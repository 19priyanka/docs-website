      "body": "Access any of your New Relic One dashboards to create or manage your charts directly from the chart menu, customize your dashboard's layout, adjust display modes, or export your data. Once you have customized your dashboard and built your charts, use our advanced visualization features and tools for data exploration to correlate and analyze your data. Customize your dashboard Dashboards are highly flexible: you can tailor your dashboard layout and arrange chart sizes to optimize how you see your data. Tip Click the icon to access the See metadata and manage tags modal. There you can see the dashboard's GUID, account ID, and App ID, and manage all the tags that have been added to the dashboard. Dashboards features include: Edit your dashboard Use the edit button to: Copy the dashboard's permalink. Rename your dashboard. Names are searchable, so we recommend giving it a meaningful name. Create new content by clicking the Add widget button. Add a new chart using the query builder, or add text, images, or links using our markdown editor. Resize and rearrange charts. You can move any chart and put it anywhere in the dashboard so the layout you set fits your preferences: place your more relevant charts on top, or drop less used charts in a corner. You can set up to 12 columns of charts. Settings menu Use the settings menu on the upper right corner: To change the name of the dashboard. Names are searchable, so we recommend giving it a meaningful name that will help you locate your dashboard easily. To modify the dashboard's permissions. At the settings menu you can also see when the dashboard was created and the account it belongs to. These values cannot be modified. TV mode You can enable a full-screen TV mode that optimizes the dashboard for display on a television screen. There are two ways to turn on TV mode: When viewing a dashboard in New Relic One, select the icon at the top right. Add this parameter to a dashboard page URL: &platform[tvMode]=true To configure TV mode, from a dashboard, select the icon. Options include: Dashboard name display. Turning off the dashboard name gives the dashboard charts more space on the screen. Page cycle. For dashboards with multiple pages, this automatically cycles from page to page. Dark mode High-contrast mode is available in dashboards. Select the icon from the upper right menu bar. Copy your dashboard as JSON You can copy your dashboard as JSON and add it to the clipboard by clicking on the < / > icon on the right corner. Export your dashboard You can export your dashboard as a pdf file clicking the icon. Duplicate your dashboard You can duplicate your dashboard clicking the duplicate icon regardless of your permission levels. The dashboard is automatically copied and the duplicate is added to the index. The duplicate has Public - Read and write permissions. Access the new, duplicated dashboard by clicking on the message that pops up on your screen. The duplicated dashboard is named like the original dashboard followed by the word “copy”. For example, if you duplicate a dashboard named This is my dashboard, the duplicate is called This is my dashboard copy. You can change the name when you duplicate it. You can edit the name and other properties of the dashboard, such as permissions, any time. Tip You can use the search feature at any time to search data across New Relic One. Add new content to your dashboard There are multiple ways to add new content to your dashboard: From the data explorer and query builder features. Use the + Add to your dashboard button (accessible from the main dashboard page or in the edit mode) to access the query builder, or to add content (such as text, links, or images) using our Markdown editor. Copy an existing chart from any dashboard. If you experience issues adding new content, check our error messages. Add custom content using the markdown editor The Markdown editor contains a Markdown pane, where you enter your content, as well as a Preview pane, where you can view it. For more information about Markdown syntax options, see the Commonmark website. You can also edit existing content by clicking the ellipses icon on any markdown widget and selecting Edit. Organize your dashboards with pages You can use multiple pages to organize your dashboard data in different views. When you add more pages to that dashboard, you can access these pages using the tabs at the top of the dashboard UI. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: This is an example of a dashboard in New Relic One with multiple pages, represented by the tabs at the top of the dashboard. You can add pages to dashboards, copy existing pages, and drag and drop the page tabs to new positions. You can use this feature to group together related dashboard views. This is valuable when you're aggregating a lot of data and charts related to a specific project, team, or subject. For example, a mobile app team might build a dashboard focused on app performance by country. The first dashboard page might be an overview of performance across all countries, with other pages focused on specific countries. We offer other features to connect dashboards: Create widgets containing markdown text to add direct links to specific UI pages or dashboards. Use facet filtering to create links that automatically link to and filter other dashboards. Use the dashboard search to find similarly named dashboards. To take advantage of this, you can add team- or project-specific words/phrases to dashboard names. In New Relic Insights, this feature was called data apps. For more about switching from Insights to New Relic One, see our transition guide. Add and edit pages to a dashboard To add or edit a page in a dashboard: From a new or existing dashboard, enter edit mode by selecting the icon. Add a new page: Select Add a page to add a blank page. Clone an existing page by clicking the dropdown next to a dashboard name, and selecting Duplicate. While in edit mode, you can add widgets to the new page, drag and drop page tabs to new locations, and do other dashboard editing tasks. When finished, select Done editing. Manage your charts and markdown content From any markdown element, access the menu on the upper right corner to edit or delete it. From any chart, access the chart action menu on the upper right corner to: Expand your chart to full screen. Share your chart as an image or with a link. Copy the chart to any dashboard. For table charts only, export as a .csv file. You can import this file into other apps like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets to do further analysis. Create an alert condition. Open the NRQL console to see or edit the query associated to the chart. Duplicate the chart. Delete the chart. Important You cannot edit the query of a chart if you have Read only permissions to the dashboard. Learn more about how to use your charts. Filter and refine your charts You can narrow down the information on display using the filtering function, which is a visual representation of query conditions: Use the filter bar to select the values or attributes you want to see, and remove the rest of the elements from the charts. Open the advanced filter bar to access the boolean operators (such as =, !=, CONTAINS, EXCLUDES, etc.) and add compound and complex conditions for filtering data. After applying the filter, your dashboard will only show the data associated to the elements you selected. A small counter indicates how many filters are being applied at a time. To return to the default view, click on the small cross by the filter to remove it. Filter using the chart legend Click on a legend in any chart with legends to see that series only and remove the rest of them from the chart. This helps you isolate the data you want to analyze. Use CMD (in a Mac) or CTRL (in Windows) for the opposite behavior: removing the selected series and keeping the rest. Filter dashboards using facets If a chart's NRQL query contains a FACET clause, you can use the faceted attributes to filter the current dashboard or another related dashboard. For details, see Filter by facets. Use the time picker to adjust time settings By default, each chart in the dashboard will show data for the time period specified when they were created in the query builder. However, you can use the time picker to change the time range of the data on display and set the same range for all charts. This is particularly useful while troubleshooting incidents, if you need to narrow down your data to observe what happened in a specific time period. The refresh rate depends on the duration of the time window you are viewing. For more information and examples, see Chart refresh intervals. To change the time range: Select one of the available options from the dropdown menu (ranging from Last 30 minutes to Last 7 days). Customize the time range with specific start and end timestamps using the custom menu. Important In dashboards, unlike Insights, the time zone is independent from your laptop's time. You can set the time zone you want to use in your user preferences, easily accessible from the custom menu in the time picker. Export and share your data It is very easy to export dashboard and chart data and share it within your company and beyond: You can export any dashboard as a PDF file, using the Export dashboard as PDF button located in the upper right menu bar. You can also share your charts either as a PNG image or as a link. Go to the chart menu and select either the Get as image or Get chart link options.",

Get started Before querying, you may want to read Introduction to querying and how to explore your data. To find the query builder, go to one.newrelic.com and click Query your data. Use the query builder: basic and advanced modes The query builder has several modes: Basic mode Advanced (NRQL) mode Advanced (PromQL-style) mode Tip You can also switch to the Data explorer tab at any time to browse your data and create charts visually, without performing queries. Basic mode Basic mode doesn't require a query language, and so it's useful if you aren't familiar with NRQL or SQL. It's also a quick way to answer one-off questions, such as how many cities outside of the United States are accessing the shopping site for your company. one.newrelic.com > Query your data > Query builder > Basic mode Use basic mode to guide you through the process to specify data for a chart. With basic mode you can: Choose your data source. In basic mode, you start by selecting an event and then picking the attribute that corresponds to the information to show in your chart. Specify (filter) the data for your chart. You can narrow the results and choose an attribute to facet by. Select the time range to present in the chart. You can select a time range from the menu or use the custom option to create your own time range. See Use basic mode for more information about this feature. Advanced (NRQL) mode With the advanced (NRQL) mode you can create your own queries using the NRQL query language. NRQL queries may be simple or complex, depending on what data you want to use and how to display it in your chart. This example of the advanced mode shows the NRQL query with the same data as used in basic mode. one.newrelic.com > Query your data > Query builder > Advanced (NRQL).

While in edit mode, you can add widgets to the new page, drag and drop page tabs to new locations, and do other dashboard editing tasks. When finished, select Done editing. Manage your charts and markdown content From any markdown element, access the menu on the upper right corner to edit or delete it. From any chart, access the chart action menu on the upper right corner to: Expand your chart to full screen. Share your chart as an image or with a link. Copy the chart to any dashboard. For table charts only, export as a .csv file. You can import this file into other apps like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets to do further analysis. Create an alert condition. Open the NRQL console to see or edit the query associated to the chart. Duplicate the chart. Delete the chart. Important You cannot edit the query of a chart if you have Read only permissions to the dashboard. Learn more about how to use your charts. Filter and refine your charts You can narrow down the information on display using the filtering function, which is a visual representation of query conditions: Use the filter bar to select the values or attributes you want to see, and remove the rest of the elements from the charts. Open the advanced filter bar to access the boolean operators (such as =, !=, CONTAINS, EXCLUDES, etc.) and add compound and complex conditions for filtering data. After applying the filter, your dashboard will only show the data associated to the elements you selected. A small counter indicates how many filters are being applied at a time. To return to the default view, click on the small cross by the filter to remove it. Filter using the chart legend Click on a legend in any chart with legends to see that series only and remove the rest of them from the chart. This helps you isolate the data you want to analyze. Use CMD (in a Mac) or CTRL (in Windows) for the opposite behavior: removing the selected series and keeping the rest. Filter dashboards using facets If a chart's NRQL query contains a FACET clause, you can use the faceted attributes to filter the current dashboard or another related dashboard. For details, see Filter by facets. Use the time picker to adjust time settings By default, each chart in the dashboard will show data for the time period specified when they were created in the query builder. However, you can use the time picker to change the time range of the data on display and set the same range for all charts. This is particularly useful while troubleshooting incidents, if you need to narrow down your data to observe what happened in a specific time period. The refresh rate depends on the duration of the time window you are viewing. For more information and examples, see Chart refresh intervals. To change the time range: Select one of the available options from the dropdown menu (ranging from Last 30 minutes to Last 7 days). Customize the time range with specific start and end timestamps using the custom menu. Important In dashboards, unlike Insights, the time zone is independent from your laptop's time. You can set the time zone you want to use in your user preferences, easily accessible from the custom menu in the time picker. Export and share your data It is very easy to export dashboard and chart data and share it within your company and beyond: You can export any dashboard as a PDF file, using the Export dashboard as PDF button located in the upper right menu bar. You can also share your charts either as a PNG image or as a link. Go to the chart menu and select either the Get as image or Get chart link options.",

      "body": "Use the New Relic One query builder in basic mode to create a chart without having to use NRQL, our querying language. The basic mode helps guides you through a query-creation process. You can choose the source of the raw data, apply filters, and use other techniques to narrow the scope of the data in the chart. Important As of September 1, 2021, we are discontinuing support of the query builder's basic mode. Instead, you can use our data explorer's user-friendly and intuitive functionality in New Relic One. For more details, including how you can easily prepare for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. Data type The query builder basic mode has a Data type selector with two options: Events: In this context, this refers to all our non-Metric-type data, including events, logs, and trace data. Metrics: This refers to our dimensional Metric data type. You can also use this to query some types of metric timeslice data. For more on other types of metrics, see Data types. Example of using basic mode This example shows how to create a chart in basic mode. Step 1: Select the source of the data for a chart Begin by specifying what data you want to view in your chart. Click in the View a chart with box to select the event type, an attribute, and a function to perform on the attribute. You can use the event data dictionary to view information about an event type and its attributes on a single page. To see a tooltip with information about an event or attribute, hover over any term that has a dotted line underneath it. Here are the results of using the event data dictionary to specify the data: Event type. The Transaction event type measures a variety of data that describes what happens while a user is on a website, such as that user clicking on a button on a page. Attribute. The name attribute stores information on all transactions. Function. Select the unique_count function to get a count of all the transactions that occurred during the time frame. Basic mode now shows the selection: one.newrelic.com > Query builder > Basic > (event and attribute specified) As you specify data, the chart updates to show you the results from the data you specified. Based on the information specified so far, you can see a chart that shows the total number of transactions during the default time frame of 30 minutes. This total includes all transactions, whether the transaction was completed successfully or had errors. one.newrelic.com > Query builder > Basic > (event and attribute specified) Step 2: Filter the data Your next step is to determine which of those transactions got a 404 page not found error. If you look in the data dictionary for the Transaction event, you'll find this event also includes an attribute called httpResponseCode. Narrow the results to show only those transactions where a page not found error occurred. Use the Narrow results to box to create this filter: httpResponseCode = 404 . Because you want to be able to see the names of the apps that are resulting in the 404 errors, you use the Facet by box to see the results by appName (which is also an attribute for the Transaction event type). Faceting by appName updates the chart to break down the total number of 404 errors by the application names. This lets you know which apps are experiencing 404 errors. Your chart now shows the line chart with a line for each app, each with its own color. one.newrelic.com > Query builder > Basic > (event and attribute specified) > (filters and facets applied) Step 3: Adjust time range and limits You decide to focus on the five apps with the most page not found errors. The default value for the Limit field is 10, meaning that your chart will show the ten most relevant returns. You change that value to 5. Customer support told you that they had been getting calls about these errors for a little over two hours. You decide to change the time range from the last 30 minutes to the last three hours so that you can view the errors during the time when the customers were calling support. Now that you have the data set so that you are seeing exactly what you need, you can turn your attention to the appearance of the chart. Step 4: Customize the chart Because you are more interested in the total number of errors than a timeline view, you change the chart type to a bar chart. one.newrelic.com > Query builder > Basic > (event and attribute specified) > (filters and facets applied) > (time range and limit customized) > (chart type customized) When you're finished with your chart, you can add it to a dashboard or share it. This table contains notes about using basic mode. Item Description Prompts You can start typing directly in an empty box; a list of items that match the information you type will display. You can also click on an empty box to view a list of all of the items that are appropriate for the field, based on your earlier choices. Saving a basic mode data specification Every time you run a query, that query is saved in the My recent queries dropdown in advanced (NRQL) mode. Events Basic mode only supports data for one event and attribute. If you want to use more than one event and/or attribute, use the SELECT statement in advanced (NRQL) mode. Shortcuts Basic mode contains shortcuts that can display more complex events and attributes that aren't generally supported, as in this example (which shows the tooltip for the shortcut). Example of the Response time histogram shortcut, showing a tooltip. Tooltips Any time you see a dotted line under a term, you can hover over that term to see a tooltip with an explanation of the term. Narrow by You can use more than one Narrow by definition in basic mode filter; the conditions will be joined by AND. The WHERE clause in advanced (NRQL) allows OR in addition to AND. Important If your query was started using basic mode and if you make changes to that query using advanced (NRQL) mode, you cannot return to basic mode to edit that query. Any additional changes may only be made in advanced (NRQL) mode.",

Once you have customized your dashboard and built your charts, use our advanced visualization features and tools for data exploration to correlate and analyze your data. Customize your dashboard Dashboards are highly flexible: you can tailor your dashboard layout and arrange chart sizes to optimize how you see your data. Tip Click the icon to access the See metadata and manage tags modal. There you can see the dashboard's GUID, account ID, and App ID, and manage all the tags that have been added to the dashboard. Dashboards features include: Edit your dashboard Use the edit button to: Copy the dashboard's permalink. Rename your dashboard. Names are searchable, so we recommend giving it a meaningful name. Create new content by clicking the Add widget button. Add a new chart using the query builder, or add text, images, or links using our markdown editor. Resize and rearrange charts. You can move any chart and put it anywhere in the dashboard so the layout you set fits your preferences: place your more relevant charts on top, or drop less used charts in a corner. You can set up to 12 columns of charts. Settings menu Use the settings menu on the upper right corner: To change the name of the dashboard. Names are searchable, so we recommend giving it a meaningful name that will help you locate your dashboard easily. To modify the dashboard's permissions. At the settings menu you can also see when the dashboard was created and the account it belongs to. These values cannot be modified. TV mode You can enable a full-screen TV mode that optimizes the dashboard for display on a television screen. There are two ways to turn on TV mode: When viewing a dashboard in New Relic One, select the icon at the top right. Add this parameter to a dashboard page URL: &platform[tvMode]=true To configure TV mode, from a dashboard, select the icon. Options include: Dashboard name display. Turning off the dashboard name gives the dashboard charts more space on the screen. Page cycle. For dashboards with multiple pages, this automatically cycles from page to page. Dark mode High-contrast mode is available in dashboards. Select the icon from the upper right menu bar. Copy your dashboard as JSON You can copy your dashboard as JSON and add it to the clipboard by clicking on the < / > icon on the right corner. Export your dashboard You can export your dashboard as a pdf file clicking the icon. Duplicate your dashboard You can duplicate your dashboard clicking the duplicate icon regardless of your permission levels. The dashboard is automatically copied and the duplicate is added to the index. The duplicate has Public - Read and write permissions. Access the new, duplicated dashboard by clicking on the message that pops up on your screen. The duplicated dashboard is named like the original dashboard followed by the word “copy”. For example, if you duplicate a dashboard named This is my dashboard, the duplicate is called This is my dashboard copy. You can change the name when you duplicate it. You can edit the name and other properties of the dashboard, such as permissions, any time. Tip You can use the search feature at any time to search data across New Relic One. Add new content to your dashboard There are multiple ways to add new content to your dashboard: From the data explorer and query builder features. Use the + Add to your dashboard button (accessible from the main dashboard page or in the edit mode) to access the query builder, or to add content (such as text, links, or images) using our Markdown editor. Copy an existing chart from any dashboard. If you experience issues adding new content, check our error messages. Add custom content using the markdown editor The Markdown editor contains a Markdown pane, where you enter your content, as well as a Preview pane, where you can view it. For more information about Markdown syntax options, see the Commonmark website. You can also edit existing content by clicking the ellipses icon on any markdown widget and selecting Edit. Organize your dashboards with pages You can use multiple pages to organize your dashboard data in different views. When you add more pages to that dashboard, you can access these pages using the tabs at the top of the dashboard UI. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: This is an example of a dashboard in New Relic One with multiple pages, represented by the tabs at the top of the dashboard. You can add pages to dashboards, copy existing pages, and drag and drop the page tabs to new positions. You can use this feature to group together related dashboard views. This is valuable when you're aggregating a lot of data and charts related to a specific project, team, or subject. For example, a mobile app team might build a dashboard focused on app performance by country. The first dashboard page might be an overview of performance across all countries, with other pages focused on specific countries. We offer other features to connect dashboards: Create widgets containing markdown text to add direct links to specific UI pages or dashboards. Use facet filtering to create links that automatically link to and filter other dashboards. Use the dashboard search to find similarly named dashboards. To take advantage of this, you can add team- or project-specific words/phrases to dashboard names. In New Relic Insights, this feature was called data apps. For more about switching from Insights to New Relic One, see our transition guide. Add and edit pages to a dashboard To add or edit a page in a dashboard: From a new or existing dashboard, enter edit mode by selecting the icon. Add a new page: Select Add a page to add a blank page. Clone an existing page by clicking the dropdown next to a dashboard name, and selecting Duplicate. While in edit mode, you can add widgets to the new page, drag and drop page tabs to new locations, and do other dashboard editing tasks. When finished, select Done editing. Manage your charts and markdown content From any markdown element, access the menu on the upper right corner to edit or delete it. From any chart, access the chart action menu on the upper right corner to: Expand your chart to full screen. Share your chart as an image or with a link. Copy the chart to any dashboard.

      "body": "Use the New Relic One query builder in basic mode to create a chart without having to use NRQL, our querying language. The basic mode helps guides you through a query-creation process. You can choose the source of the raw data, apply filters, and use other techniques to narrow the scope of the data in the chart. Important As of September 1, 2021, we are discontinuing support of the query builder's basic mode. Instead, you can use our data explorer's user-friendly and intuitive functionality in New Relic One. For more details, including how you can easily prepare for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. Data type The query builder basic mode has a Data type selector with two options: Events: In this context, this refers to all our non-Metric-type data, including events, logs, and trace data. Metrics: This refers to our dimensional Metric data type. You can also use this to query some types of metric timeslice data. For more on other types of metrics, see Data types. Example of using basic mode This example shows how to create a chart in basic mode. Step 1: Select the source of the data for a chart Begin by specifying what data you want to view in your chart. Click in the View a chart with box to select the event type, an attribute, and a function to perform on the attribute. You can use the event data dictionary to view information about an event type and its attributes on a single page. To see a tooltip with information about an event or attribute, hover over any term that has a dotted line underneath it. Here are the results of using the event data dictionary to specify the data: Event type. The Transaction event type measures a variety of data that describes what happens while a user is on a website, such as that user clicking on a button on a page. Attribute. The name attribute stores information on all transactions. Function. Select the unique_count function to get a count of all the transactions that occurred during the time frame. Basic mode now shows the selection: one.newrelic.com > Query builder > Basic > (event and attribute specified) As you specify data, the chart updates to show you the results from the data you specified. Based on the information specified so far, you can see a chart that shows the total number of transactions during the default time frame of 30 minutes. This total includes all transactions, whether the transaction was completed successfully or had errors. one.newrelic.com > Query builder > Basic > (event and attribute specified) Step 2: Filter the data Your next step is to determine which of those transactions got a 404 page not found error. If you look in the data dictionary for the Transaction event, you'll find this event also includes an attribute called httpResponseCode. Narrow the results to show only those transactions where a page not found error occurred. Use the Narrow results to box to create this filter: httpResponseCode = 404 . Because you want to be able to see the names of the apps that are resulting in the 404 errors, you use the Facet by box to see the results by appName (which is also an attribute for the Transaction event type). Faceting by appName updates the chart to break down the total number of 404 errors by the application names. This lets you know which apps are experiencing 404 errors. Your chart now shows the line chart with a line for each app, each with its own color. one.newrelic.com > Query builder > Basic > (event and attribute specified) > (filters and facets applied) Step 3: Adjust time range and limits You decide to focus on the five apps with the most page not found errors. The default value for the Limit field is 10, meaning that your chart will show the ten most relevant returns. You change that value to 5. Customer support told you that they had been getting calls about these errors for a little over two hours. You decide to change the time range from the last 30 minutes to the last three hours so that you can view the errors during the time when the customers were calling support. Now that you have the data set so that you are seeing exactly what you need, you can turn your attention to the appearance of the chart. Step 4: Customize the chart Because you are more interested in the total number of errors than a timeline view, you change the chart type to a bar chart. one.newrelic.com > Query builder > Basic > (event and attribute specified) > (filters and facets applied) > (time range and limit customized) > (chart type customized) When you're finished with your chart, you can add it to a dashboard or share it. This table contains notes about using basic mode. Item Description Prompts You can start typing directly in an empty box; a list of items that match the information you type will display. You can also click on an empty box to view a list of all of the items that are appropriate for the field, based on your earlier choices. Saving a basic mode data specification Every time you run a query, that query is saved in the My recent queries dropdown in advanced (NRQL) mode. Events Basic mode only supports data for one event and attribute. If you want to use more than one event and/or attribute, use the SELECT statement in advanced (NRQL) mode. Shortcuts Basic mode contains shortcuts that can display more complex events and attributes that aren't generally supported, as in this example (which shows the tooltip for the shortcut). Example of the Response time histogram shortcut, showing a tooltip. Tooltips Any time you see a dotted line under a term, you can hover over that term to see a tooltip with an explanation of the term. Narrow by You can use more than one Narrow by definition in basic mode filter; the conditions will be joined by AND. The WHERE clause in advanced (NRQL) allows OR in addition to AND. Important If your query was started using basic mode and if you make changes to that query using advanced (NRQL) mode, you cannot return to basic mode to edit that query. Any additional changes may only be made in advanced (NRQL) mode.",

      "body": "With real time streaming, your APM event data is sent to New Relic every five seconds. You can query and visualize your data for transactions, errors, and custom events in near real time. The smaller payloads result in faster chart refreshes and faster queries of data that is the most important to you. No configuration is needed to take advantage of real time streaming. All you need to do is ensure your APM agent version is up to date. Why it matters Real time streaming doesn't result in more events being sent. The combination of more frequent posts, with a smaller number of events per post, results in approximately the same number of events per minute as there would be without real time streaming. The following image shows a comparison between data sent to New Relic with and without real time streaming. Note that 10,000 is an example number of events; some agents have lower default limits. The overall limits on how many events can be sent per minute haven't changed. Also, non-event data (spans, traces, and metrics) are unaffected; they're still sent every minute. Use real time streaming to quickly understand the impact when something has changed, such as deploying a new app version. Examine key performance indicators (throughput, error rates, charting, etc.) in near real time. Respond quickly to failure conditions and anomalies. Get the most out of New Relic One dashboards. Reduce mean time to detection with APM events reporting every five seconds. Agent version to automatically enable To enable real time streaming, update to the latest APM agent. You don't need to configure anything to enable real time streaming; it will automatically report faster! Real time streaming is supported by all APM agents. Here are the minimum agent versions: C SDK: v1.3.0 or higher Go: v2.8.0 or higher Java: v5.5.0 or higher .NET: v8.23.107.0 or higher Node.js: v5.13.0 or higher PHP: v9.5.0.252 or higher Python: v5.2.0.127 or higher Ruby: v6.7.0.359 or higher Caution If Transaction event reporting is disabled, this can affect some UI elements throughout New Relic. You may see some empty charts on some UI pages that rely on this data. Query real time streaming data When building charts, include the following in your NRQL query: NRQL clause Comments SINCE 5 minutes ago Be sure to add a SINCE 5 minutes ago clause to your NRQL query in order to take advantage of the 5 second chart refresh interval. This is because the chart's refresh interval is based on the time window. TIMESERIES bucket To set the refresh interval for time series charts, you can also specify the bucket size as an optional argument to the TIMESERIES clause. For example, SINCE 30 minutes ago TIMESERIES 5 seconds will display a 30 minute window at a 5 second resolution. You can have a maximum of 366 buckets. Create real time streaming charts You can visualize the results of your NRQL query in New Relic One: Go to one.newrelic.com, and at the top of the page, select Query your data. Use the data explorer to start building a chart. Select the advanced (NRQL) mode to refine your query. In your NRQL query, adjust the SINCE and TIMESERIES clauses to take advantage of the 5 second refresh intervals.",

      "body": "Access any of your New Relic One dashboards to create or manage your charts directly from the chart menu, customize your dashboard's layout, adjust display modes, or export your data. Once you have customized your dashboard and built your charts, use our advanced visualization features and tools for data exploration to correlate and analyze your data. Customize your dashboard Dashboards are highly flexible: you can tailor your dashboard layout and arrange chart sizes to optimize how you see your data. Tip Click the icon to access the See metadata and manage tags modal. There you can see the dashboard's GUID, account ID, and App ID, and manage all the tags that have been added to the dashboard. Dashboards features include: Edit your dashboard Use the edit button to: Copy the dashboard's permalink. Rename your dashboard. Names are searchable, so we recommend giving it a meaningful name. Create new content by clicking the Add widget button. Add a new chart using the query builder, or add text, images, or links using our markdown editor. Resize and rearrange charts. You can move any chart and put it anywhere in the dashboard so the layout you set fits your preferences: place your more relevant charts on top, or drop less used charts in a corner. You can set up to 12 columns of charts. Settings menu Use the settings menu on the upper right corner: To change the name of the dashboard. Names are searchable, so we recommend giving it a meaningful name that will help you locate your dashboard easily. To modify the dashboard's permissions. At the settings menu you can also see when the dashboard was created and the account it belongs to. These values cannot be modified. TV mode You can enable a full-screen TV mode that optimizes the dashboard for display on a television screen. There are two ways to turn on TV mode: When viewing a dashboard in New Relic One, select the icon at the top right. Add this parameter to a dashboard page URL: &platform[tvMode]=true To configure TV mode, from a dashboard, select the icon. Options include: Dashboard name display. Turning off the dashboard name gives the dashboard charts more space on the screen. Page cycle. For dashboards with multiple pages, this automatically cycles from page to page. Dark mode High-contrast mode is available in dashboards. Select the icon from the upper right menu bar. Copy your dashboard as JSON You can copy your dashboard as JSON and add it to the clipboard by clicking on the < / > icon on the right corner. Export your dashboard You can export your dashboard as a pdf file clicking the icon. Duplicate your dashboard You can duplicate your dashboard clicking the duplicate icon regardless of your permission levels. The dashboard is automatically copied and the duplicate is added to the index. The duplicate has Public - Read and write permissions. Access the new, duplicated dashboard by clicking on the message that pops up on your screen. The duplicated dashboard is named like the original dashboard followed by the word “copy”. For example, if you duplicate a dashboard named This is my dashboard, the duplicate is called This is my dashboard copy. You can change the name when you duplicate it. You can edit the name and other properties of the dashboard, such as permissions, any time. Tip You can use the search feature at any time to search data across New Relic One. Add new content to your dashboard There are multiple ways to add new content to your dashboard: From the data explorer and query builder features. Use the + Add to your dashboard button (accessible from the main dashboard page or in the edit mode) to access the query builder, or to add content (such as text, links, or images) using our Markdown editor. Copy an existing chart from any dashboard. If you experience issues adding new content, check our error messages. Add custom content using the markdown editor The Markdown editor contains a Markdown pane, where you enter your content, as well as a Preview pane, where you can view it. For more information about Markdown syntax options, see the Commonmark website. You can also edit existing content by clicking the ellipses icon on any markdown widget and selecting Edit. Organize your dashboards with pages You can use multiple pages to organize your dashboard data in different views. When you add more pages to that dashboard, you can access these pages using the tabs at the top of the dashboard UI. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: This is an example of a dashboard in New Relic One with multiple pages, represented by the tabs at the top of the dashboard. You can add pages to dashboards, copy existing pages, and drag and drop the page tabs to new positions. You can use this feature to group together related dashboard views. This is valuable when you're aggregating a lot of data and charts related to a specific project, team, or subject. For example, a mobile app team might build a dashboard focused on app performance by country. The first dashboard page might be an overview of performance across all countries, with other pages focused on specific countries. We offer other features to connect dashboards: Create widgets containing markdown text to add direct links to specific UI pages or dashboards. Use facet filtering to create links that automatically link to and filter other dashboards. Use the dashboard search to find similarly named dashboards. To take advantage of this, you can add team- or project-specific words/phrases to dashboard names. In New Relic Insights, this feature was called data apps. For more about switching from Insights to New Relic One, see our transition guide. Add and edit pages to a dashboard To add or edit a page in a dashboard: From a new or existing dashboard, enter edit mode by selecting the icon. Add a new page: Select Add a page to add a blank page. Clone an existing page by clicking the dropdown next to a dashboard name, and selecting Duplicate. While in edit mode, you can add widgets to the new page, drag and drop page tabs to new locations, and do other dashboard editing tasks. When finished, select Done editing. Manage your charts and markdown content From any markdown element, access the menu on the upper right corner to edit or delete it. From any chart, access the chart action menu on the upper right corner to: Expand your chart to full screen. Share your chart as an image or with a link. Copy the chart to any dashboard. For table charts only, export as a .csv file. You can import this file into other apps like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets to do further analysis. Create an alert condition. Open the NRQL console to see or edit the query associated to the chart. Duplicate the chart. Delete the chart. Important You cannot edit the query of a chart if you have Read only permissions to the dashboard. Learn more about how to use your charts. Filter and refine your charts You can narrow down the information on display using the filtering function, which is a visual representation of query conditions: Use the filter bar to select the values or attributes you want to see, and remove the rest of the elements from the charts. Open the advanced filter bar to access the boolean operators (such as =, !=, CONTAINS, EXCLUDES, etc.) and add compound and complex conditions for filtering data. After applying the filter, your dashboard will only show the data associated to the elements you selected. A small counter indicates how many filters are being applied at a time. To return to the default view, click on the small cross by the filter to remove it. Filter using the chart legend Click on a legend in any chart with legends to see that series only and remove the rest of them from the chart. This helps you isolate the data you want to analyze. Use CMD (in a Mac) or CTRL (in Windows) for the opposite behavior: removing the selected series and keeping the rest. Filter dashboards using facets If a chart's NRQL query contains a FACET clause, you can use the faceted attributes to filter the current dashboard or another related dashboard. For details, see Filter by facets. Use the time picker to adjust time settings By default, each chart in the dashboard will show data for the time period specified when they were created in the query builder. However, you can use the time picker to change the time range of the data on display and set the same range for all charts. This is particularly useful while troubleshooting incidents, if you need to narrow down your data to observe what happened in a specific time period. The refresh rate depends on the duration of the time window you are viewing. For more information and examples, see Chart refresh intervals. To change the time range: Select one of the available options from the dropdown menu (ranging from Last 30 minutes to Last 7 days). Customize the time range with specific start and end timestamps using the custom menu. Important In dashboards, unlike Insights, the time zone is independent from your laptop's time. You can set the time zone you want to use in your user preferences, easily accessible from the custom menu in the time picker. Export and share your data It is very easy to export dashboard and chart data and share it within your company and beyond: You can export any dashboard as a PDF file, using the Export dashboard as PDF button located in the upper right menu bar. You can also share your charts either as a PNG image or as a link. Go to the chart menu and select either the Get as image or Get chart link options.",

      "body": "When you connect your data to New Relic, we process what we receive and apply data dropping and transformation rules. Then we count the bytes needed to represent your data in a standard format, like JSON. If you're on our New Relic One pricing plan, you're charged by the number of bytes written to our database, above and beyond the standard amount that’s free. Important This doc is for accounts on our New Relic One pricing plan. If you're on our original product-based pricing plan, see Original data retention. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing and user model. The Data ingestion page shows your ingest rates for a period you specify on the top-right of the Data management hub. Since 30 days ago is the default setting, but you can also set a custom date span. The page shows your daily average GBs, and the total for the range you set. You can toggle between an overall ingest view and an account view to identify which of your accounts are sending the most data. The page also provides the current month-to-date, and the projected end-of-month total ingest rates. With this information, you can proactively drop data or turn off agents in order to manage ingest and, therefore, costs. If you want to take a look at how we query the data, click the ellipsis icon (just above the chart) to slide out the chart query and open it in our query builder. And If you want to drill down further into your data usage, check out the sample queries in the usage docs. From the Login drop-down, select Manage your data, and then select Data ingestion. This is the Data ingestion page with data source and account views. Data ingestion sources The Data ingestion page describes which of your data sources provide the most data on average and during specific data ranges. The sources are described here. Billable data sources Description Timeslices (1-minute) and Metric:Raw Metrics are timeslices + MetricRaw Metric group: MetricsBytes Metric timeslice data averages to one-hour periods after eight days. After 90 days, the permanent metric data continues to be stored in one-hour periods. We currently store the raw metric data for 30 days. You are only billed for the initial ingest volume. You are not billed for subsequent rollups. APM (transactions and errors) APM events Metric group: ApmEventsBytes InfraSamples:Raw Includes multiple Infrastructure events Infrastructure host data Metric group:InfraHostBytes Information related to your servers and virtual machines coming from infrastructure agents, including storage and network data Infrastructure process data stored in ProcessSample. Metric group: InfraProcessBytes Data are metrics related to each process running on the hosts running the Infrastructure agent. This feature is turned off by default. Infrastructure integrations Metric group: InfraIntegrationBytes Performance data related to applications and services, typically managed by the customer, including data related to Docker containers, Windows services, Nagios checks, and cloud integrations such as managed services in AWS, Azure, and GCP. Logging Includes logs and LogExtendedRecord Metric group: LoggingBytes Log messages longer than 4KB are split into multiple events that, when needed, are stitched together to display the original message; this reduces the size of message data. Default Custom events Metric group: CustomEventsBytes Mobile error Mobile general Breadcrumb crash event trails Mobile session Mobile exception Mobile crash Mobile events Metric group: MobileEventsBytes Tracing Metric group: TracingBytes TracingBytes includes Span and OpenTelemetry's SpanEvent. You are not charged for DistributedTraceSummary events. Browser:EventLog Browser Browser:JSErrors PcvPerf (PageView timing) Browser events Metric group: BrowserEventsBytes Lambda Serverless Metric group: ServerlessBytes Break down data to see what's contributing to your ingest You can inspect your data ingest to gain more information about your ingest health. This way, you'll know your baselines, and can more easily spot an anomaly like an ingest spike, as well as its source. To break down your ingested data, start from the chart on the Data ingestion page. Think of the data source bands as the Y axis, and the dates as the X axis. Click on the band you want to inspect at the spot in the X axis that corresponds with the date you want to investigate. This image shows the Metrics band for June 15 right before it's clicked. A modal opens with the account, data source, and facet selected. You can do a handful of things on this page: Change the account, data source, or facet you want to drill down into. Change the date and time to investigate. Review the results of the query in chart form. The chart displays the top 15 results for the facet query. Open the NRQL query in the Query builder where you'll find additional facets that you can use. Learn more about NRQL queries here. How we break your ingest data down Some of the content in the UI is variable, depending on your account. This information is intended to help you understand how we're working with your ingest data. The chart on the Data ingestion page shows data usage for a little longer time frame than that covered by your retention settings for each data ingest source. If you choose a date outside of your designated retention period for an ingest source, you'll get the message that there's no chart data available. Select a more recent date to fix this problem. If you inspect a data source for an account that has less than a terrabyte of data, we compute the ingest volume over a 24 hour period; otherwise, we compute it for a 1 hour period. The ingest value provided on the main Data ingestion chart will be slightly different from that reflected during inspection. This is because our facet computation is an estimate. Set alerts for data use Query and alert on usage data describes how to set alerts to get notified if you're nearing data ingest limits you don't want to cross. For example, you might set an alert on logs, which can stack up quickly in an active system. Adjust your data ingest Drop data for lower retention costs and data compliance On ingest, we apply data dropping rules so you won't be charged for data that's not useful. Learn how to set additional data dropping rules yourself. Use NerdGraph to drop entire data types or drop data attributes from data types so they’re not written to NRDB. This enables you to focus on the data you want, reduces retention costs, and avoids writing sensitive data to the database. For dropping log data, see Drop data with drop filter rules. Turn off agents and integrations If you don’t need data from specific agents or integrations that you have installed, you can uninstall/delete those tools. For instructions, see the specific documentation for an agent or integration.",

      "body": "Once you've created a chart, you can customize the appearance of it to best present the data. You can share a chart in different formats and add a chart to a new or existing dashboard. Change the appearance of your chart When you run your query in advanced (NRQL) mode or view your chart while using the data explorer to specify data, the query builder analyzes your data and applies a chart type that fits your data. For some queries, you'll have several options of chart types to choose from. To change chart type, use the Chart type menu to the right of the current chart. Each type in the list has a tooltip with information about using that type. Example of the chart type menu, showing a tooltip. Customize your charts While we try our best to optimize how we display your data, sometimes you may have other needs. To this end, you can customize charts to display information at your convenience. Tip Customizations are available depending on the chart type. Format date and time Tip For table and billboard charts. Customize the date and time format for tables and billboards: for each type of data, you can select if you want to leave it as it is, or modify the format as Numeric or Date. If data is a timestamp, you can choose how to represent the date and time: For numbers, select if you want us to auto-format them, or chose the number of decimals you want to see. Customize the Y axis Tip For line and area charts. On line charts and area charts you can adjust the Y axis to display the data within certain values by setting a minimum and maximum value for the axis. If no customization option is selected, dashboards automatically displays the full Y axis from 0 to the top value plus a margin. Enable or disable the legend Tip For line and area charts, and histograms. For line charts, area charts, and histograms, you can disable or enable the legend. Remove the other groups facet Tip For bar and pie charts, and tables. When faceting on bar charts, pie charts, or tables, and if the number of faceting on queries is larger than 2,000, the Other groups facet aggregates the rest of facets. With this customization you can select whether to see Other groups, or remove it. More chart-specific features For more chart type-specific features, see Chart types. Chart share and view options Most charts have various options, including a chart-embed option, getting a chart as an image, and adding a chart to a dashboard.

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a custom visualization in the New Relic One platform. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Custom visualizations and the New Relic One SDK, before starting this one. In the previous lesson, you built a custom visualization that shows queried data in one of two chart types: RadarChart Treemap You used a SegmentedControl to switch between the two chart types in the visualization UI. This implementation takes up space in the visualization, but it offers your users the choice to switch between two chart types even after you've created an instance of your chart. But what if you only need to be able to select an option once, when initializing the visualization? In this lesson you'll learn how to add a configuration option to your visualization which replaces the SegmentedControl. Tip If you get lost in the code project and would like to see what the files should look like when you're done with each lesson, check out the course project on Github.

Use New Relic One custom visualizations to display your data, whether it's from New Relic's database or an external source, in unique ways that are distinct from the charts offered by the New Relic platform. In this lesson, you build a visualization that displays your data in one of two chart types: RadarChart or Treemap. You then implement a SegmentedControl component from the New Relic One SDK, which allows you to alternate between the two chart types. Ultimately, this gives you freedom to view your data in a dynamic way that isn't possible with New Relic's base offerings. Tip If you get lost in the code project and would like to see what the files should look like when you're done with each lesson, check out the course project on Github. Before you begin Explore our custom visualization guides and build your first visualization. After you're done, you'll have a better foundation for building more complex visualizations, such as the one you'll build in this course. Finally, if you haven't already: Sign up for a New Relic account Install Node.js Complete the steps in the nr1 quick start to install and configure the CLI Create your visualization Step 1 of 2 Ensure you're working with the latest version of the New Relic One CLI: bash Copy $ nr1 update Step 2 of 2 Create a visualization, called radar-or-treemap, in a Nerdpack, called alternate-viz: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type visualization --name radar-or-treemap ✔ You’re trying to create a visualization outside of a Nerdpack. We’ll create a Nerdpack for you—what do you want to name it? … alternate-viz ✔ nerdpack created successfully! nerdpack alternate-viz is available at \"./alternate-viz\" ✔ visualization created successfully! visualization radar-or-treemap is available at \"./alternate-viz/visualizations/radar-or-treemap\" Tip If you receive a RequestError for a self-signed certificate when you run nr1 create, you may need to add a certificate to Node's certificate chain. Read more about this and other advanced configurations in Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. As a result, you have a new visualizations/radar-or-treemap directory under alternate-viz: bash Copy $ cd alternate-viz $ ls visualizations/radar-or-treemap index.js nr1.json styles.scss Set up your component state Add component state to the default visualization template that nr1 created for you.

Now that you've created an object which enumerates the chart type options for your visualization, and you've initialized state.selectedChart, you're ready to implement a control UI for switching between the two chart types. Add SegmentedControl components state.selectedChart isn't useful unless your visualization's users can actually select a chart type.

      "body": "Access any of your New Relic One dashboards to create or manage your charts directly from the chart menu, customize your dashboard's layout, adjust display modes, or export your data. Once you have customized your dashboard and built your charts, use our advanced visualization features and tools for data exploration to correlate and analyze your data. Customize your dashboard Dashboards are highly flexible: you can tailor your dashboard layout and arrange chart sizes to optimize how you see your data. Tip Click the icon to access the See metadata and manage tags modal. There you can see the dashboard's GUID, account ID, and App ID, and manage all the tags that have been added to the dashboard. Dashboards features include: Edit your dashboard Use the edit button to: Copy the dashboard's permalink. Rename your dashboard. Names are searchable, so we recommend giving it a meaningful name. Create new content by clicking the Add widget button. Add a new chart using the query builder, or add text, images, or links using our markdown editor. Resize and rearrange charts. You can move any chart and put it anywhere in the dashboard so the layout you set fits your preferences: place your more relevant charts on top, or drop less used charts in a corner. You can set up to 12 columns of charts. Settings menu Use the settings menu on the upper right corner: To change the name of the dashboard. Names are searchable, so we recommend giving it a meaningful name that will help you locate your dashboard easily. To modify the dashboard's permissions. At the settings menu you can also see when the dashboard was created and the account it belongs to. These values cannot be modified. TV mode You can enable a full-screen TV mode that optimizes the dashboard for display on a television screen. There are two ways to turn on TV mode: When viewing a dashboard in New Relic One, select the icon at the top right. Add this parameter to a dashboard page URL: &platform[tvMode]=true To configure TV mode, from a dashboard, select the icon. Options include: Dashboard name display. Turning off the dashboard name gives the dashboard charts more space on the screen. Page cycle. For dashboards with multiple pages, this automatically cycles from page to page. Dark mode High-contrast mode is available in dashboards. Select the icon from the upper right menu bar. Copy your dashboard as JSON You can copy your dashboard as JSON and add it to the clipboard by clicking on the < / > icon on the right corner. Export your dashboard You can export your dashboard as a pdf file clicking the icon. Duplicate your dashboard You can duplicate your dashboard clicking the duplicate icon regardless of your permission levels. The dashboard is automatically copied and the duplicate is added to the index. The duplicate has Public - Read and write permissions. Access the new, duplicated dashboard by clicking on the message that pops up on your screen. The duplicated dashboard is named like the original dashboard followed by the word “copy”. For example, if you duplicate a dashboard named This is my dashboard, the duplicate is called This is my dashboard copy. You can change the name when you duplicate it. You can edit the name and other properties of the dashboard, such as permissions, any time. Tip You can use the search feature at any time to search data across New Relic One. Add new content to your dashboard There are multiple ways to add new content to your dashboard: From the data explorer and query builder features. Use the + Add to your dashboard button (accessible from the main dashboard page or in the edit mode) to access the query builder, or to add content (such as text, links, or images) using our Markdown editor. Copy an existing chart from any dashboard. If you experience issues adding new content, check our error messages. Add custom content using the markdown editor The Markdown editor contains a Markdown pane, where you enter your content, as well as a Preview pane, where you can view it. For more information about Markdown syntax options, see the Commonmark website. You can also edit existing content by clicking the ellipses icon on any markdown widget and selecting Edit. Organize your dashboards with pages You can use multiple pages to organize your dashboard data in different views. When you add more pages to that dashboard, you can access these pages using the tabs at the top of the dashboard UI. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: This is an example of a dashboard in New Relic One with multiple pages, represented by the tabs at the top of the dashboard. You can add pages to dashboards, copy existing pages, and drag and drop the page tabs to new positions. You can use this feature to group together related dashboard views. This is valuable when you're aggregating a lot of data and charts related to a specific project, team, or subject. For example, a mobile app team might build a dashboard focused on app performance by country. The first dashboard page might be an overview of performance across all countries, with other pages focused on specific countries. We offer other features to connect dashboards: Create widgets containing markdown text to add direct links to specific UI pages or dashboards. Use facet filtering to create links that automatically link to and filter other dashboards. Use the dashboard search to find similarly named dashboards. To take advantage of this, you can add team- or project-specific words/phrases to dashboard names. In New Relic Insights, this feature was called data apps. For more about switching from Insights to New Relic One, see our transition guide. Add and edit pages to a dashboard To add or edit a page in a dashboard: From a new or existing dashboard, enter edit mode by selecting the icon. Add a new page: Select Add a page to add a blank page. Clone an existing page by clicking the dropdown next to a dashboard name, and selecting Duplicate. While in edit mode, you can add widgets to the new page, drag and drop page tabs to new locations, and do other dashboard editing tasks. When finished, select Done editing. Manage your charts and markdown content From any markdown element, access the menu on the upper right corner to edit or delete it. From any chart, access the chart action menu on the upper right corner to: Expand your chart to full screen. Share your chart as an image or with a link. Copy the chart to any dashboard. For table charts only, export as a .csv file. You can import this file into other apps like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets to do further analysis. Create an alert condition. Open the NRQL console to see or edit the query associated to the chart. Duplicate the chart. Delete the chart. Important You cannot edit the query of a chart if you have Read only permissions to the dashboard. Learn more about how to use your charts. Filter and refine your charts You can narrow down the information on display using the filtering function, which is a visual representation of query conditions: Use the filter bar to select the values or attributes you want to see, and remove the rest of the elements from the charts. Open the advanced filter bar to access the boolean operators (such as =, !=, CONTAINS, EXCLUDES, etc.) and add compound and complex conditions for filtering data. After applying the filter, your dashboard will only show the data associated to the elements you selected. A small counter indicates how many filters are being applied at a time. To return to the default view, click on the small cross by the filter to remove it. Filter using the chart legend Click on a legend in any chart with legends to see that series only and remove the rest of them from the chart. This helps you isolate the data you want to analyze. Use CMD (in a Mac) or CTRL (in Windows) for the opposite behavior: removing the selected series and keeping the rest. Filter dashboards using facets If a chart's NRQL query contains a FACET clause, you can use the faceted attributes to filter the current dashboard or another related dashboard. For details, see Filter by facets. Use the time picker to adjust time settings By default, each chart in the dashboard will show data for the time period specified when they were created in the query builder. However, you can use the time picker to change the time range of the data on display and set the same range for all charts. This is particularly useful while troubleshooting incidents, if you need to narrow down your data to observe what happened in a specific time period. The refresh rate depends on the duration of the time window you are viewing. For more information and examples, see Chart refresh intervals. To change the time range: Select one of the available options from the dropdown menu (ranging from Last 30 minutes to Last 7 days). Customize the time range with specific start and end timestamps using the custom menu. Important In dashboards, unlike Insights, the time zone is independent from your laptop's time. You can set the time zone you want to use in your user preferences, easily accessible from the custom menu in the time picker. Export and share your data It is very easy to export dashboard and chart data and share it within your company and beyond: You can export any dashboard as a PDF file, using the Export dashboard as PDF button located in the upper right menu bar. You can also share your charts either as a PNG image or as a link. Go to the chart menu and select either the Get as image or Get chart link options.",

      "body": "Envision your data as a complex system of roads: you need to navigate the signs and signals along the way to quickly see and make meaning of the information you collect. New Relic One dashboards gather and chart the specific data you want to see, the way you want to see it, from anywhere in the New Relic platform. Why it matters With New Relic One dashboards you can customize and understand the data you collect. Explore your data and correlate connected sources with tailored, user-friendly charts, and quickly learn the state of your system and applications for faster, more efficient troubleshooting. Use dashboards to: Drive insight with custom, high-density interactive visualizations with a consistent UI. View dashboards across your organization using cross-account search.

Explore and contextualize data with advanced tooltips and zoom-in functions to monitor what your systems are doing in real time. Search your dashboards for attributes and metrics. Send data to your dashboards using our APIs. Transitioning from Insights Switching to using New Relic One dashboards from our deprecated Insights dashboards? See our transition guide. If you're using the Insights Dashboard API, we have have a migration guide that will help you transition to using the new API. Get started with dashboards To access dashboards, go to one.newrelic.com and click on Dashboards on the top navigation menu. In the dashboards index, you can view all the dashboards and data apps associated with your New Relic account. From the top bar, quickly access our explorer as well as all New Relic capabilities, such as APM, Browser and Infrastructure monitoring, Logs, or Applied Intelligence. You can also use the core New Relic One features such as Search or Query your data that are available across the platform. For each dashboard, the index displays the following information: Favorite status, indicated by a star Name: The name of the dashboard Account: The account the dashboard belongs to Created by: The user who created the dashboard Last edited: When the dashboard was last modified Created on: When the dashboard was created Here you can carry out the following actions: Create a dashboard You can easily create a dashboard in New Relic One from the dashboards index by selecting the + Create a dashboard button located at the top-right corner of the dashboards index. Name your dashboard. Names are searchable, so we recommend giving it a meaningful name (your service or application, for instance) using words that will help you locate your dashboard easily. Select the account the dashboard belongs to. Choose carefully because this action cannot be modified. Press Create to continue, or Cancel to return to the index. Tip By default a dashboard is created with Public - Read and write permissions. You can edit them from the settings menu once you access the dashboard. Alternatively, you can also create a new dashboard: By duplicating an existing dashboard. From any chart: Copy any chart from any dashboard to a new or an existing dashboard. From the data explorer or the query builder: Add any chart you create from our querying features to a new or an existing dashboard. From the explorer: Take any custom view from the entity manager over to dashboards. To organize dashboards with multiple pages, see Add pages to a dashboard. Import a dashboard You can import a dashboard as JSON by selecting the Import a dashboard button located at the top-right corner of the dashboards index: Paste the JSON code. By default, the dashboard belongs to the same account as the original dashboard you’re importing. Select a different account if you want to change it. By default, the new dashboard has the same rights as the original dashboard you’re importing. Select different rights if you want to change them. Tip See how to obtain a dashboard’s JSON. Duplicate a dashboard Duplicate any dashboard by clicking the Duplicate dashboard button that appears when you hover over any dashboard row in the index. You can duplicate any dashboard regardless of your permission levels. The dashboard is automatically copied and the duplicate is added to the index. Access the new dashboard by clicking on the message that pops up on your screen. The duplicated dashboard is named like the original dashboard followed by the word \"copy\". For example, if you duplicate a dashboard named this is my dashboard, the duplicate will be created as this is my dashboard copy. The duplicate has Public - Read and write permissions. You can edit the name and other properties of the dashboard, like the permissions, at any time. Tip The index displays dashboards according to sorting. To quickly find your duplicated dashboard, sort the dashboards by creation date. The new dashboard appears on top. Delete a dashboard To delete a dashboard, hover over the dashboard row at the index until the Delete button appears. You can only delete a dashboard if you created it, or if it has Public - Read and write permissions. For more information, see the permissions information. You can also delete a dashboard from the settings panel of the dashboard. Mark a dashboard as favorite Clicking the star icon next to a dashboard toggles on or off the favorites. When you favorite a dashboard, it’s grouped with other favorite dashboards at the top of the list, and appears on the New Relic One home page. To remove a dashboard from your favorites, select the star icon again. New Relic One doesn’t retrieve favorited dashboards from Insights. Learn how to make the transition from Insights to New Relic One. Search and sort dashboards You can search dashboards by dashboard name and author using the search box above the index. You can also sort the dashboards in the index. By default, dashboards you edited recently are at the top of the index in both the favorited and non-favorited sections. To change this order, you can sort both sections by any of the columns in the index, your most recent sort is displayed next time you access New Relic One. Dashboard permissions Dashboards have three types of permissions: Public - Read and write: All users have full rights to the dashboard. Public - Read only: All users are able to see the dashboard, but only you have full rights to work with the dashboard. Other users can access the dashboard but are not able to edit or delete it, although they can duplicate it. Private: Only you can see the dashboard. Everything but the metadata is hidden. When you create a dashboard using the Create a dashboard button or by duplicating another dashboard, it will have Public - Read and write rights by default. Access the new dashboard to change this setting. Organize your dashboards with tags You can add tags using our NerdGraph, our tagging API. You can also filter your dashboards by tags, which you can use to identify users, accounts, locations, etc. Click on the tag filter to see the available tags, you can easily select one or more tags from the list to narrow down the dashboards in the index. Key visual tools Dashboards offer intuitive visualization features and tools for advanced data exploration and fast troubleshooting. Consistent chart coloring So that you can quickly see and correlate your data, facets that you apply to more than one chart in a dashboard have a consistent facet color across all the charts. Correlated needle When you mouse over one chart, the correlated needle overlays across all charts or data points in the dashboard at the same time. The tooltip provides the relevant data points from the selected facet, such as maximum and minimum values in a line chart. It also highlights the selected attribute in a pie chart. Data scrubber The chart scrubber helps you select a data point or facet in a chart when the chart is too crowded and facets are too close to each other. Mouse along the needle to smoothly select the adjacent facets and view their associated data points. You can also lighten a heavily populated chart by unselecting one or more of the attributes that appear in the UI. Brush to zoom Drag to select a time segment on any chart and you automatically zoom to that time period on all the charts in the dashboard. The time picker reflects the new period on display in the dashboard. You can return to the default or any other time settings at any time. Custom visualizations You can also make custom visualizations for your dashboards. These enable you to include information from any data source. To learn more about working with custom visualizations, see Build a custom visualization for dashboards and Add custom visualizations to your dashboards.",

      "body": "NRQL is a query language you can use to query the New Relic database. This document explains NRQL syntax, clauses, components, and functions. Syntax This document is a reference for the functions and clauses used in a NRQL query. Other resources for understanding NRQL: Intro to NRQL: explains what NRQL is used for, what data you can query with it, and basic NRQL syntax Examine NRQL queries used to build New Relic charts Learn how to query the Metric data type Simulate SQL JOIN functions Use funnels to evaluate a series of related data Format NRQL for querying with the Event API Query components Every NRQL query will begin with a SELECT statement or a FROM clause. All other clauses are optional. The clause definitions below also contain example NRQL queries. Required clauses Required: SELECT statement SELECT attribute ... Copy SELECT function(attribute) ... Copy The SELECT specifies what portion of a data type you want to query by specifying an attribute or a function. It's followed by one or more arguments separated by commas. In each argument you can: Get the values of all available attributes by using * as a wildcard. For example: SELECT * from Transaction. Get values associated with a specified attribute or multiple attributes specified in a comma separated list. Get aggregated values from specified attributes by selecting an aggregator function. Label the results returned in each argument with the AS clause. You can also use SELECT with basic math functions. Avg response time since last week This query returns the average response time since last week. SELECT average(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy Required: FROM clause SELECT ... FROM data type ... Copy Use the FROM clause to specify the data type you wish to query. You can start your query with FROM or with SELECT. You can merge values for the same attributes across multiple data types in a comma separated list. Query one data type This query returns the count of all APM transactions over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction SINCE 3 days ago Copy Query multiple data types This query returns the count of all APM transactions and browser events over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, PageView SINCE 3 days ago Copy Optional clauses AS clause SELECT ... AS 'label' ... Copy Use the AS clause to label an attribute, aggregator, step in a funnel, or the result of a math function with a string delimited by single quotes. The label is used in the resulting chart. Query using math function and AS This query returns the number of page views per session: SELECT count(*)/uniqueCount(session) AS 'Pageviews per Session' FROM PageView Copy Query using funnel and AS This query returns a count of people who have visited both the main page and the careers page of a site over the past week: SELECT funnel(SESSION, WHERE name='Controller/about/main' AS 'Step 1', WHERE name = 'Controller/about/careers' AS 'Step 2') FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy COMPARE WITH clause SELECT ... (SINCE or UNTIL) (integer units) AGO COMPARE WITH (integer units) AGO ... Copy Use the COMPARE WITH clause to compare the values for two different time ranges. COMPARE WITH requires a SINCE or UNTIL statement. The time specified by COMPARE WITH is relative to the time specified by SINCE or UNTIL. For example, SINCE 1 day ago COMPARE WITH 1 day ago compares yesterday with the day before. The time range for theCOMPARE WITH value is always the same as that specified by SINCE or UNTIL. For example, SINCE 2 hours ago COMPARE WITH 4 hours ago might compare 3:00pm through 5:00pm against 11:00am through 1:00pm. COMPARE WITH can be formatted as either a line chart or a billboard: With TIMESERIES, COMPARE WITH creates a line chart with the comparison mapped over time. Without TIMESERIES, COMPARE WITH generates a billboard with the current value and the percent change from the COMPARE WITH value. Example: This query returns data as a line chart showing the 95th percentile for the past hour compared to the same range one week ago. First as a single value, then as a line chart. SELECT percentile(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago COMPARE WITH 1 week AGO SELECT percentile(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago COMPARE WITH 1 week AGO TIMESERIES AUTO Copy EXTRAPOLATE clause You can use this clause with these data types: Transaction TransactionError Custom events reported via APM agent APIs The purpose of EXTRAPOLATE is to mathematically compensate for the effects of APM agent sampling of event data so that query results more closely represent the total activity in your system. This clause will be useful when a APM agent reports so many events that it often passes its harvest cycle reporting limits. When that occurs, the agent begins to sample events. When EXTRAPOLATE is used in a NRQL query that supports its use, the ratio between the reported events and the total events is used to extrapolate a close approximation of the total unsampled data. When it is used in a NRQL query that doesn’t support its use or that hasn’t used sampled data, it has no effect. Important Note that EXTRAPOLATE is most useful for homogenous data (like throughput or error rate). It's not effective when attempting to extrapolate a count of distinct things (like uniqueCount() or uniques()). This clause works only with NRQL queries that use one of the following aggregator functions: apdex average count histogram sum percentage (if function it takes as an argument supports EXTRAPOLATE) rate (if function it takes as an argument supports EXTRAPOLATE) stddev Example of extrapolating throughput A query that will show the extrapolated throughput of a service named interestingApplication. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction WHERE appName='interestingApplication' SINCE 60 minutes ago EXTRAPOLATE Copy Example of extrapolating throughput as a time series A query that will show the extrapolated throughput of a service named interestingApplication by transaction name, displayed as a time series. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction WHERE appName='interestingApplication' SINCE 60 minutes ago FACET name TIMESERIES 1 minute EXTRAPOLATE Copy FACET clause SELECT ... FACET attribute ... Copy Use FACET to separate and group your results by attribute values. For example, you could FACET your PageView data by deviceType to figure out what percentage of your traffic comes from mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. Use the LIMIT clause to specify how many facets appear (default is 10). For more complex grouping, use FACET CASES. FACET clauses support up to five attributes, separated by commas. The facets are sorted in descending order by the first field you provide in the SELECT clause. If you are faceting on attributes with more than 2,000 unique values, a subset of facet values is selected and sorted according to the query type. When selecting min(), max(), or count(), FACET uses those functions to determine how facets are picked and sorted. When selecting any other function, FACET uses the frequency of the attribute you are faceting on to determine how facets are picked and sorted. Faceted query using count() This query shows cities with the highest pageview counts. This query uses the total number of pageviews per city to determine how facets are picked and ordered. SELECT count(*) FROM PageView FACET city Copy Faceted query using uniqueCount() This query shows the cities that access the highest number of unique URLs. This query uses the total number of times a particular city appears in the results to determine how facets are picked and ordered. SELECT uniqueCount(pageUrl) FROM PageView FACET city Copy Grouping results across time Advanced segmentation and cohort analysis allow you to facet on bucket functions to more effectively break out your data. Cohort analysis is a way to group results together based on timestamps. You can separate them into buckets that cover a specified range of dates and times. FACET ... AS clause Use FACET ... AS to name facets using the AS keyword in queries. This clause is helpful for adding clearer or simplified names for facets in your results. It can also be used to rename facets in nested aggregation queries. FACET ... AS queries will change the facet names in results (when they appear as headers in tables, for example), but not the actual facet names themselves. FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) FACET response.headers.contentType AS 'content type' Copy FACET CASES clause SELECT ... FACET CASES ( WHERE attribute operator value, WHERE attribute operator value, ... ) ... Copy Use FACET CASES to break out your data by more complex conditions than possible with FACET. Separate multiple conditions with a comma ,. For example, you could query your PageView data and FACET CASES into categories like less than 1 second, from 1 to 10 seconds, and greater than 10 seconds. You can combine multiple attributes within your cases, and label the cases with the AS selector. Data points will be added to at most one facet case, the first facet case that they match. You may also use a time function with your attribute, and you can use the OR operator to facet results that don't match any of your specified cases. Basic usage with WHERE SELECT count(*) FROM PageView FACET CASES (WHERE duration < 1, WHERE duration > 1 and duration < 10, WHERE duration > 10) Copy Group based on multiple attributes This example groups results into one bucket where the transaction name contains login, and another where the URL contains login and a custom attribute indicates that the user was a paid user: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid') Copy Label groups with AS This example uses the AS selector to give your results a human-readable name: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%' AS 'Total Logins', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid' AS 'Feature Visits from Paid Users') Copy Facet non-matching data with OR This example uses the OR operator to facet results that didn't match any of your cases: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid') OR name Copy FACET ... ORDER BY clause In NRQL, the default is for the first aggregation in the SELECT clause to guide the selection of facets in a query. FACET ... ORDER BY allows you to override this default behavior by adding an aggregate function with the ORDER BY modifier to specify how facets are selected. Specifically, the clause will override the priority by which facets are chosen to be in the final result before being limited by the LIMIT clause. This clause can be used in querying but not for alerts or streaming. This example shows how to use FACET ... ORDER BY to find the average durations of app transactions, showing the top 10 (default limit) highest durations by apps which have the highest response size. In this case, if FACET ... ORDER BY is not used, the query results will instead show the top 10 by highest durations, with response size being irrelevant to the app selection. FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) TIMESERIES FACET appName ORDER BY max(responseSize) Copy Tip Because the operations are performed before the LIMIT clause is applied, FACET ... ORDER BY does not impact the sort of the final query results, which will be particularly noticeable in the results for non-timeseries queries. Important The ORDER BY modifier in this case works differently than the ORDER BY clause. When parsing queries that follow the format FACET attribute1 ORDER BY attribute2, New Relic will read these as FACET ... ORDER BY queries, but only if ORDER BY appears immediately after FACET. Otherwise ORDER BY will be interpreted by New Relic as a clause. LIMIT clause SELECT ... LIMIT count ... Copy Use the LIMIT clause to control the maximum number of facet values returned by FACET queries or the maximum number of items returned by SELECT * queries. This clause takes a single integer value as an argument. If the LIMIT clause is not specified, or no value is provided, the limit defaults to 10 for FACET queries and 100 in the case of SELECT * queries. The maximum allowed value for the LIMIT clause is 2,000. Query using LIMIT This query shows the top 20 countries by session count and provides 95th percentile of response time for each country for Windows users only. SELECT uniqueCount(session), percentile(duration, 95) FROM PageView WHERE userAgentOS = 'Windows' FACET countryCode LIMIT 20 SINCE YESTERDAY Copy OFFSET clause SELECT ... LIMIT count OFFSET count ... Copy Use the OFFSET clause with LIMIT to control the portion of rows returned by SELECT * or SELECT column queries. Like the LIMIT clause, OFFSET takes a single integer value as an argument. OFFSET sets the number of rows to be skipped before the selected rows of your query are returned. This is constrained by LIMIT. OFFSET rows are skipped starting from the most recent record. For example, the query SELECT interestingValue FROM Minute_Report LIMIT 5 OFFSET 1 returns the last 5 values from Minute_Report except for the most recent one. ORDER BY clause The ORDER BY clause allows you to specify how you want to sort your query results in queries that select event attributes by row. This query orders transactions by duration. FROM Transaction SELECT appName, duration ORDER BY duration Copy The default sort order is ascending, but this can be changed by adding the ASC or DESC modifiers. SHOW EVENT TYPES clause SHOW EVENT TYPES... Copy SHOW EVENT TYPES will return a list of all the data types present in your account for a specific time range. It is used as the first clause in a query instead of SELECT. Important In this context, \"event types\" refers to the data types you can access with a NRQL query. Data types in the last day This query will return all the data types present over the past day: SHOW EVENT TYPES SINCE 1 day ago Copy SINCE clause SELECT ... SINCE [numerical units AGO | phrase] ... Copy The default value is 1 hour ago. Use the SINCE clause to define the beginning of a time range for the returned data. When using NRQL, you can set a UTC timestamp or relative time range. You can specify a timezone for the query but not for the results. NRQL results are based on your system time. SLIDE BY clause The SLIDE BY clause supports a feature known as sliding windows. With sliding windows,SLIDE BY data is gathered into \"windows\" of time that overlap with each other. These windows can help to smooth out line graphs with a lot of variation in cases where the rolling aggregate (such as a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. To use SLIDE BY, place it in a query after the TIMESERIES clause. For example, this query pulls data in 5-minute windows with a 1-minute SLIDE BY interval, meaning that each window lasts 5 minutes, but window 1 starts at 0 minutes, window 2 starts at 1 minute, window 3 starts at 2 minutes, and so on. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY 1 minute Copy To learn more about how and when you can use SLIDE BY, see Create smoother charts with sliding windows. Use SLIDE BY with MAX or AUTO interval You can use sliding windows in combination with MAX or AUTO. However, MAX or AUTO may not be placed between TIMESERIES and SLIDE BY. This query will automatically decide a SLIDE BY window interval. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY AUTO Copy This query will set the SLIDE BY window to the maximum interval granularity. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY MAX Copy Important The SLIDE BY value as determined by AUTO or MAX can produce a step interval greater than the window size, which can cause gaps and unexpected results. TIMESERIES clause SELECT ... TIMESERIES integer units ... Copy Use the TIMESERIES clause to return data as a time series broken out by a specified period of time. Since TIMESERIES is used to trigger certain charts, there is no default value. To indicate the time range, use integer units. For example: TIMESERIES 1 minute TIMESERIES 30 minutes TIMESERIES 1 hour TIMESERIES 30 seconds TIMESERIES can be combined with arguments such as MAX, AUTO, and SLIDE BY to further tailor query results, as shown in the examples below. Important For functions such as average( ) or percentile( ), a large aggregation window can have a significant smoothing effect on outliers. This is true whether or not the query makes use of sliding windows. Use a set interval The value provided indicates the units used to break out the graph. For example, to present a one-day graph showing 30 minute increments: SELECT ... SINCE 1 day AGO TIMESERIES 30 minutes Copy Use an automatically set interval TIMESERIES can also be set to AUTO, which will divide your graph into a reasonable number of divisions. For example, a daily chart will be divided into 30 minute intervals and a weekly chart will be divided into 6 hour intervals. This query returns data as a line chart showing the 50th and 90th percentile of client-side transaction time for one week with a data point every 6 hours. SELECT average(duration), percentile(duration, 50, 90) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week AGO TIMESERIES AUTO Copy Use MAX interval You can set TIMESERIES to MAX, which will automatically adjust your time window to the maximum number of intervals allowed for a given time period. This allows you to update your time windows without having to manually update your TIMESERIES buckets and ensures your time window is being split into the peak number of intervals allowed. The maximum number of TIMESERIES buckets that will be returned is 366. For example, the following query creates 4-minute intervals, which is the ceiling for a daily chart. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction since 1 day ago TIMESERIES MAX Copy UNTIL clause SELECT ... UNTIL integer units AGO ... Copy The default value is NOW. Only use UNTIL to specify an end point other than the default. Use the UNTIL clause to define the end of a time range across which to return data. Once a time range has been specified, the data will be preserved and can be reviewed after the time range has ended. See Use the time picker to adjust time settings for detailed information and examples. WHERE clause Use the WHERE clause to filter results. NRQL returns the results that fulfill the condition(s) you specify in the clause. SELECT function(attribute) ... WHERE attribute [operator 'value' | IN ('value' [, 'value]) | IS [NOT] NULL ] [AND|OR ...] ... Copy If you specify more than one condition, separate the conditions by the operators AND or OR. If you want to simulate a SQL join, use custom attributes in a WHERE or FACET clause. Operators that the WHERE clause accepts Description =, !=, <, <=, >, >= NRQL accepts standard comparison operators. Example: state = 'WA' AND Used to define an intersection of two conditions. OR Used to define a union of two conditions. IS NULL Determines if an attribute has a null value. IS NOT NULL Determines if an attribute does not have a null value. IN Determines if the string value of an attribute is in a specified set. Using this method yields better performance than stringing together multiple WHERE clauses. Example: animalType IN ('cat', 'dog', 'fish') NOT IN Determines if the string value of an attribute is not in a specified set. Using this method yields better performance than stringing together multiple WHERE clauses. Values must be in parentheses, separated by commas. For example: SELECT * FROM PageView WHERE countryCode NOT IN ('CA', 'WA') Copy LIKE Determines if an attribute contains a specified sub-string. The string argument for the LIKE operator accepts the percent sign (%) as a wildcard anywhere in the string. If the substring does not begin or end the string you are matching against, the wildcard must begin or end the string. Examples: userAgentName LIKE 'IE%' IE IE Mobile userAgentName LIKE 'o%a%' Opera Opera Mini userAgentName LIKE 'o%a' Opera userAgentName LIKE '%o%a%' Opera Opera Mini Mozilla Gecko NOT LIKE Determines if an attribute does not contain a specified sub-string. RLIKE Determines if an attribute contains a specified Regex sub-string. Uses RE2 syntax. Examples: appName RLIKE r'z.*|q.*'' hostname RLIKE r'ip-10-351-[0-2]?[0-9]-.*' z-app q-app ip-10-351-19-237 ip-10-351-2-41 ip-10-351-24-238 ip-10-351-14-15 Important Regex defaults to full-string matching, therefore ^ and $ are implicit and you do not need to add them. NOT RLIKE Determines if an attribute does not contain a specified Regex sub-string. Uses RE2 syntax. Example query with three conditions This query returns the browser response time for pages with checkout in the URL for Safari users in the United States and Canada over the past 24 hours. SELECT histogram(duration, 50, 20) FROM PageView WHERE countryCode IN ('CA', 'US') AND userAgentName='Safari' AND pageUrl LIKE '%checkout%' SINCE 1 day ago Copy WITH METRIC_FORMAT clause For information on querying metric data, see Query metrics. WITH TIMEZONE clause SELECT ... WITH TIMEZONE (selected zone) ... Copy By default, query results are displayed in the timezone of the browser you're using. Use the WITH TIMEZONE clause to select a time zone for a date or time in the query that hasn't already had a time zone specified for it. For example, the query clause SINCE Monday UNTIL Tuesday WITH TIMEZONE 'America/New_York' will return data recorded from Monday at midnight, Eastern Standard Time, until midnight Tuesday, Eastern Standard Time.

Query metric data Metric data is more complex than other types of data. There are specific tips for querying it well. We have two types of metric data, each with their own query guidelines: Query dimensional metrics, which are reported by our Metric API and by some of our tools that use that API, like our Telemetry SDKs and our open-source telemetry integrations (OpenTelemetry, Kamon, Micrometer, more). Query metric timeslice data, which is our original metric data type reported by our APM, mobile monitoring, and browser monitoring. For more on understanding these data types, see Metric data types. Functions In this section we explain NRQL functions, both aggregator functions and non-aggregator functions. Aggregator functions You can use aggregator functions to filter and aggregate data. Some tips for using these: See New Relic University tutorials for Filter queries, Apdex queries, and Percentile queries. Or, go to the full online course Writing NRQL queries. If you're using an aggregator function multiple times in the same query (e.g., SELECT median(one_metric</var>), median(another_metric)), it can cause problems in displaying results. To solve this, use the AS function. For example: SELECT median(one_metric) as 'med-a', median(another_metric) as 'med-b' Data type \"coercion\" is not supported. Read about available type conversion functions. For how to display results over time, see Group results over time. Examples: SELECT histogram(duration, 10, 20) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy aggregationendtime() Use the aggregationendtime() function to return the time of the relevant aggregation. More specifically, for a given aggregate, the aggregationendtime() function provides the timestamp of the end of the time period of that aggregation. For example, in a timeseries query, for a data point that encompasses an hour’s worth of data, the function would return the timestamp of the end of that hour period. apdex(attribute, t: ) Use the apdex function to return an Apdex score for a single transaction or for all your transactions. The attribute can be any attribute based on response time, such as duration or backendDuration. The t: argument defines an Apdex T threshold in seconds. The Apdex score returned by the apdex( ) function is based only on execution time. It does not account for APM errors. If a transaction includes an error but completes in Apdex T or less, that transaction will be rated satisfying by the apdex ( ) function. Get Apdex for specific customers If you have defined custom attributes, you can filter based on those attributes. For example, you could monitor the Apdex for a particularly important customer: SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.4) FROM Transaction WHERE customerName='ReallyImportantCustomer' SINCE 1 day ago Copy Get Apdex for specific transaction Use the name attribute to return a score for a specific transaction, or return an overall Apdex by omitting name. This query returns an Apdex score for the Controller/notes/index transaction over the last hour: The apdex function returns an Apdex score that measures user satisfaction with your site. Arguments are a response time attribute and an Apdex T threshold in seconds. SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.5) from Transaction WHERE name='Controller/notes/index' SINCE 1 hour ago Copy Get overall Apdex for your app This example query returns an overall Apdex for the application over the last three weeks: SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.08) FROM Transaction SINCE 3 week ago Copy average(attribute) Use the average( ) function to return the average value for an attribute. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. buckets(attribute, ceiling [,number of buckets]) Use the buckets() function to aggregate data split up by a FACET clause into buckets based on ranges. You can bucket by any attribute that is stored as a numerical value in the New Relic database. It takes three arguments: Attribute name Maximum value of the sample range. Any outliers will appear in the final bucket. Total number of buckets For more information and examples, see Split your data into buckets. bucketPercentile(attribute) The bucketPercentile( ) function is the NRQL equivalent of the histogram_quantile function in Prometheus. It is intended to be used with dimensional metric data. Instead of the quantile, New Relic returns the percentile, which is the quantile * 100. Use the bucketPercentile( ) function to calculate the quantile from the histogram data in a Prometheus format. It takes the bucket name as an argument and reports percentiles along the bucket's boundaries: SELECT bucketPercentile(duration_bucket) FROM Metric SINCE 1 day ago Copy Optionally, you can add percentile specifications as an argument: SELECT bucketPercentile(duration_bucket, 50, 75, 90) FROM Metric SINCE 1 day ago Copy Because multiple metrics are used to make up Prometheus histogram data, you must query for specific Prometheus metrics in terms of the associated <basename>. For example, to compute percentiles from a Prometheus histogram, with the <basename> prometheus_http_request_duration_seconds using NRQL, use bucketPercentile(prometheus_http_request_duration_seconds_bucket, 50). Note how _ bucket is added to the end of the <basename> as a suffix. See the Prometheus.io documentation for more information. cardinality(attribute) Use the cardinality( ) function to obtain the number of combinations of all the dimensions (attributes) on a metric. It takes three arguments, all optional: Metric name: if present, cardinality( ) only computes the metric specified. Include: if present, the include list restricts the cardinality computation to those attributes. Exclude: if present, the exclude list causes those attributes to be ignored in the cardinality computation. SELECT cardinality(metric_name, include:{attribute_list}, exclude:{attribute_list}) Copy count(*) Use the count( ) function to return a count of available records. It takes a single argument; either *, an attribute, or a constant value. Currently, it follows typical SQL behavior and counts all records that have values for its argument. Since count(*) does not name a specific attribute, the results will be formatted in the default \"humanize\" format. derivative(attribute [,time interval]) derivative() finds the rate of change for a given dataset. The rate of change is calculated using a linear least-squares regression to approximate the derivative. Since this calculation requires comparing more than one datapoint, if only one datapoint is included in the evaluation range, the calculation is indeterminate and won't work, resulting in a null value. The time interval is the period for which the rate of change is calculated. For example, derivative(attributeName, 1 minute) will return the rate of change per minute. dimensions(include: {attributes}, exclude: {attributes}) Use the dimensions( ) function to return all the dimensional values on a data type. You can explicitly include or exclude specific attributes using the optional arguments: Include: if present, the include list limits dimensions( ) to those attributes. Exclude: if present, the dimensions( ) calculation ignores those attributes. FROM Metric SELECT count(node_filesystem_size) TIMESERIES FACET dimensions() Copy When used with a FACET clause, dimensions( ) produces a unique timeseries for all facets available on the event type, similar to how Prometheus behaves with non-aggregated queries. latestrate(attribute, time interval) Use the latestrate( ) function to return the rate of change of a value based on the last 2 data points. It takes the attribute in question as the first argument and the unit of time for the resulting rate as the second argument. The function returns a result in units of change in attribute/time interval. This function can be useful to provide the most recent rate of change for an attribute in order to see leading-edge trends. Get the most recent rate of change of PageView Duration This query returns the rate of change of duration based on the last 2 data points. It will be returned in units of duration/second because of the 1 SECOND argument. SELECT latestrate(duration, 1 SECOND) FROM PageView Copy max(attribute) Use the max( ) function to return the maximum recorded value of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. median(attribute) Use the median( ) function to return an attribute's median, or 50th percentile. For more information about percentile queries, see percentile(). Tip The median( ) query is only available when using the query builder. Median query This query will generate a line chart for the median value. SELECT median(duration) FROM PageView TIMESERIES AUTO Copy min(attribute) Use the min( ) function to return the minimum recorded value of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. minuteOf(attribute) Use the minuteOf() function to extract only the minute portion (i.e. 0-59) of an attribute holding a valid timestamp value. mod(attribute, divisor) Use the mod( ) function to return the floor modulus after dividing the value of the provided numeric attribute (the first argument, or dividend) by a numeric value (the second argument, or divisor). This modulo operation can be used within a WHERE clause condition to filter to an arbitrary subset of results or within a FACET clause as a way to subdivide the result set. mod() within a WHERE clause condition FROM Transaction SELECT * WHERE mod(port, 2) = 1 Copy mod() within a FACET clause FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT uniques(hostId, 10000) SINCE 1 day AGO FACET mod(hostId, 10) Copy percentage(function(attribute), WHERE condition) Use the percentage( ) function to return the percentage of a target data set that matches some condition. The first argument requires an aggregator function against the desired attribute. Use exactly two arguments (arguments after the first two will be ignored). If the attribute is not numeric, this function returns a value of 100%. percentile(attribute [, percentile [, ...]]) Use the percentile( ) function to return an attribute's approximate value at a given percentile. It requires an attribute and can take any number of arguments representing percentile points. The percentile() function enables percentiles to displays with up to three digits after the decimal point, providing greater precision. Percentile thresholds may be specified as decimal values, but be aware that for most data sets, percentiles closer than 0.1 from each other will not be resolved. Percentile display examples Use TIMESERIES to generate a line chart with percentiles mapped over time. Omit TIMESERIES to generate a billboard and attribute sheet showing aggregate values for the percentiles. If no percentiles are listed, the default is the 95th percentile. To return only the 50th percentile value, the median, you can also use median(). Basic percentile query This query will generate a line chart with lines for the 5th, 50th, and 95th percentile. SELECT percentile(duration, 5, 50, 95) FROM PageView TIMESERIES AUTO Copy predictLinear(attribute, [,time interval]) predictLinear() is an extension of the derivative() function. It uses a similar method of least-squares linear regression to predict the future values for a dataset. The time interval is how far the query will look into the future. For example, predictLinear(attributeName, 1 hour) is a linear prediction 1 hour into the future of the query time window. Generally, predictLinear() is helpful for continuously growing values like disk space, or predictions on large trends. Since predictLinear() is a linear regression, familiarity with the dataset being queried helps to ensure accurate long-term predictions. Any dataset which grows exponentially, logarithmically, or by other nonlinear means will likely only be successful in very short-term predictions. New Relic recommends against using predictLinear in TIMESERIES queries. This is because each bucket will be making an individual prediction based on its relative timeframe within the query, meaning that such queries will not show predictions from the end of the timeseries forward. rate(function(attribute) [,time interval]) Use the rate( ) function to visualize the frequency or rate of a given query per time interval. For example, you might want to know the number of pageviews per minute over an hour-long period or the count of unique sessions on your site per hour over a day-long period. Use TIMESERIES to generate a line chart with rates mapped over time. Omit TIMESERIES to generate a billboard showing a single rate value averaged over time. Basic rate query This query will generate a line chart showing the rate of throughput for APM transactions per 10 minutes over the past 6 hours. SELECT rate(count(*), 10 minute) FROM Transaction SINCE 6 hours ago TIMESERIES Copy round(attribute) Use the round( ) function to return the rounded value of an attribute. Optionally round( ) can take a second argument, to_nearest, to round the first argument to the closest multiple of the second one. to_nearest can be fractional. SELECT round(n [, to_nearest]) Copy stddev(attribute) Use the stddev( ) function to return one standard deviation for a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. stdvar(attribute) Use the stdvar( ) function to return the standard variance for a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. sum(attribute) Use the sum( ) function to return the sum recorded values of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. uniqueCount(attribute) Use the uniqueCount( ) function to return the number of unique values recorded for an attribute over the time range specified. Tip To optimize query performance, this function returns approximate results for queries that inspect more than 256 unique values. uniques(attribute [,limit]) Use the uniques( ) function to return a list of unique values recorded for an attribute over the time range specified. When used along with the facet clause, a list of unique attribute values will be returned per each facet value. The limit parameter is optional. When it is not provided, the default limit of 1,000 unique attribute values per facet is applied. You may specify a different limit value, up to a maximum of 10,000. The uniques( ) function will return the first set of unique attribute values discovered, until the limit is reached. Therefore, if you have 5,000 unique attribute values in your data set, and the limit is set to 1,000, the operator will return the first 1,000 unique values that it discovers, regardless of their frequency. The maximum number of values that can be returned in a query result is the product of the uniques( ) limit times the facet limit. In the following query, the theoretical maximum number of values that can be returned is 5 million (5,000 x 1,000). Depending on the data set being queried, and the complexity of the query, memory protection limits may prevent a very large query from being executed. From Transaction SELECT uniques(host,5000) FACET appName LIMIT 1000 Copy Using tuple If you'd like to know the unique combinations of a handful of attributes, you can structure a query in the format SELECT uniques(tuple(x, y, ... z)) ...` to get all the unique tuples of values, to maintain their relationship. In the following query, tuple is used on index and cellName together to find uniques where those two values occur in combination. FROM NodeStatus SELECT uniques(tuple(index, cellName), 5) Copy capture(attribute, regular expression) Use the capture() to extract values from an attribute using a regular expression. Uses RE2 syntax. It takes two arguments: Attribute name Regular expression with capture syntax. Regex expressions in NRQL use Python-like syntax, r'...'. When capturing, use the RE2 named-capture syntax ...(?P<name> pattern )... to capture the contained pattern, given the specified name. Currently, only 1 capture group is supported. Please see the examples below. capture() within a SELECT clause condition The following will select the domain name of the website, removing https:// and any paths following the .com SELECT capture(pageUrl, r'https://(?P<baseUrl>.*.com)/.+') FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago Copy The following will capture only the first word of the error message. SELECT capture(errorMessage, r'(?P<firstWord>\\S+)\\s.+') FROM Transaction SINCE 1 hour ago where errorMessage is not null Copy capture() within a FACET clause condition The following will facet by the captured HTTP method. SELECT count(*) FROM Log WHERE message like '%HTTP%' FACET capture(message, r'.* \"(?P<httpMethod>[A-Z]+) .*') Copy capture() within a WHERE clause condition The following will filter the results based on Log events with message attribute that matches the regular expression where the captured job name is ExampleJob. SELECT message FROM Log WHERE capture(message, r'.*Job Failed: (?P<jobName>[A-Za-z]+),.*') = 'ExampleJob' SINCE 10 minutes ago Copy capture() with a numeric cast The following will capture sum of CPU Time from log lines. You must explicitly cast to numeric to do mathematical operations. SELECT sum(numeric(capture(message, r'.*CpuTime:\\s(?P<cpuTime>\\d+)'))) FROM Log WHERE message like '%CpuTime:%' SINCE 1 hour ago Copy Non-aggregator functions Use non-aggregator functions for non-numerical data in NRQL queries. earliest(attribute) Use the earliest( ) function to return the earliest value for an attribute over the specified time range. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If used in conjunction with a FACET it will return the most recent value for an attribute for each of the resulting facets. Get earliest country per user agent from PageView This query returns the earliest country code per each user agent from the PageView event. SELECT earliest(countryCode) FROM PageView FACET userAgentName Copy eventType() ...WHERE eventType() = 'EventNameHere'... ...FACET eventType()... Copy Use the eventType() function in a FACET clause to break out results by the selected data type or in a WHERE clause to filter results to a specific data type. This is particularly useful for targeting specific data types with the filter() and percentage() functions. Important In this context, \"event type\" refers to the types of data you can access with a NRQL query. Use eventType() in filter() function This query returns the percentage of total TransactionError results out of the total Transaction results. You can use the eventType() function to target specific types of data with the filter() function. SELECT 100 * filter(count(*), where eventType() = 'TransactionError') / filter(count(*), where eventType() = 'Transaction') FROM Transaction, TransactionError WHERE appName = 'App.Prod' TIMESERIES 2 Minutes SINCE 6 hours ago Copy Use eventType() with FACET This query displays a count of how many records each data type (Transaction and TransactionError) returns. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, TransactionError FACET eventType() TIMESERIES Copy filter(function(attribute), WHERE condition) Use the filter() function to limit the results for one of the aggregator functions in your SELECT statement. You can use filter() in conjunction with FACET or TIMESERIES. Filter is only useful when selecting multiple different aggregations such as SELECT filter(sum(x), WHERE attribute='a') AS 'A', filter(sum(x), WHERE attribute='b') AS 'B' .... Otherwise, it's better to just use the standard WHERE clause. Analyze purchases that used offer codes You could use filter() to compare the items bought in a set of transactions for those using an offer code versus those who aren't: Use the filter( ) function to limit the results for one of the aggregator functions in your SELECT statement. funnel(attribute, steps) Use the funnel() function to generate a funnel chart. It takes an attribute as its first argument. You then specify steps as WHERE clauses (with optional AS clauses for labels) separated by commas. For details and examples, see the funnels documentation. getField(attribute, field) Use the getField() function to extract a field from compound data types, such as metric data. It takes the following arguments: Metric type Supported fields summary count, total, max, min, type gauge count, total, max, min, latest, type distribution count, total, max, min, type counter count, type timeslice count, total, totalExclusive, min, and max Examples: SELECT max(getField(mySummary, count)) from Metric Copy SELECT sum(mySummary) from Metric where getField(mySummary, count) > 10 Copy histogram(attribute, ceiling [,number of buckets]) Use the histogram( ) function to generate histograms. It takes three arguments: Attribute name Maximum value of the sample range Total number of buckets (between 1 and 500, inclusive) Histogram of response times from PageView events This query results in a histogram of response times ranging up to 10 seconds over 20 buckets. SELECT histogram(duration, 10, 20) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy Prometheus histogram buckets histogram( ) accepts Prometheus histogram buckets: SELECT histogram(duration_bucket, 10, 20) FROM Metric SINCE 1 week ago Copy New Relic distribution metric histogram( ) accepts Distribution metric as an input: SELECT histogram(myDistributionMetric, 10, 20) FROM Metric SINCE 1 week ago Copy Histogram with a FACET clause Use histogram( ) with a FACET clause to generate a heatmap chart: SELECT histogram(duration) FROM PageView FACET appName SINCE 1 week ago Copy keyset() Using keyset() will allow you to see all of the attributes for a given data type over a given time range. It takes no arguments. It returns a JSON structure containing groups of string-typed keys, numeric-typed keys, boolean-typed keys, and all keys. See all attributes for a data type This query returns the attributes found for PageView events from the last day: SELECT keyset() FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago Copy latest(attribute) Use the latest( ) function to return the most recent value for an attribute over a specified time range. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If used in conjunction with a FACET it will return the most recent value for an attribute for each of the resulting facets. Get most recent country per user agent from PageView This query returns the most recent country code per each user agent from the PageView event. SELECT latest(countryCode) FROM PageView FACET userAgentName Copy Type conversion NRQL does not support \"coercion.\" This means that a float stored as a string is treated as a string and cannot be operated on by functions expecting float values. You can convert a string with a numeric value or a boolean with a string value to their numeric and boolean types with these functions: Use the numeric() function to convert a number with a string format to a numeric function. The function can be built into a query that uses math functions on query results or NRQL aggregator functions, such as average(). Use the boolean() function to convert a string value of \"true\" or \"false\" to the corresponding boolean value.",

      "body": "BETA FEATURE This feature is currently in beta. Dimensional metrics are an industry standard for storing and querying metric data. All infrastructure metrics are stored as event data in New Relic, but you can also query them through dimensional metrics. In this page you can learn: The benefits of dimensional metrics. A few examples on how and where to use them. Known issues. Why it matters At New Relic we report metrics in several ways, including dimensional metrics, which are used by our metric API, Telemetry SDK, some open-source integrations, and our infrastructure services. This type of metric enables you to: Enjoy an improved query experience for Infrastructure data. Discover all your metrics in one place. Tap into more metric sources, such as Prometheus. For example, the query to get the maximum duration of your Lambda functions is simplified: Query with samples FROM ServerlessSample SELECT max(provider.duration.Maximum) WHERE provider = 'LambdaFunction' Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT max(aws.lambda.function.duration) Copy Get started No agent or integration updates are required to use these metrics. NRQL alerting based on dimensional metrics is also supported, except for data coming from cloud integrations (that is metrics from AWS polling integrations, GCP, and Azure). AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams metrics are ingested as dimensional metrics and NRQL alerts are recommended. Where and how to query dimensional metrics All current NRQL query features are supported. Queries can use WHERE, FACET, and time selection functions such as SINCE, UNTIL, and COMPARE WITH. The query builder in New Relic One supports metrics in both simple and advanced (NRQL) mode. Naming conventions for metrics and attributes All metric names and attributes for dimensional metrics follow the same naming convention in order to make them easy to find and use. Metric and attribute names are namespaced with dots: for example, the host. prefix is used for host metrics, the k8s. prefix is used for Kubernetes metrics, and aws. is used for AWS metrics. The graphic below shows how a ProcessSample that contains three metrics (cpuPercent, ioTotalReadBytes, and ioTotalWriteBytes) is split into three separate metrics. Note the updated naming of the metrics and the attributes. Dimensional metrics naming convention Examples Here are some examples of NQRL queries with and without dimensional metrics: AWS EBS query example Get the total write time by EBS Volume. Query with samples FROM BlockDeviceSample SELECT sum('provider.volumeTotalWriteTime.Sum') WHERE provider = 'EbsVolume' FACET entityName Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT sum(aws.ebs.volume.TotalWriteTime) FACET entity.name Copy Azure Service bus query example Maximum number of messages in an Azure Service Bus topic by resource group. Query with samples FROM AzureServiceBusTopicSample SELECT max(activeMessages.Maximum) FACET resourceGroupName Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT max(azure.servicebus.topic.activeMessages) FACET azure.resourceGroup Copy Azure functions query example Number of function executions Azure Functions over the past 6 hours by region over time. Query with samples FROM AzureFunctionsAppSample SELECT sum(functionExecutionCount.Total) FACET regionName TIMESERIES SINCE 6 hours ago Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT sum(azure.functions.app.functionExecutionCount) FACET azure.region TIMESERIES SINCE 6 hours ago Copy Azure VMs query example Compare the number of Azure VMs over the past thirty minutes with the same time a week ago. Query with samples FROM AzureVirtualMachineScaleSetSample SELECT uniqueCount(vMName) FACET name SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO COMPARE WITH 1 WEEK AGO Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT uniqueCount(azure.vms.vmName) FACET azure.resourceName WHERE azure.resourceType='Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachineScaleSets' SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO COMPARE WITH 1 WEEK AGO Copy NGINX query example The average number of NGINX requests per second over time. Query with samples FROM NginxSample SELECT average(net.requestsPerSecond) TIMESERIES Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT average(nginx.server.net.requestsPerSecond) TIMESERIES Copy MySQL query example The maximum number of used MySQL connections. Query with samples FROM MysqlSample SELECT max(net.maxUsedConnections) Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT max(mysql.node.net.maxUsedConnections) Copy Known limitations Metric queries with * do not return Infrastructure sample data (for example, SELECT * FROM Metric). In order to select attributes starting with tags. a metric name has to be provided. For example, SELECT uniques(tags.environment) FROM Metric WHERE metricName='aws.lambda.function.duration' does not work without the WHERE clause. Results may not be complete if the selection criteria matches too many samples. For example, SELECT uniqueCount(entity.guid) FROM Metric maps to all Infrastructure samples, and may return incomplete results. Initially there is no support for the newly introduced metric wildcarding feature (for example, SELECT average(host.swap%Bytes) FROM Metric).",

      "body": "New Relic Query Language (NRQL) supports basic math functions within a SELECT clause. You can apply addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on both individual attributes as well as the results of aggregator functions. Use math operators with SELECT To use basic math functions in NRQL, include operators within the SELECT clause: Addition: + Subtraction: - Multiplication: * Division: / Here are some examples: SELECT duration-databaseDuration FROM Transaction Copy SELECT count(*)/uniqueCount(session) FROM PageView Copy SELECT average(duration-databaseDuration) FROM Transaction Copy Results with STRING or FLOAT Here is how NRQL handles strings present in math calculations: Examples: sum(1+STRING) = 0 sum(1+MIXED) = skips records where MIXED is a string average(1+STRING) = 0 average(1+MIXED) = skips records where MIXED is a string NULL and zero both appear as 0 in the dashboard. To override NULL values with another numeric value, use the syntax: SELECT average(purchasePrice OR 0) Copy This will replace NULL values with 0 or any number specified. Tip This can also be used to test whether something returns NULL or zero. (zero) OR 1 returns 0. (NULL) OR 1 returns 1. Advanced math functions NRQL includes advanced mathematical functions that can be used for complex calculations and for processing data to display more effectively in the UI. abs abs(n) returns the absolute value of n. For non-negative n it returns n, and for negative n it returns the positive number -n. For example abs(2) = 2, and abs(-4) = 4. round, floor, ceil(ing) These three functions force decimal numbers to one of the neighboring integers. floor(n) returns the closest integer less than or equal to n. ceil(n) returns the closest integer greater than or equal to n. round(n) returns the closest integer to n in either direction. Sample graph showing raw data, with floor, round, and ceiling functions applied. clamp_max, clamp_min The clamping functions impose an upper or lower bound on values. For example, clamp_max(duration, 10) returns the duration, unless it exceeds 10, in which case 10 is returned. Similarly clamp_min(duration, 1) will not return any value lower than 1. The following chart shows the result of clamping both min and max to keep the value in the range 70-90. Sample graph showing raw data with clamp function applied. pow pow(n, m) computes n raised to the power m. (I.e. n * n * ... * n, with m copies of n) sqrt sqrt(n) returns the square root of n, that is, the number such that sqrt(n) * sqrt(n) = n. exp Computes the natural exponential function of the argument: exp(n) = pow(e, n). ln, log2, log10, log These functions compute the logarithm of the argument for various bases. ln(n) computes the natural logarithm: the logarithm base e. log2(n) computes the logarithm base 2. log10(n) computes the logarithm base 10. log(n, b) allows logarithms to be computed with an arbitrary base b. All logarithms satisfy the identity: log(pow(b, n), b) = n. Note that log(0) is undefined, for all bases. Be aware that if you take the logarithm of something that might be zero, you may end up getting \"No Value\" back from your query. For more help",

      "body": "NRQL is a query language you can use to query the New Relic database. This document explains NRQL syntax, clauses, components, and functions. Syntax This document is a reference for the functions and clauses used in a NRQL query. Other resources for understanding NRQL: Intro to NRQL: explains what NRQL is used for, what data you can query with it, and basic NRQL syntax Examine NRQL queries used to build New Relic charts Learn how to query the Metric data type Simulate SQL JOIN functions Use funnels to evaluate a series of related data Format NRQL for querying with the Event API Query components Every NRQL query will begin with a SELECT statement or a FROM clause. All other clauses are optional. The clause definitions below also contain example NRQL queries. Required clauses Required: SELECT statement SELECT attribute ... Copy SELECT function(attribute) ... Copy The SELECT specifies what portion of a data type you want to query by specifying an attribute or a function. It's followed by one or more arguments separated by commas. In each argument you can: Get the values of all available attributes by using * as a wildcard. For example: SELECT * from Transaction. Get values associated with a specified attribute or multiple attributes specified in a comma separated list. Get aggregated values from specified attributes by selecting an aggregator function. Label the results returned in each argument with the AS clause. You can also use SELECT with basic math functions. Avg response time since last week This query returns the average response time since last week. SELECT average(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy Required: FROM clause SELECT ... FROM data type ... Copy Use the FROM clause to specify the data type you wish to query. You can start your query with FROM or with SELECT. You can merge values for the same attributes across multiple data types in a comma separated list. Query one data type This query returns the count of all APM transactions over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction SINCE 3 days ago Copy Query multiple data types This query returns the count of all APM transactions and browser events over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, PageView SINCE 3 days ago Copy Optional clauses AS clause SELECT ... AS 'label' ... Copy Use the AS clause to label an attribute, aggregator, step in a funnel, or the result of a math function with a string delimited by single quotes. The label is used in the resulting chart. Query using math function and AS This query returns the number of page views per session: SELECT count(*)/uniqueCount(session) AS 'Pageviews per Session' FROM PageView Copy Query using funnel and AS This query returns a count of people who have visited both the main page and the careers page of a site over the past week: SELECT funnel(SESSION, WHERE name='Controller/about/main' AS 'Step 1', WHERE name = 'Controller/about/careers' AS 'Step 2') FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy COMPARE WITH clause SELECT ... (SINCE or UNTIL) (integer units) AGO COMPARE WITH (integer units) AGO ... Copy Use the COMPARE WITH clause to compare the values for two different time ranges. COMPARE WITH requires a SINCE or UNTIL statement. The time specified by COMPARE WITH is relative to the time specified by SINCE or UNTIL. For example, SINCE 1 day ago COMPARE WITH 1 day ago compares yesterday with the day before. The time range for theCOMPARE WITH value is always the same as that specified by SINCE or UNTIL. For example, SINCE 2 hours ago COMPARE WITH 4 hours ago might compare 3:00pm through 5:00pm against 11:00am through 1:00pm. COMPARE WITH can be formatted as either a line chart or a billboard: With TIMESERIES, COMPARE WITH creates a line chart with the comparison mapped over time. Without TIMESERIES, COMPARE WITH generates a billboard with the current value and the percent change from the COMPARE WITH value. Example: This query returns data as a line chart showing the 95th percentile for the past hour compared to the same range one week ago. First as a single value, then as a line chart. SELECT percentile(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago COMPARE WITH 1 week AGO SELECT percentile(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago COMPARE WITH 1 week AGO TIMESERIES AUTO Copy EXTRAPOLATE clause You can use this clause with these data types: Transaction TransactionError Custom events reported via APM agent APIs The purpose of EXTRAPOLATE is to mathematically compensate for the effects of APM agent sampling of event data so that query results more closely represent the total activity in your system. This clause will be useful when a APM agent reports so many events that it often passes its harvest cycle reporting limits. When that occurs, the agent begins to sample events. When EXTRAPOLATE is used in a NRQL query that supports its use, the ratio between the reported events and the total events is used to extrapolate a close approximation of the total unsampled data. When it is used in a NRQL query that doesn’t support its use or that hasn’t used sampled data, it has no effect. Important Note that EXTRAPOLATE is most useful for homogenous data (like throughput or error rate). It's not effective when attempting to extrapolate a count of distinct things (like uniqueCount() or uniques()). This clause works only with NRQL queries that use one of the following aggregator functions: apdex average count histogram sum percentage (if function it takes as an argument supports EXTRAPOLATE) rate (if function it takes as an argument supports EXTRAPOLATE) stddev Example of extrapolating throughput A query that will show the extrapolated throughput of a service named interestingApplication. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction WHERE appName='interestingApplication' SINCE 60 minutes ago EXTRAPOLATE Copy Example of extrapolating throughput as a time series A query that will show the extrapolated throughput of a service named interestingApplication by transaction name, displayed as a time series. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction WHERE appName='interestingApplication' SINCE 60 minutes ago FACET name TIMESERIES 1 minute EXTRAPOLATE Copy FACET clause SELECT ... FACET attribute ... Copy Use FACET to separate and group your results by attribute values. For example, you could FACET your PageView data by deviceType to figure out what percentage of your traffic comes from mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. Use the LIMIT clause to specify how many facets appear (default is 10). For more complex grouping, use FACET CASES. FACET clauses support up to five attributes, separated by commas. The facets are sorted in descending order by the first field you provide in the SELECT clause. If you are faceting on attributes with more than 2,000 unique values, a subset of facet values is selected and sorted according to the query type. When selecting min(), max(), or count(), FACET uses those functions to determine how facets are picked and sorted. When selecting any other function, FACET uses the frequency of the attribute you are faceting on to determine how facets are picked and sorted. Faceted query using count() This query shows cities with the highest pageview counts. This query uses the total number of pageviews per city to determine how facets are picked and ordered. SELECT count(*) FROM PageView FACET city Copy Faceted query using uniqueCount() This query shows the cities that access the highest number of unique URLs. This query uses the total number of times a particular city appears in the results to determine how facets are picked and ordered. SELECT uniqueCount(pageUrl) FROM PageView FACET city Copy Grouping results across time Advanced segmentation and cohort analysis allow you to facet on bucket functions to more effectively break out your data. Cohort analysis is a way to group results together based on timestamps. You can separate them into buckets that cover a specified range of dates and times. FACET ... AS clause Use FACET ... AS to name facets using the AS keyword in queries. This clause is helpful for adding clearer or simplified names for facets in your results. It can also be used to rename facets in nested aggregation queries. FACET ... AS queries will change the facet names in results (when they appear as headers in tables, for example), but not the actual facet names themselves. FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) FACET response.headers.contentType AS 'content type' Copy FACET CASES clause SELECT ... FACET CASES ( WHERE attribute operator value, WHERE attribute operator value, ... ) ... Copy Use FACET CASES to break out your data by more complex conditions than possible with FACET. Separate multiple conditions with a comma ,. For example, you could query your PageView data and FACET CASES into categories like less than 1 second, from 1 to 10 seconds, and greater than 10 seconds. You can combine multiple attributes within your cases, and label the cases with the AS selector. Data points will be added to at most one facet case, the first facet case that they match. You may also use a time function with your attribute, and you can use the OR operator to facet results that don't match any of your specified cases. Basic usage with WHERE SELECT count(*) FROM PageView FACET CASES (WHERE duration < 1, WHERE duration > 1 and duration < 10, WHERE duration > 10) Copy Group based on multiple attributes This example groups results into one bucket where the transaction name contains login, and another where the URL contains login and a custom attribute indicates that the user was a paid user: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid') Copy Label groups with AS This example uses the AS selector to give your results a human-readable name: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%' AS 'Total Logins', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid' AS 'Feature Visits from Paid Users') Copy Facet non-matching data with OR This example uses the OR operator to facet results that didn't match any of your cases: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid') OR name Copy FACET ... ORDER BY clause In NRQL, the default is for the first aggregation in the SELECT clause to guide the selection of facets in a query. FACET ... ORDER BY allows you to override this default behavior by adding an aggregate function with the ORDER BY modifier to specify how facets are selected. Specifically, the clause will override the priority by which facets are chosen to be in the final result before being limited by the LIMIT clause. This clause can be used in querying but not for alerts or streaming. This example shows how to use FACET ... ORDER BY to find the average durations of app transactions, showing the top 10 (default limit) highest durations by apps which have the highest response size. In this case, if FACET ... ORDER BY is not used, the query results will instead show the top 10 by highest durations, with response size being irrelevant to the app selection. FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) TIMESERIES FACET appName ORDER BY max(responseSize) Copy Tip Because the operations are performed before the LIMIT clause is applied, FACET ... ORDER BY does not impact the sort of the final query results, which will be particularly noticeable in the results for non-timeseries queries. Important The ORDER BY modifier in this case works differently than the ORDER BY clause. When parsing queries that follow the format FACET attribute1 ORDER BY attribute2, New Relic will read these as FACET ... ORDER BY queries, but only if ORDER BY appears immediately after FACET. Otherwise ORDER BY will be interpreted by New Relic as a clause. LIMIT clause SELECT ... LIMIT count ... Copy Use the LIMIT clause to control the maximum number of facet values returned by FACET queries or the maximum number of items returned by SELECT * queries. This clause takes a single integer value as an argument. If the LIMIT clause is not specified, or no value is provided, the limit defaults to 10 for FACET queries and 100 in the case of SELECT * queries. The maximum allowed value for the LIMIT clause is 2,000. Query using LIMIT This query shows the top 20 countries by session count and provides 95th percentile of response time for each country for Windows users only. SELECT uniqueCount(session), percentile(duration, 95) FROM PageView WHERE userAgentOS = 'Windows' FACET countryCode LIMIT 20 SINCE YESTERDAY Copy OFFSET clause SELECT ... LIMIT count OFFSET count ... Copy Use the OFFSET clause with LIMIT to control the portion of rows returned by SELECT * or SELECT column queries. Like the LIMIT clause, OFFSET takes a single integer value as an argument. OFFSET sets the number of rows to be skipped before the selected rows of your query are returned. This is constrained by LIMIT. OFFSET rows are skipped starting from the most recent record. For example, the query SELECT interestingValue FROM Minute_Report LIMIT 5 OFFSET 1 returns the last 5 values from Minute_Report except for the most recent one. ORDER BY clause The ORDER BY clause allows you to specify how you want to sort your query results in queries that select event attributes by row. This query orders transactions by duration. FROM Transaction SELECT appName, duration ORDER BY duration Copy The default sort order is ascending, but this can be changed by adding the ASC or DESC modifiers. SHOW EVENT TYPES clause SHOW EVENT TYPES... Copy SHOW EVENT TYPES will return a list of all the data types present in your account for a specific time range. It is used as the first clause in a query instead of SELECT. Important In this context, \"event types\" refers to the data types you can access with a NRQL query. Data types in the last day This query will return all the data types present over the past day: SHOW EVENT TYPES SINCE 1 day ago Copy SINCE clause SELECT ... SINCE [numerical units AGO | phrase] ... Copy The default value is 1 hour ago. Use the SINCE clause to define the beginning of a time range for the returned data. When using NRQL, you can set a UTC timestamp or relative time range. You can specify a timezone for the query but not for the results. NRQL results are based on your system time. SLIDE BY clause The SLIDE BY clause supports a feature known as sliding windows. With sliding windows,SLIDE BY data is gathered into \"windows\" of time that overlap with each other. These windows can help to smooth out line graphs with a lot of variation in cases where the rolling aggregate (such as a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. To use SLIDE BY, place it in a query after the TIMESERIES clause. For example, this query pulls data in 5-minute windows with a 1-minute SLIDE BY interval, meaning that each window lasts 5 minutes, but window 1 starts at 0 minutes, window 2 starts at 1 minute, window 3 starts at 2 minutes, and so on. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY 1 minute Copy To learn more about how and when you can use SLIDE BY, see Create smoother charts with sliding windows. Use SLIDE BY with MAX or AUTO interval You can use sliding windows in combination with MAX or AUTO. However, MAX or AUTO may not be placed between TIMESERIES and SLIDE BY. This query will automatically decide a SLIDE BY window interval. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY AUTO Copy This query will set the SLIDE BY window to the maximum interval granularity. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY MAX Copy Important The SLIDE BY value as determined by AUTO or MAX can produce a step interval greater than the window size, which can cause gaps and unexpected results. TIMESERIES clause SELECT ... TIMESERIES integer units ... Copy Use the TIMESERIES clause to return data as a time series broken out by a specified period of time. Since TIMESERIES is used to trigger certain charts, there is no default value. To indicate the time range, use integer units. For example: TIMESERIES 1 minute TIMESERIES 30 minutes TIMESERIES 1 hour TIMESERIES 30 seconds TIMESERIES can be combined with arguments such as MAX, AUTO, and SLIDE BY to further tailor query results, as shown in the examples below. Important For functions such as average( ) or percentile( ), a large aggregation window can have a significant smoothing effect on outliers. This is true whether or not the query makes use of sliding windows. Use a set interval The value provided indicates the units used to break out the graph. For example, to present a one-day graph showing 30 minute increments: SELECT ... SINCE 1 day AGO TIMESERIES 30 minutes Copy Use an automatically set interval TIMESERIES can also be set to AUTO, which will divide your graph into a reasonable number of divisions. For example, a daily chart will be divided into 30 minute intervals and a weekly chart will be divided into 6 hour intervals. This query returns data as a line chart showing the 50th and 90th percentile of client-side transaction time for one week with a data point every 6 hours. SELECT average(duration), percentile(duration, 50, 90) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week AGO TIMESERIES AUTO Copy Use MAX interval You can set TIMESERIES to MAX, which will automatically adjust your time window to the maximum number of intervals allowed for a given time period. This allows you to update your time windows without having to manually update your TIMESERIES buckets and ensures your time window is being split into the peak number of intervals allowed. The maximum number of TIMESERIES buckets that will be returned is 366. For example, the following query creates 4-minute intervals, which is the ceiling for a daily chart. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction since 1 day ago TIMESERIES MAX Copy UNTIL clause SELECT ... UNTIL integer units AGO ... Copy The default value is NOW. Only use UNTIL to specify an end point other than the default. Use the UNTIL clause to define the end of a time range across which to return data. Once a time range has been specified, the data will be preserved and can be reviewed after the time range has ended. See Use the time picker to adjust time settings for detailed information and examples. WHERE clause Use the WHERE clause to filter results. NRQL returns the results that fulfill the condition(s) you specify in the clause. SELECT function(attribute) ... WHERE attribute [operator 'value' | IN ('value' [, 'value]) | IS [NOT] NULL ] [AND|OR ...] ... Copy If you specify more than one condition, separate the conditions by the operators AND or OR. If you want to simulate a SQL join, use custom attributes in a WHERE or FACET clause. Operators that the WHERE clause accepts Description =, !=, <, <=, >, >= NRQL accepts standard comparison operators. Example: state = 'WA' AND Used to define an intersection of two conditions. OR Used to define a union of two conditions. IS NULL Determines if an attribute has a null value. IS NOT NULL Determines if an attribute does not have a null value. IN Determines if the string value of an attribute is in a specified set. Using this method yields better performance than stringing together multiple WHERE clauses. Example: animalType IN ('cat', 'dog', 'fish') NOT IN Determines if the string value of an attribute is not in a specified set. Using this method yields better performance than stringing together multiple WHERE clauses. Values must be in parentheses, separated by commas. For example: SELECT * FROM PageView WHERE countryCode NOT IN ('CA', 'WA') Copy LIKE Determines if an attribute contains a specified sub-string. The string argument for the LIKE operator accepts the percent sign (%) as a wildcard anywhere in the string. If the substring does not begin or end the string you are matching against, the wildcard must begin or end the string. Examples: userAgentName LIKE 'IE%' IE IE Mobile userAgentName LIKE 'o%a%' Opera Opera Mini userAgentName LIKE 'o%a' Opera userAgentName LIKE '%o%a%' Opera Opera Mini Mozilla Gecko NOT LIKE Determines if an attribute does not contain a specified sub-string. RLIKE Determines if an attribute contains a specified Regex sub-string. Uses RE2 syntax. Examples: appName RLIKE r'z.*|q.*'' hostname RLIKE r'ip-10-351-[0-2]?[0-9]-.*' z-app q-app ip-10-351-19-237 ip-10-351-2-41 ip-10-351-24-238 ip-10-351-14-15 Important Regex defaults to full-string matching, therefore ^ and $ are implicit and you do not need to add them. NOT RLIKE Determines if an attribute does not contain a specified Regex sub-string. Uses RE2 syntax. Example query with three conditions This query returns the browser response time for pages with checkout in the URL for Safari users in the United States and Canada over the past 24 hours. SELECT histogram(duration, 50, 20) FROM PageView WHERE countryCode IN ('CA', 'US') AND userAgentName='Safari' AND pageUrl LIKE '%checkout%' SINCE 1 day ago Copy WITH METRIC_FORMAT clause For information on querying metric data, see Query metrics. WITH TIMEZONE clause SELECT ... WITH TIMEZONE (selected zone) ... Copy By default, query results are displayed in the timezone of the browser you're using. Use the WITH TIMEZONE clause to select a time zone for a date or time in the query that hasn't already had a time zone specified for it. For example, the query clause SINCE Monday UNTIL Tuesday WITH TIMEZONE 'America/New_York' will return data recorded from Monday at midnight, Eastern Standard Time, until midnight Tuesday, Eastern Standard Time.

Query metric data Metric data is more complex than other types of data. There are specific tips for querying it well. We have two types of metric data, each with their own query guidelines: Query dimensional metrics, which are reported by our Metric API and by some of our tools that use that API, like our Telemetry SDKs and our open-source telemetry integrations (OpenTelemetry, Kamon, Micrometer, more). Query metric timeslice data, which is our original metric data type reported by our APM, mobile monitoring, and browser monitoring. For more on understanding these data types, see Metric data types. Functions In this section we explain NRQL functions, both aggregator functions and non-aggregator functions. Aggregator functions You can use aggregator functions to filter and aggregate data. Some tips for using these: See New Relic University tutorials for Filter queries, Apdex queries, and Percentile queries. Or, go to the full online course Writing NRQL queries. If you're using an aggregator function multiple times in the same query (e.g., SELECT median(one_metric</var>), median(another_metric)), it can cause problems in displaying results. To solve this, use the AS function. For example: SELECT median(one_metric) as 'med-a', median(another_metric) as 'med-b' Data type \"coercion\" is not supported. Read about available type conversion functions. For how to display results over time, see Group results over time. Examples: SELECT histogram(duration, 10, 20) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy aggregationendtime() Use the aggregationendtime() function to return the time of the relevant aggregation. More specifically, for a given aggregate, the aggregationendtime() function provides the timestamp of the end of the time period of that aggregation. For example, in a timeseries query, for a data point that encompasses an hour’s worth of data, the function would return the timestamp of the end of that hour period. apdex(attribute, t: ) Use the apdex function to return an Apdex score for a single transaction or for all your transactions. The attribute can be any attribute based on response time, such as duration or backendDuration. The t: argument defines an Apdex T threshold in seconds. The Apdex score returned by the apdex( ) function is based only on execution time. It does not account for APM errors. If a transaction includes an error but completes in Apdex T or less, that transaction will be rated satisfying by the apdex ( ) function. Get Apdex for specific customers If you have defined custom attributes, you can filter based on those attributes. For example, you could monitor the Apdex for a particularly important customer: SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.4) FROM Transaction WHERE customerName='ReallyImportantCustomer' SINCE 1 day ago Copy Get Apdex for specific transaction Use the name attribute to return a score for a specific transaction, or return an overall Apdex by omitting name. This query returns an Apdex score for the Controller/notes/index transaction over the last hour: The apdex function returns an Apdex score that measures user satisfaction with your site. Arguments are a response time attribute and an Apdex T threshold in seconds. SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.5) from Transaction WHERE name='Controller/notes/index' SINCE 1 hour ago Copy Get overall Apdex for your app This example query returns an overall Apdex for the application over the last three weeks: SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.08) FROM Transaction SINCE 3 week ago Copy average(attribute) Use the average( ) function to return the average value for an attribute. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. buckets(attribute, ceiling [,number of buckets]) Use the buckets() function to aggregate data split up by a FACET clause into buckets based on ranges. You can bucket by any attribute that is stored as a numerical value in the New Relic database. It takes three arguments: Attribute name Maximum value of the sample range. Any outliers will appear in the final bucket. Total number of buckets For more information and examples, see Split your data into buckets. bucketPercentile(attribute) The bucketPercentile( ) function is the NRQL equivalent of the histogram_quantile function in Prometheus. It is intended to be used with dimensional metric data. Instead of the quantile, New Relic returns the percentile, which is the quantile * 100. Use the bucketPercentile( ) function to calculate the quantile from the histogram data in a Prometheus format. It takes the bucket name as an argument and reports percentiles along the bucket's boundaries: SELECT bucketPercentile(duration_bucket) FROM Metric SINCE 1 day ago Copy Optionally, you can add percentile specifications as an argument: SELECT bucketPercentile(duration_bucket, 50, 75, 90) FROM Metric SINCE 1 day ago Copy Because multiple metrics are used to make up Prometheus histogram data, you must query for specific Prometheus metrics in terms of the associated <basename>. For example, to compute percentiles from a Prometheus histogram, with the <basename> prometheus_http_request_duration_seconds using NRQL, use bucketPercentile(prometheus_http_request_duration_seconds_bucket, 50). Note how _ bucket is added to the end of the <basename> as a suffix. See the Prometheus.io documentation for more information. cardinality(attribute) Use the cardinality( ) function to obtain the number of combinations of all the dimensions (attributes) on a metric. It takes three arguments, all optional: Metric name: if present, cardinality( ) only computes the metric specified. Include: if present, the include list restricts the cardinality computation to those attributes. Exclude: if present, the exclude list causes those attributes to be ignored in the cardinality computation. SELECT cardinality(metric_name, include:{attribute_list}, exclude:{attribute_list}) Copy count(*) Use the count( ) function to return a count of available records. It takes a single argument; either *, an attribute, or a constant value. Currently, it follows typical SQL behavior and counts all records that have values for its argument. Since count(*) does not name a specific attribute, the results will be formatted in the default \"humanize\" format. derivative(attribute [,time interval]) derivative() finds the rate of change for a given dataset. The rate of change is calculated using a linear least-squares regression to approximate the derivative. Since this calculation requires comparing more than one datapoint, if only one datapoint is included in the evaluation range, the calculation is indeterminate and won't work, resulting in a null value. The time interval is the period for which the rate of change is calculated. For example, derivative(attributeName, 1 minute) will return the rate of change per minute. dimensions(include: {attributes}, exclude: {attributes}) Use the dimensions( ) function to return all the dimensional values on a data type. You can explicitly include or exclude specific attributes using the optional arguments: Include: if present, the include list limits dimensions( ) to those attributes. Exclude: if present, the dimensions( ) calculation ignores those attributes. FROM Metric SELECT count(node_filesystem_size) TIMESERIES FACET dimensions() Copy When used with a FACET clause, dimensions( ) produces a unique timeseries for all facets available on the event type, similar to how Prometheus behaves with non-aggregated queries. latestrate(attribute, time interval) Use the latestrate( ) function to return the rate of change of a value based on the last 2 data points. It takes the attribute in question as the first argument and the unit of time for the resulting rate as the second argument. The function returns a result in units of change in attribute/time interval. This function can be useful to provide the most recent rate of change for an attribute in order to see leading-edge trends. Get the most recent rate of change of PageView Duration This query returns the rate of change of duration based on the last 2 data points. It will be returned in units of duration/second because of the 1 SECOND argument. SELECT latestrate(duration, 1 SECOND) FROM PageView Copy max(attribute) Use the max( ) function to return the maximum recorded value of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. median(attribute) Use the median( ) function to return an attribute's median, or 50th percentile. For more information about percentile queries, see percentile(). Tip The median( ) query is only available when using the query builder. Median query This query will generate a line chart for the median value. SELECT median(duration) FROM PageView TIMESERIES AUTO Copy min(attribute) Use the min( ) function to return the minimum recorded value of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. minuteOf(attribute) Use the minuteOf() function to extract only the minute portion (i.e. 0-59) of an attribute holding a valid timestamp value. mod(attribute, divisor) Use the mod( ) function to return the floor modulus after dividing the value of the provided numeric attribute (the first argument, or dividend) by a numeric value (the second argument, or divisor). This modulo operation can be used within a WHERE clause condition to filter to an arbitrary subset of results or within a FACET clause as a way to subdivide the result set. mod() within a WHERE clause condition FROM Transaction SELECT * WHERE mod(port, 2) = 1 Copy mod() within a FACET clause FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT uniques(hostId, 10000) SINCE 1 day AGO FACET mod(hostId, 10) Copy percentage(function(attribute), WHERE condition) Use the percentage( ) function to return the percentage of a target data set that matches some condition. The first argument requires an aggregator function against the desired attribute. Use exactly two arguments (arguments after the first two will be ignored). If the attribute is not numeric, this function returns a value of 100%. percentile(attribute [, percentile [, ...]]) Use the percentile( ) function to return an attribute's approximate value at a given percentile. It requires an attribute and can take any number of arguments representing percentile points. The percentile() function enables percentiles to displays with up to three digits after the decimal point, providing greater precision. Percentile thresholds may be specified as decimal values, but be aware that for most data sets, percentiles closer than 0.1 from each other will not be resolved. Percentile display examples Use TIMESERIES to generate a line chart with percentiles mapped over time. Omit TIMESERIES to generate a billboard and attribute sheet showing aggregate values for the percentiles. If no percentiles are listed, the default is the 95th percentile. To return only the 50th percentile value, the median, you can also use median(). Basic percentile query This query will generate a line chart with lines for the 5th, 50th, and 95th percentile. SELECT percentile(duration, 5, 50, 95) FROM PageView TIMESERIES AUTO Copy predictLinear(attribute, [,time interval]) predictLinear() is an extension of the derivative() function. It uses a similar method of least-squares linear regression to predict the future values for a dataset. The time interval is how far the query will look into the future. For example, predictLinear(attributeName, 1 hour) is a linear prediction 1 hour into the future of the query time window. Generally, predictLinear() is helpful for continuously growing values like disk space, or predictions on large trends. Since predictLinear() is a linear regression, familiarity with the dataset being queried helps to ensure accurate long-term predictions. Any dataset which grows exponentially, logarithmically, or by other nonlinear means will likely only be successful in very short-term predictions. New Relic recommends against using predictLinear in TIMESERIES queries. This is because each bucket will be making an individual prediction based on its relative timeframe within the query, meaning that such queries will not show predictions from the end of the timeseries forward. rate(function(attribute) [,time interval]) Use the rate( ) function to visualize the frequency or rate of a given query per time interval. For example, you might want to know the number of pageviews per minute over an hour-long period or the count of unique sessions on your site per hour over a day-long period. Use TIMESERIES to generate a line chart with rates mapped over time. Omit TIMESERIES to generate a billboard showing a single rate value averaged over time. Basic rate query This query will generate a line chart showing the rate of throughput for APM transactions per 10 minutes over the past 6 hours. SELECT rate(count(*), 10 minute) FROM Transaction SINCE 6 hours ago TIMESERIES Copy round(attribute) Use the round( ) function to return the rounded value of an attribute. Optionally round( ) can take a second argument, to_nearest, to round the first argument to the closest multiple of the second one. to_nearest can be fractional. SELECT round(n [, to_nearest]) Copy stddev(attribute) Use the stddev( ) function to return one standard deviation for a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. stdvar(attribute) Use the stdvar( ) function to return the standard variance for a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. sum(attribute) Use the sum( ) function to return the sum recorded values of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. uniqueCount(attribute) Use the uniqueCount( ) function to return the number of unique values recorded for an attribute over the time range specified. Tip To optimize query performance, this function returns approximate results for queries that inspect more than 256 unique values. uniques(attribute [,limit]) Use the uniques( ) function to return a list of unique values recorded for an attribute over the time range specified. When used along with the facet clause, a list of unique attribute values will be returned per each facet value. The limit parameter is optional. When it is not provided, the default limit of 1,000 unique attribute values per facet is applied. You may specify a different limit value, up to a maximum of 10,000. The uniques( ) function will return the first set of unique attribute values discovered, until the limit is reached. Therefore, if you have 5,000 unique attribute values in your data set, and the limit is set to 1,000, the operator will return the first 1,000 unique values that it discovers, regardless of their frequency. The maximum number of values that can be returned in a query result is the product of the uniques( ) limit times the facet limit. In the following query, the theoretical maximum number of values that can be returned is 5 million (5,000 x 1,000). Depending on the data set being queried, and the complexity of the query, memory protection limits may prevent a very large query from being executed. From Transaction SELECT uniques(host,5000) FACET appName LIMIT 1000 Copy Using tuple If you'd like to know the unique combinations of a handful of attributes, you can structure a query in the format SELECT uniques(tuple(x, y, ... z)) ...` to get all the unique tuples of values, to maintain their relationship. In the following query, tuple is used on index and cellName together to find uniques where those two values occur in combination. FROM NodeStatus SELECT uniques(tuple(index, cellName), 5) Copy capture(attribute, regular expression) Use the capture() to extract values from an attribute using a regular expression. Uses RE2 syntax. It takes two arguments: Attribute name Regular expression with capture syntax. Regex expressions in NRQL use Python-like syntax, r'...'. When capturing, use the RE2 named-capture syntax ...(?P<name> pattern )... to capture the contained pattern, given the specified name. Currently, only 1 capture group is supported. Please see the examples below. capture() within a SELECT clause condition The following will select the domain name of the website, removing https:// and any paths following the .com SELECT capture(pageUrl, r'https://(?P<baseUrl>.*.com)/.+') FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago Copy The following will capture only the first word of the error message. SELECT capture(errorMessage, r'(?P<firstWord>\\S+)\\s.+') FROM Transaction SINCE 1 hour ago where errorMessage is not null Copy capture() within a FACET clause condition The following will facet by the captured HTTP method. SELECT count(*) FROM Log WHERE message like '%HTTP%' FACET capture(message, r'.* \"(?P<httpMethod>[A-Z]+) .*') Copy capture() within a WHERE clause condition The following will filter the results based on Log events with message attribute that matches the regular expression where the captured job name is ExampleJob. SELECT message FROM Log WHERE capture(message, r'.*Job Failed: (?P<jobName>[A-Za-z]+),.*') = 'ExampleJob' SINCE 10 minutes ago Copy capture() with a numeric cast The following will capture sum of CPU Time from log lines. You must explicitly cast to numeric to do mathematical operations. SELECT sum(numeric(capture(message, r'.*CpuTime:\\s(?P<cpuTime>\\d+)'))) FROM Log WHERE message like '%CpuTime:%' SINCE 1 hour ago Copy Non-aggregator functions Use non-aggregator functions for non-numerical data in NRQL queries. earliest(attribute) Use the earliest( ) function to return the earliest value for an attribute over the specified time range. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If used in conjunction with a FACET it will return the most recent value for an attribute for each of the resulting facets. Get earliest country per user agent from PageView This query returns the earliest country code per each user agent from the PageView event. SELECT earliest(countryCode) FROM PageView FACET userAgentName Copy eventType() ...WHERE eventType() = 'EventNameHere'... ...FACET eventType()... Copy Use the eventType() function in a FACET clause to break out results by the selected data type or in a WHERE clause to filter results to a specific data type. This is particularly useful for targeting specific data types with the filter() and percentage() functions. Important In this context, \"event type\" refers to the types of data you can access with a NRQL query. Use eventType() in filter() function This query returns the percentage of total TransactionError results out of the total Transaction results. You can use the eventType() function to target specific types of data with the filter() function. SELECT 100 * filter(count(*), where eventType() = 'TransactionError') / filter(count(*), where eventType() = 'Transaction') FROM Transaction, TransactionError WHERE appName = 'App.Prod' TIMESERIES 2 Minutes SINCE 6 hours ago Copy Use eventType() with FACET This query displays a count of how many records each data type (Transaction and TransactionError) returns. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, TransactionError FACET eventType() TIMESERIES Copy filter(function(attribute), WHERE condition) Use the filter() function to limit the results for one of the aggregator functions in your SELECT statement. You can use filter() in conjunction with FACET or TIMESERIES. Filter is only useful when selecting multiple different aggregations such as SELECT filter(sum(x), WHERE attribute='a') AS 'A', filter(sum(x), WHERE attribute='b') AS 'B' .... Otherwise, it's better to just use the standard WHERE clause. Analyze purchases that used offer codes You could use filter() to compare the items bought in a set of transactions for those using an offer code versus those who aren't: Use the filter( ) function to limit the results for one of the aggregator functions in your SELECT statement. funnel(attribute, steps) Use the funnel() function to generate a funnel chart. It takes an attribute as its first argument. You then specify steps as WHERE clauses (with optional AS clauses for labels) separated by commas. For details and examples, see the funnels documentation. getField(attribute, field) Use the getField() function to extract a field from compound data types, such as metric data. It takes the following arguments: Metric type Supported fields summary count, total, max, min, type gauge count, total, max, min, latest, type distribution count, total, max, min, type counter count, type timeslice count, total, totalExclusive, min, and max Examples: SELECT max(getField(mySummary, count)) from Metric Copy SELECT sum(mySummary) from Metric where getField(mySummary, count) > 10 Copy histogram(attribute, ceiling [,number of buckets]) Use the histogram( ) function to generate histograms. It takes three arguments: Attribute name Maximum value of the sample range Total number of buckets (between 1 and 500, inclusive) Histogram of response times from PageView events This query results in a histogram of response times ranging up to 10 seconds over 20 buckets. SELECT histogram(duration, 10, 20) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy Prometheus histogram buckets histogram( ) accepts Prometheus histogram buckets: SELECT histogram(duration_bucket, 10, 20) FROM Metric SINCE 1 week ago Copy New Relic distribution metric histogram( ) accepts Distribution metric as an input: SELECT histogram(myDistributionMetric, 10, 20) FROM Metric SINCE 1 week ago Copy Histogram with a FACET clause Use histogram( ) with a FACET clause to generate a heatmap chart: SELECT histogram(duration) FROM PageView FACET appName SINCE 1 week ago Copy keyset() Using keyset() will allow you to see all of the attributes for a given data type over a given time range. It takes no arguments. It returns a JSON structure containing groups of string-typed keys, numeric-typed keys, boolean-typed keys, and all keys. See all attributes for a data type This query returns the attributes found for PageView events from the last day: SELECT keyset() FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago Copy latest(attribute) Use the latest( ) function to return the most recent value for an attribute over a specified time range. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If used in conjunction with a FACET it will return the most recent value for an attribute for each of the resulting facets. Get most recent country per user agent from PageView This query returns the most recent country code per each user agent from the PageView event. SELECT latest(countryCode) FROM PageView FACET userAgentName Copy Type conversion NRQL does not support \"coercion.\" This means that a float stored as a string is treated as a string and cannot be operated on by functions expecting float values. You can convert a string with a numeric value or a boolean with a string value to their numeric and boolean types with these functions: Use the numeric() function to convert a number with a string format to a numeric function. The function can be built into a query that uses math functions on query results or NRQL aggregator functions, such as average(). Use the boolean() function to convert a string value of \"true\" or \"false\" to the corresponding boolean value.",

      "body": "One way to query your New Relic data is with the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). This resource explains what NRQL is, when and how you can use it, and basic syntax rules. For more detailed information on querying, including a listing of clauses and functions and example queries, see NRQL syntax, clauses, and functions. What is NRQL? NRQL is New Relic's SQL-like query language. You can use NRQL to retrieve detailed New Relic data and get insight into your applications, hosts, and business-important activity. Reasons to use NRQL include: To answer a question for the purpose of troubleshooting or business analysis To create a new chart To make API queries of New Relic data (for example, using our NerdGraph API) NRQL is used behind the scenes to generate some New Relic charts: Some New Relic charts are built using NRQL. One way to start using NRQL is to view a chart's query and then edit it to make your own custom chart. Where can you use NRQL? You can use NRQL in these places: New Relic One query builder NerdGraph: our GraphQL-format API, which includes options for making NRQL queries one.newrelic.com > Query your data: You can run a NRQL query in New Relic One. This NRQL query shows a count of distributed tracing spans faceted by their entity names. NRQL is one of several ways to query New Relic data. For more on all query options, see Query your data. What data can you query with NRQL? NRQL allows you to query these New Relic data types: Event data from all New Relic products, including: APM events, like Transaction Browser monitoring events, like PageView Mobile monitoring events, like Mobile Infrastructure events, like ProcessSample Synthetics events, like SyntheticCheck Custom events, like those reported by the Event API Metric timeslice data (metrics reported by APM, browser, and mobile) The Metric data type (metrics reported by the Metric API and data sources that use that API) The Span data type (distributed tracing data) The Log data type (data from New Relic Logs) Tip Some data, like relationships between monitored entities, is not available via NRQL but is available using our NerdGraph API. Start using NRQL One way to start using NRQL and to understand what data you have available is to go to a NRQL interface (for example, the New Relic One query builder), type FROM, and press space. The interface will suggest available types of data: To see the attributes available for a specific data type, type FROM DATA_TYPE SELECT and press space. The interface will suggest available attributes. For example: To see the complete JSON associated with a data type, including all of its attributes, use the keyset() attribute. For example: FROM Transaction SELECT keyset() Copy NRQL is used behind the scenes to build some New Relic charts and dashboards. One way to learn NRQL is to find one of these NRQL-generated charts and start playing with the NRQL to create new, customized queries and charts: Charts built with NRQL will have View query as an option. You can then edit and customize that query to see how your changes affect the resulting visualization. Important To explore your data without having to use NRQL, use the data explorer. Learn more about querying data in New Relic. NRQL query examples Here's an example NRQL query of Transaction data, which is reported by APM. FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) FACET appName TIMESERIES auto Copy This would generate a chart that looks like: Here are some more query examples: Basic NRQL query of browser data Here's a NRQL query of PageView data from browser monitoring. SELECT uniqueCount(user) FROM PageView WHERE userAgentOS = 'Mac' FACET countryCode SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 20 Copy Attribute name with a space in it If a custom attribute name has a space in it, use backticks around the attribute name: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET `Logged-in user` Copy Querying multiple data sources To return data from two data sources, separate their data types with a comma. For example, this query returns a count of all APM transactions and browser events over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, PageView SINCE 3 days ago Copy Query returning multiple columns To return multiple columns from a dataset, separate the aggregator arguments with a comma: SELECT function(attribute), function(attribute) ... FROM ... Copy This query returns the minimum, average, and maximum duration for browser monitoring PageView events over the last week: SELECT min(duration), max(duration), average(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy See more NRQL query examples. NRQL syntax The syntax of a NRQL query is similar to standard SQL queries. Here is a breakdown of the structure of a NRQL query: SELECT function(attribute) [AS 'label'][, ...] FROM data type [WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...]][AS 'label'][, ...] [FACET attribute | function(attribute)] [LIMIT number] [SINCE time] [UNTIL time] [WITH TIMEZONE timezone] [COMPARE WITH time] [TIMESERIES time] Copy Basic rules include: NRQL condition Details Required values The SELECT statement and FROM clause are required. All other clauses are optional. You can start your query with either SELECT or FROM. Query string size The query string must be less than 4 KB. Case sensitivity The data type names and attribute names are case sensitive. NRQL clauses and functions are not case sensitive. Syntax for strings NRQL uses single quotes to designate strings. For example: ... where traceId = '030a573f0df02c57' Copy Attribute names with spaces Use backticks `` to quote a custom attribute name that has a space in it. For example: ... FACET `Logged-in user` Copy Data type coercion Insights does not support data type \"coercion.\" For more information, see Data type conversion. Use of math functions Basic and advanced math functions are supported in the SELECT statement. JOIN functions NRQL does not have the equivalent of the SQL JOIN function, but you can simulate a JOIN with custom attributes. Read more about NRQL syntax and functions.",

All infrastructure metrics are stored as event data in New Relic, but you can also query them through dimensional metrics. In this page you can learn: The benefits of dimensional metrics. A few examples on how and where to use them. Known issues. Why it matters At New Relic we report metrics in several ways, including dimensional metrics, which are used by our metric API, Telemetry SDK, some open-source integrations, and our infrastructure services. This type of metric enables you to: Enjoy an improved query experience for Infrastructure data. Discover all your metrics in one place. Tap into more metric sources, such as Prometheus. For example, the query to get the maximum duration of your Lambda functions is simplified: Query with samples FROM ServerlessSample SELECT max(provider.duration.Maximum) WHERE provider = 'LambdaFunction' Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT max(aws.lambda.function.duration) Copy Get started No agent or integration updates are required to use these metrics. NRQL alerting based on dimensional metrics is also supported, except for data coming from cloud integrations (that is metrics from AWS polling integrations, GCP, and Azure). AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams metrics are ingested as dimensional metrics and NRQL alerts are recommended. Where and how to query dimensional metrics All current NRQL query features are supported. Queries can use WHERE, FACET, and time selection functions such as SINCE, UNTIL, and COMPARE WITH. The query builder in New Relic One supports metrics in both simple and advanced (NRQL) mode. Naming conventions for metrics and attributes All metric names and attributes for dimensional metrics follow the same naming convention in order to make them easy to find and use. Metric and attribute names are namespaced with dots: for example, the host. prefix is used for host metrics, the k8s. prefix is used for Kubernetes metrics, and aws. is used for AWS metrics. The graphic below shows how a ProcessSample that contains three metrics (cpuPercent, ioTotalReadBytes, and ioTotalWriteBytes) is split into three separate metrics. Note the updated naming of the metrics and the attributes. Dimensional metrics naming convention Examples Here are some examples of NQRL queries with and without dimensional metrics: AWS EBS query example Get the total write time by EBS Volume. Query with samples FROM BlockDeviceSample SELECT sum('provider.volumeTotalWriteTime.Sum') WHERE provider = 'EbsVolume' FACET entityName Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT sum(aws.ebs.volume.TotalWriteTime) FACET entity.name Copy Azure Service bus query example Maximum number of messages in an Azure Service Bus topic by resource group. Query with samples FROM AzureServiceBusTopicSample SELECT max(activeMessages.Maximum) FACET resourceGroupName Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT max(azure.servicebus.topic.activeMessages) FACET azure.resourceGroup Copy Azure functions query example Number of function executions Azure Functions over the past 6 hours by region over time. Query with samples FROM AzureFunctionsAppSample SELECT sum(functionExecutionCount.Total) FACET regionName TIMESERIES SINCE 6 hours ago Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT sum(azure.functions.app.functionExecutionCount) FACET azure.region TIMESERIES SINCE 6 hours ago Copy Azure VMs query example Compare the number of Azure VMs over the past thirty minutes with the same time a week ago. Query with samples FROM AzureVirtualMachineScaleSetSample SELECT uniqueCount(vMName) FACET name SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO COMPARE WITH 1 WEEK AGO Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT uniqueCount(azure.vms.vmName) FACET azure.resourceName WHERE azure.resourceType='Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachineScaleSets' SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO COMPARE WITH 1 WEEK AGO Copy NGINX query example The average number of NGINX requests per second over time. Query with samples FROM NginxSample SELECT average(net.requestsPerSecond) TIMESERIES Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT average(nginx.server.net.requestsPerSecond) TIMESERIES Copy MySQL query example The maximum number of used MySQL connections. Query with samples FROM MysqlSample SELECT max(net.maxUsedConnections) Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT max(mysql.node.net.maxUsedConnections) Copy Known limitations Metric queries with * do not return Infrastructure sample data (for example, SELECT * FROM Metric). In order to select attributes starting with tags. a metric name has to be provided. For example, SELECT uniques(tags.environment) FROM Metric WHERE metricName='aws.lambda.function.duration' does not work without the WHERE clause. Results may not be complete if the selection criteria matches too many samples. For example, SELECT uniqueCount(entity.guid) FROM Metric maps to all Infrastructure samples, and may return incomplete results. Initially there is no support for the newly introduced metric wildcarding feature (for example, SELECT average(host.swap%Bytes) FROM Metric).",

      "body": "New Relic Query Language (NRQL) supports basic math functions within a SELECT clause. You can apply addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on both individual attributes as well as the results of aggregator functions. Use math operators with SELECT To use basic math functions in NRQL, include operators within the SELECT clause: Addition: + Subtraction: - Multiplication: * Division: / Here are some examples: SELECT duration-databaseDuration FROM Transaction Copy SELECT count(*)/uniqueCount(session) FROM PageView Copy SELECT average(duration-databaseDuration) FROM Transaction Copy Results with STRING or FLOAT Here is how NRQL handles strings present in math calculations: Examples: sum(1+STRING) = 0 sum(1+MIXED) = skips records where MIXED is a string average(1+STRING) = 0 average(1+MIXED) = skips records where MIXED is a string NULL and zero both appear as 0 in the dashboard. To override NULL values with another numeric value, use the syntax: SELECT average(purchasePrice OR 0) Copy This will replace NULL values with 0 or any number specified. Tip This can also be used to test whether something returns NULL or zero. (zero) OR 1 returns 0. (NULL) OR 1 returns 1. Advanced math functions NRQL includes advanced mathematical functions that can be used for complex calculations and for processing data to display more effectively in the UI. abs abs(n) returns the absolute value of n. For non-negative n it returns n, and for negative n it returns the positive number -n. For example abs(2) = 2, and abs(-4) = 4. round, floor, ceil(ing) These three functions force decimal numbers to one of the neighboring integers. floor(n) returns the closest integer less than or equal to n. ceil(n) returns the closest integer greater than or equal to n. round(n) returns the closest integer to n in either direction. Sample graph showing raw data, with floor, round, and ceiling functions applied. clamp_max, clamp_min The clamping functions impose an upper or lower bound on values. For example, clamp_max(duration, 10) returns the duration, unless it exceeds 10, in which case 10 is returned. Similarly clamp_min(duration, 1) will not return any value lower than 1. The following chart shows the result of clamping both min and max to keep the value in the range 70-90. Sample graph showing raw data with clamp function applied. pow pow(n, m) computes n raised to the power m. (I.e. n * n * ... * n, with m copies of n) sqrt sqrt(n) returns the square root of n, that is, the number such that sqrt(n) * sqrt(n) = n. exp Computes the natural exponential function of the argument: exp(n) = pow(e, n). ln, log2, log10, log These functions compute the logarithm of the argument for various bases. ln(n) computes the natural logarithm: the logarithm base e. log2(n) computes the logarithm base 2. log10(n) computes the logarithm base 10. log(n, b) allows logarithms to be computed with an arbitrary base b. All logarithms satisfy the identity: log(pow(b, n), b) = n. Note that log(0) is undefined, for all bases. Be aware that if you take the logarithm of something that might be zero, you may end up getting \"No Value\" back from your query. For more help",

      "body": "To ensure our systems are always up and ready to support you, and to keep you from unintended use, we place limits on the amount of data you can send, query, and store. Responses to limit violations Limits are enforced per child account, and across our APIs. You might reach a limit if you start monitoring a new high-traffic application, or have a sudden data spike. When you do reach a limit, New Relic responds according to the type of data and the limit that’s reached. For example: We place a limit on the number of ingested requests per minute (RPM) per data type. When this limit is reached, we stop accepting data and return a 429 status code for the duration of the minute. For queries, we place limits on the number of queries per minute and the number of records inspected (see query limits). When the number of queries per minute limit is reached, New Relic will begin rejecting queries until the number of queries is below the limit. When the records inspected limit is reached, New Relic will reject traffic from the source scanning the largest number of records and attempt to allow traffic from other sources. For metrics, we place a limit on the number of unique timeseries (cardinality) per account and per metric. When this limit is reached, aggregated data is turned off for the rest of the UTC day. For every major limit violation, New Relic creates an NrIntegrationError event for that account, which has these limit-related attributes: Attribute Description category RateLimit or ApiLimit. The RateLimit category is used for limits based on a unit of time such as the number of requests ingested per minute. The ApiLimit is used for constant limits, such as the number of attributes on a record. limitName The name of the limit. message Describes the limit and the impact. limitValue The limit reached. System limits UI The system Limits page (from the account dropdown, click Manage your data and click Limits on the left) displays when your account has encountered a rate limit in the specified time period. The page displays a default period of 24 hours; you can set a custom range from the top-right of the page. Non-limit-related NrIntegrationError events are not displayed here. In addition, this page does not display information about limits you have not hit, or how close you are to reaching a limit. For more on creating queries and alerts for data ingest and billing metrics, see Query billing/usage data. one.newrelic.com > account dropdown > Manage your data > Limits: An example of a chart on the Limits UI page displaying a cardinality violation limit issue. To add more detail, or build a dashboard, click the View NRQL button on the chart to see the NRQL powering this view. The graph displays each unique limit type that was reached during the selected time-period. This can help you find any trends based on time. The Limits page also provides a table where you can find the limit name, the limit event message associated with it, and last occurrence time and date. If you click a limit in the table, you see more about what happened, and when. one.newrelic.com > account dropdown > Manage your data > Limits: An example of a limit events table on the Limits UI page.

      "body": "New Relic has resource limits in place to protect your experience, our systems, and our other customers. These limits range from the maximum number of characters you can have in a query, to API request rates, to how many events your queries inspect, and more. This page describes the limit metrics and NrIntegrationError events that enable you to view your limits, your current data usage and overall resource consumption as compared to those limits, and the impact of experiencing a limit event. We also provide a handful of queries that, when compiled into a dashboard, can give you consistent insight into your limits status. Important While NrIntegrationError events provide data on many limits types, resource limit metrics currently only cover request rate ingestion and API query rate limits. What happens when you reach a limit Our response to reaching a limit depends on a handful of factors: the type of limit that’s reached, as well as the duration, frequency, and amount at which you exceed the limit. Exceeding a limit doesn’t always mean you experience a limit event, such as dropped data, rejected traffic, or having your data turned off for the rest of the day. We sometimes allow a small buffer before enforcing a limit. That said, any resource consumed above 100% is at risk for limit impact at any time. Many of our rate limits apply proportionally. That means if you’re barely exceeding the limit, we will take less action than if you're exceeding by 200%. Limit metrics are only visible if you're sending data in to a corresponding dataType or limitName API. For example, if you send in data via the Metric API, you’ll see the Metric API resource metrics, but if you don't send any APM data in, you won't see APM resource metrics. Tip Impact metrics will be generated regardless of impact; if there's no impact, you’ll see a 0. An NrIntegrationError event is generated when you experience impact and is a good way to quickly see if you’re experiencing any limit events. See View System Limits for more information. Create a dashboard to view your limit status Using three limit metrics together on a dashboard, you can quickly see detailed visuals of your Ingest Resource Request Per Minute limits, and with NrIntegrationError get a view into more limits. Dashboard displaying limits status using a handful of queries. We used the following queries to create this dashboard. To make a dashboard like this in New Relic One, select Dashboards, and then Create a dashboard. Then, add a new chart for each query you want to regularly monitor. The three limits metrics included in these queries are described in a separate section, below. From left to right, top to bottom: Resource Consumption Limits as a % FROM Metric select rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.currentValue), 1 minute) /latest(newrelic.resourceConsumption.limitValue) * 100 facet limitName where limitTimeInterval = '1 minute' timeseries limit max Copy Max % Consumption in an hour SELECT max(`usage`) FROM (FROM Metric select rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.currentValue), 1 minute) / latest(newrelic.resourceConsumption.limitValue) * 100 as 'usage' facet limitName timeseries ) facet limitName limit max Copy APM Agent API transaction events request per minute FROM Metric select rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.currentValue), 1 minute) where limitName = 'APM Agent API transaction events requests per minute' TIMESERIES Copy Trace API With limit line FROM Metric select rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.currentValue), 1 minute) as 'usage', latest(newrelic.resourceConsumption.limitValue) as 'limit' where limitName = 'Trace API requests per minute' TIMESERIES Copy Impact FACET From Metric select rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.impact), 1 minute) facet dataType, impact, resource TIMESERIES 1 minute limit max Copy NrIntegrationError by limit FROM NrIntegrationError select count(*) facet limitName TIMESERIES MAX since 1 day ago limit max Copy Multi-Account limits (on time series charts only) If you want to see limits for multiple accounts on one chart: run this query from one of the accounts: FROM Metric select rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.currentValue), 1 minute) / latest(newrelic.resourceConsumption.limitValue) * 100 facet limitName, consumingAccountId where limitTimeInterval = '1 minute' timeseries limit max Copy Click Add another query. Select a different account. Then run this query again: FROM Metric select rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.currentValue), 1 minute) / latest(newrelic.resourceConsumption.limitValue) * 100 facet limitName, consumingAccountId where limitTimeInterval = '1 minute' timeseries limit max Copy Finally, save it. Limit list and NrIntegrationError FROM Metric, NrIntegrationError select rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.currentValue), 1 minute) as 'Per Minute Count',latest(newrelic.resourceConsumption.limitValue) as ' limit Value',(rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.currentValue), 1 minute)/latest(newrelic.resourceConsumption.limitValue)*100)as 'Percent Used', filter (count(*), where NrIntegrationError.limitValue is not null) as 'limit reached count' facet limitName limit 1000 Copy Limit metrics These metrics, used in the dashboard queries above, can hone in on a single limit or resource. Or, with the help of FACET limitName or resource provide a view across all your limits. newrelic.resourceConsumption.limitValue limitValue allows you to see the setting for a limit by limitName and understand more about what resource is linked to this limit. The following examples use the limit value metric in the query: Example for Metric API requests per minute. FROM Metric select latest(newrelic.resourceConsumption.limitValue) where limitName = 'Metric API requests per minute' Copy To show all limits, add FACET limitName and consider grouping by limitTimeInterval. FROM Metric select latest(newrelic.resourceConsumption.limitValue) WHERE limitTimeInterval = '1 minute' FACET limitName limit max Copy newrelic.resourceConsumption.currentValue currentValue shows you how much of a given resource you’re currently consuming. To get a better glimpse into how our systems are viewing your consumption, use a rate() function with the time period that aligns with the limitTimeInterval. Limit 200. Example for Metric API request per minute: FROM Metric select rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.currentValue),1 minute) where limitName = 'Metric API requests per minute' Copy To show all limits, add FACET limitName and consider grouping by limitTimeInterval. FROM Metric select rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.currentValue),1 minute) where limitTimeInterval = '1 minute' FACET limitName limit max Copy newrelic.resourceConsumption.impact impact lets you know for any given resource what impact limit events are having. Zeros mean you are not currently impacted. The most granular we have is dataType. It is possible for multiple instances of limitName to impact a single type, such as Metric RPM and DPM. If we know, we will display limitName. From Metric select rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.impact), 1 minute) facet dataType, resource, impact, limitName TIMESERIES limit max Copy Metric attributes Attributes on newrelic.resourceConsumption.limitValue and newrelic.resourceConsumption.currentValue: limitName - The Name of the limit for the metric data, i.e RPM Metric API. dataType - What kind of data the metric is tracking, i.e Metric, Log, or APM. Resource - What resource is being consumed, i.e. Requests, or DPM. limitTimeInterval - What time window this resource is evaluated for limiting. consumingAccountId - The New Relic account where the resource is being consumed. Attributes on newrelic.resourceConsumption.impact dataType - The kind of data that is being impacted, i.e Metric, Log, APM. Resource - What resource is being impacted, i.e Request Rate. Impact - A count of what is happening when resource has exceeded set limit, i.e dropped requests. consumingAccountId - The New Relic account where the resource is being consumed. Set alerts on resource metrics While building a dashboard to see all your limits is handy, being able to automate it is even better. You can set alerts on your limit metrics to provide updates on limits changes. Tip Because we currently only have metrics on 1 minute time windows, setting TimeWindow = 1 minute, will cover them all. Eventually, we make more metrics available, you might want to set separate alerts for limits that are enforced by different time windows. You can use the following NRQL queries to create alerts. Learn about creating alerts with NRQL queries here. Limits faceted by LimitName and scoped by Timewindow From Metric select (rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.currentValue), 1 minute)/latest(newrelic.resourceConsumption.limitValue))*100 facet limitName Copy Alert on a single limit From Metric select (rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.currentValue), 1 minute)/latest(newrelic.resourceConsumption.limitValue))*100 where limitName = 'my limit' Copy Alert on limit impact faceted by dataType, impact, resource, and reason From Metric select rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.impact), 1 minute) facet dataType, impact, resource, reason Copy Alert on impact of a single dataType From Metric select rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.impact), 1 minute) facet dataType, impact, resource, reason WHERE dataType = 'important things' Copy",

      "body": "The New Relic Insights query API is a REST API for making NRQL queries. Tip This API is no longer the preferred way to query New Relic data. Please use NerdGraph to do that. Requirements and recommendations This API is no longer the preferred way to query New Relic data. Please use NerdGraph to do that. Use of this API may be restricted by role-related user permissions. To add custom data to New Relic, you'd use our data ingest APIs. If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you are using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. 1. Register an API key To use the Insights query API, you need a query key. You can have multiple query keys, and any query key can be used to initiate any Insights API query. If you have multiple systems querying Insights or different data destinations, New Relic recommends you use multiple query keys to enhance data security. For security reasons, query keys cannot be altered or read using the API. To change or read a query key, use the New Relic UI. Tip This API is no longer the preferred way to query New Relic data. Please use NerdGraph to do that. To create a new query key: Go to insights.newrelic.com > Manage data > API keys. Select the plus icon next to the Query keys heading. Enter a short description of the key. Select Save your notes. 2. Create the API query request When you create or edit a query key, you will see an example curl query that you can use as a template. The example query won't work unless you follow these query rules: The NRQL query string must be URL-encoded. The query string must be less than 4000 bytes. The URL must contain a valid account ID. The X-Query-Key must contain a valid query key. The Content-Type must be application/json. Linux Here is a curl example: curl -H \"Accept: application/json\" -H \"X-Query-Key: YOUR_QUERY_KEY\" \"https://insights-api.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID/query?nrql=YOUR_URL_ENCODED_QUERY\" Copy Microsoft Windows You can use Powershell to query events via API: Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://insights-api.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID/query?nrql=YOUR_URL_ENCODED_QUERY -Headers @{\"X-Query-Key\"=\"YOUR_QUERY_KEY\"} -ContentType \"application/json\" -Method GET Copy 3. Process the returned JSON The query API returns results in JSON format. There is a limit of 2,000 results per request. The structure of the JSON data depends on the NRQL that you used in the request: Different combinations of SELECT statements, clauses, and functions each return an appropriate response. When writing your code to process the JSON, you should do a test run of your query and examine the resulting JSON. Example The Insights query API returns JSON data. Here's an example of a query, its query request format, and its returned data: Query, query API request, returned data Original NRQL query: SELECT count(appName) FROM PageView SINCE '2014-08-04 00:00:00+0500' Copy Query cURL request (with URL-encoded NRQL query): curl -H \"Accept: application/json\" -H \"X-Query-Key: YOUR_QUERY_KEY\" \"https://insights-api.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID/query?nrql=SELECT+count%28appName%29+FROM+PageView+SINCE+%272014-08-04+00%3A00%3A00%2B0500%27\" Copy Returned JSON data: { \"results\": [ { \"count\": 80275388 } ], \"metadata\": { \"eventTypes\": [ \"PageView\" ], \"eventType\": \"PageView\", \"openEnded\": true, \"beginTime\": \"2014-08-03T19:00:00Z\", \"endTime\": \"2017-01-18T23:18:41Z\", \"beginTimeMillis=\": 1407092400000, \"endTimeMillis\": 1484781521198, \"rawSince\": \"'2014-08-04 00:00:00+0500'\", \"rawUntil\": \"`now`\", \"rawCompareWith\": \"\", \"clippedTimeWindows\": { \"Browser\": { \"beginTimeMillis\": 1483571921198, \"endTimeMillis\": 1484781521198, \"retentionMillis\": 1209600000 } }, \"messages\": [], \"contents\": [ { \"function\": \"count\", \"attribute\": \"appName\", \"simple\": true } ] } } Copy Rate limiting guidelines We have query rate limits. You likely won't encounter these limits, especially if you follow these general guidelines: Limit the amount of requests with complex queries (for example, queries with FACET or TIMESERIES clauses, or queries of over a million events) run at the same time. Limit the amount of requests run concurrently over extended periods of time to a maximum of 5, especially if they include complex queries. If New Relic applies rate limits on your account for the number of queries per minute, the query API returns a 429 error. If New Relic applies rate limits on your account for records inspected, the query API returns a 503 error and your charts may display timeout error messages.",

      "body": "BETA FEATURE This feature is currently in beta. Dimensional metrics are an industry standard for storing and querying metric data. All infrastructure metrics are stored as event data in New Relic, but you can also query them through dimensional metrics. In this page you can learn: The benefits of dimensional metrics. A few examples on how and where to use them. Known issues. Why it matters At New Relic we report metrics in several ways, including dimensional metrics, which are used by our metric API, Telemetry SDK, some open-source integrations, and our infrastructure services. This type of metric enables you to: Enjoy an improved query experience for Infrastructure data. Discover all your metrics in one place. Tap into more metric sources, such as Prometheus. For example, the query to get the maximum duration of your Lambda functions is simplified: Query with samples FROM ServerlessSample SELECT max(provider.duration.Maximum) WHERE provider = 'LambdaFunction' Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT max(aws.lambda.function.duration) Copy Get started No agent or integration updates are required to use these metrics. NRQL alerting based on dimensional metrics is also supported, except for data coming from cloud integrations (that is metrics from AWS polling integrations, GCP, and Azure). AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams metrics are ingested as dimensional metrics and NRQL alerts are recommended. Where and how to query dimensional metrics All current NRQL query features are supported. Queries can use WHERE, FACET, and time selection functions such as SINCE, UNTIL, and COMPARE WITH. The query builder in New Relic One supports metrics in both simple and advanced (NRQL) mode. Naming conventions for metrics and attributes All metric names and attributes for dimensional metrics follow the same naming convention in order to make them easy to find and use. Metric and attribute names are namespaced with dots: for example, the host. prefix is used for host metrics, the k8s. prefix is used for Kubernetes metrics, and aws. is used for AWS metrics. The graphic below shows how a ProcessSample that contains three metrics (cpuPercent, ioTotalReadBytes, and ioTotalWriteBytes) is split into three separate metrics. Note the updated naming of the metrics and the attributes. Dimensional metrics naming convention Examples Here are some examples of NQRL queries with and without dimensional metrics: AWS EBS query example Get the total write time by EBS Volume. Query with samples FROM BlockDeviceSample SELECT sum('provider.volumeTotalWriteTime.Sum') WHERE provider = 'EbsVolume' FACET entityName Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT sum(aws.ebs.volume.TotalWriteTime) FACET entity.name Copy Azure Service bus query example Maximum number of messages in an Azure Service Bus topic by resource group. Query with samples FROM AzureServiceBusTopicSample SELECT max(activeMessages.Maximum) FACET resourceGroupName Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT max(azure.servicebus.topic.activeMessages) FACET azure.resourceGroup Copy Azure functions query example Number of function executions Azure Functions over the past 6 hours by region over time. Query with samples FROM AzureFunctionsAppSample SELECT sum(functionExecutionCount.Total) FACET regionName TIMESERIES SINCE 6 hours ago Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT sum(azure.functions.app.functionExecutionCount) FACET azure.region TIMESERIES SINCE 6 hours ago Copy Azure VMs query example Compare the number of Azure VMs over the past thirty minutes with the same time a week ago. Query with samples FROM AzureVirtualMachineScaleSetSample SELECT uniqueCount(vMName) FACET name SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO COMPARE WITH 1 WEEK AGO Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT uniqueCount(azure.vms.vmName) FACET azure.resourceName WHERE azure.resourceType='Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachineScaleSets' SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO COMPARE WITH 1 WEEK AGO Copy NGINX query example The average number of NGINX requests per second over time. Query with samples FROM NginxSample SELECT average(net.requestsPerSecond) TIMESERIES Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT average(nginx.server.net.requestsPerSecond) TIMESERIES Copy MySQL query example The maximum number of used MySQL connections. Query with samples FROM MysqlSample SELECT max(net.maxUsedConnections) Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT max(mysql.node.net.maxUsedConnections) Copy Known limitations Metric queries with * do not return Infrastructure sample data (for example, SELECT * FROM Metric). In order to select attributes starting with tags. a metric name has to be provided. For example, SELECT uniques(tags.environment) FROM Metric WHERE metricName='aws.lambda.function.duration' does not work without the WHERE clause. Results may not be complete if the selection criteria matches too many samples. For example, SELECT uniqueCount(entity.guid) FROM Metric maps to all Infrastructure samples, and may return incomplete results. Initially there is no support for the newly introduced metric wildcarding feature (for example, SELECT average(host.swap%Bytes) FROM Metric).",

      "body": "NRQL is a query language you can use to query the New Relic database. This document explains NRQL syntax, clauses, components, and functions. Syntax This document is a reference for the functions and clauses used in a NRQL query. Other resources for understanding NRQL: Intro to NRQL: explains what NRQL is used for, what data you can query with it, and basic NRQL syntax Examine NRQL queries used to build New Relic charts Learn how to query the Metric data type Simulate SQL JOIN functions Use funnels to evaluate a series of related data Format NRQL for querying with the Event API Query components Every NRQL query will begin with a SELECT statement or a FROM clause. All other clauses are optional. The clause definitions below also contain example NRQL queries. Required clauses Required: SELECT statement SELECT attribute ... Copy SELECT function(attribute) ... Copy The SELECT specifies what portion of a data type you want to query by specifying an attribute or a function. It's followed by one or more arguments separated by commas. In each argument you can: Get the values of all available attributes by using * as a wildcard. For example: SELECT * from Transaction. Get values associated with a specified attribute or multiple attributes specified in a comma separated list. Get aggregated values from specified attributes by selecting an aggregator function. Label the results returned in each argument with the AS clause. You can also use SELECT with basic math functions. Avg response time since last week This query returns the average response time since last week. SELECT average(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy Required: FROM clause SELECT ... FROM data type ... Copy Use the FROM clause to specify the data type you wish to query. You can start your query with FROM or with SELECT. You can merge values for the same attributes across multiple data types in a comma separated list. Query one data type This query returns the count of all APM transactions over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction SINCE 3 days ago Copy Query multiple data types This query returns the count of all APM transactions and browser events over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, PageView SINCE 3 days ago Copy Optional clauses AS clause SELECT ... AS 'label' ... Copy Use the AS clause to label an attribute, aggregator, step in a funnel, or the result of a math function with a string delimited by single quotes. The label is used in the resulting chart. Query using math function and AS This query returns the number of page views per session: SELECT count(*)/uniqueCount(session) AS 'Pageviews per Session' FROM PageView Copy Query using funnel and AS This query returns a count of people who have visited both the main page and the careers page of a site over the past week: SELECT funnel(SESSION, WHERE name='Controller/about/main' AS 'Step 1', WHERE name = 'Controller/about/careers' AS 'Step 2') FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy COMPARE WITH clause SELECT ... (SINCE or UNTIL) (integer units) AGO COMPARE WITH (integer units) AGO ... Copy Use the COMPARE WITH clause to compare the values for two different time ranges. COMPARE WITH requires a SINCE or UNTIL statement. The time specified by COMPARE WITH is relative to the time specified by SINCE or UNTIL. For example, SINCE 1 day ago COMPARE WITH 1 day ago compares yesterday with the day before. The time range for theCOMPARE WITH value is always the same as that specified by SINCE or UNTIL. For example, SINCE 2 hours ago COMPARE WITH 4 hours ago might compare 3:00pm through 5:00pm against 11:00am through 1:00pm. COMPARE WITH can be formatted as either a line chart or a billboard: With TIMESERIES, COMPARE WITH creates a line chart with the comparison mapped over time. Without TIMESERIES, COMPARE WITH generates a billboard with the current value and the percent change from the COMPARE WITH value. Example: This query returns data as a line chart showing the 95th percentile for the past hour compared to the same range one week ago. First as a single value, then as a line chart. SELECT percentile(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago COMPARE WITH 1 week AGO SELECT percentile(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago COMPARE WITH 1 week AGO TIMESERIES AUTO Copy EXTRAPOLATE clause You can use this clause with these data types: Transaction TransactionError Custom events reported via APM agent APIs The purpose of EXTRAPOLATE is to mathematically compensate for the effects of APM agent sampling of event data so that query results more closely represent the total activity in your system. This clause will be useful when a APM agent reports so many events that it often passes its harvest cycle reporting limits. When that occurs, the agent begins to sample events. When EXTRAPOLATE is used in a NRQL query that supports its use, the ratio between the reported events and the total events is used to extrapolate a close approximation of the total unsampled data. When it is used in a NRQL query that doesn’t support its use or that hasn’t used sampled data, it has no effect. Important Note that EXTRAPOLATE is most useful for homogenous data (like throughput or error rate). It's not effective when attempting to extrapolate a count of distinct things (like uniqueCount() or uniques()). This clause works only with NRQL queries that use one of the following aggregator functions: apdex average count histogram sum percentage (if function it takes as an argument supports EXTRAPOLATE) rate (if function it takes as an argument supports EXTRAPOLATE) stddev Example of extrapolating throughput A query that will show the extrapolated throughput of a service named interestingApplication. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction WHERE appName='interestingApplication' SINCE 60 minutes ago EXTRAPOLATE Copy Example of extrapolating throughput as a time series A query that will show the extrapolated throughput of a service named interestingApplication by transaction name, displayed as a time series. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction WHERE appName='interestingApplication' SINCE 60 minutes ago FACET name TIMESERIES 1 minute EXTRAPOLATE Copy FACET clause SELECT ... FACET attribute ... Copy Use FACET to separate and group your results by attribute values. For example, you could FACET your PageView data by deviceType to figure out what percentage of your traffic comes from mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. Use the LIMIT clause to specify how many facets appear (default is 10). For more complex grouping, use FACET CASES. FACET clauses support up to five attributes, separated by commas. The facets are sorted in descending order by the first field you provide in the SELECT clause. If you are faceting on attributes with more than 2,000 unique values, a subset of facet values is selected and sorted according to the query type. When selecting min(), max(), or count(), FACET uses those functions to determine how facets are picked and sorted. When selecting any other function, FACET uses the frequency of the attribute you are faceting on to determine how facets are picked and sorted. Faceted query using count() This query shows cities with the highest pageview counts. This query uses the total number of pageviews per city to determine how facets are picked and ordered. SELECT count(*) FROM PageView FACET city Copy Faceted query using uniqueCount() This query shows the cities that access the highest number of unique URLs. This query uses the total number of times a particular city appears in the results to determine how facets are picked and ordered. SELECT uniqueCount(pageUrl) FROM PageView FACET city Copy Grouping results across time Advanced segmentation and cohort analysis allow you to facet on bucket functions to more effectively break out your data. Cohort analysis is a way to group results together based on timestamps. You can separate them into buckets that cover a specified range of dates and times. FACET ... AS clause Use FACET ... AS to name facets using the AS keyword in queries. This clause is helpful for adding clearer or simplified names for facets in your results. It can also be used to rename facets in nested aggregation queries. FACET ... AS queries will change the facet names in results (when they appear as headers in tables, for example), but not the actual facet names themselves. FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) FACET response.headers.contentType AS 'content type' Copy FACET CASES clause SELECT ... FACET CASES ( WHERE attribute operator value, WHERE attribute operator value, ... ) ... Copy Use FACET CASES to break out your data by more complex conditions than possible with FACET. Separate multiple conditions with a comma ,. For example, you could query your PageView data and FACET CASES into categories like less than 1 second, from 1 to 10 seconds, and greater than 10 seconds. You can combine multiple attributes within your cases, and label the cases with the AS selector. Data points will be added to at most one facet case, the first facet case that they match. You may also use a time function with your attribute, and you can use the OR operator to facet results that don't match any of your specified cases. Basic usage with WHERE SELECT count(*) FROM PageView FACET CASES (WHERE duration < 1, WHERE duration > 1 and duration < 10, WHERE duration > 10) Copy Group based on multiple attributes This example groups results into one bucket where the transaction name contains login, and another where the URL contains login and a custom attribute indicates that the user was a paid user: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid') Copy Label groups with AS This example uses the AS selector to give your results a human-readable name: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%' AS 'Total Logins', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid' AS 'Feature Visits from Paid Users') Copy Facet non-matching data with OR This example uses the OR operator to facet results that didn't match any of your cases: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid') OR name Copy FACET ... ORDER BY clause In NRQL, the default is for the first aggregation in the SELECT clause to guide the selection of facets in a query. FACET ... ORDER BY allows you to override this default behavior by adding an aggregate function with the ORDER BY modifier to specify how facets are selected. Specifically, the clause will override the priority by which facets are chosen to be in the final result before being limited by the LIMIT clause. This clause can be used in querying but not for alerts or streaming. This example shows how to use FACET ... ORDER BY to find the average durations of app transactions, showing the top 10 (default limit) highest durations by apps which have the highest response size. In this case, if FACET ... ORDER BY is not used, the query results will instead show the top 10 by highest durations, with response size being irrelevant to the app selection. FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) TIMESERIES FACET appName ORDER BY max(responseSize) Copy Tip Because the operations are performed before the LIMIT clause is applied, FACET ... ORDER BY does not impact the sort of the final query results, which will be particularly noticeable in the results for non-timeseries queries. Important The ORDER BY modifier in this case works differently than the ORDER BY clause. When parsing queries that follow the format FACET attribute1 ORDER BY attribute2, New Relic will read these as FACET ... ORDER BY queries, but only if ORDER BY appears immediately after FACET. Otherwise ORDER BY will be interpreted by New Relic as a clause. LIMIT clause SELECT ... LIMIT count ... Copy Use the LIMIT clause to control the maximum number of facet values returned by FACET queries or the maximum number of items returned by SELECT * queries. This clause takes a single integer value as an argument. If the LIMIT clause is not specified, or no value is provided, the limit defaults to 10 for FACET queries and 100 in the case of SELECT * queries. The maximum allowed value for the LIMIT clause is 2,000. Query using LIMIT This query shows the top 20 countries by session count and provides 95th percentile of response time for each country for Windows users only. SELECT uniqueCount(session), percentile(duration, 95) FROM PageView WHERE userAgentOS = 'Windows' FACET countryCode LIMIT 20 SINCE YESTERDAY Copy OFFSET clause SELECT ... LIMIT count OFFSET count ... Copy Use the OFFSET clause with LIMIT to control the portion of rows returned by SELECT * or SELECT column queries. Like the LIMIT clause, OFFSET takes a single integer value as an argument. OFFSET sets the number of rows to be skipped before the selected rows of your query are returned. This is constrained by LIMIT. OFFSET rows are skipped starting from the most recent record. For example, the query SELECT interestingValue FROM Minute_Report LIMIT 5 OFFSET 1 returns the last 5 values from Minute_Report except for the most recent one. ORDER BY clause The ORDER BY clause allows you to specify how you want to sort your query results in queries that select event attributes by row. This query orders transactions by duration. FROM Transaction SELECT appName, duration ORDER BY duration Copy The default sort order is ascending, but this can be changed by adding the ASC or DESC modifiers. SHOW EVENT TYPES clause SHOW EVENT TYPES... Copy SHOW EVENT TYPES will return a list of all the data types present in your account for a specific time range. It is used as the first clause in a query instead of SELECT. Important In this context, \"event types\" refers to the data types you can access with a NRQL query. Data types in the last day This query will return all the data types present over the past day: SHOW EVENT TYPES SINCE 1 day ago Copy SINCE clause SELECT ... SINCE [numerical units AGO | phrase] ... Copy The default value is 1 hour ago. Use the SINCE clause to define the beginning of a time range for the returned data. When using NRQL, you can set a UTC timestamp or relative time range. You can specify a timezone for the query but not for the results. NRQL results are based on your system time. SLIDE BY clause The SLIDE BY clause supports a feature known as sliding windows. With sliding windows,SLIDE BY data is gathered into \"windows\" of time that overlap with each other. These windows can help to smooth out line graphs with a lot of variation in cases where the rolling aggregate (such as a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. To use SLIDE BY, place it in a query after the TIMESERIES clause. For example, this query pulls data in 5-minute windows with a 1-minute SLIDE BY interval, meaning that each window lasts 5 minutes, but window 1 starts at 0 minutes, window 2 starts at 1 minute, window 3 starts at 2 minutes, and so on. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY 1 minute Copy To learn more about how and when you can use SLIDE BY, see Create smoother charts with sliding windows. Use SLIDE BY with MAX or AUTO interval You can use sliding windows in combination with MAX or AUTO. However, MAX or AUTO may not be placed between TIMESERIES and SLIDE BY. This query will automatically decide a SLIDE BY window interval. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY AUTO Copy This query will set the SLIDE BY window to the maximum interval granularity. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY MAX Copy Important The SLIDE BY value as determined by AUTO or MAX can produce a step interval greater than the window size, which can cause gaps and unexpected results. TIMESERIES clause SELECT ... TIMESERIES integer units ... Copy Use the TIMESERIES clause to return data as a time series broken out by a specified period of time. Since TIMESERIES is used to trigger certain charts, there is no default value. To indicate the time range, use integer units. For example: TIMESERIES 1 minute TIMESERIES 30 minutes TIMESERIES 1 hour TIMESERIES 30 seconds TIMESERIES can be combined with arguments such as MAX, AUTO, and SLIDE BY to further tailor query results, as shown in the examples below. Important For functions such as average( ) or percentile( ), a large aggregation window can have a significant smoothing effect on outliers. This is true whether or not the query makes use of sliding windows. Use a set interval The value provided indicates the units used to break out the graph. For example, to present a one-day graph showing 30 minute increments: SELECT ... SINCE 1 day AGO TIMESERIES 30 minutes Copy Use an automatically set interval TIMESERIES can also be set to AUTO, which will divide your graph into a reasonable number of divisions. For example, a daily chart will be divided into 30 minute intervals and a weekly chart will be divided into 6 hour intervals. This query returns data as a line chart showing the 50th and 90th percentile of client-side transaction time for one week with a data point every 6 hours. SELECT average(duration), percentile(duration, 50, 90) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week AGO TIMESERIES AUTO Copy Use MAX interval You can set TIMESERIES to MAX, which will automatically adjust your time window to the maximum number of intervals allowed for a given time period. This allows you to update your time windows without having to manually update your TIMESERIES buckets and ensures your time window is being split into the peak number of intervals allowed. The maximum number of TIMESERIES buckets that will be returned is 366. For example, the following query creates 4-minute intervals, which is the ceiling for a daily chart. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction since 1 day ago TIMESERIES MAX Copy UNTIL clause SELECT ... UNTIL integer units AGO ... Copy The default value is NOW. Only use UNTIL to specify an end point other than the default. Use the UNTIL clause to define the end of a time range across which to return data. Once a time range has been specified, the data will be preserved and can be reviewed after the time range has ended. See Use the time picker to adjust time settings for detailed information and examples. WHERE clause Use the WHERE clause to filter results. NRQL returns the results that fulfill the condition(s) you specify in the clause. SELECT function(attribute) ... WHERE attribute [operator 'value' | IN ('value' [, 'value]) | IS [NOT] NULL ] [AND|OR ...] ... Copy If you specify more than one condition, separate the conditions by the operators AND or OR. If you want to simulate a SQL join, use custom attributes in a WHERE or FACET clause. Operators that the WHERE clause accepts Description =, !=, <, <=, >, >= NRQL accepts standard comparison operators. Example: state = 'WA' AND Used to define an intersection of two conditions. OR Used to define a union of two conditions. IS NULL Determines if an attribute has a null value. IS NOT NULL Determines if an attribute does not have a null value. IN Determines if the string value of an attribute is in a specified set. Using this method yields better performance than stringing together multiple WHERE clauses. Example: animalType IN ('cat', 'dog', 'fish') NOT IN Determines if the string value of an attribute is not in a specified set. Using this method yields better performance than stringing together multiple WHERE clauses. Values must be in parentheses, separated by commas. For example: SELECT * FROM PageView WHERE countryCode NOT IN ('CA', 'WA') Copy LIKE Determines if an attribute contains a specified sub-string. The string argument for the LIKE operator accepts the percent sign (%) as a wildcard anywhere in the string. If the substring does not begin or end the string you are matching against, the wildcard must begin or end the string. Examples: userAgentName LIKE 'IE%' IE IE Mobile userAgentName LIKE 'o%a%' Opera Opera Mini userAgentName LIKE 'o%a' Opera userAgentName LIKE '%o%a%' Opera Opera Mini Mozilla Gecko NOT LIKE Determines if an attribute does not contain a specified sub-string. RLIKE Determines if an attribute contains a specified Regex sub-string. Uses RE2 syntax. Examples: appName RLIKE r'z.*|q.*'' hostname RLIKE r'ip-10-351-[0-2]?[0-9]-.*' z-app q-app ip-10-351-19-237 ip-10-351-2-41 ip-10-351-24-238 ip-10-351-14-15 Important Regex defaults to full-string matching, therefore ^ and $ are implicit and you do not need to add them. NOT RLIKE Determines if an attribute does not contain a specified Regex sub-string. Uses RE2 syntax. Example query with three conditions This query returns the browser response time for pages with checkout in the URL for Safari users in the United States and Canada over the past 24 hours. SELECT histogram(duration, 50, 20) FROM PageView WHERE countryCode IN ('CA', 'US') AND userAgentName='Safari' AND pageUrl LIKE '%checkout%' SINCE 1 day ago Copy WITH METRIC_FORMAT clause For information on querying metric data, see Query metrics. WITH TIMEZONE clause SELECT ... WITH TIMEZONE (selected zone) ... Copy By default, query results are displayed in the timezone of the browser you're using. Use the WITH TIMEZONE clause to select a time zone for a date or time in the query that hasn't already had a time zone specified for it. For example, the query clause SINCE Monday UNTIL Tuesday WITH TIMEZONE 'America/New_York' will return data recorded from Monday at midnight, Eastern Standard Time, until midnight Tuesday, Eastern Standard Time.

Query metric data Metric data is more complex than other types of data. There are specific tips for querying it well. We have two types of metric data, each with their own query guidelines: Query dimensional metrics, which are reported by our Metric API and by some of our tools that use that API, like our Telemetry SDKs and our open-source telemetry integrations (OpenTelemetry, Kamon, Micrometer, more). Query metric timeslice data, which is our original metric data type reported by our APM, mobile monitoring, and browser monitoring. For more on understanding these data types, see Metric data types. Functions In this section we explain NRQL functions, both aggregator functions and non-aggregator functions. Aggregator functions You can use aggregator functions to filter and aggregate data. Some tips for using these: See New Relic University tutorials for Filter queries, Apdex queries, and Percentile queries. Or, go to the full online course Writing NRQL queries. If you're using an aggregator function multiple times in the same query (e.g., SELECT median(one_metric</var>), median(another_metric)), it can cause problems in displaying results. To solve this, use the AS function. For example: SELECT median(one_metric) as 'med-a', median(another_metric) as 'med-b' Data type \"coercion\" is not supported. Read about available type conversion functions. For how to display results over time, see Group results over time. Examples: SELECT histogram(duration, 10, 20) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy aggregationendtime() Use the aggregationendtime() function to return the time of the relevant aggregation. More specifically, for a given aggregate, the aggregationendtime() function provides the timestamp of the end of the time period of that aggregation. For example, in a timeseries query, for a data point that encompasses an hour’s worth of data, the function would return the timestamp of the end of that hour period. apdex(attribute, t: ) Use the apdex function to return an Apdex score for a single transaction or for all your transactions. The attribute can be any attribute based on response time, such as duration or backendDuration. The t: argument defines an Apdex T threshold in seconds. The Apdex score returned by the apdex( ) function is based only on execution time. It does not account for APM errors. If a transaction includes an error but completes in Apdex T or less, that transaction will be rated satisfying by the apdex ( ) function. Get Apdex for specific customers If you have defined custom attributes, you can filter based on those attributes. For example, you could monitor the Apdex for a particularly important customer: SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.4) FROM Transaction WHERE customerName='ReallyImportantCustomer' SINCE 1 day ago Copy Get Apdex for specific transaction Use the name attribute to return a score for a specific transaction, or return an overall Apdex by omitting name. This query returns an Apdex score for the Controller/notes/index transaction over the last hour: The apdex function returns an Apdex score that measures user satisfaction with your site. Arguments are a response time attribute and an Apdex T threshold in seconds. SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.5) from Transaction WHERE name='Controller/notes/index' SINCE 1 hour ago Copy Get overall Apdex for your app This example query returns an overall Apdex for the application over the last three weeks: SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.08) FROM Transaction SINCE 3 week ago Copy average(attribute) Use the average( ) function to return the average value for an attribute. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. buckets(attribute, ceiling [,number of buckets]) Use the buckets() function to aggregate data split up by a FACET clause into buckets based on ranges. You can bucket by any attribute that is stored as a numerical value in the New Relic database. It takes three arguments: Attribute name Maximum value of the sample range. Any outliers will appear in the final bucket. Total number of buckets For more information and examples, see Split your data into buckets. bucketPercentile(attribute) The bucketPercentile( ) function is the NRQL equivalent of the histogram_quantile function in Prometheus. It is intended to be used with dimensional metric data. Instead of the quantile, New Relic returns the percentile, which is the quantile * 100. Use the bucketPercentile( ) function to calculate the quantile from the histogram data in a Prometheus format. It takes the bucket name as an argument and reports percentiles along the bucket's boundaries: SELECT bucketPercentile(duration_bucket) FROM Metric SINCE 1 day ago Copy Optionally, you can add percentile specifications as an argument: SELECT bucketPercentile(duration_bucket, 50, 75, 90) FROM Metric SINCE 1 day ago Copy Because multiple metrics are used to make up Prometheus histogram data, you must query for specific Prometheus metrics in terms of the associated <basename>. For example, to compute percentiles from a Prometheus histogram, with the <basename> prometheus_http_request_duration_seconds using NRQL, use bucketPercentile(prometheus_http_request_duration_seconds_bucket, 50). Note how _ bucket is added to the end of the <basename> as a suffix. See the Prometheus.io documentation for more information. cardinality(attribute) Use the cardinality( ) function to obtain the number of combinations of all the dimensions (attributes) on a metric. It takes three arguments, all optional: Metric name: if present, cardinality( ) only computes the metric specified. Include: if present, the include list restricts the cardinality computation to those attributes. Exclude: if present, the exclude list causes those attributes to be ignored in the cardinality computation. SELECT cardinality(metric_name, include:{attribute_list}, exclude:{attribute_list}) Copy count(*) Use the count( ) function to return a count of available records. It takes a single argument; either *, an attribute, or a constant value. Currently, it follows typical SQL behavior and counts all records that have values for its argument. Since count(*) does not name a specific attribute, the results will be formatted in the default \"humanize\" format. derivative(attribute [,time interval]) derivative() finds the rate of change for a given dataset. The rate of change is calculated using a linear least-squares regression to approximate the derivative. Since this calculation requires comparing more than one datapoint, if only one datapoint is included in the evaluation range, the calculation is indeterminate and won't work, resulting in a null value. The time interval is the period for which the rate of change is calculated. For example, derivative(attributeName, 1 minute) will return the rate of change per minute. dimensions(include: {attributes}, exclude: {attributes}) Use the dimensions( ) function to return all the dimensional values on a data type. You can explicitly include or exclude specific attributes using the optional arguments: Include: if present, the include list limits dimensions( ) to those attributes. Exclude: if present, the dimensions( ) calculation ignores those attributes. FROM Metric SELECT count(node_filesystem_size) TIMESERIES FACET dimensions() Copy When used with a FACET clause, dimensions( ) produces a unique timeseries for all facets available on the event type, similar to how Prometheus behaves with non-aggregated queries. latestrate(attribute, time interval) Use the latestrate( ) function to return the rate of change of a value based on the last 2 data points. It takes the attribute in question as the first argument and the unit of time for the resulting rate as the second argument. The function returns a result in units of change in attribute/time interval. This function can be useful to provide the most recent rate of change for an attribute in order to see leading-edge trends. Get the most recent rate of change of PageView Duration This query returns the rate of change of duration based on the last 2 data points. It will be returned in units of duration/second because of the 1 SECOND argument. SELECT latestrate(duration, 1 SECOND) FROM PageView Copy max(attribute) Use the max( ) function to return the maximum recorded value of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. median(attribute) Use the median( ) function to return an attribute's median, or 50th percentile. For more information about percentile queries, see percentile(). Tip The median( ) query is only available when using the query builder. Median query This query will generate a line chart for the median value. SELECT median(duration) FROM PageView TIMESERIES AUTO Copy min(attribute) Use the min( ) function to return the minimum recorded value of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. minuteOf(attribute) Use the minuteOf() function to extract only the minute portion (i.e. 0-59) of an attribute holding a valid timestamp value. mod(attribute, divisor) Use the mod( ) function to return the floor modulus after dividing the value of the provided numeric attribute (the first argument, or dividend) by a numeric value (the second argument, or divisor). This modulo operation can be used within a WHERE clause condition to filter to an arbitrary subset of results or within a FACET clause as a way to subdivide the result set. mod() within a WHERE clause condition FROM Transaction SELECT * WHERE mod(port, 2) = 1 Copy mod() within a FACET clause FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT uniques(hostId, 10000) SINCE 1 day AGO FACET mod(hostId, 10) Copy percentage(function(attribute), WHERE condition) Use the percentage( ) function to return the percentage of a target data set that matches some condition. The first argument requires an aggregator function against the desired attribute. Use exactly two arguments (arguments after the first two will be ignored). If the attribute is not numeric, this function returns a value of 100%. percentile(attribute [, percentile [, ...]]) Use the percentile( ) function to return an attribute's approximate value at a given percentile. It requires an attribute and can take any number of arguments representing percentile points. The percentile() function enables percentiles to displays with up to three digits after the decimal point, providing greater precision. Percentile thresholds may be specified as decimal values, but be aware that for most data sets, percentiles closer than 0.1 from each other will not be resolved. Percentile display examples Use TIMESERIES to generate a line chart with percentiles mapped over time. Omit TIMESERIES to generate a billboard and attribute sheet showing aggregate values for the percentiles. If no percentiles are listed, the default is the 95th percentile. To return only the 50th percentile value, the median, you can also use median(). Basic percentile query This query will generate a line chart with lines for the 5th, 50th, and 95th percentile. SELECT percentile(duration, 5, 50, 95) FROM PageView TIMESERIES AUTO Copy predictLinear(attribute, [,time interval]) predictLinear() is an extension of the derivative() function. It uses a similar method of least-squares linear regression to predict the future values for a dataset. The time interval is how far the query will look into the future. For example, predictLinear(attributeName, 1 hour) is a linear prediction 1 hour into the future of the query time window. Generally, predictLinear() is helpful for continuously growing values like disk space, or predictions on large trends. Since predictLinear() is a linear regression, familiarity with the dataset being queried helps to ensure accurate long-term predictions. Any dataset which grows exponentially, logarithmically, or by other nonlinear means will likely only be successful in very short-term predictions. New Relic recommends against using predictLinear in TIMESERIES queries. This is because each bucket will be making an individual prediction based on its relative timeframe within the query, meaning that such queries will not show predictions from the end of the timeseries forward. rate(function(attribute) [,time interval]) Use the rate( ) function to visualize the frequency or rate of a given query per time interval. For example, you might want to know the number of pageviews per minute over an hour-long period or the count of unique sessions on your site per hour over a day-long period. Use TIMESERIES to generate a line chart with rates mapped over time. Omit TIMESERIES to generate a billboard showing a single rate value averaged over time. Basic rate query This query will generate a line chart showing the rate of throughput for APM transactions per 10 minutes over the past 6 hours. SELECT rate(count(*), 10 minute) FROM Transaction SINCE 6 hours ago TIMESERIES Copy round(attribute) Use the round( ) function to return the rounded value of an attribute. Optionally round( ) can take a second argument, to_nearest, to round the first argument to the closest multiple of the second one. to_nearest can be fractional. SELECT round(n [, to_nearest]) Copy stddev(attribute) Use the stddev( ) function to return one standard deviation for a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. stdvar(attribute) Use the stdvar( ) function to return the standard variance for a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. sum(attribute) Use the sum( ) function to return the sum recorded values of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. uniqueCount(attribute) Use the uniqueCount( ) function to return the number of unique values recorded for an attribute over the time range specified. Tip To optimize query performance, this function returns approximate results for queries that inspect more than 256 unique values. uniques(attribute [,limit]) Use the uniques( ) function to return a list of unique values recorded for an attribute over the time range specified. When used along with the facet clause, a list of unique attribute values will be returned per each facet value. The limit parameter is optional. When it is not provided, the default limit of 1,000 unique attribute values per facet is applied. You may specify a different limit value, up to a maximum of 10,000. The uniques( ) function will return the first set of unique attribute values discovered, until the limit is reached. Therefore, if you have 5,000 unique attribute values in your data set, and the limit is set to 1,000, the operator will return the first 1,000 unique values that it discovers, regardless of their frequency. The maximum number of values that can be returned in a query result is the product of the uniques( ) limit times the facet limit. In the following query, the theoretical maximum number of values that can be returned is 5 million (5,000 x 1,000). Depending on the data set being queried, and the complexity of the query, memory protection limits may prevent a very large query from being executed. From Transaction SELECT uniques(host,5000) FACET appName LIMIT 1000 Copy Using tuple If you'd like to know the unique combinations of a handful of attributes, you can structure a query in the format SELECT uniques(tuple(x, y, ... z)) ...` to get all the unique tuples of values, to maintain their relationship. In the following query, tuple is used on index and cellName together to find uniques where those two values occur in combination. FROM NodeStatus SELECT uniques(tuple(index, cellName), 5) Copy capture(attribute, regular expression) Use the capture() to extract values from an attribute using a regular expression. Uses RE2 syntax. It takes two arguments: Attribute name Regular expression with capture syntax. Regex expressions in NRQL use Python-like syntax, r'...'. When capturing, use the RE2 named-capture syntax ...(?P<name> pattern )... to capture the contained pattern, given the specified name. Currently, only 1 capture group is supported. Please see the examples below. capture() within a SELECT clause condition The following will select the domain name of the website, removing https:// and any paths following the .com SELECT capture(pageUrl, r'https://(?P<baseUrl>.*.com)/.+') FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago Copy The following will capture only the first word of the error message. SELECT capture(errorMessage, r'(?P<firstWord>\\S+)\\s.+') FROM Transaction SINCE 1 hour ago where errorMessage is not null Copy capture() within a FACET clause condition The following will facet by the captured HTTP method. SELECT count(*) FROM Log WHERE message like '%HTTP%' FACET capture(message, r'.* \"(?P<httpMethod>[A-Z]+) .*') Copy capture() within a WHERE clause condition The following will filter the results based on Log events with message attribute that matches the regular expression where the captured job name is ExampleJob. SELECT message FROM Log WHERE capture(message, r'.*Job Failed: (?P<jobName>[A-Za-z]+),.*') = 'ExampleJob' SINCE 10 minutes ago Copy capture() with a numeric cast The following will capture sum of CPU Time from log lines. You must explicitly cast to numeric to do mathematical operations. SELECT sum(numeric(capture(message, r'.*CpuTime:\\s(?P<cpuTime>\\d+)'))) FROM Log WHERE message like '%CpuTime:%' SINCE 1 hour ago Copy Non-aggregator functions Use non-aggregator functions for non-numerical data in NRQL queries. earliest(attribute) Use the earliest( ) function to return the earliest value for an attribute over the specified time range. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If used in conjunction with a FACET it will return the most recent value for an attribute for each of the resulting facets. Get earliest country per user agent from PageView This query returns the earliest country code per each user agent from the PageView event. SELECT earliest(countryCode) FROM PageView FACET userAgentName Copy eventType() ...WHERE eventType() = 'EventNameHere'... ...FACET eventType()... Copy Use the eventType() function in a FACET clause to break out results by the selected data type or in a WHERE clause to filter results to a specific data type. This is particularly useful for targeting specific data types with the filter() and percentage() functions. Important In this context, \"event type\" refers to the types of data you can access with a NRQL query. Use eventType() in filter() function This query returns the percentage of total TransactionError results out of the total Transaction results. You can use the eventType() function to target specific types of data with the filter() function. SELECT 100 * filter(count(*), where eventType() = 'TransactionError') / filter(count(*), where eventType() = 'Transaction') FROM Transaction, TransactionError WHERE appName = 'App.Prod' TIMESERIES 2 Minutes SINCE 6 hours ago Copy Use eventType() with FACET This query displays a count of how many records each data type (Transaction and TransactionError) returns. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, TransactionError FACET eventType() TIMESERIES Copy filter(function(attribute), WHERE condition) Use the filter() function to limit the results for one of the aggregator functions in your SELECT statement. You can use filter() in conjunction with FACET or TIMESERIES. Filter is only useful when selecting multiple different aggregations such as SELECT filter(sum(x), WHERE attribute='a') AS 'A', filter(sum(x), WHERE attribute='b') AS 'B' .... Otherwise, it's better to just use the standard WHERE clause. Analyze purchases that used offer codes You could use filter() to compare the items bought in a set of transactions for those using an offer code versus those who aren't: Use the filter( ) function to limit the results for one of the aggregator functions in your SELECT statement. funnel(attribute, steps) Use the funnel() function to generate a funnel chart. It takes an attribute as its first argument. You then specify steps as WHERE clauses (with optional AS clauses for labels) separated by commas. For details and examples, see the funnels documentation. getField(attribute, field) Use the getField() function to extract a field from compound data types, such as metric data. It takes the following arguments: Metric type Supported fields summary count, total, max, min, type gauge count, total, max, min, latest, type distribution count, total, max, min, type counter count, type timeslice count, total, totalExclusive, min, and max Examples: SELECT max(getField(mySummary, count)) from Metric Copy SELECT sum(mySummary) from Metric where getField(mySummary, count) > 10 Copy histogram(attribute, ceiling [,number of buckets]) Use the histogram( ) function to generate histograms. It takes three arguments: Attribute name Maximum value of the sample range Total number of buckets (between 1 and 500, inclusive) Histogram of response times from PageView events This query results in a histogram of response times ranging up to 10 seconds over 20 buckets. SELECT histogram(duration, 10, 20) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy Prometheus histogram buckets histogram( ) accepts Prometheus histogram buckets: SELECT histogram(duration_bucket, 10, 20) FROM Metric SINCE 1 week ago Copy New Relic distribution metric histogram( ) accepts Distribution metric as an input: SELECT histogram(myDistributionMetric, 10, 20) FROM Metric SINCE 1 week ago Copy Histogram with a FACET clause Use histogram( ) with a FACET clause to generate a heatmap chart: SELECT histogram(duration) FROM PageView FACET appName SINCE 1 week ago Copy keyset() Using keyset() will allow you to see all of the attributes for a given data type over a given time range. It takes no arguments. It returns a JSON structure containing groups of string-typed keys, numeric-typed keys, boolean-typed keys, and all keys. See all attributes for a data type This query returns the attributes found for PageView events from the last day: SELECT keyset() FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago Copy latest(attribute) Use the latest( ) function to return the most recent value for an attribute over a specified time range. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If used in conjunction with a FACET it will return the most recent value for an attribute for each of the resulting facets. Get most recent country per user agent from PageView This query returns the most recent country code per each user agent from the PageView event. SELECT latest(countryCode) FROM PageView FACET userAgentName Copy Type conversion NRQL does not support \"coercion.\" This means that a float stored as a string is treated as a string and cannot be operated on by functions expecting float values. You can convert a string with a numeric value or a boolean with a string value to their numeric and boolean types with these functions: Use the numeric() function to convert a number with a string format to a numeric function. The function can be built into a query that uses math functions on query results or NRQL aggregator functions, such as average(). Use the boolean() function to convert a string value of \"true\" or \"false\" to the corresponding boolean value.",

      "body": "One way to query your New Relic data is with the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). This resource explains what NRQL is, when and how you can use it, and basic syntax rules. For more detailed information on querying, including a listing of clauses and functions and example queries, see NRQL syntax, clauses, and functions. What is NRQL? NRQL is New Relic's SQL-like query language. You can use NRQL to retrieve detailed New Relic data and get insight into your applications, hosts, and business-important activity. Reasons to use NRQL include: To answer a question for the purpose of troubleshooting or business analysis To create a new chart To make API queries of New Relic data (for example, using our NerdGraph API) NRQL is used behind the scenes to generate some New Relic charts: Some New Relic charts are built using NRQL. One way to start using NRQL is to view a chart's query and then edit it to make your own custom chart. Where can you use NRQL? You can use NRQL in these places: New Relic One query builder NerdGraph: our GraphQL-format API, which includes options for making NRQL queries one.newrelic.com > Query your data: You can run a NRQL query in New Relic One. This NRQL query shows a count of distributed tracing spans faceted by their entity names. NRQL is one of several ways to query New Relic data. For more on all query options, see Query your data. What data can you query with NRQL? NRQL allows you to query these New Relic data types: Event data from all New Relic products, including: APM events, like Transaction Browser monitoring events, like PageView Mobile monitoring events, like Mobile Infrastructure events, like ProcessSample Synthetics events, like SyntheticCheck Custom events, like those reported by the Event API Metric timeslice data (metrics reported by APM, browser, and mobile) The Metric data type (metrics reported by the Metric API and data sources that use that API) The Span data type (distributed tracing data) The Log data type (data from New Relic Logs) Tip Some data, like relationships between monitored entities, is not available via NRQL but is available using our NerdGraph API. Start using NRQL One way to start using NRQL and to understand what data you have available is to go to a NRQL interface (for example, the New Relic One query builder), type FROM, and press space. The interface will suggest available types of data: To see the attributes available for a specific data type, type FROM DATA_TYPE SELECT and press space. The interface will suggest available attributes. For example: To see the complete JSON associated with a data type, including all of its attributes, use the keyset() attribute. For example: FROM Transaction SELECT keyset() Copy NRQL is used behind the scenes to build some New Relic charts and dashboards. One way to learn NRQL is to find one of these NRQL-generated charts and start playing with the NRQL to create new, customized queries and charts: Charts built with NRQL will have View query as an option. You can then edit and customize that query to see how your changes affect the resulting visualization. Important To explore your data without having to use NRQL, use the data explorer. Learn more about querying data in New Relic. NRQL query examples Here's an example NRQL query of Transaction data, which is reported by APM. FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) FACET appName TIMESERIES auto Copy This would generate a chart that looks like: Here are some more query examples: Basic NRQL query of browser data Here's a NRQL query of PageView data from browser monitoring. SELECT uniqueCount(user) FROM PageView WHERE userAgentOS = 'Mac' FACET countryCode SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 20 Copy Attribute name with a space in it If a custom attribute name has a space in it, use backticks around the attribute name: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET `Logged-in user` Copy Querying multiple data sources To return data from two data sources, separate their data types with a comma. For example, this query returns a count of all APM transactions and browser events over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, PageView SINCE 3 days ago Copy Query returning multiple columns To return multiple columns from a dataset, separate the aggregator arguments with a comma: SELECT function(attribute), function(attribute) ... FROM ... Copy This query returns the minimum, average, and maximum duration for browser monitoring PageView events over the last week: SELECT min(duration), max(duration), average(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy See more NRQL query examples. NRQL syntax The syntax of a NRQL query is similar to standard SQL queries. Here is a breakdown of the structure of a NRQL query: SELECT function(attribute) [AS 'label'][, ...] FROM data type [WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...]][AS 'label'][, ...] [FACET attribute | function(attribute)] [LIMIT number] [SINCE time] [UNTIL time] [WITH TIMEZONE timezone] [COMPARE WITH time] [TIMESERIES time] Copy Basic rules include: NRQL condition Details Required values The SELECT statement and FROM clause are required. All other clauses are optional. You can start your query with either SELECT or FROM. Query string size The query string must be less than 4 KB. Case sensitivity The data type names and attribute names are case sensitive. NRQL clauses and functions are not case sensitive. Syntax for strings NRQL uses single quotes to designate strings. For example: ... where traceId = '030a573f0df02c57' Copy Attribute names with spaces Use backticks `` to quote a custom attribute name that has a space in it. For example: ... FACET `Logged-in user` Copy Data type coercion Insights does not support data type \"coercion.\" For more information, see Data type conversion. Use of math functions Basic and advanced math functions are supported in the SELECT statement. JOIN functions NRQL does not have the equivalent of the SQL JOIN function, but you can simulate a JOIN with custom attributes. Read more about NRQL syntax and functions.",

      "body": "BETA FEATURE This feature is currently in beta. Dimensional metrics are an industry standard for storing and querying metric data. All infrastructure metrics are stored as event data in New Relic, but you can also query them through dimensional metrics. In this page you can learn: The benefits of dimensional metrics. A few examples on how and where to use them. Known issues. Why it matters At New Relic we report metrics in several ways, including dimensional metrics, which are used by our metric API, Telemetry SDK, some open-source integrations, and our infrastructure services. This type of metric enables you to: Enjoy an improved query experience for Infrastructure data. Discover all your metrics in one place. Tap into more metric sources, such as Prometheus. For example, the query to get the maximum duration of your Lambda functions is simplified: Query with samples FROM ServerlessSample SELECT max(provider.duration.Maximum) WHERE provider = 'LambdaFunction' Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT max(aws.lambda.function.duration) Copy Get started No agent or integration updates are required to use these metrics. NRQL alerting based on dimensional metrics is also supported, except for data coming from cloud integrations (that is metrics from AWS polling integrations, GCP, and Azure). AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams metrics are ingested as dimensional metrics and NRQL alerts are recommended. Where and how to query dimensional metrics All current NRQL query features are supported. Queries can use WHERE, FACET, and time selection functions such as SINCE, UNTIL, and COMPARE WITH. The query builder in New Relic One supports metrics in both simple and advanced (NRQL) mode. Naming conventions for metrics and attributes All metric names and attributes for dimensional metrics follow the same naming convention in order to make them easy to find and use. Metric and attribute names are namespaced with dots: for example, the host. prefix is used for host metrics, the k8s. prefix is used for Kubernetes metrics, and aws. is used for AWS metrics. The graphic below shows how a ProcessSample that contains three metrics (cpuPercent, ioTotalReadBytes, and ioTotalWriteBytes) is split into three separate metrics. Note the updated naming of the metrics and the attributes. Dimensional metrics naming convention Examples Here are some examples of NQRL queries with and without dimensional metrics: AWS EBS query example Get the total write time by EBS Volume. Query with samples FROM BlockDeviceSample SELECT sum('provider.volumeTotalWriteTime.Sum') WHERE provider = 'EbsVolume' FACET entityName Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT sum(aws.ebs.volume.TotalWriteTime) FACET entity.name Copy Azure Service bus query example Maximum number of messages in an Azure Service Bus topic by resource group. Query with samples FROM AzureServiceBusTopicSample SELECT max(activeMessages.Maximum) FACET resourceGroupName Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT max(azure.servicebus.topic.activeMessages) FACET azure.resourceGroup Copy Azure functions query example Number of function executions Azure Functions over the past 6 hours by region over time. Query with samples FROM AzureFunctionsAppSample SELECT sum(functionExecutionCount.Total) FACET regionName TIMESERIES SINCE 6 hours ago Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT sum(azure.functions.app.functionExecutionCount) FACET azure.region TIMESERIES SINCE 6 hours ago Copy Azure VMs query example Compare the number of Azure VMs over the past thirty minutes with the same time a week ago. Query with samples FROM AzureVirtualMachineScaleSetSample SELECT uniqueCount(vMName) FACET name SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO COMPARE WITH 1 WEEK AGO Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT uniqueCount(azure.vms.vmName) FACET azure.resourceName WHERE azure.resourceType='Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachineScaleSets' SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO COMPARE WITH 1 WEEK AGO Copy NGINX query example The average number of NGINX requests per second over time. Query with samples FROM NginxSample SELECT average(net.requestsPerSecond) TIMESERIES Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT average(nginx.server.net.requestsPerSecond) TIMESERIES Copy MySQL query example The maximum number of used MySQL connections. Query with samples FROM MysqlSample SELECT max(net.maxUsedConnections) Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT max(mysql.node.net.maxUsedConnections) Copy Known limitations Metric queries with * do not return Infrastructure sample data (for example, SELECT * FROM Metric). In order to select attributes starting with tags. a metric name has to be provided. For example, SELECT uniques(tags.environment) FROM Metric WHERE metricName='aws.lambda.function.duration' does not work without the WHERE clause. Results may not be complete if the selection criteria matches too many samples. For example, SELECT uniqueCount(entity.guid) FROM Metric maps to all Infrastructure samples, and may return incomplete results. Initially there is no support for the newly introduced metric wildcarding feature (for example, SELECT average(host.swap%Bytes) FROM Metric).",

Syntax This document is a reference for the functions and clauses used in a NRQL query. Other resources for understanding NRQL: Intro to NRQL: explains what NRQL is used for, what data you can query with it, and basic NRQL syntax Examine NRQL queries used to build New Relic charts Learn how to query the Metric data type Simulate SQL JOIN functions Use funnels to evaluate a series of related data Format NRQL for querying with the Event API Query components Every NRQL query will begin with a SELECT statement or a FROM clause. All other clauses are optional. The clause definitions below also contain example NRQL queries. Required clauses Required: SELECT statement SELECT attribute ... Copy SELECT function(attribute) ... Copy The SELECT specifies what portion of a data type you want to query by specifying an attribute or a function. It's followed by one or more arguments separated by commas. In each argument you can: Get the values of all available attributes by using * as a wildcard. For example: SELECT * from Transaction. Get values associated with a specified attribute or multiple attributes specified in a comma separated list. Get aggregated values from specified attributes by selecting an aggregator function. Label the results returned in each argument with the AS clause. You can also use SELECT with basic math functions. Avg response time since last week This query returns the average response time since last week. SELECT average(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy Required: FROM clause SELECT ... FROM data type ... Copy Use the FROM clause to specify the data type you wish to query. You can start your query with FROM or with SELECT. You can merge values for the same attributes across multiple data types in a comma separated list. Query one data type This query returns the count of all APM transactions over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction SINCE 3 days ago Copy Query multiple data types This query returns the count of all APM transactions and browser events over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, PageView SINCE 3 days ago Copy Optional clauses AS clause SELECT ... AS 'label' ... Copy Use the AS clause to label an attribute, aggregator, step in a funnel, or the result of a math function with a string delimited by single quotes. The label is used in the resulting chart. Query using math function and AS This query returns the number of page views per session: SELECT count(*)/uniqueCount(session) AS 'Pageviews per Session' FROM PageView Copy Query using funnel and AS This query returns a count of people who have visited both the main page and the careers page of a site over the past week: SELECT funnel(SESSION, WHERE name='Controller/about/main' AS 'Step 1', WHERE name = 'Controller/about/careers' AS 'Step 2') FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy COMPARE WITH clause SELECT ... (SINCE or UNTIL) (integer units) AGO COMPARE WITH (integer units) AGO ... Copy Use the COMPARE WITH clause to compare the values for two different time ranges. COMPARE WITH requires a SINCE or UNTIL statement. The time specified by COMPARE WITH is relative to the time specified by SINCE or UNTIL. For example, SINCE 1 day ago COMPARE WITH 1 day ago compares yesterday with the day before. The time range for theCOMPARE WITH value is always the same as that specified by SINCE or UNTIL. For example, SINCE 2 hours ago COMPARE WITH 4 hours ago might compare 3:00pm through 5:00pm against 11:00am through 1:00pm. COMPARE WITH can be formatted as either a line chart or a billboard: With TIMESERIES, COMPARE WITH creates a line chart with the comparison mapped over time. Without TIMESERIES, COMPARE WITH generates a billboard with the current value and the percent change from the COMPARE WITH value. Example: This query returns data as a line chart showing the 95th percentile for the past hour compared to the same range one week ago. First as a single value, then as a line chart. SELECT percentile(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago COMPARE WITH 1 week AGO SELECT percentile(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago COMPARE WITH 1 week AGO TIMESERIES AUTO Copy EXTRAPOLATE clause You can use this clause with these data types: Transaction TransactionError Custom events reported via APM agent APIs The purpose of EXTRAPOLATE is to mathematically compensate for the effects of APM agent sampling of event data so that query results more closely represent the total activity in your system. This clause will be useful when a APM agent reports so many events that it often passes its harvest cycle reporting limits. When that occurs, the agent begins to sample events. When EXTRAPOLATE is used in a NRQL query that supports its use, the ratio between the reported events and the total events is used to extrapolate a close approximation of the total unsampled data. When it is used in a NRQL query that doesn’t support its use or that hasn’t used sampled data, it has no effect. Important Note that EXTRAPOLATE is most useful for homogenous data (like throughput or error rate). It's not effective when attempting to extrapolate a count of distinct things (like uniqueCount() or uniques()). This clause works only with NRQL queries that use one of the following aggregator functions: apdex average count histogram sum percentage (if function it takes as an argument supports EXTRAPOLATE) rate (if function it takes as an argument supports EXTRAPOLATE) stddev Example of extrapolating throughput A query that will show the extrapolated throughput of a service named interestingApplication. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction WHERE appName='interestingApplication' SINCE 60 minutes ago EXTRAPOLATE Copy Example of extrapolating throughput as a time series A query that will show the extrapolated throughput of a service named interestingApplication by transaction name, displayed as a time series. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction WHERE appName='interestingApplication' SINCE 60 minutes ago FACET name TIMESERIES 1 minute EXTRAPOLATE Copy FACET clause SELECT ... FACET attribute ... Copy Use FACET to separate and group your results by attribute values. For example, you could FACET your PageView data by deviceType to figure out what percentage of your traffic comes from mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. Use the LIMIT clause to specify how many facets appear (default is 10). For more complex grouping, use FACET CASES. FACET clauses support up to five attributes, separated by commas. The facets are sorted in descending order by the first field you provide in the SELECT clause. If you are faceting on attributes with more than 2,000 unique values, a subset of facet values is selected and sorted according to the query type. When selecting min(), max(), or count(), FACET uses those functions to determine how facets are picked and sorted. When selecting any other function, FACET uses the frequency of the attribute you are faceting on to determine how facets are picked and sorted. Faceted query using count() This query shows cities with the highest pageview counts. This query uses the total number of pageviews per city to determine how facets are picked and ordered. SELECT count(*) FROM PageView FACET city Copy Faceted query using uniqueCount() This query shows the cities that access the highest number of unique URLs. This query uses the total number of times a particular city appears in the results to determine how facets are picked and ordered. SELECT uniqueCount(pageUrl) FROM PageView FACET city Copy Grouping results across time Advanced segmentation and cohort analysis allow you to facet on bucket functions to more effectively break out your data. Cohort analysis is a way to group results together based on timestamps. You can separate them into buckets that cover a specified range of dates and times. FACET ... AS clause Use FACET ... AS to name facets using the AS keyword in queries. This clause is helpful for adding clearer or simplified names for facets in your results. It can also be used to rename facets in nested aggregation queries. FACET ... AS queries will change the facet names in results (when they appear as headers in tables, for example), but not the actual facet names themselves. FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) FACET response.headers.contentType AS 'content type' Copy FACET CASES clause SELECT ... FACET CASES ( WHERE attribute operator value, WHERE attribute operator value, ... ) ... Copy Use FACET CASES to break out your data by more complex conditions than possible with FACET. Separate multiple conditions with a comma ,. For example, you could query your PageView data and FACET CASES into categories like less than 1 second, from 1 to 10 seconds, and greater than 10 seconds. You can combine multiple attributes within your cases, and label the cases with the AS selector. Data points will be added to at most one facet case, the first facet case that they match. You may also use a time function with your attribute, and you can use the OR operator to facet results that don't match any of your specified cases. Basic usage with WHERE SELECT count(*) FROM PageView FACET CASES (WHERE duration < 1, WHERE duration > 1 and duration < 10, WHERE duration > 10) Copy Group based on multiple attributes This example groups results into one bucket where the transaction name contains login, and another where the URL contains login and a custom attribute indicates that the user was a paid user: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid') Copy Label groups with AS This example uses the AS selector to give your results a human-readable name: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%' AS 'Total Logins', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid' AS 'Feature Visits from Paid Users') Copy Facet non-matching data with OR This example uses the OR operator to facet results that didn't match any of your cases: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid') OR name Copy FACET ... ORDER BY clause In NRQL, the default is for the first aggregation in the SELECT clause to guide the selection of facets in a query. FACET ... ORDER BY allows you to override this default behavior by adding an aggregate function with the ORDER BY modifier to specify how facets are selected. Specifically, the clause will override the priority by which facets are chosen to be in the final result before being limited by the LIMIT clause. This clause can be used in querying but not for alerts or streaming. This example shows how to use FACET ... ORDER BY to find the average durations of app transactions, showing the top 10 (default limit) highest durations by apps which have the highest response size. In this case, if FACET ... ORDER BY is not used, the query results will instead show the top 10 by highest durations, with response size being irrelevant to the app selection. FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) TIMESERIES FACET appName ORDER BY max(responseSize) Copy Tip Because the operations are performed before the LIMIT clause is applied, FACET ... ORDER BY does not impact the sort of the final query results, which will be particularly noticeable in the results for non-timeseries queries. Important The ORDER BY modifier in this case works differently than the ORDER BY clause. When parsing queries that follow the format FACET attribute1 ORDER BY attribute2, New Relic will read these as FACET ... ORDER BY queries, but only if ORDER BY appears immediately after FACET. Otherwise ORDER BY will be interpreted by New Relic as a clause. LIMIT clause SELECT ... LIMIT count ... Copy Use the LIMIT clause to control the maximum number of facet values returned by FACET queries or the maximum number of items returned by SELECT * queries. This clause takes a single integer value as an argument. If the LIMIT clause is not specified, or no value is provided, the limit defaults to 10 for FACET queries and 100 in the case of SELECT * queries. The maximum allowed value for the LIMIT clause is 2,000. Query using LIMIT This query shows the top 20 countries by session count and provides 95th percentile of response time for each country for Windows users only. SELECT uniqueCount(session), percentile(duration, 95) FROM PageView WHERE userAgentOS = 'Windows' FACET countryCode LIMIT 20 SINCE YESTERDAY Copy OFFSET clause SELECT ... LIMIT count OFFSET count ... Copy Use the OFFSET clause with LIMIT to control the portion of rows returned by SELECT * or SELECT column queries. Like the LIMIT clause, OFFSET takes a single integer value as an argument. OFFSET sets the number of rows to be skipped before the selected rows of your query are returned. This is constrained by LIMIT. OFFSET rows are skipped starting from the most recent record. For example, the query SELECT interestingValue FROM Minute_Report LIMIT 5 OFFSET 1 returns the last 5 values from Minute_Report except for the most recent one. ORDER BY clause The ORDER BY clause allows you to specify how you want to sort your query results in queries that select event attributes by row. This query orders transactions by duration. FROM Transaction SELECT appName, duration ORDER BY duration Copy The default sort order is ascending, but this can be changed by adding the ASC or DESC modifiers. SHOW EVENT TYPES clause SHOW EVENT TYPES... Copy SHOW EVENT TYPES will return a list of all the data types present in your account for a specific time range. It is used as the first clause in a query instead of SELECT. Important In this context, \"event types\" refers to the data types you can access with a NRQL query. Data types in the last day This query will return all the data types present over the past day: SHOW EVENT TYPES SINCE 1 day ago Copy SINCE clause SELECT ... SINCE [numerical units AGO | phrase] ... Copy The default value is 1 hour ago. Use the SINCE clause to define the beginning of a time range for the returned data. When using NRQL, you can set a UTC timestamp or relative time range. You can specify a timezone for the query but not for the results. NRQL results are based on your system time. SLIDE BY clause The SLIDE BY clause supports a feature known as sliding windows. With sliding windows,SLIDE BY data is gathered into \"windows\" of time that overlap with each other. These windows can help to smooth out line graphs with a lot of variation in cases where the rolling aggregate (such as a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. To use SLIDE BY, place it in a query after the TIMESERIES clause. For example, this query pulls data in 5-minute windows with a 1-minute SLIDE BY interval, meaning that each window lasts 5 minutes, but window 1 starts at 0 minutes, window 2 starts at 1 minute, window 3 starts at 2 minutes, and so on. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY 1 minute Copy To learn more about how and when you can use SLIDE BY, see Create smoother charts with sliding windows. Use SLIDE BY with MAX or AUTO interval You can use sliding windows in combination with MAX or AUTO. However, MAX or AUTO may not be placed between TIMESERIES and SLIDE BY. This query will automatically decide a SLIDE BY window interval. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY AUTO Copy This query will set the SLIDE BY window to the maximum interval granularity. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY MAX Copy Important The SLIDE BY value as determined by AUTO or MAX can produce a step interval greater than the window size, which can cause gaps and unexpected results. TIMESERIES clause SELECT ... TIMESERIES integer units ... Copy Use the TIMESERIES clause to return data as a time series broken out by a specified period of time. Since TIMESERIES is used to trigger certain charts, there is no default value. To indicate the time range, use integer units. For example: TIMESERIES 1 minute TIMESERIES 30 minutes TIMESERIES 1 hour TIMESERIES 30 seconds TIMESERIES can be combined with arguments such as MAX, AUTO, and SLIDE BY to further tailor query results, as shown in the examples below. Important For functions such as average( ) or percentile( ), a large aggregation window can have a significant smoothing effect on outliers. This is true whether or not the query makes use of sliding windows. Use a set interval The value provided indicates the units used to break out the graph. For example, to present a one-day graph showing 30 minute increments: SELECT ... SINCE 1 day AGO TIMESERIES 30 minutes Copy Use an automatically set interval TIMESERIES can also be set to AUTO, which will divide your graph into a reasonable number of divisions. For example, a daily chart will be divided into 30 minute intervals and a weekly chart will be divided into 6 hour intervals. This query returns data as a line chart showing the 50th and 90th percentile of client-side transaction time for one week with a data point every 6 hours. SELECT average(duration), percentile(duration, 50, 90) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week AGO TIMESERIES AUTO Copy Use MAX interval You can set TIMESERIES to MAX, which will automatically adjust your time window to the maximum number of intervals allowed for a given time period. This allows you to update your time windows without having to manually update your TIMESERIES buckets and ensures your time window is being split into the peak number of intervals allowed. The maximum number of TIMESERIES buckets that will be returned is 366. For example, the following query creates 4-minute intervals, which is the ceiling for a daily chart. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction since 1 day ago TIMESERIES MAX Copy UNTIL clause SELECT ... UNTIL integer units AGO ... Copy The default value is NOW. Only use UNTIL to specify an end point other than the default. Use the UNTIL clause to define the end of a time range across which to return data. Once a time range has been specified, the data will be preserved and can be reviewed after the time range has ended. See Use the time picker to adjust time settings for detailed information and examples. WHERE clause Use the WHERE clause to filter results. NRQL returns the results that fulfill the condition(s) you specify in the clause. SELECT function(attribute) ... WHERE attribute [operator 'value' | IN ('value' [, 'value]) | IS [NOT] NULL ] [AND|OR ...] ... Copy If you specify more than one condition, separate the conditions by the operators AND or OR. If you want to simulate a SQL join, use custom attributes in a WHERE or FACET clause. Operators that the WHERE clause accepts Description =, !=, <, <=, >, >= NRQL accepts standard comparison operators. Example: state = 'WA' AND Used to define an intersection of two conditions. OR Used to define a union of two conditions. IS NULL Determines if an attribute has a null value. IS NOT NULL Determines if an attribute does not have a null value. IN Determines if the string value of an attribute is in a specified set. Using this method yields better performance than stringing together multiple WHERE clauses. Example: animalType IN ('cat', 'dog', 'fish') NOT IN Determines if the string value of an attribute is not in a specified set. Using this method yields better performance than stringing together multiple WHERE clauses. Values must be in parentheses, separated by commas. For example: SELECT * FROM PageView WHERE countryCode NOT IN ('CA', 'WA') Copy LIKE Determines if an attribute contains a specified sub-string. The string argument for the LIKE operator accepts the percent sign (%) as a wildcard anywhere in the string. If the substring does not begin or end the string you are matching against, the wildcard must begin or end the string. Examples: userAgentName LIKE 'IE%' IE IE Mobile userAgentName LIKE 'o%a%' Opera Opera Mini userAgentName LIKE 'o%a' Opera userAgentName LIKE '%o%a%' Opera Opera Mini Mozilla Gecko NOT LIKE Determines if an attribute does not contain a specified sub-string. RLIKE Determines if an attribute contains a specified Regex sub-string. Uses RE2 syntax. Examples: appName RLIKE r'z.*|q.*'' hostname RLIKE r'ip-10-351-[0-2]?[0-9]-.*' z-app q-app ip-10-351-19-237 ip-10-351-2-41 ip-10-351-24-238 ip-10-351-14-15 Important Regex defaults to full-string matching, therefore ^ and $ are implicit and you do not need to add them. NOT RLIKE Determines if an attribute does not contain a specified Regex sub-string. Uses RE2 syntax. Example query with three conditions This query returns the browser response time for pages with checkout in the URL for Safari users in the United States and Canada over the past 24 hours. SELECT histogram(duration, 50, 20) FROM PageView WHERE countryCode IN ('CA', 'US') AND userAgentName='Safari' AND pageUrl LIKE '%checkout%' SINCE 1 day ago Copy WITH METRIC_FORMAT clause For information on querying metric data, see Query metrics. WITH TIMEZONE clause SELECT ... WITH TIMEZONE (selected zone) ... Copy By default, query results are displayed in the timezone of the browser you're using. Use the WITH TIMEZONE clause to select a time zone for a date or time in the query that hasn't already had a time zone specified for it. For example, the query clause SINCE Monday UNTIL Tuesday WITH TIMEZONE 'America/New_York' will return data recorded from Monday at midnight, Eastern Standard Time, until midnight Tuesday, Eastern Standard Time.

Query metric data Metric data is more complex than other types of data. There are specific tips for querying it well. We have two types of metric data, each with their own query guidelines: Query dimensional metrics, which are reported by our Metric API and by some of our tools that use that API, like our Telemetry SDKs and our open-source telemetry integrations (OpenTelemetry, Kamon, Micrometer, more). Query metric timeslice data, which is our original metric data type reported by our APM, mobile monitoring, and browser monitoring. For more on understanding these data types, see Metric data types. Functions In this section we explain NRQL functions, both aggregator functions and non-aggregator functions. Aggregator functions You can use aggregator functions to filter and aggregate data. Some tips for using these: See New Relic University tutorials for Filter queries, Apdex queries, and Percentile queries. Or, go to the full online course Writing NRQL queries. If you're using an aggregator function multiple times in the same query (e.g., SELECT median(one_metric</var>), median(another_metric)), it can cause problems in displaying results. To solve this, use the AS function. For example: SELECT median(one_metric) as 'med-a', median(another_metric) as 'med-b' Data type \"coercion\" is not supported. Read about available type conversion functions. For how to display results over time, see Group results over time. Examples: SELECT histogram(duration, 10, 20) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy aggregationendtime() Use the aggregationendtime() function to return the time of the relevant aggregation. More specifically, for a given aggregate, the aggregationendtime() function provides the timestamp of the end of the time period of that aggregation. For example, in a timeseries query, for a data point that encompasses an hour’s worth of data, the function would return the timestamp of the end of that hour period. apdex(attribute, t: ) Use the apdex function to return an Apdex score for a single transaction or for all your transactions. The attribute can be any attribute based on response time, such as duration or backendDuration. The t: argument defines an Apdex T threshold in seconds. The Apdex score returned by the apdex( ) function is based only on execution time. It does not account for APM errors. If a transaction includes an error but completes in Apdex T or less, that transaction will be rated satisfying by the apdex ( ) function. Get Apdex for specific customers If you have defined custom attributes, you can filter based on those attributes. For example, you could monitor the Apdex for a particularly important customer: SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.4) FROM Transaction WHERE customerName='ReallyImportantCustomer' SINCE 1 day ago Copy Get Apdex for specific transaction Use the name attribute to return a score for a specific transaction, or return an overall Apdex by omitting name. This query returns an Apdex score for the Controller/notes/index transaction over the last hour: The apdex function returns an Apdex score that measures user satisfaction with your site. Arguments are a response time attribute and an Apdex T threshold in seconds. SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.5) from Transaction WHERE name='Controller/notes/index' SINCE 1 hour ago Copy Get overall Apdex for your app This example query returns an overall Apdex for the application over the last three weeks: SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.08) FROM Transaction SINCE 3 week ago Copy average(attribute) Use the average( ) function to return the average value for an attribute. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. buckets(attribute, ceiling [,number of buckets]) Use the buckets() function to aggregate data split up by a FACET clause into buckets based on ranges. You can bucket by any attribute that is stored as a numerical value in the New Relic database. It takes three arguments: Attribute name Maximum value of the sample range. Any outliers will appear in the final bucket. Total number of buckets For more information and examples, see Split your data into buckets. bucketPercentile(attribute) The bucketPercentile( ) function is the NRQL equivalent of the histogram_quantile function in Prometheus. It is intended to be used with dimensional metric data. Instead of the quantile, New Relic returns the percentile, which is the quantile * 100. Use the bucketPercentile( ) function to calculate the quantile from the histogram data in a Prometheus format. It takes the bucket name as an argument and reports percentiles along the bucket's boundaries: SELECT bucketPercentile(duration_bucket) FROM Metric SINCE 1 day ago Copy Optionally, you can add percentile specifications as an argument: SELECT bucketPercentile(duration_bucket, 50, 75, 90) FROM Metric SINCE 1 day ago Copy Because multiple metrics are used to make up Prometheus histogram data, you must query for specific Prometheus metrics in terms of the associated <basename>. For example, to compute percentiles from a Prometheus histogram, with the <basename> prometheus_http_request_duration_seconds using NRQL, use bucketPercentile(prometheus_http_request_duration_seconds_bucket, 50). Note how _ bucket is added to the end of the <basename> as a suffix. See the Prometheus.io documentation for more information. cardinality(attribute) Use the cardinality( ) function to obtain the number of combinations of all the dimensions (attributes) on a metric. It takes three arguments, all optional: Metric name: if present, cardinality( ) only computes the metric specified. Include: if present, the include list restricts the cardinality computation to those attributes. Exclude: if present, the exclude list causes those attributes to be ignored in the cardinality computation. SELECT cardinality(metric_name, include:{attribute_list}, exclude:{attribute_list}) Copy count(*) Use the count( ) function to return a count of available records. It takes a single argument; either *, an attribute, or a constant value. Currently, it follows typical SQL behavior and counts all records that have values for its argument. Since count(*) does not name a specific attribute, the results will be formatted in the default \"humanize\" format. derivative(attribute [,time interval]) derivative() finds the rate of change for a given dataset. The rate of change is calculated using a linear least-squares regression to approximate the derivative. Since this calculation requires comparing more than one datapoint, if only one datapoint is included in the evaluation range, the calculation is indeterminate and won't work, resulting in a null value. The time interval is the period for which the rate of change is calculated. For example, derivative(attributeName, 1 minute) will return the rate of change per minute. dimensions(include: {attributes}, exclude: {attributes}) Use the dimensions( ) function to return all the dimensional values on a data type. You can explicitly include or exclude specific attributes using the optional arguments: Include: if present, the include list limits dimensions( ) to those attributes. Exclude: if present, the dimensions( ) calculation ignores those attributes. FROM Metric SELECT count(node_filesystem_size) TIMESERIES FACET dimensions() Copy When used with a FACET clause, dimensions( ) produces a unique timeseries for all facets available on the event type, similar to how Prometheus behaves with non-aggregated queries. latestrate(attribute, time interval) Use the latestrate( ) function to return the rate of change of a value based on the last 2 data points. It takes the attribute in question as the first argument and the unit of time for the resulting rate as the second argument. The function returns a result in units of change in attribute/time interval. This function can be useful to provide the most recent rate of change for an attribute in order to see leading-edge trends. Get the most recent rate of change of PageView Duration This query returns the rate of change of duration based on the last 2 data points. It will be returned in units of duration/second because of the 1 SECOND argument. SELECT latestrate(duration, 1 SECOND) FROM PageView Copy max(attribute) Use the max( ) function to return the maximum recorded value of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. median(attribute) Use the median( ) function to return an attribute's median, or 50th percentile. For more information about percentile queries, see percentile(). Tip The median( ) query is only available when using the query builder. Median query This query will generate a line chart for the median value. SELECT median(duration) FROM PageView TIMESERIES AUTO Copy min(attribute) Use the min( ) function to return the minimum recorded value of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. minuteOf(attribute) Use the minuteOf() function to extract only the minute portion (i.e. 0-59) of an attribute holding a valid timestamp value. mod(attribute, divisor) Use the mod( ) function to return the floor modulus after dividing the value of the provided numeric attribute (the first argument, or dividend) by a numeric value (the second argument, or divisor). This modulo operation can be used within a WHERE clause condition to filter to an arbitrary subset of results or within a FACET clause as a way to subdivide the result set. mod() within a WHERE clause condition FROM Transaction SELECT * WHERE mod(port, 2) = 1 Copy mod() within a FACET clause FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT uniques(hostId, 10000) SINCE 1 day AGO FACET mod(hostId, 10) Copy percentage(function(attribute), WHERE condition) Use the percentage( ) function to return the percentage of a target data set that matches some condition. The first argument requires an aggregator function against the desired attribute. Use exactly two arguments (arguments after the first two will be ignored). If the attribute is not numeric, this function returns a value of 100%. percentile(attribute [, percentile [, ...]]) Use the percentile( ) function to return an attribute's approximate value at a given percentile. It requires an attribute and can take any number of arguments representing percentile points. The percentile() function enables percentiles to displays with up to three digits after the decimal point, providing greater precision. Percentile thresholds may be specified as decimal values, but be aware that for most data sets, percentiles closer than 0.1 from each other will not be resolved. Percentile display examples Use TIMESERIES to generate a line chart with percentiles mapped over time. Omit TIMESERIES to generate a billboard and attribute sheet showing aggregate values for the percentiles. If no percentiles are listed, the default is the 95th percentile. To return only the 50th percentile value, the median, you can also use median(). Basic percentile query This query will generate a line chart with lines for the 5th, 50th, and 95th percentile. SELECT percentile(duration, 5, 50, 95) FROM PageView TIMESERIES AUTO Copy predictLinear(attribute, [,time interval]) predictLinear() is an extension of the derivative() function. It uses a similar method of least-squares linear regression to predict the future values for a dataset. The time interval is how far the query will look into the future. For example, predictLinear(attributeName, 1 hour) is a linear prediction 1 hour into the future of the query time window. Generally, predictLinear() is helpful for continuously growing values like disk space, or predictions on large trends. Since predictLinear() is a linear regression, familiarity with the dataset being queried helps to ensure accurate long-term predictions. Any dataset which grows exponentially, logarithmically, or by other nonlinear means will likely only be successful in very short-term predictions. New Relic recommends against using predictLinear in TIMESERIES queries. This is because each bucket will be making an individual prediction based on its relative timeframe within the query, meaning that such queries will not show predictions from the end of the timeseries forward. rate(function(attribute) [,time interval]) Use the rate( ) function to visualize the frequency or rate of a given query per time interval. For example, you might want to know the number of pageviews per minute over an hour-long period or the count of unique sessions on your site per hour over a day-long period. Use TIMESERIES to generate a line chart with rates mapped over time. Omit TIMESERIES to generate a billboard showing a single rate value averaged over time. Basic rate query This query will generate a line chart showing the rate of throughput for APM transactions per 10 minutes over the past 6 hours. SELECT rate(count(*), 10 minute) FROM Transaction SINCE 6 hours ago TIMESERIES Copy round(attribute) Use the round( ) function to return the rounded value of an attribute. Optionally round( ) can take a second argument, to_nearest, to round the first argument to the closest multiple of the second one. to_nearest can be fractional. SELECT round(n [, to_nearest]) Copy stddev(attribute) Use the stddev( ) function to return one standard deviation for a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. stdvar(attribute) Use the stdvar( ) function to return the standard variance for a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. sum(attribute) Use the sum( ) function to return the sum recorded values of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. uniqueCount(attribute) Use the uniqueCount( ) function to return the number of unique values recorded for an attribute over the time range specified. Tip To optimize query performance, this function returns approximate results for queries that inspect more than 256 unique values. uniques(attribute [,limit]) Use the uniques( ) function to return a list of unique values recorded for an attribute over the time range specified. When used along with the facet clause, a list of unique attribute values will be returned per each facet value. The limit parameter is optional. When it is not provided, the default limit of 1,000 unique attribute values per facet is applied. You may specify a different limit value, up to a maximum of 10,000. The uniques( ) function will return the first set of unique attribute values discovered, until the limit is reached. Therefore, if you have 5,000 unique attribute values in your data set, and the limit is set to 1,000, the operator will return the first 1,000 unique values that it discovers, regardless of their frequency. The maximum number of values that can be returned in a query result is the product of the uniques( ) limit times the facet limit. In the following query, the theoretical maximum number of values that can be returned is 5 million (5,000 x 1,000). Depending on the data set being queried, and the complexity of the query, memory protection limits may prevent a very large query from being executed. From Transaction SELECT uniques(host,5000) FACET appName LIMIT 1000 Copy Using tuple If you'd like to know the unique combinations of a handful of attributes, you can structure a query in the format SELECT uniques(tuple(x, y, ... z)) ...` to get all the unique tuples of values, to maintain their relationship. In the following query, tuple is used on index and cellName together to find uniques where those two values occur in combination. FROM NodeStatus SELECT uniques(tuple(index, cellName), 5) Copy capture(attribute, regular expression) Use the capture() to extract values from an attribute using a regular expression. Uses RE2 syntax. It takes two arguments: Attribute name Regular expression with capture syntax. Regex expressions in NRQL use Python-like syntax, r'...'. When capturing, use the RE2 named-capture syntax ...(?P<name> pattern )... to capture the contained pattern, given the specified name. Currently, only 1 capture group is supported. Please see the examples below. capture() within a SELECT clause condition The following will select the domain name of the website, removing https:// and any paths following the .com SELECT capture(pageUrl, r'https://(?P<baseUrl>.*.com)/.+') FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago Copy The following will capture only the first word of the error message. SELECT capture(errorMessage, r'(?P<firstWord>\\S+)\\s.+') FROM Transaction SINCE 1 hour ago where errorMessage is not null Copy capture() within a FACET clause condition The following will facet by the captured HTTP method. SELECT count(*) FROM Log WHERE message like '%HTTP%' FACET capture(message, r'.* \"(?P<httpMethod>[A-Z]+) .*') Copy capture() within a WHERE clause condition The following will filter the results based on Log events with message attribute that matches the regular expression where the captured job name is ExampleJob. SELECT message FROM Log WHERE capture(message, r'.*Job Failed: (?P<jobName>[A-Za-z]+),.*') = 'ExampleJob' SINCE 10 minutes ago Copy capture() with a numeric cast The following will capture sum of CPU Time from log lines. You must explicitly cast to numeric to do mathematical operations. SELECT sum(numeric(capture(message, r'.*CpuTime:\\s(?P<cpuTime>\\d+)'))) FROM Log WHERE message like '%CpuTime:%' SINCE 1 hour ago Copy Non-aggregator functions Use non-aggregator functions for non-numerical data in NRQL queries. earliest(attribute) Use the earliest( ) function to return the earliest value for an attribute over the specified time range. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If used in conjunction with a FACET it will return the most recent value for an attribute for each of the resulting facets. Get earliest country per user agent from PageView This query returns the earliest country code per each user agent from the PageView event. SELECT earliest(countryCode) FROM PageView FACET userAgentName Copy eventType() ...WHERE eventType() = 'EventNameHere'... ...FACET eventType()... Copy Use the eventType() function in a FACET clause to break out results by the selected data type or in a WHERE clause to filter results to a specific data type. This is particularly useful for targeting specific data types with the filter() and percentage() functions. Important In this context, \"event type\" refers to the types of data you can access with a NRQL query. Use eventType() in filter() function This query returns the percentage of total TransactionError results out of the total Transaction results. You can use the eventType() function to target specific types of data with the filter() function. SELECT 100 * filter(count(*), where eventType() = 'TransactionError') / filter(count(*), where eventType() = 'Transaction') FROM Transaction, TransactionError WHERE appName = 'App.Prod' TIMESERIES 2 Minutes SINCE 6 hours ago Copy Use eventType() with FACET This query displays a count of how many records each data type (Transaction and TransactionError) returns. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, TransactionError FACET eventType() TIMESERIES Copy filter(function(attribute), WHERE condition) Use the filter() function to limit the results for one of the aggregator functions in your SELECT statement. You can use filter() in conjunction with FACET or TIMESERIES. Filter is only useful when selecting multiple different aggregations such as SELECT filter(sum(x), WHERE attribute='a') AS 'A', filter(sum(x), WHERE attribute='b') AS 'B' .... Otherwise, it's better to just use the standard WHERE clause. Analyze purchases that used offer codes You could use filter() to compare the items bought in a set of transactions for those using an offer code versus those who aren't: Use the filter( ) function to limit the results for one of the aggregator functions in your SELECT statement. funnel(attribute, steps) Use the funnel() function to generate a funnel chart. It takes an attribute as its first argument. You then specify steps as WHERE clauses (with optional AS clauses for labels) separated by commas. For details and examples, see the funnels documentation. getField(attribute, field) Use the getField() function to extract a field from compound data types, such as metric data. It takes the following arguments: Metric type Supported fields summary count, total, max, min, type gauge count, total, max, min, latest, type distribution count, total, max, min, type counter count, type timeslice count, total, totalExclusive, min, and max Examples: SELECT max(getField(mySummary, count)) from Metric Copy SELECT sum(mySummary) from Metric where getField(mySummary, count) > 10 Copy histogram(attribute, ceiling [,number of buckets]) Use the histogram( ) function to generate histograms. It takes three arguments: Attribute name Maximum value of the sample range Total number of buckets (between 1 and 500, inclusive) Histogram of response times from PageView events This query results in a histogram of response times ranging up to 10 seconds over 20 buckets. SELECT histogram(duration, 10, 20) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy Prometheus histogram buckets histogram( ) accepts Prometheus histogram buckets: SELECT histogram(duration_bucket, 10, 20) FROM Metric SINCE 1 week ago Copy New Relic distribution metric histogram( ) accepts Distribution metric as an input: SELECT histogram(myDistributionMetric, 10, 20) FROM Metric SINCE 1 week ago Copy Histogram with a FACET clause Use histogram( ) with a FACET clause to generate a heatmap chart: SELECT histogram(duration) FROM PageView FACET appName SINCE 1 week ago Copy keyset() Using keyset() will allow you to see all of the attributes for a given data type over a given time range. It takes no arguments. It returns a JSON structure containing groups of string-typed keys, numeric-typed keys, boolean-typed keys, and all keys. See all attributes for a data type This query returns the attributes found for PageView events from the last day: SELECT keyset() FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago Copy latest(attribute) Use the latest( ) function to return the most recent value for an attribute over a specified time range. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If used in conjunction with a FACET it will return the most recent value for an attribute for each of the resulting facets. Get most recent country per user agent from PageView This query returns the most recent country code per each user agent from the PageView event. SELECT latest(countryCode) FROM PageView FACET userAgentName Copy Type conversion NRQL does not support \"coercion.\" This means that a float stored as a string is treated as a string and cannot be operated on by functions expecting float values. You can convert a string with a numeric value or a boolean with a string value to their numeric and boolean types with these functions: Use the numeric() function to convert a number with a string format to a numeric function. The function can be built into a query that uses math functions on query results or NRQL aggregator functions, such as average(). Use the boolean() function to convert a string value of \"true\" or \"false\" to the corresponding boolean value.",

      "body": "One way to query your New Relic data is with the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). This resource explains what NRQL is, when and how you can use it, and basic syntax rules. For more detailed information on querying, including a listing of clauses and functions and example queries, see NRQL syntax, clauses, and functions. What is NRQL? NRQL is New Relic's SQL-like query language. You can use NRQL to retrieve detailed New Relic data and get insight into your applications, hosts, and business-important activity. Reasons to use NRQL include: To answer a question for the purpose of troubleshooting or business analysis To create a new chart To make API queries of New Relic data (for example, using our NerdGraph API) NRQL is used behind the scenes to generate some New Relic charts: Some New Relic charts are built using NRQL. One way to start using NRQL is to view a chart's query and then edit it to make your own custom chart. Where can you use NRQL? You can use NRQL in these places: New Relic One query builder NerdGraph: our GraphQL-format API, which includes options for making NRQL queries one.newrelic.com > Query your data: You can run a NRQL query in New Relic One. This NRQL query shows a count of distributed tracing spans faceted by their entity names. NRQL is one of several ways to query New Relic data. For more on all query options, see Query your data. What data can you query with NRQL? NRQL allows you to query these New Relic data types: Event data from all New Relic products, including: APM events, like Transaction Browser monitoring events, like PageView Mobile monitoring events, like Mobile Infrastructure events, like ProcessSample Synthetics events, like SyntheticCheck Custom events, like those reported by the Event API Metric timeslice data (metrics reported by APM, browser, and mobile) The Metric data type (metrics reported by the Metric API and data sources that use that API) The Span data type (distributed tracing data) The Log data type (data from New Relic Logs) Tip Some data, like relationships between monitored entities, is not available via NRQL but is available using our NerdGraph API. Start using NRQL One way to start using NRQL and to understand what data you have available is to go to a NRQL interface (for example, the New Relic One query builder), type FROM, and press space. The interface will suggest available types of data: To see the attributes available for a specific data type, type FROM DATA_TYPE SELECT and press space. The interface will suggest available attributes. For example: To see the complete JSON associated with a data type, including all of its attributes, use the keyset() attribute. For example: FROM Transaction SELECT keyset() Copy NRQL is used behind the scenes to build some New Relic charts and dashboards. One way to learn NRQL is to find one of these NRQL-generated charts and start playing with the NRQL to create new, customized queries and charts: Charts built with NRQL will have View query as an option. You can then edit and customize that query to see how your changes affect the resulting visualization. Important To explore your data without having to use NRQL, use the data explorer. Learn more about querying data in New Relic. NRQL query examples Here's an example NRQL query of Transaction data, which is reported by APM. FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) FACET appName TIMESERIES auto Copy This would generate a chart that looks like: Here are some more query examples: Basic NRQL query of browser data Here's a NRQL query of PageView data from browser monitoring. SELECT uniqueCount(user) FROM PageView WHERE userAgentOS = 'Mac' FACET countryCode SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 20 Copy Attribute name with a space in it If a custom attribute name has a space in it, use backticks around the attribute name: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET `Logged-in user` Copy Querying multiple data sources To return data from two data sources, separate their data types with a comma. For example, this query returns a count of all APM transactions and browser events over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, PageView SINCE 3 days ago Copy Query returning multiple columns To return multiple columns from a dataset, separate the aggregator arguments with a comma: SELECT function(attribute), function(attribute) ... FROM ... Copy This query returns the minimum, average, and maximum duration for browser monitoring PageView events over the last week: SELECT min(duration), max(duration), average(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy See more NRQL query examples. NRQL syntax The syntax of a NRQL query is similar to standard SQL queries. Here is a breakdown of the structure of a NRQL query: SELECT function(attribute) [AS 'label'][, ...] FROM data type [WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...]][AS 'label'][, ...] [FACET attribute | function(attribute)] [LIMIT number] [SINCE time] [UNTIL time] [WITH TIMEZONE timezone] [COMPARE WITH time] [TIMESERIES time] Copy Basic rules include: NRQL condition Details Required values The SELECT statement and FROM clause are required. All other clauses are optional. You can start your query with either SELECT or FROM. Query string size The query string must be less than 4 KB. Case sensitivity The data type names and attribute names are case sensitive. NRQL clauses and functions are not case sensitive. Syntax for strings NRQL uses single quotes to designate strings. For example: ... where traceId = '030a573f0df02c57' Copy Attribute names with spaces Use backticks `` to quote a custom attribute name that has a space in it. For example: ... FACET `Logged-in user` Copy Data type coercion Insights does not support data type \"coercion.\" For more information, see Data type conversion. Use of math functions Basic and advanced math functions are supported in the SELECT statement. JOIN functions NRQL does not have the equivalent of the SQL JOIN function, but you can simulate a JOIN with custom attributes. Read more about NRQL syntax and functions.",

      "body": "BETA FEATURE This feature is currently in beta. Dimensional metrics are an industry standard for storing and querying metric data. All infrastructure metrics are stored as event data in New Relic, but you can also query them through dimensional metrics. In this page you can learn: The benefits of dimensional metrics. A few examples on how and where to use them. Known issues. Why it matters At New Relic we report metrics in several ways, including dimensional metrics, which are used by our metric API, Telemetry SDK, some open-source integrations, and our infrastructure services. This type of metric enables you to: Enjoy an improved query experience for Infrastructure data. Discover all your metrics in one place. Tap into more metric sources, such as Prometheus. For example, the query to get the maximum duration of your Lambda functions is simplified: Query with samples FROM ServerlessSample SELECT max(provider.duration.Maximum) WHERE provider = 'LambdaFunction' Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT max(aws.lambda.function.duration) Copy Get started No agent or integration updates are required to use these metrics. NRQL alerting based on dimensional metrics is also supported, except for data coming from cloud integrations (that is metrics from AWS polling integrations, GCP, and Azure). AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams metrics are ingested as dimensional metrics and NRQL alerts are recommended. Where and how to query dimensional metrics All current NRQL query features are supported. Queries can use WHERE, FACET, and time selection functions such as SINCE, UNTIL, and COMPARE WITH. The query builder in New Relic One supports metrics in both simple and advanced (NRQL) mode. Naming conventions for metrics and attributes All metric names and attributes for dimensional metrics follow the same naming convention in order to make them easy to find and use. Metric and attribute names are namespaced with dots: for example, the host. prefix is used for host metrics, the k8s. prefix is used for Kubernetes metrics, and aws. is used for AWS metrics. The graphic below shows how a ProcessSample that contains three metrics (cpuPercent, ioTotalReadBytes, and ioTotalWriteBytes) is split into three separate metrics. Note the updated naming of the metrics and the attributes. Dimensional metrics naming convention Examples Here are some examples of NQRL queries with and without dimensional metrics: AWS EBS query example Get the total write time by EBS Volume. Query with samples FROM BlockDeviceSample SELECT sum('provider.volumeTotalWriteTime.Sum') WHERE provider = 'EbsVolume' FACET entityName Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT sum(aws.ebs.volume.TotalWriteTime) FACET entity.name Copy Azure Service bus query example Maximum number of messages in an Azure Service Bus topic by resource group. Query with samples FROM AzureServiceBusTopicSample SELECT max(activeMessages.Maximum) FACET resourceGroupName Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT max(azure.servicebus.topic.activeMessages) FACET azure.resourceGroup Copy Azure functions query example Number of function executions Azure Functions over the past 6 hours by region over time. Query with samples FROM AzureFunctionsAppSample SELECT sum(functionExecutionCount.Total) FACET regionName TIMESERIES SINCE 6 hours ago Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT sum(azure.functions.app.functionExecutionCount) FACET azure.region TIMESERIES SINCE 6 hours ago Copy Azure VMs query example Compare the number of Azure VMs over the past thirty minutes with the same time a week ago. Query with samples FROM AzureVirtualMachineScaleSetSample SELECT uniqueCount(vMName) FACET name SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO COMPARE WITH 1 WEEK AGO Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT uniqueCount(azure.vms.vmName) FACET azure.resourceName WHERE azure.resourceType='Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachineScaleSets' SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO COMPARE WITH 1 WEEK AGO Copy NGINX query example The average number of NGINX requests per second over time. Query with samples FROM NginxSample SELECT average(net.requestsPerSecond) TIMESERIES Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT average(nginx.server.net.requestsPerSecond) TIMESERIES Copy MySQL query example The maximum number of used MySQL connections. Query with samples FROM MysqlSample SELECT max(net.maxUsedConnections) Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT max(mysql.node.net.maxUsedConnections) Copy Known limitations Metric queries with * do not return Infrastructure sample data (for example, SELECT * FROM Metric). In order to select attributes starting with tags. a metric name has to be provided. For example, SELECT uniques(tags.environment) FROM Metric WHERE metricName='aws.lambda.function.duration' does not work without the WHERE clause. Results may not be complete if the selection criteria matches too many samples. For example, SELECT uniqueCount(entity.guid) FROM Metric maps to all Infrastructure samples, and may return incomplete results. Initially there is no support for the newly introduced metric wildcarding feature (for example, SELECT average(host.swap%Bytes) FROM Metric).",

You can merge values for the same attributes across multiple data types in a comma separated list. Query one data type This query returns the count of all APM transactions over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction SINCE 3 days ago Copy Query multiple data types This query returns the count of all APM transactions and browser events over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, PageView SINCE 3 days ago Copy Optional clauses AS clause SELECT ... AS 'label' ... Copy Use the AS clause to label an attribute, aggregator, step in a funnel, or the result of a math function with a string delimited by single quotes. The label is used in the resulting chart. Query using math function and AS This query returns the number of page views per session: SELECT count(*)/uniqueCount(session) AS 'Pageviews per Session' FROM PageView Copy Query using funnel and AS This query returns a count of people who have visited both the main page and the careers page of a site over the past week: SELECT funnel(SESSION, WHERE name='Controller/about/main' AS 'Step 1', WHERE name = 'Controller/about/careers' AS 'Step 2') FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy COMPARE WITH clause SELECT ... (SINCE or UNTIL) (integer units) AGO COMPARE WITH (integer units) AGO ... Copy Use the COMPARE WITH clause to compare the values for two different time ranges. COMPARE WITH requires a SINCE or UNTIL statement. The time specified by COMPARE WITH is relative to the time specified by SINCE or UNTIL. For example, SINCE 1 day ago COMPARE WITH 1 day ago compares yesterday with the day before. The time range for theCOMPARE WITH value is always the same as that specified by SINCE or UNTIL. For example, SINCE 2 hours ago COMPARE WITH 4 hours ago might compare 3:00pm through 5:00pm against 11:00am through 1:00pm. COMPARE WITH can be formatted as either a line chart or a billboard: With TIMESERIES, COMPARE WITH creates a line chart with the comparison mapped over time. Without TIMESERIES, COMPARE WITH generates a billboard with the current value and the percent change from the COMPARE WITH value. Example: This query returns data as a line chart showing the 95th percentile for the past hour compared to the same range one week ago. First as a single value, then as a line chart. SELECT percentile(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago COMPARE WITH 1 week AGO SELECT percentile(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago COMPARE WITH 1 week AGO TIMESERIES AUTO Copy EXTRAPOLATE clause You can use this clause with these data types: Transaction TransactionError Custom events reported via APM agent APIs The purpose of EXTRAPOLATE is to mathematically compensate for the effects of APM agent sampling of event data so that query results more closely represent the total activity in your system. This clause will be useful when a APM agent reports so many events that it often passes its harvest cycle reporting limits. When that occurs, the agent begins to sample events. When EXTRAPOLATE is used in a NRQL query that supports its use, the ratio between the reported events and the total events is used to extrapolate a close approximation of the total unsampled data. When it is used in a NRQL query that doesn’t support its use or that hasn’t used sampled data, it has no effect. Important Note that EXTRAPOLATE is most useful for homogenous data (like throughput or error rate). It's not effective when attempting to extrapolate a count of distinct things (like uniqueCount() or uniques()). This clause works only with NRQL queries that use one of the following aggregator functions: apdex average count histogram sum percentage (if function it takes as an argument supports EXTRAPOLATE) rate (if function it takes as an argument supports EXTRAPOLATE) stddev Example of extrapolating throughput A query that will show the extrapolated throughput of a service named interestingApplication. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction WHERE appName='interestingApplication' SINCE 60 minutes ago EXTRAPOLATE Copy Example of extrapolating throughput as a time series A query that will show the extrapolated throughput of a service named interestingApplication by transaction name, displayed as a time series. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction WHERE appName='interestingApplication' SINCE 60 minutes ago FACET name TIMESERIES 1 minute EXTRAPOLATE Copy FACET clause SELECT ... FACET attribute ... Copy Use FACET to separate and group your results by attribute values. For example, you could FACET your PageView data by deviceType to figure out what percentage of your traffic comes from mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. Use the LIMIT clause to specify how many facets appear (default is 10). For more complex grouping, use FACET CASES. FACET clauses support up to five attributes, separated by commas. The facets are sorted in descending order by the first field you provide in the SELECT clause. If you are faceting on attributes with more than 2,000 unique values, a subset of facet values is selected and sorted according to the query type. When selecting min(), max(), or count(), FACET uses those functions to determine how facets are picked and sorted. When selecting any other function, FACET uses the frequency of the attribute you are faceting on to determine how facets are picked and sorted. Faceted query using count() This query shows cities with the highest pageview counts. This query uses the total number of pageviews per city to determine how facets are picked and ordered. SELECT count(*) FROM PageView FACET city Copy Faceted query using uniqueCount() This query shows the cities that access the highest number of unique URLs. This query uses the total number of times a particular city appears in the results to determine how facets are picked and ordered. SELECT uniqueCount(pageUrl) FROM PageView FACET city Copy Grouping results across time Advanced segmentation and cohort analysis allow you to facet on bucket functions to more effectively break out your data. Cohort analysis is a way to group results together based on timestamps. You can separate them into buckets that cover a specified range of dates and times. FACET ... AS clause Use FACET ... AS to name facets using the AS keyword in queries. This clause is helpful for adding clearer or simplified names for facets in your results. It can also be used to rename facets in nested aggregation queries. FACET ... AS queries will change the facet names in results (when they appear as headers in tables, for example), but not the actual facet names themselves. FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) FACET response.headers.contentType AS 'content type' Copy FACET CASES clause SELECT ... FACET CASES ( WHERE attribute operator value, WHERE attribute operator value, ... ) ... Copy Use FACET CASES to break out your data by more complex conditions than possible with FACET. Separate multiple conditions with a comma ,. For example, you could query your PageView data and FACET CASES into categories like less than 1 second, from 1 to 10 seconds, and greater than 10 seconds. You can combine multiple attributes within your cases, and label the cases with the AS selector. Data points will be added to at most one facet case, the first facet case that they match. You may also use a time function with your attribute, and you can use the OR operator to facet results that don't match any of your specified cases. Basic usage with WHERE SELECT count(*) FROM PageView FACET CASES (WHERE duration < 1, WHERE duration > 1 and duration < 10, WHERE duration > 10) Copy Group based on multiple attributes This example groups results into one bucket where the transaction name contains login, and another where the URL contains login and a custom attribute indicates that the user was a paid user: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid') Copy Label groups with AS This example uses the AS selector to give your results a human-readable name: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%' AS 'Total Logins', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid' AS 'Feature Visits from Paid Users') Copy Facet non-matching data with OR This example uses the OR operator to facet results that didn't match any of your cases: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid') OR name Copy FACET ... ORDER BY clause In NRQL, the default is for the first aggregation in the SELECT clause to guide the selection of facets in a query. FACET ... ORDER BY allows you to override this default behavior by adding an aggregate function with the ORDER BY modifier to specify how facets are selected. Specifically, the clause will override the priority by which facets are chosen to be in the final result before being limited by the LIMIT clause. This clause can be used in querying but not for alerts or streaming. This example shows how to use FACET ... ORDER BY to find the average durations of app transactions, showing the top 10 (default limit) highest durations by apps which have the highest response size. In this case, if FACET ... ORDER BY is not used, the query results will instead show the top 10 by highest durations, with response size being irrelevant to the app selection. FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) TIMESERIES FACET appName ORDER BY max(responseSize) Copy Tip Because the operations are performed before the LIMIT clause is applied, FACET ... ORDER BY does not impact the sort of the final query results, which will be particularly noticeable in the results for non-timeseries queries. Important The ORDER BY modifier in this case works differently than the ORDER BY clause. When parsing queries that follow the format FACET attribute1 ORDER BY attribute2, New Relic will read these as FACET ... ORDER BY queries, but only if ORDER BY appears immediately after FACET. Otherwise ORDER BY will be interpreted by New Relic as a clause. LIMIT clause SELECT ... LIMIT count ... Copy Use the LIMIT clause to control the maximum number of facet values returned by FACET queries or the maximum number of items returned by SELECT * queries. This clause takes a single integer value as an argument. If the LIMIT clause is not specified, or no value is provided, the limit defaults to 10 for FACET queries and 100 in the case of SELECT * queries. The maximum allowed value for the LIMIT clause is 2,000. Query using LIMIT This query shows the top 20 countries by session count and provides 95th percentile of response time for each country for Windows users only. SELECT uniqueCount(session), percentile(duration, 95) FROM PageView WHERE userAgentOS = 'Windows' FACET countryCode LIMIT 20 SINCE YESTERDAY Copy OFFSET clause SELECT ... LIMIT count OFFSET count ... Copy Use the OFFSET clause with LIMIT to control the portion of rows returned by SELECT * or SELECT column queries. Like the LIMIT clause, OFFSET takes a single integer value as an argument. OFFSET sets the number of rows to be skipped before the selected rows of your query are returned. This is constrained by LIMIT. OFFSET rows are skipped starting from the most recent record. For example, the query SELECT interestingValue FROM Minute_Report LIMIT 5 OFFSET 1 returns the last 5 values from Minute_Report except for the most recent one. ORDER BY clause The ORDER BY clause allows you to specify how you want to sort your query results in queries that select event attributes by row. This query orders transactions by duration. FROM Transaction SELECT appName, duration ORDER BY duration Copy The default sort order is ascending, but this can be changed by adding the ASC or DESC modifiers. SHOW EVENT TYPES clause SHOW EVENT TYPES... Copy SHOW EVENT TYPES will return a list of all the data types present in your account for a specific time range. It is used as the first clause in a query instead of SELECT. Important In this context, \"event types\" refers to the data types you can access with a NRQL query. Data types in the last day This query will return all the data types present over the past day: SHOW EVENT TYPES SINCE 1 day ago Copy SINCE clause SELECT ... SINCE [numerical units AGO | phrase] ... Copy The default value is 1 hour ago. Use the SINCE clause to define the beginning of a time range for the returned data. When using NRQL, you can set a UTC timestamp or relative time range. You can specify a timezone for the query but not for the results. NRQL results are based on your system time. SLIDE BY clause The SLIDE BY clause supports a feature known as sliding windows. With sliding windows,SLIDE BY data is gathered into \"windows\" of time that overlap with each other. These windows can help to smooth out line graphs with a lot of variation in cases where the rolling aggregate (such as a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. To use SLIDE BY, place it in a query after the TIMESERIES clause. For example, this query pulls data in 5-minute windows with a 1-minute SLIDE BY interval, meaning that each window lasts 5 minutes, but window 1 starts at 0 minutes, window 2 starts at 1 minute, window 3 starts at 2 minutes, and so on. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY 1 minute Copy To learn more about how and when you can use SLIDE BY, see Create smoother charts with sliding windows. Use SLIDE BY with MAX or AUTO interval You can use sliding windows in combination with MAX or AUTO. However, MAX or AUTO may not be placed between TIMESERIES and SLIDE BY. This query will automatically decide a SLIDE BY window interval. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY AUTO Copy This query will set the SLIDE BY window to the maximum interval granularity. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY MAX Copy Important The SLIDE BY value as determined by AUTO or MAX can produce a step interval greater than the window size, which can cause gaps and unexpected results. TIMESERIES clause SELECT ... TIMESERIES integer units ... Copy Use the TIMESERIES clause to return data as a time series broken out by a specified period of time. Since TIMESERIES is used to trigger certain charts, there is no default value. To indicate the time range, use integer units. For example: TIMESERIES 1 minute TIMESERIES 30 minutes TIMESERIES 1 hour TIMESERIES 30 seconds TIMESERIES can be combined with arguments such as MAX, AUTO, and SLIDE BY to further tailor query results, as shown in the examples below. Important For functions such as average( ) or percentile( ), a large aggregation window can have a significant smoothing effect on outliers. This is true whether or not the query makes use of sliding windows. Use a set interval The value provided indicates the units used to break out the graph. For example, to present a one-day graph showing 30 minute increments: SELECT ... SINCE 1 day AGO TIMESERIES 30 minutes Copy Use an automatically set interval TIMESERIES can also be set to AUTO, which will divide your graph into a reasonable number of divisions. For example, a daily chart will be divided into 30 minute intervals and a weekly chart will be divided into 6 hour intervals. This query returns data as a line chart showing the 50th and 90th percentile of client-side transaction time for one week with a data point every 6 hours. SELECT average(duration), percentile(duration, 50, 90) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week AGO TIMESERIES AUTO Copy Use MAX interval You can set TIMESERIES to MAX, which will automatically adjust your time window to the maximum number of intervals allowed for a given time period. This allows you to update your time windows without having to manually update your TIMESERIES buckets and ensures your time window is being split into the peak number of intervals allowed. The maximum number of TIMESERIES buckets that will be returned is 366. For example, the following query creates 4-minute intervals, which is the ceiling for a daily chart. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction since 1 day ago TIMESERIES MAX Copy UNTIL clause SELECT ... UNTIL integer units AGO ... Copy The default value is NOW. Only use UNTIL to specify an end point other than the default. Use the UNTIL clause to define the end of a time range across which to return data. Once a time range has been specified, the data will be preserved and can be reviewed after the time range has ended. See Use the time picker to adjust time settings for detailed information and examples. WHERE clause Use the WHERE clause to filter results. NRQL returns the results that fulfill the condition(s) you specify in the clause. SELECT function(attribute) ... WHERE attribute [operator 'value' | IN ('value' [, 'value]) | IS [NOT] NULL ] [AND|OR ...] ... Copy If you specify more than one condition, separate the conditions by the operators AND or OR. If you want to simulate a SQL join, use custom attributes in a WHERE or FACET clause. Operators that the WHERE clause accepts Description =, !=, <, <=, >, >= NRQL accepts standard comparison operators. Example: state = 'WA' AND Used to define an intersection of two conditions. OR Used to define a union of two conditions. IS NULL Determines if an attribute has a null value. IS NOT NULL Determines if an attribute does not have a null value. IN Determines if the string value of an attribute is in a specified set. Using this method yields better performance than stringing together multiple WHERE clauses. Example: animalType IN ('cat', 'dog', 'fish') NOT IN Determines if the string value of an attribute is not in a specified set. Using this method yields better performance than stringing together multiple WHERE clauses. Values must be in parentheses, separated by commas. For example: SELECT * FROM PageView WHERE countryCode NOT IN ('CA', 'WA') Copy LIKE Determines if an attribute contains a specified sub-string. The string argument for the LIKE operator accepts the percent sign (%) as a wildcard anywhere in the string. If the substring does not begin or end the string you are matching against, the wildcard must begin or end the string. Examples: userAgentName LIKE 'IE%' IE IE Mobile userAgentName LIKE 'o%a%' Opera Opera Mini userAgentName LIKE 'o%a' Opera userAgentName LIKE '%o%a%' Opera Opera Mini Mozilla Gecko NOT LIKE Determines if an attribute does not contain a specified sub-string. RLIKE Determines if an attribute contains a specified Regex sub-string. Uses RE2 syntax. Examples: appName RLIKE r'z.*|q.*'' hostname RLIKE r'ip-10-351-[0-2]?[0-9]-.*' z-app q-app ip-10-351-19-237 ip-10-351-2-41 ip-10-351-24-238 ip-10-351-14-15 Important Regex defaults to full-string matching, therefore ^ and $ are implicit and you do not need to add them. NOT RLIKE Determines if an attribute does not contain a specified Regex sub-string. Uses RE2 syntax. Example query with three conditions This query returns the browser response time for pages with checkout in the URL for Safari users in the United States and Canada over the past 24 hours. SELECT histogram(duration, 50, 20) FROM PageView WHERE countryCode IN ('CA', 'US') AND userAgentName='Safari' AND pageUrl LIKE '%checkout%' SINCE 1 day ago Copy WITH METRIC_FORMAT clause For information on querying metric data, see Query metrics. WITH TIMEZONE clause SELECT ... WITH TIMEZONE (selected zone) ... Copy By default, query results are displayed in the timezone of the browser you're using. Use the WITH TIMEZONE clause to select a time zone for a date or time in the query that hasn't already had a time zone specified for it. For example, the query clause SINCE Monday UNTIL Tuesday WITH TIMEZONE 'America/New_York' will return data recorded from Monday at midnight, Eastern Standard Time, until midnight Tuesday, Eastern Standard Time.

Query metric data Metric data is more complex than other types of data. There are specific tips for querying it well. We have two types of metric data, each with their own query guidelines: Query dimensional metrics, which are reported by our Metric API and by some of our tools that use that API, like our Telemetry SDKs and our open-source telemetry integrations (OpenTelemetry, Kamon, Micrometer, more). Query metric timeslice data, which is our original metric data type reported by our APM, mobile monitoring, and browser monitoring. For more on understanding these data types, see Metric data types. Functions In this section we explain NRQL functions, both aggregator functions and non-aggregator functions. Aggregator functions You can use aggregator functions to filter and aggregate data. Some tips for using these: See New Relic University tutorials for Filter queries, Apdex queries, and Percentile queries. Or, go to the full online course Writing NRQL queries. If you're using an aggregator function multiple times in the same query (e.g., SELECT median(one_metric</var>), median(another_metric)), it can cause problems in displaying results. To solve this, use the AS function. For example: SELECT median(one_metric) as 'med-a', median(another_metric) as 'med-b' Data type \"coercion\" is not supported. Read about available type conversion functions. For how to display results over time, see Group results over time. Examples: SELECT histogram(duration, 10, 20) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy aggregationendtime() Use the aggregationendtime() function to return the time of the relevant aggregation. More specifically, for a given aggregate, the aggregationendtime() function provides the timestamp of the end of the time period of that aggregation. For example, in a timeseries query, for a data point that encompasses an hour’s worth of data, the function would return the timestamp of the end of that hour period. apdex(attribute, t: ) Use the apdex function to return an Apdex score for a single transaction or for all your transactions. The attribute can be any attribute based on response time, such as duration or backendDuration. The t: argument defines an Apdex T threshold in seconds. The Apdex score returned by the apdex( ) function is based only on execution time. It does not account for APM errors. If a transaction includes an error but completes in Apdex T or less, that transaction will be rated satisfying by the apdex ( ) function. Get Apdex for specific customers If you have defined custom attributes, you can filter based on those attributes. For example, you could monitor the Apdex for a particularly important customer: SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.4) FROM Transaction WHERE customerName='ReallyImportantCustomer' SINCE 1 day ago Copy Get Apdex for specific transaction Use the name attribute to return a score for a specific transaction, or return an overall Apdex by omitting name. This query returns an Apdex score for the Controller/notes/index transaction over the last hour: The apdex function returns an Apdex score that measures user satisfaction with your site. Arguments are a response time attribute and an Apdex T threshold in seconds. SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.5) from Transaction WHERE name='Controller/notes/index' SINCE 1 hour ago Copy Get overall Apdex for your app This example query returns an overall Apdex for the application over the last three weeks: SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.08) FROM Transaction SINCE 3 week ago Copy average(attribute) Use the average( ) function to return the average value for an attribute. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. buckets(attribute, ceiling [,number of buckets]) Use the buckets() function to aggregate data split up by a FACET clause into buckets based on ranges. You can bucket by any attribute that is stored as a numerical value in the New Relic database. It takes three arguments: Attribute name Maximum value of the sample range. Any outliers will appear in the final bucket. Total number of buckets For more information and examples, see Split your data into buckets. bucketPercentile(attribute) The bucketPercentile( ) function is the NRQL equivalent of the histogram_quantile function in Prometheus. It is intended to be used with dimensional metric data. Instead of the quantile, New Relic returns the percentile, which is the quantile * 100. Use the bucketPercentile( ) function to calculate the quantile from the histogram data in a Prometheus format. It takes the bucket name as an argument and reports percentiles along the bucket's boundaries: SELECT bucketPercentile(duration_bucket) FROM Metric SINCE 1 day ago Copy Optionally, you can add percentile specifications as an argument: SELECT bucketPercentile(duration_bucket, 50, 75, 90) FROM Metric SINCE 1 day ago Copy Because multiple metrics are used to make up Prometheus histogram data, you must query for specific Prometheus metrics in terms of the associated <basename>. For example, to compute percentiles from a Prometheus histogram, with the <basename> prometheus_http_request_duration_seconds using NRQL, use bucketPercentile(prometheus_http_request_duration_seconds_bucket, 50). Note how _ bucket is added to the end of the <basename> as a suffix. See the Prometheus.io documentation for more information. cardinality(attribute) Use the cardinality( ) function to obtain the number of combinations of all the dimensions (attributes) on a metric. It takes three arguments, all optional: Metric name: if present, cardinality( ) only computes the metric specified. Include: if present, the include list restricts the cardinality computation to those attributes. Exclude: if present, the exclude list causes those attributes to be ignored in the cardinality computation. SELECT cardinality(metric_name, include:{attribute_list}, exclude:{attribute_list}) Copy count(*) Use the count( ) function to return a count of available records. It takes a single argument; either *, an attribute, or a constant value. Currently, it follows typical SQL behavior and counts all records that have values for its argument. Since count(*) does not name a specific attribute, the results will be formatted in the default \"humanize\" format. derivative(attribute [,time interval]) derivative() finds the rate of change for a given dataset. The rate of change is calculated using a linear least-squares regression to approximate the derivative. Since this calculation requires comparing more than one datapoint, if only one datapoint is included in the evaluation range, the calculation is indeterminate and won't work, resulting in a null value. The time interval is the period for which the rate of change is calculated. For example, derivative(attributeName, 1 minute) will return the rate of change per minute. dimensions(include: {attributes}, exclude: {attributes}) Use the dimensions( ) function to return all the dimensional values on a data type. You can explicitly include or exclude specific attributes using the optional arguments: Include: if present, the include list limits dimensions( ) to those attributes. Exclude: if present, the dimensions( ) calculation ignores those attributes. FROM Metric SELECT count(node_filesystem_size) TIMESERIES FACET dimensions() Copy When used with a FACET clause, dimensions( ) produces a unique timeseries for all facets available on the event type, similar to how Prometheus behaves with non-aggregated queries. latestrate(attribute, time interval) Use the latestrate( ) function to return the rate of change of a value based on the last 2 data points. It takes the attribute in question as the first argument and the unit of time for the resulting rate as the second argument. The function returns a result in units of change in attribute/time interval. This function can be useful to provide the most recent rate of change for an attribute in order to see leading-edge trends. Get the most recent rate of change of PageView Duration This query returns the rate of change of duration based on the last 2 data points. It will be returned in units of duration/second because of the 1 SECOND argument. SELECT latestrate(duration, 1 SECOND) FROM PageView Copy max(attribute) Use the max( ) function to return the maximum recorded value of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. median(attribute) Use the median( ) function to return an attribute's median, or 50th percentile. For more information about percentile queries, see percentile(). Tip The median( ) query is only available when using the query builder. Median query This query will generate a line chart for the median value. SELECT median(duration) FROM PageView TIMESERIES AUTO Copy min(attribute) Use the min( ) function to return the minimum recorded value of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. minuteOf(attribute) Use the minuteOf() function to extract only the minute portion (i.e. 0-59) of an attribute holding a valid timestamp value. mod(attribute, divisor) Use the mod( ) function to return the floor modulus after dividing the value of the provided numeric attribute (the first argument, or dividend) by a numeric value (the second argument, or divisor). This modulo operation can be used within a WHERE clause condition to filter to an arbitrary subset of results or within a FACET clause as a way to subdivide the result set. mod() within a WHERE clause condition FROM Transaction SELECT * WHERE mod(port, 2) = 1 Copy mod() within a FACET clause FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT uniques(hostId, 10000) SINCE 1 day AGO FACET mod(hostId, 10) Copy percentage(function(attribute), WHERE condition) Use the percentage( ) function to return the percentage of a target data set that matches some condition. The first argument requires an aggregator function against the desired attribute. Use exactly two arguments (arguments after the first two will be ignored). If the attribute is not numeric, this function returns a value of 100%. percentile(attribute [, percentile [, ...]]) Use the percentile( ) function to return an attribute's approximate value at a given percentile. It requires an attribute and can take any number of arguments representing percentile points. The percentile() function enables percentiles to displays with up to three digits after the decimal point, providing greater precision. Percentile thresholds may be specified as decimal values, but be aware that for most data sets, percentiles closer than 0.1 from each other will not be resolved. Percentile display examples Use TIMESERIES to generate a line chart with percentiles mapped over time. Omit TIMESERIES to generate a billboard and attribute sheet showing aggregate values for the percentiles. If no percentiles are listed, the default is the 95th percentile. To return only the 50th percentile value, the median, you can also use median(). Basic percentile query This query will generate a line chart with lines for the 5th, 50th, and 95th percentile. SELECT percentile(duration, 5, 50, 95) FROM PageView TIMESERIES AUTO Copy predictLinear(attribute, [,time interval]) predictLinear() is an extension of the derivative() function. It uses a similar method of least-squares linear regression to predict the future values for a dataset. The time interval is how far the query will look into the future. For example, predictLinear(attributeName, 1 hour) is a linear prediction 1 hour into the future of the query time window. Generally, predictLinear() is helpful for continuously growing values like disk space, or predictions on large trends. Since predictLinear() is a linear regression, familiarity with the dataset being queried helps to ensure accurate long-term predictions. Any dataset which grows exponentially, logarithmically, or by other nonlinear means will likely only be successful in very short-term predictions. New Relic recommends against using predictLinear in TIMESERIES queries. This is because each bucket will be making an individual prediction based on its relative timeframe within the query, meaning that such queries will not show predictions from the end of the timeseries forward. rate(function(attribute) [,time interval]) Use the rate( ) function to visualize the frequency or rate of a given query per time interval. For example, you might want to know the number of pageviews per minute over an hour-long period or the count of unique sessions on your site per hour over a day-long period. Use TIMESERIES to generate a line chart with rates mapped over time. Omit TIMESERIES to generate a billboard showing a single rate value averaged over time. Basic rate query This query will generate a line chart showing the rate of throughput for APM transactions per 10 minutes over the past 6 hours. SELECT rate(count(*), 10 minute) FROM Transaction SINCE 6 hours ago TIMESERIES Copy round(attribute) Use the round( ) function to return the rounded value of an attribute. Optionally round( ) can take a second argument, to_nearest, to round the first argument to the closest multiple of the second one. to_nearest can be fractional. SELECT round(n [, to_nearest]) Copy stddev(attribute) Use the stddev( ) function to return one standard deviation for a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. stdvar(attribute) Use the stdvar( ) function to return the standard variance for a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. sum(attribute) Use the sum( ) function to return the sum recorded values of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. uniqueCount(attribute) Use the uniqueCount( ) function to return the number of unique values recorded for an attribute over the time range specified. Tip To optimize query performance, this function returns approximate results for queries that inspect more than 256 unique values. uniques(attribute [,limit]) Use the uniques( ) function to return a list of unique values recorded for an attribute over the time range specified. When used along with the facet clause, a list of unique attribute values will be returned per each facet value. The limit parameter is optional. When it is not provided, the default limit of 1,000 unique attribute values per facet is applied. You may specify a different limit value, up to a maximum of 10,000. The uniques( ) function will return the first set of unique attribute values discovered, until the limit is reached. Therefore, if you have 5,000 unique attribute values in your data set, and the limit is set to 1,000, the operator will return the first 1,000 unique values that it discovers, regardless of their frequency. The maximum number of values that can be returned in a query result is the product of the uniques( ) limit times the facet limit. In the following query, the theoretical maximum number of values that can be returned is 5 million (5,000 x 1,000). Depending on the data set being queried, and the complexity of the query, memory protection limits may prevent a very large query from being executed. From Transaction SELECT uniques(host,5000) FACET appName LIMIT 1000 Copy Using tuple If you'd like to know the unique combinations of a handful of attributes, you can structure a query in the format SELECT uniques(tuple(x, y, ... z)) ...` to get all the unique tuples of values, to maintain their relationship. In the following query, tuple is used on index and cellName together to find uniques where those two values occur in combination. FROM NodeStatus SELECT uniques(tuple(index, cellName), 5) Copy capture(attribute, regular expression) Use the capture() to extract values from an attribute using a regular expression. Uses RE2 syntax. It takes two arguments: Attribute name Regular expression with capture syntax. Regex expressions in NRQL use Python-like syntax, r'...'. When capturing, use the RE2 named-capture syntax ...(?P<name> pattern )... to capture the contained pattern, given the specified name. Currently, only 1 capture group is supported. Please see the examples below. capture() within a SELECT clause condition The following will select the domain name of the website, removing https:// and any paths following the .com SELECT capture(pageUrl, r'https://(?P<baseUrl>.*.com)/.+') FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago Copy The following will capture only the first word of the error message. SELECT capture(errorMessage, r'(?P<firstWord>\\S+)\\s.+') FROM Transaction SINCE 1 hour ago where errorMessage is not null Copy capture() within a FACET clause condition The following will facet by the captured HTTP method. SELECT count(*) FROM Log WHERE message like '%HTTP%' FACET capture(message, r'.* \"(?P<httpMethod>[A-Z]+) .*') Copy capture() within a WHERE clause condition The following will filter the results based on Log events with message attribute that matches the regular expression where the captured job name is ExampleJob. SELECT message FROM Log WHERE capture(message, r'.*Job Failed: (?P<jobName>[A-Za-z]+),.*') = 'ExampleJob' SINCE 10 minutes ago Copy capture() with a numeric cast The following will capture sum of CPU Time from log lines. You must explicitly cast to numeric to do mathematical operations. SELECT sum(numeric(capture(message, r'.*CpuTime:\\s(?P<cpuTime>\\d+)'))) FROM Log WHERE message like '%CpuTime:%' SINCE 1 hour ago Copy Non-aggregator functions Use non-aggregator functions for non-numerical data in NRQL queries. earliest(attribute) Use the earliest( ) function to return the earliest value for an attribute over the specified time range. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If used in conjunction with a FACET it will return the most recent value for an attribute for each of the resulting facets. Get earliest country per user agent from PageView This query returns the earliest country code per each user agent from the PageView event. SELECT earliest(countryCode) FROM PageView FACET userAgentName Copy eventType() ...WHERE eventType() = 'EventNameHere'... ...FACET eventType()... Copy Use the eventType() function in a FACET clause to break out results by the selected data type or in a WHERE clause to filter results to a specific data type. This is particularly useful for targeting specific data types with the filter() and percentage() functions. Important In this context, \"event type\" refers to the types of data you can access with a NRQL query. Use eventType() in filter() function This query returns the percentage of total TransactionError results out of the total Transaction results. You can use the eventType() function to target specific types of data with the filter() function. SELECT 100 * filter(count(*), where eventType() = 'TransactionError') / filter(count(*), where eventType() = 'Transaction') FROM Transaction, TransactionError WHERE appName = 'App.Prod' TIMESERIES 2 Minutes SINCE 6 hours ago Copy Use eventType() with FACET This query displays a count of how many records each data type (Transaction and TransactionError) returns. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, TransactionError FACET eventType() TIMESERIES Copy filter(function(attribute), WHERE condition) Use the filter() function to limit the results for one of the aggregator functions in your SELECT statement. You can use filter() in conjunction with FACET or TIMESERIES. Filter is only useful when selecting multiple different aggregations such as SELECT filter(sum(x), WHERE attribute='a') AS 'A', filter(sum(x), WHERE attribute='b') AS 'B' .... Otherwise, it's better to just use the standard WHERE clause. Analyze purchases that used offer codes You could use filter() to compare the items bought in a set of transactions for those using an offer code versus those who aren't: Use the filter( ) function to limit the results for one of the aggregator functions in your SELECT statement. funnel(attribute, steps) Use the funnel() function to generate a funnel chart. It takes an attribute as its first argument. You then specify steps as WHERE clauses (with optional AS clauses for labels) separated by commas. For details and examples, see the funnels documentation. getField(attribute, field) Use the getField() function to extract a field from compound data types, such as metric data. It takes the following arguments: Metric type Supported fields summary count, total, max, min, type gauge count, total, max, min, latest, type distribution count, total, max, min, type counter count, type timeslice count, total, totalExclusive, min, and max Examples: SELECT max(getField(mySummary, count)) from Metric Copy SELECT sum(mySummary) from Metric where getField(mySummary, count) > 10 Copy histogram(attribute, ceiling [,number of buckets]) Use the histogram( ) function to generate histograms. It takes three arguments: Attribute name Maximum value of the sample range Total number of buckets (between 1 and 500, inclusive) Histogram of response times from PageView events This query results in a histogram of response times ranging up to 10 seconds over 20 buckets. SELECT histogram(duration, 10, 20) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy Prometheus histogram buckets histogram( ) accepts Prometheus histogram buckets: SELECT histogram(duration_bucket, 10, 20) FROM Metric SINCE 1 week ago Copy New Relic distribution metric histogram( ) accepts Distribution metric as an input: SELECT histogram(myDistributionMetric, 10, 20) FROM Metric SINCE 1 week ago Copy Histogram with a FACET clause Use histogram( ) with a FACET clause to generate a heatmap chart: SELECT histogram(duration) FROM PageView FACET appName SINCE 1 week ago Copy keyset() Using keyset() will allow you to see all of the attributes for a given data type over a given time range. It takes no arguments. It returns a JSON structure containing groups of string-typed keys, numeric-typed keys, boolean-typed keys, and all keys. See all attributes for a data type This query returns the attributes found for PageView events from the last day: SELECT keyset() FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago Copy latest(attribute) Use the latest( ) function to return the most recent value for an attribute over a specified time range. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If used in conjunction with a FACET it will return the most recent value for an attribute for each of the resulting facets. Get most recent country per user agent from PageView This query returns the most recent country code per each user agent from the PageView event. SELECT latest(countryCode) FROM PageView FACET userAgentName Copy Type conversion NRQL does not support \"coercion.\" This means that a float stored as a string is treated as a string and cannot be operated on by functions expecting float values. You can convert a string with a numeric value or a boolean with a string value to their numeric and boolean types with these functions: Use the numeric() function to convert a number with a string format to a numeric function. The function can be built into a query that uses math functions on query results or NRQL aggregator functions, such as average(). Use the boolean() function to convert a string value of \"true\" or \"false\" to the corresponding boolean value.",

      "body": "One way to query your New Relic data is with the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). This resource explains what NRQL is, when and how you can use it, and basic syntax rules. For more detailed information on querying, including a listing of clauses and functions and example queries, see NRQL syntax, clauses, and functions. What is NRQL? NRQL is New Relic's SQL-like query language. You can use NRQL to retrieve detailed New Relic data and get insight into your applications, hosts, and business-important activity. Reasons to use NRQL include: To answer a question for the purpose of troubleshooting or business analysis To create a new chart To make API queries of New Relic data (for example, using our NerdGraph API) NRQL is used behind the scenes to generate some New Relic charts: Some New Relic charts are built using NRQL. One way to start using NRQL is to view a chart's query and then edit it to make your own custom chart. Where can you use NRQL? You can use NRQL in these places: New Relic One query builder NerdGraph: our GraphQL-format API, which includes options for making NRQL queries one.newrelic.com > Query your data: You can run a NRQL query in New Relic One. This NRQL query shows a count of distributed tracing spans faceted by their entity names. NRQL is one of several ways to query New Relic data. For more on all query options, see Query your data. What data can you query with NRQL? NRQL allows you to query these New Relic data types: Event data from all New Relic products, including: APM events, like Transaction Browser monitoring events, like PageView Mobile monitoring events, like Mobile Infrastructure events, like ProcessSample Synthetics events, like SyntheticCheck Custom events, like those reported by the Event API Metric timeslice data (metrics reported by APM, browser, and mobile) The Metric data type (metrics reported by the Metric API and data sources that use that API) The Span data type (distributed tracing data) The Log data type (data from New Relic Logs) Tip Some data, like relationships between monitored entities, is not available via NRQL but is available using our NerdGraph API. Start using NRQL One way to start using NRQL and to understand what data you have available is to go to a NRQL interface (for example, the New Relic One query builder), type FROM, and press space. The interface will suggest available types of data: To see the attributes available for a specific data type, type FROM DATA_TYPE SELECT and press space. The interface will suggest available attributes. For example: To see the complete JSON associated with a data type, including all of its attributes, use the keyset() attribute. For example: FROM Transaction SELECT keyset() Copy NRQL is used behind the scenes to build some New Relic charts and dashboards. One way to learn NRQL is to find one of these NRQL-generated charts and start playing with the NRQL to create new, customized queries and charts: Charts built with NRQL will have View query as an option. You can then edit and customize that query to see how your changes affect the resulting visualization. Important To explore your data without having to use NRQL, use the data explorer. Learn more about querying data in New Relic. NRQL query examples Here's an example NRQL query of Transaction data, which is reported by APM. FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) FACET appName TIMESERIES auto Copy This would generate a chart that looks like: Here are some more query examples: Basic NRQL query of browser data Here's a NRQL query of PageView data from browser monitoring. SELECT uniqueCount(user) FROM PageView WHERE userAgentOS = 'Mac' FACET countryCode SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 20 Copy Attribute name with a space in it If a custom attribute name has a space in it, use backticks around the attribute name: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET `Logged-in user` Copy Querying multiple data sources To return data from two data sources, separate their data types with a comma. For example, this query returns a count of all APM transactions and browser events over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, PageView SINCE 3 days ago Copy Query returning multiple columns To return multiple columns from a dataset, separate the aggregator arguments with a comma: SELECT function(attribute), function(attribute) ... FROM ... Copy This query returns the minimum, average, and maximum duration for browser monitoring PageView events over the last week: SELECT min(duration), max(duration), average(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy See more NRQL query examples. NRQL syntax The syntax of a NRQL query is similar to standard SQL queries. Here is a breakdown of the structure of a NRQL query: SELECT function(attribute) [AS 'label'][, ...] FROM data type [WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...]][AS 'label'][, ...] [FACET attribute | function(attribute)] [LIMIT number] [SINCE time] [UNTIL time] [WITH TIMEZONE timezone] [COMPARE WITH time] [TIMESERIES time] Copy Basic rules include: NRQL condition Details Required values The SELECT statement and FROM clause are required. All other clauses are optional. You can start your query with either SELECT or FROM. Query string size The query string must be less than 4 KB. Case sensitivity The data type names and attribute names are case sensitive. NRQL clauses and functions are not case sensitive. Syntax for strings NRQL uses single quotes to designate strings. For example: ... where traceId = '030a573f0df02c57' Copy Attribute names with spaces Use backticks `` to quote a custom attribute name that has a space in it. For example: ... FACET `Logged-in user` Copy Data type coercion Insights does not support data type \"coercion.\" For more information, see Data type conversion. Use of math functions Basic and advanced math functions are supported in the SELECT statement. JOIN functions NRQL does not have the equivalent of the SQL JOIN function, but you can simulate a JOIN with custom attributes. Read more about NRQL syntax and functions.",

      "body": "BETA FEATURE This feature is currently in beta. Dimensional metrics are an industry standard for storing and querying metric data. All infrastructure metrics are stored as event data in New Relic, but you can also query them through dimensional metrics. In this page you can learn: The benefits of dimensional metrics. A few examples on how and where to use them. Known issues. Why it matters At New Relic we report metrics in several ways, including dimensional metrics, which are used by our metric API, Telemetry SDK, some open-source integrations, and our infrastructure services. This type of metric enables you to: Enjoy an improved query experience for Infrastructure data. Discover all your metrics in one place. Tap into more metric sources, such as Prometheus. For example, the query to get the maximum duration of your Lambda functions is simplified: Query with samples FROM ServerlessSample SELECT max(provider.duration.Maximum) WHERE provider = 'LambdaFunction' Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT max(aws.lambda.function.duration) Copy Get started No agent or integration updates are required to use these metrics. NRQL alerting based on dimensional metrics is also supported, except for data coming from cloud integrations (that is metrics from AWS polling integrations, GCP, and Azure). AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams metrics are ingested as dimensional metrics and NRQL alerts are recommended. Where and how to query dimensional metrics All current NRQL query features are supported. Queries can use WHERE, FACET, and time selection functions such as SINCE, UNTIL, and COMPARE WITH. The query builder in New Relic One supports metrics in both simple and advanced (NRQL) mode. Naming conventions for metrics and attributes All metric names and attributes for dimensional metrics follow the same naming convention in order to make them easy to find and use. Metric and attribute names are namespaced with dots: for example, the host. prefix is used for host metrics, the k8s. prefix is used for Kubernetes metrics, and aws. is used for AWS metrics. The graphic below shows how a ProcessSample that contains three metrics (cpuPercent, ioTotalReadBytes, and ioTotalWriteBytes) is split into three separate metrics. Note the updated naming of the metrics and the attributes. Dimensional metrics naming convention Examples Here are some examples of NQRL queries with and without dimensional metrics: AWS EBS query example Get the total write time by EBS Volume. Query with samples FROM BlockDeviceSample SELECT sum('provider.volumeTotalWriteTime.Sum') WHERE provider = 'EbsVolume' FACET entityName Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT sum(aws.ebs.volume.TotalWriteTime) FACET entity.name Copy Azure Service bus query example Maximum number of messages in an Azure Service Bus topic by resource group. Query with samples FROM AzureServiceBusTopicSample SELECT max(activeMessages.Maximum) FACET resourceGroupName Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT max(azure.servicebus.topic.activeMessages) FACET azure.resourceGroup Copy Azure functions query example Number of function executions Azure Functions over the past 6 hours by region over time. Query with samples FROM AzureFunctionsAppSample SELECT sum(functionExecutionCount.Total) FACET regionName TIMESERIES SINCE 6 hours ago Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT sum(azure.functions.app.functionExecutionCount) FACET azure.region TIMESERIES SINCE 6 hours ago Copy Azure VMs query example Compare the number of Azure VMs over the past thirty minutes with the same time a week ago. Query with samples FROM AzureVirtualMachineScaleSetSample SELECT uniqueCount(vMName) FACET name SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO COMPARE WITH 1 WEEK AGO Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT uniqueCount(azure.vms.vmName) FACET azure.resourceName WHERE azure.resourceType='Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachineScaleSets' SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO COMPARE WITH 1 WEEK AGO Copy NGINX query example The average number of NGINX requests per second over time. Query with samples FROM NginxSample SELECT average(net.requestsPerSecond) TIMESERIES Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT average(nginx.server.net.requestsPerSecond) TIMESERIES Copy MySQL query example The maximum number of used MySQL connections. Query with samples FROM MysqlSample SELECT max(net.maxUsedConnections) Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT max(mysql.node.net.maxUsedConnections) Copy Known limitations Metric queries with * do not return Infrastructure sample data (for example, SELECT * FROM Metric). In order to select attributes starting with tags. a metric name has to be provided. For example, SELECT uniques(tags.environment) FROM Metric WHERE metricName='aws.lambda.function.duration' does not work without the WHERE clause. Results may not be complete if the selection criteria matches too many samples. For example, SELECT uniqueCount(entity.guid) FROM Metric maps to all Infrastructure samples, and may return incomplete results. Initially there is no support for the newly introduced metric wildcarding feature (for example, SELECT average(host.swap%Bytes) FROM Metric).",

Syntax This document is a reference for the functions and clauses used in a NRQL query. Other resources for understanding NRQL: Intro to NRQL: explains what NRQL is used for, what data you can query with it, and basic NRQL syntax Examine NRQL queries used to build New Relic charts Learn how to query the Metric data type Simulate SQL JOIN functions Use funnels to evaluate a series of related data Format NRQL for querying with the Event API Query components Every NRQL query will begin with a SELECT statement or a FROM clause. All other clauses are optional. The clause definitions below also contain example NRQL queries. Required clauses Required: SELECT statement SELECT attribute ... Copy SELECT function(attribute) ... Copy The SELECT specifies what portion of a data type you want to query by specifying an attribute or a function. It's followed by one or more arguments separated by commas. In each argument you can: Get the values of all available attributes by using * as a wildcard. For example: SELECT * from Transaction. Get values associated with a specified attribute or multiple attributes specified in a comma separated list. Get aggregated values from specified attributes by selecting an aggregator function. Label the results returned in each argument with the AS clause. You can also use SELECT with basic math functions. Avg response time since last week This query returns the average response time since last week. SELECT average(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy Required: FROM clause SELECT ... FROM data type ... Copy Use the FROM clause to specify the data type you wish to query. You can start your query with FROM or with SELECT. You can merge values for the same attributes across multiple data types in a comma separated list. Query one data type This query returns the count of all APM transactions over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction SINCE 3 days ago Copy Query multiple data types This query returns the count of all APM transactions and browser events over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, PageView SINCE 3 days ago Copy Optional clauses AS clause SELECT ... AS 'label' ... Copy Use the AS clause to label an attribute, aggregator, step in a funnel, or the result of a math function with a string delimited by single quotes. The label is used in the resulting chart. Query using math function and AS This query returns the number of page views per session: SELECT count(*)/uniqueCount(session) AS 'Pageviews per Session' FROM PageView Copy Query using funnel and AS This query returns a count of people who have visited both the main page and the careers page of a site over the past week: SELECT funnel(SESSION, WHERE name='Controller/about/main' AS 'Step 1', WHERE name = 'Controller/about/careers' AS 'Step 2') FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy COMPARE WITH clause SELECT ... (SINCE or UNTIL) (integer units) AGO COMPARE WITH (integer units) AGO ... Copy Use the COMPARE WITH clause to compare the values for two different time ranges. COMPARE WITH requires a SINCE or UNTIL statement. The time specified by COMPARE WITH is relative to the time specified by SINCE or UNTIL. For example, SINCE 1 day ago COMPARE WITH 1 day ago compares yesterday with the day before. The time range for theCOMPARE WITH value is always the same as that specified by SINCE or UNTIL. For example, SINCE 2 hours ago COMPARE WITH 4 hours ago might compare 3:00pm through 5:00pm against 11:00am through 1:00pm. COMPARE WITH can be formatted as either a line chart or a billboard: With TIMESERIES, COMPARE WITH creates a line chart with the comparison mapped over time. Without TIMESERIES, COMPARE WITH generates a billboard with the current value and the percent change from the COMPARE WITH value. Example: This query returns data as a line chart showing the 95th percentile for the past hour compared to the same range one week ago. First as a single value, then as a line chart. SELECT percentile(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago COMPARE WITH 1 week AGO SELECT percentile(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago COMPARE WITH 1 week AGO TIMESERIES AUTO Copy EXTRAPOLATE clause You can use this clause with these data types: Transaction TransactionError Custom events reported via APM agent APIs The purpose of EXTRAPOLATE is to mathematically compensate for the effects of APM agent sampling of event data so that query results more closely represent the total activity in your system. This clause will be useful when a APM agent reports so many events that it often passes its harvest cycle reporting limits. When that occurs, the agent begins to sample events. When EXTRAPOLATE is used in a NRQL query that supports its use, the ratio between the reported events and the total events is used to extrapolate a close approximation of the total unsampled data. When it is used in a NRQL query that doesn’t support its use or that hasn’t used sampled data, it has no effect. Important Note that EXTRAPOLATE is most useful for homogenous data (like throughput or error rate). It's not effective when attempting to extrapolate a count of distinct things (like uniqueCount() or uniques()). This clause works only with NRQL queries that use one of the following aggregator functions: apdex average count histogram sum percentage (if function it takes as an argument supports EXTRAPOLATE) rate (if function it takes as an argument supports EXTRAPOLATE) stddev Example of extrapolating throughput A query that will show the extrapolated throughput of a service named interestingApplication. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction WHERE appName='interestingApplication' SINCE 60 minutes ago EXTRAPOLATE Copy Example of extrapolating throughput as a time series A query that will show the extrapolated throughput of a service named interestingApplication by transaction name, displayed as a time series. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction WHERE appName='interestingApplication' SINCE 60 minutes ago FACET name TIMESERIES 1 minute EXTRAPOLATE Copy FACET clause SELECT ... FACET attribute ... Copy Use FACET to separate and group your results by attribute values. For example, you could FACET your PageView data by deviceType to figure out what percentage of your traffic comes from mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. Use the LIMIT clause to specify how many facets appear (default is 10). For more complex grouping, use FACET CASES. FACET clauses support up to five attributes, separated by commas. The facets are sorted in descending order by the first field you provide in the SELECT clause. If you are faceting on attributes with more than 2,000 unique values, a subset of facet values is selected and sorted according to the query type. When selecting min(), max(), or count(), FACET uses those functions to determine how facets are picked and sorted. When selecting any other function, FACET uses the frequency of the attribute you are faceting on to determine how facets are picked and sorted. Faceted query using count() This query shows cities with the highest pageview counts. This query uses the total number of pageviews per city to determine how facets are picked and ordered. SELECT count(*) FROM PageView FACET city Copy Faceted query using uniqueCount() This query shows the cities that access the highest number of unique URLs. This query uses the total number of times a particular city appears in the results to determine how facets are picked and ordered. SELECT uniqueCount(pageUrl) FROM PageView FACET city Copy Grouping results across time Advanced segmentation and cohort analysis allow you to facet on bucket functions to more effectively break out your data. Cohort analysis is a way to group results together based on timestamps. You can separate them into buckets that cover a specified range of dates and times. FACET ... AS clause Use FACET ... AS to name facets using the AS keyword in queries. This clause is helpful for adding clearer or simplified names for facets in your results. It can also be used to rename facets in nested aggregation queries. FACET ... AS queries will change the facet names in results (when they appear as headers in tables, for example), but not the actual facet names themselves. FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) FACET response.headers.contentType AS 'content type' Copy FACET CASES clause SELECT ... FACET CASES ( WHERE attribute operator value, WHERE attribute operator value, ... ) ... Copy Use FACET CASES to break out your data by more complex conditions than possible with FACET. Separate multiple conditions with a comma ,. For example, you could query your PageView data and FACET CASES into categories like less than 1 second, from 1 to 10 seconds, and greater than 10 seconds. You can combine multiple attributes within your cases, and label the cases with the AS selector. Data points will be added to at most one facet case, the first facet case that they match. You may also use a time function with your attribute, and you can use the OR operator to facet results that don't match any of your specified cases. Basic usage with WHERE SELECT count(*) FROM PageView FACET CASES (WHERE duration < 1, WHERE duration > 1 and duration < 10, WHERE duration > 10) Copy Group based on multiple attributes This example groups results into one bucket where the transaction name contains login, and another where the URL contains login and a custom attribute indicates that the user was a paid user: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid') Copy Label groups with AS This example uses the AS selector to give your results a human-readable name: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%' AS 'Total Logins', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid' AS 'Feature Visits from Paid Users') Copy Facet non-matching data with OR This example uses the OR operator to facet results that didn't match any of your cases: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid') OR name Copy FACET ... ORDER BY clause In NRQL, the default is for the first aggregation in the SELECT clause to guide the selection of facets in a query. FACET ... ORDER BY allows you to override this default behavior by adding an aggregate function with the ORDER BY modifier to specify how facets are selected. Specifically, the clause will override the priority by which facets are chosen to be in the final result before being limited by the LIMIT clause. This clause can be used in querying but not for alerts or streaming. This example shows how to use FACET ... ORDER BY to find the average durations of app transactions, showing the top 10 (default limit) highest durations by apps which have the highest response size. In this case, if FACET ... ORDER BY is not used, the query results will instead show the top 10 by highest durations, with response size being irrelevant to the app selection. FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) TIMESERIES FACET appName ORDER BY max(responseSize) Copy Tip Because the operations are performed before the LIMIT clause is applied, FACET ... ORDER BY does not impact the sort of the final query results, which will be particularly noticeable in the results for non-timeseries queries. Important The ORDER BY modifier in this case works differently than the ORDER BY clause. When parsing queries that follow the format FACET attribute1 ORDER BY attribute2, New Relic will read these as FACET ... ORDER BY queries, but only if ORDER BY appears immediately after FACET. Otherwise ORDER BY will be interpreted by New Relic as a clause. LIMIT clause SELECT ... LIMIT count ... Copy Use the LIMIT clause to control the maximum number of facet values returned by FACET queries or the maximum number of items returned by SELECT * queries. This clause takes a single integer value as an argument. If the LIMIT clause is not specified, or no value is provided, the limit defaults to 10 for FACET queries and 100 in the case of SELECT * queries. The maximum allowed value for the LIMIT clause is 2,000. Query using LIMIT This query shows the top 20 countries by session count and provides 95th percentile of response time for each country for Windows users only. SELECT uniqueCount(session), percentile(duration, 95) FROM PageView WHERE userAgentOS = 'Windows' FACET countryCode LIMIT 20 SINCE YESTERDAY Copy OFFSET clause SELECT ... LIMIT count OFFSET count ... Copy Use the OFFSET clause with LIMIT to control the portion of rows returned by SELECT * or SELECT column queries. Like the LIMIT clause, OFFSET takes a single integer value as an argument. OFFSET sets the number of rows to be skipped before the selected rows of your query are returned. This is constrained by LIMIT. OFFSET rows are skipped starting from the most recent record. For example, the query SELECT interestingValue FROM Minute_Report LIMIT 5 OFFSET 1 returns the last 5 values from Minute_Report except for the most recent one. ORDER BY clause The ORDER BY clause allows you to specify how you want to sort your query results in queries that select event attributes by row. This query orders transactions by duration. FROM Transaction SELECT appName, duration ORDER BY duration Copy The default sort order is ascending, but this can be changed by adding the ASC or DESC modifiers. SHOW EVENT TYPES clause SHOW EVENT TYPES... Copy SHOW EVENT TYPES will return a list of all the data types present in your account for a specific time range. It is used as the first clause in a query instead of SELECT. Important In this context, \"event types\" refers to the data types you can access with a NRQL query. Data types in the last day This query will return all the data types present over the past day: SHOW EVENT TYPES SINCE 1 day ago Copy SINCE clause SELECT ... SINCE [numerical units AGO | phrase] ... Copy The default value is 1 hour ago. Use the SINCE clause to define the beginning of a time range for the returned data. When using NRQL, you can set a UTC timestamp or relative time range. You can specify a timezone for the query but not for the results. NRQL results are based on your system time. SLIDE BY clause The SLIDE BY clause supports a feature known as sliding windows. With sliding windows,SLIDE BY data is gathered into \"windows\" of time that overlap with each other. These windows can help to smooth out line graphs with a lot of variation in cases where the rolling aggregate (such as a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. To use SLIDE BY, place it in a query after the TIMESERIES clause. For example, this query pulls data in 5-minute windows with a 1-minute SLIDE BY interval, meaning that each window lasts 5 minutes, but window 1 starts at 0 minutes, window 2 starts at 1 minute, window 3 starts at 2 minutes, and so on. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY 1 minute Copy To learn more about how and when you can use SLIDE BY, see Create smoother charts with sliding windows. Use SLIDE BY with MAX or AUTO interval You can use sliding windows in combination with MAX or AUTO. However, MAX or AUTO may not be placed between TIMESERIES and SLIDE BY. This query will automatically decide a SLIDE BY window interval. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY AUTO Copy This query will set the SLIDE BY window to the maximum interval granularity. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY MAX Copy Important The SLIDE BY value as determined by AUTO or MAX can produce a step interval greater than the window size, which can cause gaps and unexpected results. TIMESERIES clause SELECT ... TIMESERIES integer units ... Copy Use the TIMESERIES clause to return data as a time series broken out by a specified period of time. Since TIMESERIES is used to trigger certain charts, there is no default value. To indicate the time range, use integer units. For example: TIMESERIES 1 minute TIMESERIES 30 minutes TIMESERIES 1 hour TIMESERIES 30 seconds TIMESERIES can be combined with arguments such as MAX, AUTO, and SLIDE BY to further tailor query results, as shown in the examples below. Important For functions such as average( ) or percentile( ), a large aggregation window can have a significant smoothing effect on outliers. This is true whether or not the query makes use of sliding windows. Use a set interval The value provided indicates the units used to break out the graph. For example, to present a one-day graph showing 30 minute increments: SELECT ... SINCE 1 day AGO TIMESERIES 30 minutes Copy Use an automatically set interval TIMESERIES can also be set to AUTO, which will divide your graph into a reasonable number of divisions. For example, a daily chart will be divided into 30 minute intervals and a weekly chart will be divided into 6 hour intervals. This query returns data as a line chart showing the 50th and 90th percentile of client-side transaction time for one week with a data point every 6 hours. SELECT average(duration), percentile(duration, 50, 90) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week AGO TIMESERIES AUTO Copy Use MAX interval You can set TIMESERIES to MAX, which will automatically adjust your time window to the maximum number of intervals allowed for a given time period. This allows you to update your time windows without having to manually update your TIMESERIES buckets and ensures your time window is being split into the peak number of intervals allowed. The maximum number of TIMESERIES buckets that will be returned is 366. For example, the following query creates 4-minute intervals, which is the ceiling for a daily chart. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction since 1 day ago TIMESERIES MAX Copy UNTIL clause SELECT ... UNTIL integer units AGO ... Copy The default value is NOW. Only use UNTIL to specify an end point other than the default. Use the UNTIL clause to define the end of a time range across which to return data. Once a time range has been specified, the data will be preserved and can be reviewed after the time range has ended. See Use the time picker to adjust time settings for detailed information and examples. WHERE clause Use the WHERE clause to filter results. NRQL returns the results that fulfill the condition(s) you specify in the clause. SELECT function(attribute) ... WHERE attribute [operator 'value' | IN ('value' [, 'value]) | IS [NOT] NULL ] [AND|OR ...] ... Copy If you specify more than one condition, separate the conditions by the operators AND or OR. If you want to simulate a SQL join, use custom attributes in a WHERE or FACET clause. Operators that the WHERE clause accepts Description =, !=, <, <=, >, >= NRQL accepts standard comparison operators. Example: state = 'WA' AND Used to define an intersection of two conditions. OR Used to define a union of two conditions. IS NULL Determines if an attribute has a null value. IS NOT NULL Determines if an attribute does not have a null value. IN Determines if the string value of an attribute is in a specified set. Using this method yields better performance than stringing together multiple WHERE clauses. Example: animalType IN ('cat', 'dog', 'fish') NOT IN Determines if the string value of an attribute is not in a specified set. Using this method yields better performance than stringing together multiple WHERE clauses. Values must be in parentheses, separated by commas. For example: SELECT * FROM PageView WHERE countryCode NOT IN ('CA', 'WA') Copy LIKE Determines if an attribute contains a specified sub-string. The string argument for the LIKE operator accepts the percent sign (%) as a wildcard anywhere in the string. If the substring does not begin or end the string you are matching against, the wildcard must begin or end the string. Examples: userAgentName LIKE 'IE%' IE IE Mobile userAgentName LIKE 'o%a%' Opera Opera Mini userAgentName LIKE 'o%a' Opera userAgentName LIKE '%o%a%' Opera Opera Mini Mozilla Gecko NOT LIKE Determines if an attribute does not contain a specified sub-string. RLIKE Determines if an attribute contains a specified Regex sub-string. Uses RE2 syntax. Examples: appName RLIKE r'z.*|q.*'' hostname RLIKE r'ip-10-351-[0-2]?[0-9]-.*' z-app q-app ip-10-351-19-237 ip-10-351-2-41 ip-10-351-24-238 ip-10-351-14-15 Important Regex defaults to full-string matching, therefore ^ and $ are implicit and you do not need to add them. NOT RLIKE Determines if an attribute does not contain a specified Regex sub-string. Uses RE2 syntax. Example query with three conditions This query returns the browser response time for pages with checkout in the URL for Safari users in the United States and Canada over the past 24 hours. SELECT histogram(duration, 50, 20) FROM PageView WHERE countryCode IN ('CA', 'US') AND userAgentName='Safari' AND pageUrl LIKE '%checkout%' SINCE 1 day ago Copy WITH METRIC_FORMAT clause For information on querying metric data, see Query metrics. WITH TIMEZONE clause SELECT ... WITH TIMEZONE (selected zone) ... Copy By default, query results are displayed in the timezone of the browser you're using. Use the WITH TIMEZONE clause to select a time zone for a date or time in the query that hasn't already had a time zone specified for it. For example, the query clause SINCE Monday UNTIL Tuesday WITH TIMEZONE 'America/New_York' will return data recorded from Monday at midnight, Eastern Standard Time, until midnight Tuesday, Eastern Standard Time.

Query metric data Metric data is more complex than other types of data. There are specific tips for querying it well. We have two types of metric data, each with their own query guidelines: Query dimensional metrics, which are reported by our Metric API and by some of our tools that use that API, like our Telemetry SDKs and our open-source telemetry integrations (OpenTelemetry, Kamon, Micrometer, more). Query metric timeslice data, which is our original metric data type reported by our APM, mobile monitoring, and browser monitoring. For more on understanding these data types, see Metric data types. Functions In this section we explain NRQL functions, both aggregator functions and non-aggregator functions. Aggregator functions You can use aggregator functions to filter and aggregate data. Some tips for using these: See New Relic University tutorials for Filter queries, Apdex queries, and Percentile queries. Or, go to the full online course Writing NRQL queries. If you're using an aggregator function multiple times in the same query (e.g., SELECT median(one_metric</var>), median(another_metric)), it can cause problems in displaying results. To solve this, use the AS function. For example: SELECT median(one_metric) as 'med-a', median(another_metric) as 'med-b' Data type \"coercion\" is not supported. Read about available type conversion functions. For how to display results over time, see Group results over time. Examples: SELECT histogram(duration, 10, 20) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy aggregationendtime() Use the aggregationendtime() function to return the time of the relevant aggregation. More specifically, for a given aggregate, the aggregationendtime() function provides the timestamp of the end of the time period of that aggregation. For example, in a timeseries query, for a data point that encompasses an hour’s worth of data, the function would return the timestamp of the end of that hour period. apdex(attribute, t: ) Use the apdex function to return an Apdex score for a single transaction or for all your transactions. The attribute can be any attribute based on response time, such as duration or backendDuration. The t: argument defines an Apdex T threshold in seconds. The Apdex score returned by the apdex( ) function is based only on execution time. It does not account for APM errors. If a transaction includes an error but completes in Apdex T or less, that transaction will be rated satisfying by the apdex ( ) function. Get Apdex for specific customers If you have defined custom attributes, you can filter based on those attributes. For example, you could monitor the Apdex for a particularly important customer: SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.4) FROM Transaction WHERE customerName='ReallyImportantCustomer' SINCE 1 day ago Copy Get Apdex for specific transaction Use the name attribute to return a score for a specific transaction, or return an overall Apdex by omitting name. This query returns an Apdex score for the Controller/notes/index transaction over the last hour: The apdex function returns an Apdex score that measures user satisfaction with your site. Arguments are a response time attribute and an Apdex T threshold in seconds. SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.5) from Transaction WHERE name='Controller/notes/index' SINCE 1 hour ago Copy Get overall Apdex for your app This example query returns an overall Apdex for the application over the last three weeks: SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.08) FROM Transaction SINCE 3 week ago Copy average(attribute) Use the average( ) function to return the average value for an attribute. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. buckets(attribute, ceiling [,number of buckets]) Use the buckets() function to aggregate data split up by a FACET clause into buckets based on ranges. You can bucket by any attribute that is stored as a numerical value in the New Relic database. It takes three arguments: Attribute name Maximum value of the sample range. Any outliers will appear in the final bucket. Total number of buckets For more information and examples, see Split your data into buckets. bucketPercentile(attribute) The bucketPercentile( ) function is the NRQL equivalent of the histogram_quantile function in Prometheus. It is intended to be used with dimensional metric data. Instead of the quantile, New Relic returns the percentile, which is the quantile * 100. Use the bucketPercentile( ) function to calculate the quantile from the histogram data in a Prometheus format. It takes the bucket name as an argument and reports percentiles along the bucket's boundaries: SELECT bucketPercentile(duration_bucket) FROM Metric SINCE 1 day ago Copy Optionally, you can add percentile specifications as an argument: SELECT bucketPercentile(duration_bucket, 50, 75, 90) FROM Metric SINCE 1 day ago Copy Because multiple metrics are used to make up Prometheus histogram data, you must query for specific Prometheus metrics in terms of the associated <basename>. For example, to compute percentiles from a Prometheus histogram, with the <basename> prometheus_http_request_duration_seconds using NRQL, use bucketPercentile(prometheus_http_request_duration_seconds_bucket, 50). Note how _ bucket is added to the end of the <basename> as a suffix. See the Prometheus.io documentation for more information. cardinality(attribute) Use the cardinality( ) function to obtain the number of combinations of all the dimensions (attributes) on a metric. It takes three arguments, all optional: Metric name: if present, cardinality( ) only computes the metric specified. Include: if present, the include list restricts the cardinality computation to those attributes. Exclude: if present, the exclude list causes those attributes to be ignored in the cardinality computation. SELECT cardinality(metric_name, include:{attribute_list}, exclude:{attribute_list}) Copy count(*) Use the count( ) function to return a count of available records. It takes a single argument; either *, an attribute, or a constant value. Currently, it follows typical SQL behavior and counts all records that have values for its argument. Since count(*) does not name a specific attribute, the results will be formatted in the default \"humanize\" format. derivative(attribute [,time interval]) derivative() finds the rate of change for a given dataset. The rate of change is calculated using a linear least-squares regression to approximate the derivative. Since this calculation requires comparing more than one datapoint, if only one datapoint is included in the evaluation range, the calculation is indeterminate and won't work, resulting in a null value. The time interval is the period for which the rate of change is calculated. For example, derivative(attributeName, 1 minute) will return the rate of change per minute. dimensions(include: {attributes}, exclude: {attributes}) Use the dimensions( ) function to return all the dimensional values on a data type. You can explicitly include or exclude specific attributes using the optional arguments: Include: if present, the include list limits dimensions( ) to those attributes. Exclude: if present, the dimensions( ) calculation ignores those attributes. FROM Metric SELECT count(node_filesystem_size) TIMESERIES FACET dimensions() Copy When used with a FACET clause, dimensions( ) produces a unique timeseries for all facets available on the event type, similar to how Prometheus behaves with non-aggregated queries. latestrate(attribute, time interval) Use the latestrate( ) function to return the rate of change of a value based on the last 2 data points. It takes the attribute in question as the first argument and the unit of time for the resulting rate as the second argument. The function returns a result in units of change in attribute/time interval. This function can be useful to provide the most recent rate of change for an attribute in order to see leading-edge trends. Get the most recent rate of change of PageView Duration This query returns the rate of change of duration based on the last 2 data points. It will be returned in units of duration/second because of the 1 SECOND argument. SELECT latestrate(duration, 1 SECOND) FROM PageView Copy max(attribute) Use the max( ) function to return the maximum recorded value of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. median(attribute) Use the median( ) function to return an attribute's median, or 50th percentile. For more information about percentile queries, see percentile(). Tip The median( ) query is only available when using the query builder. Median query This query will generate a line chart for the median value. SELECT median(duration) FROM PageView TIMESERIES AUTO Copy min(attribute) Use the min( ) function to return the minimum recorded value of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. minuteOf(attribute) Use the minuteOf() function to extract only the minute portion (i.e. 0-59) of an attribute holding a valid timestamp value. mod(attribute, divisor) Use the mod( ) function to return the floor modulus after dividing the value of the provided numeric attribute (the first argument, or dividend) by a numeric value (the second argument, or divisor). This modulo operation can be used within a WHERE clause condition to filter to an arbitrary subset of results or within a FACET clause as a way to subdivide the result set. mod() within a WHERE clause condition FROM Transaction SELECT * WHERE mod(port, 2) = 1 Copy mod() within a FACET clause FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT uniques(hostId, 10000) SINCE 1 day AGO FACET mod(hostId, 10) Copy percentage(function(attribute), WHERE condition) Use the percentage( ) function to return the percentage of a target data set that matches some condition. The first argument requires an aggregator function against the desired attribute. Use exactly two arguments (arguments after the first two will be ignored). If the attribute is not numeric, this function returns a value of 100%. percentile(attribute [, percentile [, ...]]) Use the percentile( ) function to return an attribute's approximate value at a given percentile. It requires an attribute and can take any number of arguments representing percentile points. The percentile() function enables percentiles to displays with up to three digits after the decimal point, providing greater precision. Percentile thresholds may be specified as decimal values, but be aware that for most data sets, percentiles closer than 0.1 from each other will not be resolved. Percentile display examples Use TIMESERIES to generate a line chart with percentiles mapped over time. Omit TIMESERIES to generate a billboard and attribute sheet showing aggregate values for the percentiles. If no percentiles are listed, the default is the 95th percentile. To return only the 50th percentile value, the median, you can also use median(). Basic percentile query This query will generate a line chart with lines for the 5th, 50th, and 95th percentile. SELECT percentile(duration, 5, 50, 95) FROM PageView TIMESERIES AUTO Copy predictLinear(attribute, [,time interval]) predictLinear() is an extension of the derivative() function. It uses a similar method of least-squares linear regression to predict the future values for a dataset. The time interval is how far the query will look into the future. For example, predictLinear(attributeName, 1 hour) is a linear prediction 1 hour into the future of the query time window. Generally, predictLinear() is helpful for continuously growing values like disk space, or predictions on large trends. Since predictLinear() is a linear regression, familiarity with the dataset being queried helps to ensure accurate long-term predictions. Any dataset which grows exponentially, logarithmically, or by other nonlinear means will likely only be successful in very short-term predictions. New Relic recommends against using predictLinear in TIMESERIES queries. This is because each bucket will be making an individual prediction based on its relative timeframe within the query, meaning that such queries will not show predictions from the end of the timeseries forward. rate(function(attribute) [,time interval]) Use the rate( ) function to visualize the frequency or rate of a given query per time interval. For example, you might want to know the number of pageviews per minute over an hour-long period or the count of unique sessions on your site per hour over a day-long period. Use TIMESERIES to generate a line chart with rates mapped over time. Omit TIMESERIES to generate a billboard showing a single rate value averaged over time. Basic rate query This query will generate a line chart showing the rate of throughput for APM transactions per 10 minutes over the past 6 hours. SELECT rate(count(*), 10 minute) FROM Transaction SINCE 6 hours ago TIMESERIES Copy round(attribute) Use the round( ) function to return the rounded value of an attribute. Optionally round( ) can take a second argument, to_nearest, to round the first argument to the closest multiple of the second one. to_nearest can be fractional. SELECT round(n [, to_nearest]) Copy stddev(attribute) Use the stddev( ) function to return one standard deviation for a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. stdvar(attribute) Use the stdvar( ) function to return the standard variance for a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. sum(attribute) Use the sum( ) function to return the sum recorded values of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. uniqueCount(attribute) Use the uniqueCount( ) function to return the number of unique values recorded for an attribute over the time range specified. Tip To optimize query performance, this function returns approximate results for queries that inspect more than 256 unique values. uniques(attribute [,limit]) Use the uniques( ) function to return a list of unique values recorded for an attribute over the time range specified. When used along with the facet clause, a list of unique attribute values will be returned per each facet value. The limit parameter is optional. When it is not provided, the default limit of 1,000 unique attribute values per facet is applied. You may specify a different limit value, up to a maximum of 10,000. The uniques( ) function will return the first set of unique attribute values discovered, until the limit is reached. Therefore, if you have 5,000 unique attribute values in your data set, and the limit is set to 1,000, the operator will return the first 1,000 unique values that it discovers, regardless of their frequency. The maximum number of values that can be returned in a query result is the product of the uniques( ) limit times the facet limit. In the following query, the theoretical maximum number of values that can be returned is 5 million (5,000 x 1,000). Depending on the data set being queried, and the complexity of the query, memory protection limits may prevent a very large query from being executed. From Transaction SELECT uniques(host,5000) FACET appName LIMIT 1000 Copy Using tuple If you'd like to know the unique combinations of a handful of attributes, you can structure a query in the format SELECT uniques(tuple(x, y, ... z)) ...` to get all the unique tuples of values, to maintain their relationship. In the following query, tuple is used on index and cellName together to find uniques where those two values occur in combination. FROM NodeStatus SELECT uniques(tuple(index, cellName), 5) Copy capture(attribute, regular expression) Use the capture() to extract values from an attribute using a regular expression. Uses RE2 syntax. It takes two arguments: Attribute name Regular expression with capture syntax. Regex expressions in NRQL use Python-like syntax, r'...'. When capturing, use the RE2 named-capture syntax ...(?P<name> pattern )... to capture the contained pattern, given the specified name. Currently, only 1 capture group is supported. Please see the examples below. capture() within a SELECT clause condition The following will select the domain name of the website, removing https:// and any paths following the .com SELECT capture(pageUrl, r'https://(?P<baseUrl>.*.com)/.+') FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago Copy The following will capture only the first word of the error message. SELECT capture(errorMessage, r'(?P<firstWord>\\S+)\\s.+') FROM Transaction SINCE 1 hour ago where errorMessage is not null Copy capture() within a FACET clause condition The following will facet by the captured HTTP method. SELECT count(*) FROM Log WHERE message like '%HTTP%' FACET capture(message, r'.* \"(?P<httpMethod>[A-Z]+) .*') Copy capture() within a WHERE clause condition The following will filter the results based on Log events with message attribute that matches the regular expression where the captured job name is ExampleJob. SELECT message FROM Log WHERE capture(message, r'.*Job Failed: (?P<jobName>[A-Za-z]+),.*') = 'ExampleJob' SINCE 10 minutes ago Copy capture() with a numeric cast The following will capture sum of CPU Time from log lines. You must explicitly cast to numeric to do mathematical operations. SELECT sum(numeric(capture(message, r'.*CpuTime:\\s(?P<cpuTime>\\d+)'))) FROM Log WHERE message like '%CpuTime:%' SINCE 1 hour ago Copy Non-aggregator functions Use non-aggregator functions for non-numerical data in NRQL queries. earliest(attribute) Use the earliest( ) function to return the earliest value for an attribute over the specified time range. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If used in conjunction with a FACET it will return the most recent value for an attribute for each of the resulting facets. Get earliest country per user agent from PageView This query returns the earliest country code per each user agent from the PageView event. SELECT earliest(countryCode) FROM PageView FACET userAgentName Copy eventType() ...WHERE eventType() = 'EventNameHere'... ...FACET eventType()... Copy Use the eventType() function in a FACET clause to break out results by the selected data type or in a WHERE clause to filter results to a specific data type. This is particularly useful for targeting specific data types with the filter() and percentage() functions. Important In this context, \"event type\" refers to the types of data you can access with a NRQL query. Use eventType() in filter() function This query returns the percentage of total TransactionError results out of the total Transaction results. You can use the eventType() function to target specific types of data with the filter() function. SELECT 100 * filter(count(*), where eventType() = 'TransactionError') / filter(count(*), where eventType() = 'Transaction') FROM Transaction, TransactionError WHERE appName = 'App.Prod' TIMESERIES 2 Minutes SINCE 6 hours ago Copy Use eventType() with FACET This query displays a count of how many records each data type (Transaction and TransactionError) returns. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, TransactionError FACET eventType() TIMESERIES Copy filter(function(attribute), WHERE condition) Use the filter() function to limit the results for one of the aggregator functions in your SELECT statement. You can use filter() in conjunction with FACET or TIMESERIES. Filter is only useful when selecting multiple different aggregations such as SELECT filter(sum(x), WHERE attribute='a') AS 'A', filter(sum(x), WHERE attribute='b') AS 'B' .... Otherwise, it's better to just use the standard WHERE clause. Analyze purchases that used offer codes You could use filter() to compare the items bought in a set of transactions for those using an offer code versus those who aren't: Use the filter( ) function to limit the results for one of the aggregator functions in your SELECT statement. funnel(attribute, steps) Use the funnel() function to generate a funnel chart. It takes an attribute as its first argument. You then specify steps as WHERE clauses (with optional AS clauses for labels) separated by commas. For details and examples, see the funnels documentation. getField(attribute, field) Use the getField() function to extract a field from compound data types, such as metric data. It takes the following arguments: Metric type Supported fields summary count, total, max, min, type gauge count, total, max, min, latest, type distribution count, total, max, min, type counter count, type timeslice count, total, totalExclusive, min, and max Examples: SELECT max(getField(mySummary, count)) from Metric Copy SELECT sum(mySummary) from Metric where getField(mySummary, count) > 10 Copy histogram(attribute, ceiling [,number of buckets]) Use the histogram( ) function to generate histograms. It takes three arguments: Attribute name Maximum value of the sample range Total number of buckets (between 1 and 500, inclusive) Histogram of response times from PageView events This query results in a histogram of response times ranging up to 10 seconds over 20 buckets. SELECT histogram(duration, 10, 20) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy Prometheus histogram buckets histogram( ) accepts Prometheus histogram buckets: SELECT histogram(duration_bucket, 10, 20) FROM Metric SINCE 1 week ago Copy New Relic distribution metric histogram( ) accepts Distribution metric as an input: SELECT histogram(myDistributionMetric, 10, 20) FROM Metric SINCE 1 week ago Copy Histogram with a FACET clause Use histogram( ) with a FACET clause to generate a heatmap chart: SELECT histogram(duration) FROM PageView FACET appName SINCE 1 week ago Copy keyset() Using keyset() will allow you to see all of the attributes for a given data type over a given time range. It takes no arguments. It returns a JSON structure containing groups of string-typed keys, numeric-typed keys, boolean-typed keys, and all keys. See all attributes for a data type This query returns the attributes found for PageView events from the last day: SELECT keyset() FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago Copy latest(attribute) Use the latest( ) function to return the most recent value for an attribute over a specified time range. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If used in conjunction with a FACET it will return the most recent value for an attribute for each of the resulting facets. Get most recent country per user agent from PageView This query returns the most recent country code per each user agent from the PageView event. SELECT latest(countryCode) FROM PageView FACET userAgentName Copy Type conversion NRQL does not support \"coercion.\" This means that a float stored as a string is treated as a string and cannot be operated on by functions expecting float values. You can convert a string with a numeric value or a boolean with a string value to their numeric and boolean types with these functions: Use the numeric() function to convert a number with a string format to a numeric function. The function can be built into a query that uses math functions on query results or NRQL aggregator functions, such as average(). Use the boolean() function to convert a string value of \"true\" or \"false\" to the corresponding boolean value.",

      "body": "One way to query your New Relic data is with the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). This resource explains what NRQL is, when and how you can use it, and basic syntax rules. For more detailed information on querying, including a listing of clauses and functions and example queries, see NRQL syntax, clauses, and functions. What is NRQL? NRQL is New Relic's SQL-like query language. You can use NRQL to retrieve detailed New Relic data and get insight into your applications, hosts, and business-important activity. Reasons to use NRQL include: To answer a question for the purpose of troubleshooting or business analysis To create a new chart To make API queries of New Relic data (for example, using our NerdGraph API) NRQL is used behind the scenes to generate some New Relic charts: Some New Relic charts are built using NRQL. One way to start using NRQL is to view a chart's query and then edit it to make your own custom chart. Where can you use NRQL? You can use NRQL in these places: New Relic One query builder NerdGraph: our GraphQL-format API, which includes options for making NRQL queries one.newrelic.com > Query your data: You can run a NRQL query in New Relic One. This NRQL query shows a count of distributed tracing spans faceted by their entity names. NRQL is one of several ways to query New Relic data. For more on all query options, see Query your data. What data can you query with NRQL? NRQL allows you to query these New Relic data types: Event data from all New Relic products, including: APM events, like Transaction Browser monitoring events, like PageView Mobile monitoring events, like Mobile Infrastructure events, like ProcessSample Synthetics events, like SyntheticCheck Custom events, like those reported by the Event API Metric timeslice data (metrics reported by APM, browser, and mobile) The Metric data type (metrics reported by the Metric API and data sources that use that API) The Span data type (distributed tracing data) The Log data type (data from New Relic Logs) Tip Some data, like relationships between monitored entities, is not available via NRQL but is available using our NerdGraph API. Start using NRQL One way to start using NRQL and to understand what data you have available is to go to a NRQL interface (for example, the New Relic One query builder), type FROM, and press space. The interface will suggest available types of data: To see the attributes available for a specific data type, type FROM DATA_TYPE SELECT and press space. The interface will suggest available attributes. For example: To see the complete JSON associated with a data type, including all of its attributes, use the keyset() attribute. For example: FROM Transaction SELECT keyset() Copy NRQL is used behind the scenes to build some New Relic charts and dashboards. One way to learn NRQL is to find one of these NRQL-generated charts and start playing with the NRQL to create new, customized queries and charts: Charts built with NRQL will have View query as an option. You can then edit and customize that query to see how your changes affect the resulting visualization. Important To explore your data without having to use NRQL, use the data explorer. Learn more about querying data in New Relic. NRQL query examples Here's an example NRQL query of Transaction data, which is reported by APM. FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) FACET appName TIMESERIES auto Copy This would generate a chart that looks like: Here are some more query examples: Basic NRQL query of browser data Here's a NRQL query of PageView data from browser monitoring. SELECT uniqueCount(user) FROM PageView WHERE userAgentOS = 'Mac' FACET countryCode SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 20 Copy Attribute name with a space in it If a custom attribute name has a space in it, use backticks around the attribute name: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET `Logged-in user` Copy Querying multiple data sources To return data from two data sources, separate their data types with a comma. For example, this query returns a count of all APM transactions and browser events over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, PageView SINCE 3 days ago Copy Query returning multiple columns To return multiple columns from a dataset, separate the aggregator arguments with a comma: SELECT function(attribute), function(attribute) ... FROM ... Copy This query returns the minimum, average, and maximum duration for browser monitoring PageView events over the last week: SELECT min(duration), max(duration), average(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy See more NRQL query examples. NRQL syntax The syntax of a NRQL query is similar to standard SQL queries. Here is a breakdown of the structure of a NRQL query: SELECT function(attribute) [AS 'label'][, ...] FROM data type [WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...]][AS 'label'][, ...] [FACET attribute | function(attribute)] [LIMIT number] [SINCE time] [UNTIL time] [WITH TIMEZONE timezone] [COMPARE WITH time] [TIMESERIES time] Copy Basic rules include: NRQL condition Details Required values The SELECT statement and FROM clause are required. All other clauses are optional. You can start your query with either SELECT or FROM. Query string size The query string must be less than 4 KB. Case sensitivity The data type names and attribute names are case sensitive. NRQL clauses and functions are not case sensitive. Syntax for strings NRQL uses single quotes to designate strings. For example: ... where traceId = '030a573f0df02c57' Copy Attribute names with spaces Use backticks `` to quote a custom attribute name that has a space in it. For example: ... FACET `Logged-in user` Copy Data type coercion Insights does not support data type \"coercion.\" For more information, see Data type conversion. Use of math functions Basic and advanced math functions are supported in the SELECT statement. JOIN functions NRQL does not have the equivalent of the SQL JOIN function, but you can simulate a JOIN with custom attributes. Read more about NRQL syntax and functions.",

      "body": "BETA FEATURE This feature is currently in beta. Dimensional metrics are an industry standard for storing and querying metric data. All infrastructure metrics are stored as event data in New Relic, but you can also query them through dimensional metrics. In this page you can learn: The benefits of dimensional metrics. A few examples on how and where to use them. Known issues. Why it matters At New Relic we report metrics in several ways, including dimensional metrics, which are used by our metric API, Telemetry SDK, some open-source integrations, and our infrastructure services. This type of metric enables you to: Enjoy an improved query experience for Infrastructure data. Discover all your metrics in one place. Tap into more metric sources, such as Prometheus. For example, the query to get the maximum duration of your Lambda functions is simplified: Query with samples FROM ServerlessSample SELECT max(provider.duration.Maximum) WHERE provider = 'LambdaFunction' Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT max(aws.lambda.function.duration) Copy Get started No agent or integration updates are required to use these metrics. NRQL alerting based on dimensional metrics is also supported, except for data coming from cloud integrations (that is metrics from AWS polling integrations, GCP, and Azure). AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams metrics are ingested as dimensional metrics and NRQL alerts are recommended. Where and how to query dimensional metrics All current NRQL query features are supported. Queries can use WHERE, FACET, and time selection functions such as SINCE, UNTIL, and COMPARE WITH. The query builder in New Relic One supports metrics in both simple and advanced (NRQL) mode. Naming conventions for metrics and attributes All metric names and attributes for dimensional metrics follow the same naming convention in order to make them easy to find and use. Metric and attribute names are namespaced with dots: for example, the host. prefix is used for host metrics, the k8s. prefix is used for Kubernetes metrics, and aws. is used for AWS metrics. The graphic below shows how a ProcessSample that contains three metrics (cpuPercent, ioTotalReadBytes, and ioTotalWriteBytes) is split into three separate metrics. Note the updated naming of the metrics and the attributes. Dimensional metrics naming convention Examples Here are some examples of NQRL queries with and without dimensional metrics: AWS EBS query example Get the total write time by EBS Volume. Query with samples FROM BlockDeviceSample SELECT sum('provider.volumeTotalWriteTime.Sum') WHERE provider = 'EbsVolume' FACET entityName Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT sum(aws.ebs.volume.TotalWriteTime) FACET entity.name Copy Azure Service bus query example Maximum number of messages in an Azure Service Bus topic by resource group. Query with samples FROM AzureServiceBusTopicSample SELECT max(activeMessages.Maximum) FACET resourceGroupName Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT max(azure.servicebus.topic.activeMessages) FACET azure.resourceGroup Copy Azure functions query example Number of function executions Azure Functions over the past 6 hours by region over time. Query with samples FROM AzureFunctionsAppSample SELECT sum(functionExecutionCount.Total) FACET regionName TIMESERIES SINCE 6 hours ago Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT sum(azure.functions.app.functionExecutionCount) FACET azure.region TIMESERIES SINCE 6 hours ago Copy Azure VMs query example Compare the number of Azure VMs over the past thirty minutes with the same time a week ago. Query with samples FROM AzureVirtualMachineScaleSetSample SELECT uniqueCount(vMName) FACET name SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO COMPARE WITH 1 WEEK AGO Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT uniqueCount(azure.vms.vmName) FACET azure.resourceName WHERE azure.resourceType='Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachineScaleSets' SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO COMPARE WITH 1 WEEK AGO Copy NGINX query example The average number of NGINX requests per second over time.

      "body": "NRQL is a query language you can use to query the New Relic database. This document explains NRQL syntax, clauses, components, and functions. Syntax This document is a reference for the functions and clauses used in a NRQL query. Other resources for understanding NRQL: Intro to NRQL: explains what NRQL is used for, what data you can query with it, and basic NRQL syntax Examine NRQL queries used to build New Relic charts Learn how to query the Metric data type Simulate SQL JOIN functions Use funnels to evaluate a series of related data Format NRQL for querying with the Event API Query components Every NRQL query will begin with a SELECT statement or a FROM clause. All other clauses are optional. The clause definitions below also contain example NRQL queries. Required clauses Required: SELECT statement SELECT attribute ... Copy SELECT function(attribute) ... Copy The SELECT specifies what portion of a data type you want to query by specifying an attribute or a function. It's followed by one or more arguments separated by commas. In each argument you can: Get the values of all available attributes by using * as a wildcard. For example: SELECT * from Transaction. Get values associated with a specified attribute or multiple attributes specified in a comma separated list. Get aggregated values from specified attributes by selecting an aggregator function. Label the results returned in each argument with the AS clause. You can also use SELECT with basic math functions. Avg response time since last week This query returns the average response time since last week. SELECT average(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy Required: FROM clause SELECT ... FROM data type ... Copy Use the FROM clause to specify the data type you wish to query. You can start your query with FROM or with SELECT. You can merge values for the same attributes across multiple data types in a comma separated list. Query one data type This query returns the count of all APM transactions over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction SINCE 3 days ago Copy Query multiple data types This query returns the count of all APM transactions and browser events over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, PageView SINCE 3 days ago Copy Optional clauses AS clause SELECT ... AS 'label' ... Copy Use the AS clause to label an attribute, aggregator, step in a funnel, or the result of a math function with a string delimited by single quotes. The label is used in the resulting chart. Query using math function and AS This query returns the number of page views per session: SELECT count(*)/uniqueCount(session) AS 'Pageviews per Session' FROM PageView Copy Query using funnel and AS This query returns a count of people who have visited both the main page and the careers page of a site over the past week: SELECT funnel(SESSION, WHERE name='Controller/about/main' AS 'Step 1', WHERE name = 'Controller/about/careers' AS 'Step 2') FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy COMPARE WITH clause SELECT ... (SINCE or UNTIL) (integer units) AGO COMPARE WITH (integer units) AGO ... Copy Use the COMPARE WITH clause to compare the values for two different time ranges. COMPARE WITH requires a SINCE or UNTIL statement. The time specified by COMPARE WITH is relative to the time specified by SINCE or UNTIL. For example, SINCE 1 day ago COMPARE WITH 1 day ago compares yesterday with the day before. The time range for theCOMPARE WITH value is always the same as that specified by SINCE or UNTIL. For example, SINCE 2 hours ago COMPARE WITH 4 hours ago might compare 3:00pm through 5:00pm against 11:00am through 1:00pm. COMPARE WITH can be formatted as either a line chart or a billboard: With TIMESERIES, COMPARE WITH creates a line chart with the comparison mapped over time. Without TIMESERIES, COMPARE WITH generates a billboard with the current value and the percent change from the COMPARE WITH value. Example: This query returns data as a line chart showing the 95th percentile for the past hour compared to the same range one week ago. First as a single value, then as a line chart. SELECT percentile(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago COMPARE WITH 1 week AGO SELECT percentile(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago COMPARE WITH 1 week AGO TIMESERIES AUTO Copy EXTRAPOLATE clause You can use this clause with these data types: Transaction TransactionError Custom events reported via APM agent APIs The purpose of EXTRAPOLATE is to mathematically compensate for the effects of APM agent sampling of event data so that query results more closely represent the total activity in your system. This clause will be useful when a APM agent reports so many events that it often passes its harvest cycle reporting limits. When that occurs, the agent begins to sample events. When EXTRAPOLATE is used in a NRQL query that supports its use, the ratio between the reported events and the total events is used to extrapolate a close approximation of the total unsampled data. When it is used in a NRQL query that doesn’t support its use or that hasn’t used sampled data, it has no effect. Important Note that EXTRAPOLATE is most useful for homogenous data (like throughput or error rate). It's not effective when attempting to extrapolate a count of distinct things (like uniqueCount() or uniques()). This clause works only with NRQL queries that use one of the following aggregator functions: apdex average count histogram sum percentage (if function it takes as an argument supports EXTRAPOLATE) rate (if function it takes as an argument supports EXTRAPOLATE) stddev Example of extrapolating throughput A query that will show the extrapolated throughput of a service named interestingApplication. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction WHERE appName='interestingApplication' SINCE 60 minutes ago EXTRAPOLATE Copy Example of extrapolating throughput as a time series A query that will show the extrapolated throughput of a service named interestingApplication by transaction name, displayed as a time series. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction WHERE appName='interestingApplication' SINCE 60 minutes ago FACET name TIMESERIES 1 minute EXTRAPOLATE Copy FACET clause SELECT ... FACET attribute ... Copy Use FACET to separate and group your results by attribute values. For example, you could FACET your PageView data by deviceType to figure out what percentage of your traffic comes from mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. Use the LIMIT clause to specify how many facets appear (default is 10). For more complex grouping, use FACET CASES. FACET clauses support up to five attributes, separated by commas. The facets are sorted in descending order by the first field you provide in the SELECT clause. If you are faceting on attributes with more than 2,000 unique values, a subset of facet values is selected and sorted according to the query type. When selecting min(), max(), or count(), FACET uses those functions to determine how facets are picked and sorted. When selecting any other function, FACET uses the frequency of the attribute you are faceting on to determine how facets are picked and sorted. Faceted query using count() This query shows cities with the highest pageview counts. This query uses the total number of pageviews per city to determine how facets are picked and ordered. SELECT count(*) FROM PageView FACET city Copy Faceted query using uniqueCount() This query shows the cities that access the highest number of unique URLs. This query uses the total number of times a particular city appears in the results to determine how facets are picked and ordered. SELECT uniqueCount(pageUrl) FROM PageView FACET city Copy Grouping results across time Advanced segmentation and cohort analysis allow you to facet on bucket functions to more effectively break out your data. Cohort analysis is a way to group results together based on timestamps. You can separate them into buckets that cover a specified range of dates and times. FACET ... AS clause Use FACET ... AS to name facets using the AS keyword in queries. This clause is helpful for adding clearer or simplified names for facets in your results. It can also be used to rename facets in nested aggregation queries. FACET ... AS queries will change the facet names in results (when they appear as headers in tables, for example), but not the actual facet names themselves. FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) FACET response.headers.contentType AS 'content type' Copy FACET CASES clause SELECT ... FACET CASES ( WHERE attribute operator value, WHERE attribute operator value, ... ) ... Copy Use FACET CASES to break out your data by more complex conditions than possible with FACET. Separate multiple conditions with a comma ,. For example, you could query your PageView data and FACET CASES into categories like less than 1 second, from 1 to 10 seconds, and greater than 10 seconds. You can combine multiple attributes within your cases, and label the cases with the AS selector. Data points will be added to at most one facet case, the first facet case that they match. You may also use a time function with your attribute, and you can use the OR operator to facet results that don't match any of your specified cases. Basic usage with WHERE SELECT count(*) FROM PageView FACET CASES (WHERE duration < 1, WHERE duration > 1 and duration < 10, WHERE duration > 10) Copy Group based on multiple attributes This example groups results into one bucket where the transaction name contains login, and another where the URL contains login and a custom attribute indicates that the user was a paid user: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid') Copy Label groups with AS This example uses the AS selector to give your results a human-readable name: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%' AS 'Total Logins', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid' AS 'Feature Visits from Paid Users') Copy Facet non-matching data with OR This example uses the OR operator to facet results that didn't match any of your cases: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid') OR name Copy FACET ... ORDER BY clause In NRQL, the default is for the first aggregation in the SELECT clause to guide the selection of facets in a query. FACET ... ORDER BY allows you to override this default behavior by adding an aggregate function with the ORDER BY modifier to specify how facets are selected. Specifically, the clause will override the priority by which facets are chosen to be in the final result before being limited by the LIMIT clause. This clause can be used in querying but not for alerts or streaming. This example shows how to use FACET ... ORDER BY to find the average durations of app transactions, showing the top 10 (default limit) highest durations by apps which have the highest response size. In this case, if FACET ... ORDER BY is not used, the query results will instead show the top 10 by highest durations, with response size being irrelevant to the app selection. FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) TIMESERIES FACET appName ORDER BY max(responseSize) Copy Tip Because the operations are performed before the LIMIT clause is applied, FACET ... ORDER BY does not impact the sort of the final query results, which will be particularly noticeable in the results for non-timeseries queries. Important The ORDER BY modifier in this case works differently than the ORDER BY clause. When parsing queries that follow the format FACET attribute1 ORDER BY attribute2, New Relic will read these as FACET ... ORDER BY queries, but only if ORDER BY appears immediately after FACET. Otherwise ORDER BY will be interpreted by New Relic as a clause. LIMIT clause SELECT ... LIMIT count ... Copy Use the LIMIT clause to control the maximum number of facet values returned by FACET queries or the maximum number of items returned by SELECT * queries. This clause takes a single integer value as an argument. If the LIMIT clause is not specified, or no value is provided, the limit defaults to 10 for FACET queries and 100 in the case of SELECT * queries. The maximum allowed value for the LIMIT clause is 2,000. Query using LIMIT This query shows the top 20 countries by session count and provides 95th percentile of response time for each country for Windows users only. SELECT uniqueCount(session), percentile(duration, 95) FROM PageView WHERE userAgentOS = 'Windows' FACET countryCode LIMIT 20 SINCE YESTERDAY Copy OFFSET clause SELECT ... LIMIT count OFFSET count ... Copy Use the OFFSET clause with LIMIT to control the portion of rows returned by SELECT * or SELECT column queries. Like the LIMIT clause, OFFSET takes a single integer value as an argument. OFFSET sets the number of rows to be skipped before the selected rows of your query are returned. This is constrained by LIMIT. OFFSET rows are skipped starting from the most recent record. For example, the query SELECT interestingValue FROM Minute_Report LIMIT 5 OFFSET 1 returns the last 5 values from Minute_Report except for the most recent one. ORDER BY clause The ORDER BY clause allows you to specify how you want to sort your query results in queries that select event attributes by row. This query orders transactions by duration. FROM Transaction SELECT appName, duration ORDER BY duration Copy The default sort order is ascending, but this can be changed by adding the ASC or DESC modifiers. SHOW EVENT TYPES clause SHOW EVENT TYPES... Copy SHOW EVENT TYPES will return a list of all the data types present in your account for a specific time range. It is used as the first clause in a query instead of SELECT. Important In this context, \"event types\" refers to the data types you can access with a NRQL query. Data types in the last day This query will return all the data types present over the past day: SHOW EVENT TYPES SINCE 1 day ago Copy SINCE clause SELECT ... SINCE [numerical units AGO | phrase] ... Copy The default value is 1 hour ago. Use the SINCE clause to define the beginning of a time range for the returned data. When using NRQL, you can set a UTC timestamp or relative time range. You can specify a timezone for the query but not for the results. NRQL results are based on your system time. SLIDE BY clause The SLIDE BY clause supports a feature known as sliding windows. With sliding windows,SLIDE BY data is gathered into \"windows\" of time that overlap with each other. These windows can help to smooth out line graphs with a lot of variation in cases where the rolling aggregate (such as a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. To use SLIDE BY, place it in a query after the TIMESERIES clause. For example, this query pulls data in 5-minute windows with a 1-minute SLIDE BY interval, meaning that each window lasts 5 minutes, but window 1 starts at 0 minutes, window 2 starts at 1 minute, window 3 starts at 2 minutes, and so on. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY 1 minute Copy To learn more about how and when you can use SLIDE BY, see Create smoother charts with sliding windows. Use SLIDE BY with MAX or AUTO interval You can use sliding windows in combination with MAX or AUTO. However, MAX or AUTO may not be placed between TIMESERIES and SLIDE BY. This query will automatically decide a SLIDE BY window interval. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY AUTO Copy This query will set the SLIDE BY window to the maximum interval granularity. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY MAX Copy Important The SLIDE BY value as determined by AUTO or MAX can produce a step interval greater than the window size, which can cause gaps and unexpected results. TIMESERIES clause SELECT ... TIMESERIES integer units ... Copy Use the TIMESERIES clause to return data as a time series broken out by a specified period of time. Since TIMESERIES is used to trigger certain charts, there is no default value. To indicate the time range, use integer units. For example: TIMESERIES 1 minute TIMESERIES 30 minutes TIMESERIES 1 hour TIMESERIES 30 seconds TIMESERIES can be combined with arguments such as MAX, AUTO, and SLIDE BY to further tailor query results, as shown in the examples below. Important For functions such as average( ) or percentile( ), a large aggregation window can have a significant smoothing effect on outliers. This is true whether or not the query makes use of sliding windows. Use a set interval The value provided indicates the units used to break out the graph. For example, to present a one-day graph showing 30 minute increments: SELECT ... SINCE 1 day AGO TIMESERIES 30 minutes Copy Use an automatically set interval TIMESERIES can also be set to AUTO, which will divide your graph into a reasonable number of divisions. For example, a daily chart will be divided into 30 minute intervals and a weekly chart will be divided into 6 hour intervals. This query returns data as a line chart showing the 50th and 90th percentile of client-side transaction time for one week with a data point every 6 hours. SELECT average(duration), percentile(duration, 50, 90) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week AGO TIMESERIES AUTO Copy Use MAX interval You can set TIMESERIES to MAX, which will automatically adjust your time window to the maximum number of intervals allowed for a given time period. This allows you to update your time windows without having to manually update your TIMESERIES buckets and ensures your time window is being split into the peak number of intervals allowed. The maximum number of TIMESERIES buckets that will be returned is 366. For example, the following query creates 4-minute intervals, which is the ceiling for a daily chart. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction since 1 day ago TIMESERIES MAX Copy UNTIL clause SELECT ... UNTIL integer units AGO ... Copy The default value is NOW. Only use UNTIL to specify an end point other than the default. Use the UNTIL clause to define the end of a time range across which to return data. Once a time range has been specified, the data will be preserved and can be reviewed after the time range has ended. See Use the time picker to adjust time settings for detailed information and examples. WHERE clause Use the WHERE clause to filter results. NRQL returns the results that fulfill the condition(s) you specify in the clause. SELECT function(attribute) ... WHERE attribute [operator 'value' | IN ('value' [, 'value]) | IS [NOT] NULL ] [AND|OR ...] ... Copy If you specify more than one condition, separate the conditions by the operators AND or OR. If you want to simulate a SQL join, use custom attributes in a WHERE or FACET clause. Operators that the WHERE clause accepts Description =, !=, <, <=, >, >= NRQL accepts standard comparison operators. Example: state = 'WA' AND Used to define an intersection of two conditions. OR Used to define a union of two conditions. IS NULL Determines if an attribute has a null value. IS NOT NULL Determines if an attribute does not have a null value. IN Determines if the string value of an attribute is in a specified set. Using this method yields better performance than stringing together multiple WHERE clauses. Example: animalType IN ('cat', 'dog', 'fish') NOT IN Determines if the string value of an attribute is not in a specified set. Using this method yields better performance than stringing together multiple WHERE clauses. Values must be in parentheses, separated by commas. For example: SELECT * FROM PageView WHERE countryCode NOT IN ('CA', 'WA') Copy LIKE Determines if an attribute contains a specified sub-string. The string argument for the LIKE operator accepts the percent sign (%) as a wildcard anywhere in the string. If the substring does not begin or end the string you are matching against, the wildcard must begin or end the string. Examples: userAgentName LIKE 'IE%' IE IE Mobile userAgentName LIKE 'o%a%' Opera Opera Mini userAgentName LIKE 'o%a' Opera userAgentName LIKE '%o%a%' Opera Opera Mini Mozilla Gecko NOT LIKE Determines if an attribute does not contain a specified sub-string. RLIKE Determines if an attribute contains a specified Regex sub-string. Uses RE2 syntax. Examples: appName RLIKE r'z.*|q.*'' hostname RLIKE r'ip-10-351-[0-2]?[0-9]-.*' z-app q-app ip-10-351-19-237 ip-10-351-2-41 ip-10-351-24-238 ip-10-351-14-15 Important Regex defaults to full-string matching, therefore ^ and $ are implicit and you do not need to add them. NOT RLIKE Determines if an attribute does not contain a specified Regex sub-string. Uses RE2 syntax. Example query with three conditions This query returns the browser response time for pages with checkout in the URL for Safari users in the United States and Canada over the past 24 hours. SELECT histogram(duration, 50, 20) FROM PageView WHERE countryCode IN ('CA', 'US') AND userAgentName='Safari' AND pageUrl LIKE '%checkout%' SINCE 1 day ago Copy WITH METRIC_FORMAT clause For information on querying metric data, see Query metrics. WITH TIMEZONE clause SELECT ... WITH TIMEZONE (selected zone) ... Copy By default, query results are displayed in the timezone of the browser you're using. Use the WITH TIMEZONE clause to select a time zone for a date or time in the query that hasn't already had a time zone specified for it. For example, the query clause SINCE Monday UNTIL Tuesday WITH TIMEZONE 'America/New_York' will return data recorded from Monday at midnight, Eastern Standard Time, until midnight Tuesday, Eastern Standard Time.

Query metric data Metric data is more complex than other types of data. There are specific tips for querying it well. We have two types of metric data, each with their own query guidelines: Query dimensional metrics, which are reported by our Metric API and by some of our tools that use that API, like our Telemetry SDKs and our open-source telemetry integrations (OpenTelemetry, Kamon, Micrometer, more). Query metric timeslice data, which is our original metric data type reported by our APM, mobile monitoring, and browser monitoring. For more on understanding these data types, see Metric data types. Functions In this section we explain NRQL functions, both aggregator functions and non-aggregator functions. Aggregator functions You can use aggregator functions to filter and aggregate data. Some tips for using these: See New Relic University tutorials for Filter queries, Apdex queries, and Percentile queries. Or, go to the full online course Writing NRQL queries. If you're using an aggregator function multiple times in the same query (e.g., SELECT median(one_metric</var>), median(another_metric)), it can cause problems in displaying results. To solve this, use the AS function. For example: SELECT median(one_metric) as 'med-a', median(another_metric) as 'med-b' Data type \"coercion\" is not supported. Read about available type conversion functions. For how to display results over time, see Group results over time. Examples: SELECT histogram(duration, 10, 20) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy aggregationendtime() Use the aggregationendtime() function to return the time of the relevant aggregation. More specifically, for a given aggregate, the aggregationendtime() function provides the timestamp of the end of the time period of that aggregation. For example, in a timeseries query, for a data point that encompasses an hour’s worth of data, the function would return the timestamp of the end of that hour period. apdex(attribute, t: ) Use the apdex function to return an Apdex score for a single transaction or for all your transactions. The attribute can be any attribute based on response time, such as duration or backendDuration. The t: argument defines an Apdex T threshold in seconds. The Apdex score returned by the apdex( ) function is based only on execution time. It does not account for APM errors. If a transaction includes an error but completes in Apdex T or less, that transaction will be rated satisfying by the apdex ( ) function. Get Apdex for specific customers If you have defined custom attributes, you can filter based on those attributes. For example, you could monitor the Apdex for a particularly important customer: SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.4) FROM Transaction WHERE customerName='ReallyImportantCustomer' SINCE 1 day ago Copy Get Apdex for specific transaction Use the name attribute to return a score for a specific transaction, or return an overall Apdex by omitting name. This query returns an Apdex score for the Controller/notes/index transaction over the last hour: The apdex function returns an Apdex score that measures user satisfaction with your site. Arguments are a response time attribute and an Apdex T threshold in seconds. SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.5) from Transaction WHERE name='Controller/notes/index' SINCE 1 hour ago Copy Get overall Apdex for your app This example query returns an overall Apdex for the application over the last three weeks: SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.08) FROM Transaction SINCE 3 week ago Copy average(attribute) Use the average( ) function to return the average value for an attribute. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. buckets(attribute, ceiling [,number of buckets]) Use the buckets() function to aggregate data split up by a FACET clause into buckets based on ranges. You can bucket by any attribute that is stored as a numerical value in the New Relic database. It takes three arguments: Attribute name Maximum value of the sample range. Any outliers will appear in the final bucket. Total number of buckets For more information and examples, see Split your data into buckets. bucketPercentile(attribute) The bucketPercentile( ) function is the NRQL equivalent of the histogram_quantile function in Prometheus. It is intended to be used with dimensional metric data. Instead of the quantile, New Relic returns the percentile, which is the quantile * 100. Use the bucketPercentile( ) function to calculate the quantile from the histogram data in a Prometheus format. It takes the bucket name as an argument and reports percentiles along the bucket's boundaries: SELECT bucketPercentile(duration_bucket) FROM Metric SINCE 1 day ago Copy Optionally, you can add percentile specifications as an argument: SELECT bucketPercentile(duration_bucket, 50, 75, 90) FROM Metric SINCE 1 day ago Copy Because multiple metrics are used to make up Prometheus histogram data, you must query for specific Prometheus metrics in terms of the associated <basename>. For example, to compute percentiles from a Prometheus histogram, with the <basename> prometheus_http_request_duration_seconds using NRQL, use bucketPercentile(prometheus_http_request_duration_seconds_bucket, 50). Note how _ bucket is added to the end of the <basename> as a suffix. See the Prometheus.io documentation for more information. cardinality(attribute) Use the cardinality( ) function to obtain the number of combinations of all the dimensions (attributes) on a metric. It takes three arguments, all optional: Metric name: if present, cardinality( ) only computes the metric specified. Include: if present, the include list restricts the cardinality computation to those attributes. Exclude: if present, the exclude list causes those attributes to be ignored in the cardinality computation. SELECT cardinality(metric_name, include:{attribute_list}, exclude:{attribute_list}) Copy count(*) Use the count( ) function to return a count of available records. It takes a single argument; either *, an attribute, or a constant value. Currently, it follows typical SQL behavior and counts all records that have values for its argument. Since count(*) does not name a specific attribute, the results will be formatted in the default \"humanize\" format. derivative(attribute [,time interval]) derivative() finds the rate of change for a given dataset. The rate of change is calculated using a linear least-squares regression to approximate the derivative. Since this calculation requires comparing more than one datapoint, if only one datapoint is included in the evaluation range, the calculation is indeterminate and won't work, resulting in a null value. The time interval is the period for which the rate of change is calculated. For example, derivative(attributeName, 1 minute) will return the rate of change per minute. dimensions(include: {attributes}, exclude: {attributes}) Use the dimensions( ) function to return all the dimensional values on a data type. You can explicitly include or exclude specific attributes using the optional arguments: Include: if present, the include list limits dimensions( ) to those attributes. Exclude: if present, the dimensions( ) calculation ignores those attributes. FROM Metric SELECT count(node_filesystem_size) TIMESERIES FACET dimensions() Copy When used with a FACET clause, dimensions( ) produces a unique timeseries for all facets available on the event type, similar to how Prometheus behaves with non-aggregated queries. latestrate(attribute, time interval) Use the latestrate( ) function to return the rate of change of a value based on the last 2 data points. It takes the attribute in question as the first argument and the unit of time for the resulting rate as the second argument. The function returns a result in units of change in attribute/time interval. This function can be useful to provide the most recent rate of change for an attribute in order to see leading-edge trends. Get the most recent rate of change of PageView Duration This query returns the rate of change of duration based on the last 2 data points. It will be returned in units of duration/second because of the 1 SECOND argument. SELECT latestrate(duration, 1 SECOND) FROM PageView Copy max(attribute) Use the max( ) function to return the maximum recorded value of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. median(attribute) Use the median( ) function to return an attribute's median, or 50th percentile. For more information about percentile queries, see percentile(). Tip The median( ) query is only available when using the query builder. Median query This query will generate a line chart for the median value. SELECT median(duration) FROM PageView TIMESERIES AUTO Copy min(attribute) Use the min( ) function to return the minimum recorded value of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. minuteOf(attribute) Use the minuteOf() function to extract only the minute portion (i.e. 0-59) of an attribute holding a valid timestamp value. mod(attribute, divisor) Use the mod( ) function to return the floor modulus after dividing the value of the provided numeric attribute (the first argument, or dividend) by a numeric value (the second argument, or divisor). This modulo operation can be used within a WHERE clause condition to filter to an arbitrary subset of results or within a FACET clause as a way to subdivide the result set. mod() within a WHERE clause condition FROM Transaction SELECT * WHERE mod(port, 2) = 1 Copy mod() within a FACET clause FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT uniques(hostId, 10000) SINCE 1 day AGO FACET mod(hostId, 10) Copy percentage(function(attribute), WHERE condition) Use the percentage( ) function to return the percentage of a target data set that matches some condition. The first argument requires an aggregator function against the desired attribute. Use exactly two arguments (arguments after the first two will be ignored). If the attribute is not numeric, this function returns a value of 100%. percentile(attribute [, percentile [, ...]]) Use the percentile( ) function to return an attribute's approximate value at a given percentile. It requires an attribute and can take any number of arguments representing percentile points. The percentile() function enables percentiles to displays with up to three digits after the decimal point, providing greater precision. Percentile thresholds may be specified as decimal values, but be aware that for most data sets, percentiles closer than 0.1 from each other will not be resolved. Percentile display examples Use TIMESERIES to generate a line chart with percentiles mapped over time. Omit TIMESERIES to generate a billboard and attribute sheet showing aggregate values for the percentiles. If no percentiles are listed, the default is the 95th percentile. To return only the 50th percentile value, the median, you can also use median(). Basic percentile query This query will generate a line chart with lines for the 5th, 50th, and 95th percentile. SELECT percentile(duration, 5, 50, 95) FROM PageView TIMESERIES AUTO Copy predictLinear(attribute, [,time interval]) predictLinear() is an extension of the derivative() function. It uses a similar method of least-squares linear regression to predict the future values for a dataset. The time interval is how far the query will look into the future. For example, predictLinear(attributeName, 1 hour) is a linear prediction 1 hour into the future of the query time window. Generally, predictLinear() is helpful for continuously growing values like disk space, or predictions on large trends. Since predictLinear() is a linear regression, familiarity with the dataset being queried helps to ensure accurate long-term predictions. Any dataset which grows exponentially, logarithmically, or by other nonlinear means will likely only be successful in very short-term predictions. New Relic recommends against using predictLinear in TIMESERIES queries. This is because each bucket will be making an individual prediction based on its relative timeframe within the query, meaning that such queries will not show predictions from the end of the timeseries forward. rate(function(attribute) [,time interval]) Use the rate( ) function to visualize the frequency or rate of a given query per time interval. For example, you might want to know the number of pageviews per minute over an hour-long period or the count of unique sessions on your site per hour over a day-long period. Use TIMESERIES to generate a line chart with rates mapped over time. Omit TIMESERIES to generate a billboard showing a single rate value averaged over time. Basic rate query This query will generate a line chart showing the rate of throughput for APM transactions per 10 minutes over the past 6 hours. SELECT rate(count(*), 10 minute) FROM Transaction SINCE 6 hours ago TIMESERIES Copy round(attribute) Use the round( ) function to return the rounded value of an attribute. Optionally round( ) can take a second argument, to_nearest, to round the first argument to the closest multiple of the second one. to_nearest can be fractional. SELECT round(n [, to_nearest]) Copy stddev(attribute) Use the stddev( ) function to return one standard deviation for a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. stdvar(attribute) Use the stdvar( ) function to return the standard variance for a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. sum(attribute) Use the sum( ) function to return the sum recorded values of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. uniqueCount(attribute) Use the uniqueCount( ) function to return the number of unique values recorded for an attribute over the time range specified. Tip To optimize query performance, this function returns approximate results for queries that inspect more than 256 unique values. uniques(attribute [,limit]) Use the uniques( ) function to return a list of unique values recorded for an attribute over the time range specified. When used along with the facet clause, a list of unique attribute values will be returned per each facet value. The limit parameter is optional. When it is not provided, the default limit of 1,000 unique attribute values per facet is applied. You may specify a different limit value, up to a maximum of 10,000. The uniques( ) function will return the first set of unique attribute values discovered, until the limit is reached. Therefore, if you have 5,000 unique attribute values in your data set, and the limit is set to 1,000, the operator will return the first 1,000 unique values that it discovers, regardless of their frequency. The maximum number of values that can be returned in a query result is the product of the uniques( ) limit times the facet limit. In the following query, the theoretical maximum number of values that can be returned is 5 million (5,000 x 1,000). Depending on the data set being queried, and the complexity of the query, memory protection limits may prevent a very large query from being executed. From Transaction SELECT uniques(host,5000) FACET appName LIMIT 1000 Copy Using tuple If you'd like to know the unique combinations of a handful of attributes, you can structure a query in the format SELECT uniques(tuple(x, y, ... z)) ...` to get all the unique tuples of values, to maintain their relationship. In the following query, tuple is used on index and cellName together to find uniques where those two values occur in combination. FROM NodeStatus SELECT uniques(tuple(index, cellName), 5) Copy capture(attribute, regular expression) Use the capture() to extract values from an attribute using a regular expression. Uses RE2 syntax. It takes two arguments: Attribute name Regular expression with capture syntax. Regex expressions in NRQL use Python-like syntax, r'...'. When capturing, use the RE2 named-capture syntax ...(?P<name> pattern )... to capture the contained pattern, given the specified name. Currently, only 1 capture group is supported. Please see the examples below. capture() within a SELECT clause condition The following will select the domain name of the website, removing https:// and any paths following the .com SELECT capture(pageUrl, r'https://(?P<baseUrl>.*.com)/.+') FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago Copy The following will capture only the first word of the error message. SELECT capture(errorMessage, r'(?P<firstWord>\\S+)\\s.+') FROM Transaction SINCE 1 hour ago where errorMessage is not null Copy capture() within a FACET clause condition The following will facet by the captured HTTP method. SELECT count(*) FROM Log WHERE message like '%HTTP%' FACET capture(message, r'.* \"(?P<httpMethod>[A-Z]+) .*') Copy capture() within a WHERE clause condition The following will filter the results based on Log events with message attribute that matches the regular expression where the captured job name is ExampleJob. SELECT message FROM Log WHERE capture(message, r'.*Job Failed: (?P<jobName>[A-Za-z]+),.*') = 'ExampleJob' SINCE 10 minutes ago Copy capture() with a numeric cast The following will capture sum of CPU Time from log lines. You must explicitly cast to numeric to do mathematical operations. SELECT sum(numeric(capture(message, r'.*CpuTime:\\s(?P<cpuTime>\\d+)'))) FROM Log WHERE message like '%CpuTime:%' SINCE 1 hour ago Copy Non-aggregator functions Use non-aggregator functions for non-numerical data in NRQL queries. earliest(attribute) Use the earliest( ) function to return the earliest value for an attribute over the specified time range. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If used in conjunction with a FACET it will return the most recent value for an attribute for each of the resulting facets. Get earliest country per user agent from PageView This query returns the earliest country code per each user agent from the PageView event. SELECT earliest(countryCode) FROM PageView FACET userAgentName Copy eventType() ...WHERE eventType() = 'EventNameHere'... ...FACET eventType()... Copy Use the eventType() function in a FACET clause to break out results by the selected data type or in a WHERE clause to filter results to a specific data type. This is particularly useful for targeting specific data types with the filter() and percentage() functions. Important In this context, \"event type\" refers to the types of data you can access with a NRQL query. Use eventType() in filter() function This query returns the percentage of total TransactionError results out of the total Transaction results. You can use the eventType() function to target specific types of data with the filter() function. SELECT 100 * filter(count(*), where eventType() = 'TransactionError') / filter(count(*), where eventType() = 'Transaction') FROM Transaction, TransactionError WHERE appName = 'App.Prod' TIMESERIES 2 Minutes SINCE 6 hours ago Copy Use eventType() with FACET This query displays a count of how many records each data type (Transaction and TransactionError) returns. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, TransactionError FACET eventType() TIMESERIES Copy filter(function(attribute), WHERE condition) Use the filter() function to limit the results for one of the aggregator functions in your SELECT statement. You can use filter() in conjunction with FACET or TIMESERIES. Filter is only useful when selecting multiple different aggregations such as SELECT filter(sum(x), WHERE attribute='a') AS 'A', filter(sum(x), WHERE attribute='b') AS 'B' .... Otherwise, it's better to just use the standard WHERE clause. Analyze purchases that used offer codes You could use filter() to compare the items bought in a set of transactions for those using an offer code versus those who aren't: Use the filter( ) function to limit the results for one of the aggregator functions in your SELECT statement. funnel(attribute, steps) Use the funnel() function to generate a funnel chart. It takes an attribute as its first argument. You then specify steps as WHERE clauses (with optional AS clauses for labels) separated by commas. For details and examples, see the funnels documentation. getField(attribute, field) Use the getField() function to extract a field from compound data types, such as metric data. It takes the following arguments: Metric type Supported fields summary count, total, max, min, type gauge count, total, max, min, latest, type distribution count, total, max, min, type counter count, type timeslice count, total, totalExclusive, min, and max Examples: SELECT max(getField(mySummary, count)) from Metric Copy SELECT sum(mySummary) from Metric where getField(mySummary, count) > 10 Copy histogram(attribute, ceiling [,number of buckets]) Use the histogram( ) function to generate histograms. It takes three arguments: Attribute name Maximum value of the sample range Total number of buckets (between 1 and 500, inclusive) Histogram of response times from PageView events This query results in a histogram of response times ranging up to 10 seconds over 20 buckets. SELECT histogram(duration, 10, 20) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy Prometheus histogram buckets histogram( ) accepts Prometheus histogram buckets: SELECT histogram(duration_bucket, 10, 20) FROM Metric SINCE 1 week ago Copy New Relic distribution metric histogram( ) accepts Distribution metric as an input: SELECT histogram(myDistributionMetric, 10, 20) FROM Metric SINCE 1 week ago Copy Histogram with a FACET clause Use histogram( ) with a FACET clause to generate a heatmap chart: SELECT histogram(duration) FROM PageView FACET appName SINCE 1 week ago Copy keyset() Using keyset() will allow you to see all of the attributes for a given data type over a given time range. It takes no arguments. It returns a JSON structure containing groups of string-typed keys, numeric-typed keys, boolean-typed keys, and all keys. See all attributes for a data type This query returns the attributes found for PageView events from the last day: SELECT keyset() FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago Copy latest(attribute) Use the latest( ) function to return the most recent value for an attribute over a specified time range. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If used in conjunction with a FACET it will return the most recent value for an attribute for each of the resulting facets. Get most recent country per user agent from PageView This query returns the most recent country code per each user agent from the PageView event. SELECT latest(countryCode) FROM PageView FACET userAgentName Copy Type conversion NRQL does not support \"coercion.\" This means that a float stored as a string is treated as a string and cannot be operated on by functions expecting float values. You can convert a string with a numeric value or a boolean with a string value to their numeric and boolean types with these functions: Use the numeric() function to convert a number with a string format to a numeric function. The function can be built into a query that uses math functions on query results or NRQL aggregator functions, such as average(). Use the boolean() function to convert a string value of \"true\" or \"false\" to the corresponding boolean value.",

      "body": "One way to query your New Relic data is with the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). This resource explains what NRQL is, when and how you can use it, and basic syntax rules. For more detailed information on querying, including a listing of clauses and functions and example queries, see NRQL syntax, clauses, and functions. What is NRQL? NRQL is New Relic's SQL-like query language. You can use NRQL to retrieve detailed New Relic data and get insight into your applications, hosts, and business-important activity. Reasons to use NRQL include: To answer a question for the purpose of troubleshooting or business analysis To create a new chart To make API queries of New Relic data (for example, using our NerdGraph API) NRQL is used behind the scenes to generate some New Relic charts: Some New Relic charts are built using NRQL. One way to start using NRQL is to view a chart's query and then edit it to make your own custom chart. Where can you use NRQL? You can use NRQL in these places: New Relic One query builder NerdGraph: our GraphQL-format API, which includes options for making NRQL queries one.newrelic.com > Query your data: You can run a NRQL query in New Relic One. This NRQL query shows a count of distributed tracing spans faceted by their entity names. NRQL is one of several ways to query New Relic data. For more on all query options, see Query your data. What data can you query with NRQL? NRQL allows you to query these New Relic data types: Event data from all New Relic products, including: APM events, like Transaction Browser monitoring events, like PageView Mobile monitoring events, like Mobile Infrastructure events, like ProcessSample Synthetics events, like SyntheticCheck Custom events, like those reported by the Event API Metric timeslice data (metrics reported by APM, browser, and mobile) The Metric data type (metrics reported by the Metric API and data sources that use that API) The Span data type (distributed tracing data) The Log data type (data from New Relic Logs) Tip Some data, like relationships between monitored entities, is not available via NRQL but is available using our NerdGraph API. Start using NRQL One way to start using NRQL and to understand what data you have available is to go to a NRQL interface (for example, the New Relic One query builder), type FROM, and press space. The interface will suggest available types of data: To see the attributes available for a specific data type, type FROM DATA_TYPE SELECT and press space. The interface will suggest available attributes. For example: To see the complete JSON associated with a data type, including all of its attributes, use the keyset() attribute. For example: FROM Transaction SELECT keyset() Copy NRQL is used behind the scenes to build some New Relic charts and dashboards. One way to learn NRQL is to find one of these NRQL-generated charts and start playing with the NRQL to create new, customized queries and charts: Charts built with NRQL will have View query as an option. You can then edit and customize that query to see how your changes affect the resulting visualization. Important To explore your data without having to use NRQL, use the data explorer. Learn more about querying data in New Relic. NRQL query examples Here's an example NRQL query of Transaction data, which is reported by APM. FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) FACET appName TIMESERIES auto Copy This would generate a chart that looks like: Here are some more query examples: Basic NRQL query of browser data Here's a NRQL query of PageView data from browser monitoring. SELECT uniqueCount(user) FROM PageView WHERE userAgentOS = 'Mac' FACET countryCode SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 20 Copy Attribute name with a space in it If a custom attribute name has a space in it, use backticks around the attribute name: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET `Logged-in user` Copy Querying multiple data sources To return data from two data sources, separate their data types with a comma. For example, this query returns a count of all APM transactions and browser events over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, PageView SINCE 3 days ago Copy Query returning multiple columns To return multiple columns from a dataset, separate the aggregator arguments with a comma: SELECT function(attribute), function(attribute) ... FROM ... Copy This query returns the minimum, average, and maximum duration for browser monitoring PageView events over the last week: SELECT min(duration), max(duration), average(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy See more NRQL query examples. NRQL syntax The syntax of a NRQL query is similar to standard SQL queries. Here is a breakdown of the structure of a NRQL query: SELECT function(attribute) [AS 'label'][, ...] FROM data type [WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...]][AS 'label'][, ...] [FACET attribute | function(attribute)] [LIMIT number] [SINCE time] [UNTIL time] [WITH TIMEZONE timezone] [COMPARE WITH time] [TIMESERIES time] Copy Basic rules include: NRQL condition Details Required values The SELECT statement and FROM clause are required. All other clauses are optional. You can start your query with either SELECT or FROM. Query string size The query string must be less than 4 KB. Case sensitivity The data type names and attribute names are case sensitive. NRQL clauses and functions are not case sensitive. Syntax for strings NRQL uses single quotes to designate strings. For example: ... where traceId = '030a573f0df02c57' Copy Attribute names with spaces Use backticks `` to quote a custom attribute name that has a space in it. For example: ... FACET `Logged-in user` Copy Data type coercion Insights does not support data type \"coercion.\" For more information, see Data type conversion. Use of math functions Basic and advanced math functions are supported in the SELECT statement. JOIN functions NRQL does not have the equivalent of the SQL JOIN function, but you can simulate a JOIN with custom attributes. Read more about NRQL syntax and functions.",

      "body": "BETA FEATURE This feature is currently in beta. Dimensional metrics are an industry standard for storing and querying metric data. All infrastructure metrics are stored as event data in New Relic, but you can also query them through dimensional metrics. In this page you can learn: The benefits of dimensional metrics. A few examples on how and where to use them. Known issues. Why it matters At New Relic we report metrics in several ways, including dimensional metrics, which are used by our metric API, Telemetry SDK, some open-source integrations, and our infrastructure services. This type of metric enables you to: Enjoy an improved query experience for Infrastructure data. Discover all your metrics in one place. Tap into more metric sources, such as Prometheus. For example, the query to get the maximum duration of your Lambda functions is simplified: Query with samples FROM ServerlessSample SELECT max(provider.duration.Maximum) WHERE provider = 'LambdaFunction' Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT max(aws.lambda.function.duration) Copy Get started No agent or integration updates are required to use these metrics. NRQL alerting based on dimensional metrics is also supported, except for data coming from cloud integrations (that is metrics from AWS polling integrations, GCP, and Azure). AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams metrics are ingested as dimensional metrics and NRQL alerts are recommended. Where and how to query dimensional metrics All current NRQL query features are supported. Queries can use WHERE, FACET, and time selection functions such as SINCE, UNTIL, and COMPARE WITH. The query builder in New Relic One supports metrics in both simple and advanced (NRQL) mode. Naming conventions for metrics and attributes All metric names and attributes for dimensional metrics follow the same naming convention in order to make them easy to find and use. Metric and attribute names are namespaced with dots: for example, the host. prefix is used for host metrics, the k8s. prefix is used for Kubernetes metrics, and aws. is used for AWS metrics. The graphic below shows how a ProcessSample that contains three metrics (cpuPercent, ioTotalReadBytes, and ioTotalWriteBytes) is split into three separate metrics. Note the updated naming of the metrics and the attributes. Dimensional metrics naming convention Examples Here are some examples of NQRL queries with and without dimensional metrics: AWS EBS query example Get the total write time by EBS Volume. Query with samples FROM BlockDeviceSample SELECT sum('provider.volumeTotalWriteTime.Sum') WHERE provider = 'EbsVolume' FACET entityName Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT sum(aws.ebs.volume.TotalWriteTime) FACET entity.name Copy Azure Service bus query example Maximum number of messages in an Azure Service Bus topic by resource group. Query with samples FROM AzureServiceBusTopicSample SELECT max(activeMessages.Maximum) FACET resourceGroupName Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT max(azure.servicebus.topic.activeMessages) FACET azure.resourceGroup Copy Azure functions query example Number of function executions Azure Functions over the past 6 hours by region over time. Query with samples FROM AzureFunctionsAppSample SELECT sum(functionExecutionCount.Total) FACET regionName TIMESERIES SINCE 6 hours ago Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT sum(azure.functions.app.functionExecutionCount) FACET azure.region TIMESERIES SINCE 6 hours ago Copy Azure VMs query example Compare the number of Azure VMs over the past thirty minutes with the same time a week ago. Query with samples FROM AzureVirtualMachineScaleSetSample SELECT uniqueCount(vMName) FACET name SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO COMPARE WITH 1 WEEK AGO Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT uniqueCount(azure.vms.vmName) FACET azure.resourceName WHERE azure.resourceType='Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachineScaleSets' SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO COMPARE WITH 1 WEEK AGO Copy NGINX query example The average number of NGINX requests per second over time. Query with samples FROM NginxSample SELECT average(net.requestsPerSecond) TIMESERIES Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT average(nginx.server.net.requestsPerSecond) TIMESERIES Copy MySQL query example The maximum number of used MySQL connections. Query with samples FROM MysqlSample SELECT max(net.maxUsedConnections) Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT max(mysql.node.net.maxUsedConnections) Copy Known limitations Metric queries with * do not return Infrastructure sample data (for example, SELECT * FROM Metric). In order to select attributes starting with tags. a metric name has to be provided. For example, SELECT uniques(tags.environment) FROM Metric WHERE metricName='aws.lambda.function.duration' does not work without the WHERE clause. Results may not be complete if the selection criteria matches too many samples. For example, SELECT uniqueCount(entity.guid) FROM Metric maps to all Infrastructure samples, and may return incomplete results. Initially there is no support for the newly introduced metric wildcarding feature (for example, SELECT average(host.swap%Bytes) FROM Metric).",

      "body": "NRQL is a query language you can use to query the New Relic database. This document explains NRQL syntax, clauses, components, and functions. Syntax This document is a reference for the functions and clauses used in a NRQL query. Other resources for understanding NRQL: Intro to NRQL: explains what NRQL is used for, what data you can query with it, and basic NRQL syntax Examine NRQL queries used to build New Relic charts Learn how to query the Metric data type Simulate SQL JOIN functions Use funnels to evaluate a series of related data Format NRQL for querying with the Event API Query components Every NRQL query will begin with a SELECT statement or a FROM clause. All other clauses are optional. The clause definitions below also contain example NRQL queries. Required clauses Required: SELECT statement SELECT attribute ... Copy SELECT function(attribute) ... Copy The SELECT specifies what portion of a data type you want to query by specifying an attribute or a function. It's followed by one or more arguments separated by commas. In each argument you can: Get the values of all available attributes by using * as a wildcard. For example: SELECT * from Transaction. Get values associated with a specified attribute or multiple attributes specified in a comma separated list. Get aggregated values from specified attributes by selecting an aggregator function. Label the results returned in each argument with the AS clause. You can also use SELECT with basic math functions. Avg response time since last week This query returns the average response time since last week. SELECT average(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy Required: FROM clause SELECT ... FROM data type ... Copy Use the FROM clause to specify the data type you wish to query. You can start your query with FROM or with SELECT. You can merge values for the same attributes across multiple data types in a comma separated list. Query one data type This query returns the count of all APM transactions over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction SINCE 3 days ago Copy Query multiple data types This query returns the count of all APM transactions and browser events over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, PageView SINCE 3 days ago Copy Optional clauses AS clause SELECT ... AS 'label' ... Copy Use the AS clause to label an attribute, aggregator, step in a funnel, or the result of a math function with a string delimited by single quotes. The label is used in the resulting chart. Query using math function and AS This query returns the number of page views per session: SELECT count(*)/uniqueCount(session) AS 'Pageviews per Session' FROM PageView Copy Query using funnel and AS This query returns a count of people who have visited both the main page and the careers page of a site over the past week: SELECT funnel(SESSION, WHERE name='Controller/about/main' AS 'Step 1', WHERE name = 'Controller/about/careers' AS 'Step 2') FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy COMPARE WITH clause SELECT ... (SINCE or UNTIL) (integer units) AGO COMPARE WITH (integer units) AGO ... Copy Use the COMPARE WITH clause to compare the values for two different time ranges. COMPARE WITH requires a SINCE or UNTIL statement. The time specified by COMPARE WITH is relative to the time specified by SINCE or UNTIL. For example, SINCE 1 day ago COMPARE WITH 1 day ago compares yesterday with the day before. The time range for theCOMPARE WITH value is always the same as that specified by SINCE or UNTIL. For example, SINCE 2 hours ago COMPARE WITH 4 hours ago might compare 3:00pm through 5:00pm against 11:00am through 1:00pm. COMPARE WITH can be formatted as either a line chart or a billboard: With TIMESERIES, COMPARE WITH creates a line chart with the comparison mapped over time. Without TIMESERIES, COMPARE WITH generates a billboard with the current value and the percent change from the COMPARE WITH value. Example: This query returns data as a line chart showing the 95th percentile for the past hour compared to the same range one week ago. First as a single value, then as a line chart. SELECT percentile(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago COMPARE WITH 1 week AGO SELECT percentile(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago COMPARE WITH 1 week AGO TIMESERIES AUTO Copy EXTRAPOLATE clause You can use this clause with these data types: Transaction TransactionError Custom events reported via APM agent APIs The purpose of EXTRAPOLATE is to mathematically compensate for the effects of APM agent sampling of event data so that query results more closely represent the total activity in your system. This clause will be useful when a APM agent reports so many events that it often passes its harvest cycle reporting limits. When that occurs, the agent begins to sample events. When EXTRAPOLATE is used in a NRQL query that supports its use, the ratio between the reported events and the total events is used to extrapolate a close approximation of the total unsampled data. When it is used in a NRQL query that doesn’t support its use or that hasn’t used sampled data, it has no effect. Important Note that EXTRAPOLATE is most useful for homogenous data (like throughput or error rate). It's not effective when attempting to extrapolate a count of distinct things (like uniqueCount() or uniques()). This clause works only with NRQL queries that use one of the following aggregator functions: apdex average count histogram sum percentage (if function it takes as an argument supports EXTRAPOLATE) rate (if function it takes as an argument supports EXTRAPOLATE) stddev Example of extrapolating throughput A query that will show the extrapolated throughput of a service named interestingApplication. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction WHERE appName='interestingApplication' SINCE 60 minutes ago EXTRAPOLATE Copy Example of extrapolating throughput as a time series A query that will show the extrapolated throughput of a service named interestingApplication by transaction name, displayed as a time series. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction WHERE appName='interestingApplication' SINCE 60 minutes ago FACET name TIMESERIES 1 minute EXTRAPOLATE Copy FACET clause SELECT ... FACET attribute ... Copy Use FACET to separate and group your results by attribute values. For example, you could FACET your PageView data by deviceType to figure out what percentage of your traffic comes from mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. Use the LIMIT clause to specify how many facets appear (default is 10). For more complex grouping, use FACET CASES. FACET clauses support up to five attributes, separated by commas. The facets are sorted in descending order by the first field you provide in the SELECT clause. If you are faceting on attributes with more than 2,000 unique values, a subset of facet values is selected and sorted according to the query type. When selecting min(), max(), or count(), FACET uses those functions to determine how facets are picked and sorted. When selecting any other function, FACET uses the frequency of the attribute you are faceting on to determine how facets are picked and sorted. Faceted query using count() This query shows cities with the highest pageview counts. This query uses the total number of pageviews per city to determine how facets are picked and ordered. SELECT count(*) FROM PageView FACET city Copy Faceted query using uniqueCount() This query shows the cities that access the highest number of unique URLs. This query uses the total number of times a particular city appears in the results to determine how facets are picked and ordered. SELECT uniqueCount(pageUrl) FROM PageView FACET city Copy Grouping results across time Advanced segmentation and cohort analysis allow you to facet on bucket functions to more effectively break out your data. Cohort analysis is a way to group results together based on timestamps. You can separate them into buckets that cover a specified range of dates and times. FACET ... AS clause Use FACET ... AS to name facets using the AS keyword in queries. This clause is helpful for adding clearer or simplified names for facets in your results. It can also be used to rename facets in nested aggregation queries. FACET ... AS queries will change the facet names in results (when they appear as headers in tables, for example), but not the actual facet names themselves. FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) FACET response.headers.contentType AS 'content type' Copy FACET CASES clause SELECT ... FACET CASES ( WHERE attribute operator value, WHERE attribute operator value, ... ) ... Copy Use FACET CASES to break out your data by more complex conditions than possible with FACET. Separate multiple conditions with a comma ,. For example, you could query your PageView data and FACET CASES into categories like less than 1 second, from 1 to 10 seconds, and greater than 10 seconds. You can combine multiple attributes within your cases, and label the cases with the AS selector. Data points will be added to at most one facet case, the first facet case that they match. You may also use a time function with your attribute, and you can use the OR operator to facet results that don't match any of your specified cases. Basic usage with WHERE SELECT count(*) FROM PageView FACET CASES (WHERE duration < 1, WHERE duration > 1 and duration < 10, WHERE duration > 10) Copy Group based on multiple attributes This example groups results into one bucket where the transaction name contains login, and another where the URL contains login and a custom attribute indicates that the user was a paid user: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid') Copy Label groups with AS This example uses the AS selector to give your results a human-readable name: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%' AS 'Total Logins', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid' AS 'Feature Visits from Paid Users') Copy Facet non-matching data with OR This example uses the OR operator to facet results that didn't match any of your cases: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid') OR name Copy FACET ... ORDER BY clause In NRQL, the default is for the first aggregation in the SELECT clause to guide the selection of facets in a query. FACET ... ORDER BY allows you to override this default behavior by adding an aggregate function with the ORDER BY modifier to specify how facets are selected. Specifically, the clause will override the priority by which facets are chosen to be in the final result before being limited by the LIMIT clause. This clause can be used in querying but not for alerts or streaming. This example shows how to use FACET ... ORDER BY to find the average durations of app transactions, showing the top 10 (default limit) highest durations by apps which have the highest response size. In this case, if FACET ... ORDER BY is not used, the query results will instead show the top 10 by highest durations, with response size being irrelevant to the app selection. FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) TIMESERIES FACET appName ORDER BY max(responseSize) Copy Tip Because the operations are performed before the LIMIT clause is applied, FACET ... ORDER BY does not impact the sort of the final query results, which will be particularly noticeable in the results for non-timeseries queries. Important The ORDER BY modifier in this case works differently than the ORDER BY clause. When parsing queries that follow the format FACET attribute1 ORDER BY attribute2, New Relic will read these as FACET ... ORDER BY queries, but only if ORDER BY appears immediately after FACET. Otherwise ORDER BY will be interpreted by New Relic as a clause. LIMIT clause SELECT ... LIMIT count ... Copy Use the LIMIT clause to control the maximum number of facet values returned by FACET queries or the maximum number of items returned by SELECT * queries. This clause takes a single integer value as an argument. If the LIMIT clause is not specified, or no value is provided, the limit defaults to 10 for FACET queries and 100 in the case of SELECT * queries. The maximum allowed value for the LIMIT clause is 2,000. Query using LIMIT This query shows the top 20 countries by session count and provides 95th percentile of response time for each country for Windows users only. SELECT uniqueCount(session), percentile(duration, 95) FROM PageView WHERE userAgentOS = 'Windows' FACET countryCode LIMIT 20 SINCE YESTERDAY Copy OFFSET clause SELECT ... LIMIT count OFFSET count ... Copy Use the OFFSET clause with LIMIT to control the portion of rows returned by SELECT * or SELECT column queries. Like the LIMIT clause, OFFSET takes a single integer value as an argument. OFFSET sets the number of rows to be skipped before the selected rows of your query are returned. This is constrained by LIMIT. OFFSET rows are skipped starting from the most recent record. For example, the query SELECT interestingValue FROM Minute_Report LIMIT 5 OFFSET 1 returns the last 5 values from Minute_Report except for the most recent one. ORDER BY clause The ORDER BY clause allows you to specify how you want to sort your query results in queries that select event attributes by row. This query orders transactions by duration. FROM Transaction SELECT appName, duration ORDER BY duration Copy The default sort order is ascending, but this can be changed by adding the ASC or DESC modifiers. SHOW EVENT TYPES clause SHOW EVENT TYPES... Copy SHOW EVENT TYPES will return a list of all the data types present in your account for a specific time range. It is used as the first clause in a query instead of SELECT. Important In this context, \"event types\" refers to the data types you can access with a NRQL query. Data types in the last day This query will return all the data types present over the past day: SHOW EVENT TYPES SINCE 1 day ago Copy SINCE clause SELECT ... SINCE [numerical units AGO | phrase] ... Copy The default value is 1 hour ago. Use the SINCE clause to define the beginning of a time range for the returned data. When using NRQL, you can set a UTC timestamp or relative time range. You can specify a timezone for the query but not for the results. NRQL results are based on your system time. SLIDE BY clause The SLIDE BY clause supports a feature known as sliding windows. With sliding windows,SLIDE BY data is gathered into \"windows\" of time that overlap with each other. These windows can help to smooth out line graphs with a lot of variation in cases where the rolling aggregate (such as a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. To use SLIDE BY, place it in a query after the TIMESERIES clause. For example, this query pulls data in 5-minute windows with a 1-minute SLIDE BY interval, meaning that each window lasts 5 minutes, but window 1 starts at 0 minutes, window 2 starts at 1 minute, window 3 starts at 2 minutes, and so on. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY 1 minute Copy To learn more about how and when you can use SLIDE BY, see Create smoother charts with sliding windows. Use SLIDE BY with MAX or AUTO interval You can use sliding windows in combination with MAX or AUTO. However, MAX or AUTO may not be placed between TIMESERIES and SLIDE BY. This query will automatically decide a SLIDE BY window interval. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY AUTO Copy This query will set the SLIDE BY window to the maximum interval granularity. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY MAX Copy Important The SLIDE BY value as determined by AUTO or MAX can produce a step interval greater than the window size, which can cause gaps and unexpected results. TIMESERIES clause SELECT ... TIMESERIES integer units ... Copy Use the TIMESERIES clause to return data as a time series broken out by a specified period of time. Since TIMESERIES is used to trigger certain charts, there is no default value. To indicate the time range, use integer units. For example: TIMESERIES 1 minute TIMESERIES 30 minutes TIMESERIES 1 hour TIMESERIES 30 seconds TIMESERIES can be combined with arguments such as MAX, AUTO, and SLIDE BY to further tailor query results, as shown in the examples below. Important For functions such as average( ) or percentile( ), a large aggregation window can have a significant smoothing effect on outliers. This is true whether or not the query makes use of sliding windows. Use a set interval The value provided indicates the units used to break out the graph. For example, to present a one-day graph showing 30 minute increments: SELECT ... SINCE 1 day AGO TIMESERIES 30 minutes Copy Use an automatically set interval TIMESERIES can also be set to AUTO, which will divide your graph into a reasonable number of divisions. For example, a daily chart will be divided into 30 minute intervals and a weekly chart will be divided into 6 hour intervals. This query returns data as a line chart showing the 50th and 90th percentile of client-side transaction time for one week with a data point every 6 hours. SELECT average(duration), percentile(duration, 50, 90) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week AGO TIMESERIES AUTO Copy Use MAX interval You can set TIMESERIES to MAX, which will automatically adjust your time window to the maximum number of intervals allowed for a given time period. This allows you to update your time windows without having to manually update your TIMESERIES buckets and ensures your time window is being split into the peak number of intervals allowed. The maximum number of TIMESERIES buckets that will be returned is 366. For example, the following query creates 4-minute intervals, which is the ceiling for a daily chart. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction since 1 day ago TIMESERIES MAX Copy UNTIL clause SELECT ... UNTIL integer units AGO ... Copy The default value is NOW. Only use UNTIL to specify an end point other than the default. Use the UNTIL clause to define the end of a time range across which to return data. Once a time range has been specified, the data will be preserved and can be reviewed after the time range has ended. See Use the time picker to adjust time settings for detailed information and examples. WHERE clause Use the WHERE clause to filter results. NRQL returns the results that fulfill the condition(s) you specify in the clause. SELECT function(attribute) ... WHERE attribute [operator 'value' | IN ('value' [, 'value]) | IS [NOT] NULL ] [AND|OR ...] ... Copy If you specify more than one condition, separate the conditions by the operators AND or OR. If you want to simulate a SQL join, use custom attributes in a WHERE or FACET clause. Operators that the WHERE clause accepts Description =, !=, <, <=, >, >= NRQL accepts standard comparison operators. Example: state = 'WA' AND Used to define an intersection of two conditions. OR Used to define a union of two conditions. IS NULL Determines if an attribute has a null value. IS NOT NULL Determines if an attribute does not have a null value. IN Determines if the string value of an attribute is in a specified set. Using this method yields better performance than stringing together multiple WHERE clauses. Example: animalType IN ('cat', 'dog', 'fish') NOT IN Determines if the string value of an attribute is not in a specified set. Using this method yields better performance than stringing together multiple WHERE clauses. Values must be in parentheses, separated by commas. For example: SELECT * FROM PageView WHERE countryCode NOT IN ('CA', 'WA') Copy LIKE Determines if an attribute contains a specified sub-string. The string argument for the LIKE operator accepts the percent sign (%) as a wildcard anywhere in the string. If the substring does not begin or end the string you are matching against, the wildcard must begin or end the string. Examples: userAgentName LIKE 'IE%' IE IE Mobile userAgentName LIKE 'o%a%' Opera Opera Mini userAgentName LIKE 'o%a' Opera userAgentName LIKE '%o%a%' Opera Opera Mini Mozilla Gecko NOT LIKE Determines if an attribute does not contain a specified sub-string. RLIKE Determines if an attribute contains a specified Regex sub-string. Uses RE2 syntax. Examples: appName RLIKE r'z.*|q.*'' hostname RLIKE r'ip-10-351-[0-2]?[0-9]-.*' z-app q-app ip-10-351-19-237 ip-10-351-2-41 ip-10-351-24-238 ip-10-351-14-15 Important Regex defaults to full-string matching, therefore ^ and $ are implicit and you do not need to add them. NOT RLIKE Determines if an attribute does not contain a specified Regex sub-string. Uses RE2 syntax. Example query with three conditions This query returns the browser response time for pages with checkout in the URL for Safari users in the United States and Canada over the past 24 hours. SELECT histogram(duration, 50, 20) FROM PageView WHERE countryCode IN ('CA', 'US') AND userAgentName='Safari' AND pageUrl LIKE '%checkout%' SINCE 1 day ago Copy WITH METRIC_FORMAT clause For information on querying metric data, see Query metrics. WITH TIMEZONE clause SELECT ... WITH TIMEZONE (selected zone) ... Copy By default, query results are displayed in the timezone of the browser you're using. Use the WITH TIMEZONE clause to select a time zone for a date or time in the query that hasn't already had a time zone specified for it. For example, the query clause SINCE Monday UNTIL Tuesday WITH TIMEZONE 'America/New_York' will return data recorded from Monday at midnight, Eastern Standard Time, until midnight Tuesday, Eastern Standard Time.

Query metric data Metric data is more complex than other types of data. There are specific tips for querying it well. We have two types of metric data, each with their own query guidelines: Query dimensional metrics, which are reported by our Metric API and by some of our tools that use that API, like our Telemetry SDKs and our open-source telemetry integrations (OpenTelemetry, Kamon, Micrometer, more). Query metric timeslice data, which is our original metric data type reported by our APM, mobile monitoring, and browser monitoring. For more on understanding these data types, see Metric data types. Functions In this section we explain NRQL functions, both aggregator functions and non-aggregator functions. Aggregator functions You can use aggregator functions to filter and aggregate data. Some tips for using these: See New Relic University tutorials for Filter queries, Apdex queries, and Percentile queries. Or, go to the full online course Writing NRQL queries. If you're using an aggregator function multiple times in the same query (e.g., SELECT median(one_metric</var>), median(another_metric)), it can cause problems in displaying results. To solve this, use the AS function. For example: SELECT median(one_metric) as 'med-a', median(another_metric) as 'med-b' Data type \"coercion\" is not supported. Read about available type conversion functions. For how to display results over time, see Group results over time. Examples: SELECT histogram(duration, 10, 20) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy aggregationendtime() Use the aggregationendtime() function to return the time of the relevant aggregation. More specifically, for a given aggregate, the aggregationendtime() function provides the timestamp of the end of the time period of that aggregation. For example, in a timeseries query, for a data point that encompasses an hour’s worth of data, the function would return the timestamp of the end of that hour period. apdex(attribute, t: ) Use the apdex function to return an Apdex score for a single transaction or for all your transactions. The attribute can be any attribute based on response time, such as duration or backendDuration. The t: argument defines an Apdex T threshold in seconds. The Apdex score returned by the apdex( ) function is based only on execution time. It does not account for APM errors. If a transaction includes an error but completes in Apdex T or less, that transaction will be rated satisfying by the apdex ( ) function. Get Apdex for specific customers If you have defined custom attributes, you can filter based on those attributes. For example, you could monitor the Apdex for a particularly important customer: SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.4) FROM Transaction WHERE customerName='ReallyImportantCustomer' SINCE 1 day ago Copy Get Apdex for specific transaction Use the name attribute to return a score for a specific transaction, or return an overall Apdex by omitting name. This query returns an Apdex score for the Controller/notes/index transaction over the last hour: The apdex function returns an Apdex score that measures user satisfaction with your site. Arguments are a response time attribute and an Apdex T threshold in seconds. SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.5) from Transaction WHERE name='Controller/notes/index' SINCE 1 hour ago Copy Get overall Apdex for your app This example query returns an overall Apdex for the application over the last three weeks: SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.08) FROM Transaction SINCE 3 week ago Copy average(attribute) Use the average( ) function to return the average value for an attribute. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. buckets(attribute, ceiling [,number of buckets]) Use the buckets() function to aggregate data split up by a FACET clause into buckets based on ranges. You can bucket by any attribute that is stored as a numerical value in the New Relic database. It takes three arguments: Attribute name Maximum value of the sample range. Any outliers will appear in the final bucket. Total number of buckets For more information and examples, see Split your data into buckets. bucketPercentile(attribute) The bucketPercentile( ) function is the NRQL equivalent of the histogram_quantile function in Prometheus. It is intended to be used with dimensional metric data. Instead of the quantile, New Relic returns the percentile, which is the quantile * 100. Use the bucketPercentile( ) function to calculate the quantile from the histogram data in a Prometheus format. It takes the bucket name as an argument and reports percentiles along the bucket's boundaries: SELECT bucketPercentile(duration_bucket) FROM Metric SINCE 1 day ago Copy Optionally, you can add percentile specifications as an argument: SELECT bucketPercentile(duration_bucket, 50, 75, 90) FROM Metric SINCE 1 day ago Copy Because multiple metrics are used to make up Prometheus histogram data, you must query for specific Prometheus metrics in terms of the associated <basename>. For example, to compute percentiles from a Prometheus histogram, with the <basename> prometheus_http_request_duration_seconds using NRQL, use bucketPercentile(prometheus_http_request_duration_seconds_bucket, 50). Note how _ bucket is added to the end of the <basename> as a suffix. See the Prometheus.io documentation for more information. cardinality(attribute) Use the cardinality( ) function to obtain the number of combinations of all the dimensions (attributes) on a metric. It takes three arguments, all optional: Metric name: if present, cardinality( ) only computes the metric specified. Include: if present, the include list restricts the cardinality computation to those attributes. Exclude: if present, the exclude list causes those attributes to be ignored in the cardinality computation. SELECT cardinality(metric_name, include:{attribute_list}, exclude:{attribute_list}) Copy count(*) Use the count( ) function to return a count of available records. It takes a single argument; either *, an attribute, or a constant value. Currently, it follows typical SQL behavior and counts all records that have values for its argument. Since count(*) does not name a specific attribute, the results will be formatted in the default \"humanize\" format. derivative(attribute [,time interval]) derivative() finds the rate of change for a given dataset. The rate of change is calculated using a linear least-squares regression to approximate the derivative. Since this calculation requires comparing more than one datapoint, if only one datapoint is included in the evaluation range, the calculation is indeterminate and won't work, resulting in a null value. The time interval is the period for which the rate of change is calculated. For example, derivative(attributeName, 1 minute) will return the rate of change per minute. dimensions(include: {attributes}, exclude: {attributes}) Use the dimensions( ) function to return all the dimensional values on a data type. You can explicitly include or exclude specific attributes using the optional arguments: Include: if present, the include list limits dimensions( ) to those attributes. Exclude: if present, the dimensions( ) calculation ignores those attributes. FROM Metric SELECT count(node_filesystem_size) TIMESERIES FACET dimensions() Copy When used with a FACET clause, dimensions( ) produces a unique timeseries for all facets available on the event type, similar to how Prometheus behaves with non-aggregated queries. latestrate(attribute, time interval) Use the latestrate( ) function to return the rate of change of a value based on the last 2 data points. It takes the attribute in question as the first argument and the unit of time for the resulting rate as the second argument. The function returns a result in units of change in attribute/time interval. This function can be useful to provide the most recent rate of change for an attribute in order to see leading-edge trends. Get the most recent rate of change of PageView Duration This query returns the rate of change of duration based on the last 2 data points. It will be returned in units of duration/second because of the 1 SECOND argument. SELECT latestrate(duration, 1 SECOND) FROM PageView Copy max(attribute) Use the max( ) function to return the maximum recorded value of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. median(attribute) Use the median( ) function to return an attribute's median, or 50th percentile. For more information about percentile queries, see percentile(). Tip The median( ) query is only available when using the query builder. Median query This query will generate a line chart for the median value. SELECT median(duration) FROM PageView TIMESERIES AUTO Copy min(attribute) Use the min( ) function to return the minimum recorded value of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. minuteOf(attribute) Use the minuteOf() function to extract only the minute portion (i.e. 0-59) of an attribute holding a valid timestamp value. mod(attribute, divisor) Use the mod( ) function to return the floor modulus after dividing the value of the provided numeric attribute (the first argument, or dividend) by a numeric value (the second argument, or divisor). This modulo operation can be used within a WHERE clause condition to filter to an arbitrary subset of results or within a FACET clause as a way to subdivide the result set. mod() within a WHERE clause condition FROM Transaction SELECT * WHERE mod(port, 2) = 1 Copy mod() within a FACET clause FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT uniques(hostId, 10000) SINCE 1 day AGO FACET mod(hostId, 10) Copy percentage(function(attribute), WHERE condition) Use the percentage( ) function to return the percentage of a target data set that matches some condition. The first argument requires an aggregator function against the desired attribute. Use exactly two arguments (arguments after the first two will be ignored). If the attribute is not numeric, this function returns a value of 100%. percentile(attribute [, percentile [, ...]]) Use the percentile( ) function to return an attribute's approximate value at a given percentile. It requires an attribute and can take any number of arguments representing percentile points. The percentile() function enables percentiles to displays with up to three digits after the decimal point, providing greater precision. Percentile thresholds may be specified as decimal values, but be aware that for most data sets, percentiles closer than 0.1 from each other will not be resolved. Percentile display examples Use TIMESERIES to generate a line chart with percentiles mapped over time. Omit TIMESERIES to generate a billboard and attribute sheet showing aggregate values for the percentiles. If no percentiles are listed, the default is the 95th percentile. To return only the 50th percentile value, the median, you can also use median(). Basic percentile query This query will generate a line chart with lines for the 5th, 50th, and 95th percentile. SELECT percentile(duration, 5, 50, 95) FROM PageView TIMESERIES AUTO Copy predictLinear(attribute, [,time interval]) predictLinear() is an extension of the derivative() function. It uses a similar method of least-squares linear regression to predict the future values for a dataset. The time interval is how far the query will look into the future. For example, predictLinear(attributeName, 1 hour) is a linear prediction 1 hour into the future of the query time window. Generally, predictLinear() is helpful for continuously growing values like disk space, or predictions on large trends. Since predictLinear() is a linear regression, familiarity with the dataset being queried helps to ensure accurate long-term predictions. Any dataset which grows exponentially, logarithmically, or by other nonlinear means will likely only be successful in very short-term predictions. New Relic recommends against using predictLinear in TIMESERIES queries. This is because each bucket will be making an individual prediction based on its relative timeframe within the query, meaning that such queries will not show predictions from the end of the timeseries forward. rate(function(attribute) [,time interval]) Use the rate( ) function to visualize the frequency or rate of a given query per time interval. For example, you might want to know the number of pageviews per minute over an hour-long period or the count of unique sessions on your site per hour over a day-long period. Use TIMESERIES to generate a line chart with rates mapped over time. Omit TIMESERIES to generate a billboard showing a single rate value averaged over time. Basic rate query This query will generate a line chart showing the rate of throughput for APM transactions per 10 minutes over the past 6 hours. SELECT rate(count(*), 10 minute) FROM Transaction SINCE 6 hours ago TIMESERIES Copy round(attribute) Use the round( ) function to return the rounded value of an attribute. Optionally round( ) can take a second argument, to_nearest, to round the first argument to the closest multiple of the second one. to_nearest can be fractional. SELECT round(n [, to_nearest]) Copy stddev(attribute) Use the stddev( ) function to return one standard deviation for a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. stdvar(attribute) Use the stdvar( ) function to return the standard variance for a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. sum(attribute) Use the sum( ) function to return the sum recorded values of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. uniqueCount(attribute) Use the uniqueCount( ) function to return the number of unique values recorded for an attribute over the time range specified. Tip To optimize query performance, this function returns approximate results for queries that inspect more than 256 unique values. uniques(attribute [,limit]) Use the uniques( ) function to return a list of unique values recorded for an attribute over the time range specified. When used along with the facet clause, a list of unique attribute values will be returned per each facet value. The limit parameter is optional. When it is not provided, the default limit of 1,000 unique attribute values per facet is applied. You may specify a different limit value, up to a maximum of 10,000. The uniques( ) function will return the first set of unique attribute values discovered, until the limit is reached. Therefore, if you have 5,000 unique attribute values in your data set, and the limit is set to 1,000, the operator will return the first 1,000 unique values that it discovers, regardless of their frequency. The maximum number of values that can be returned in a query result is the product of the uniques( ) limit times the facet limit. In the following query, the theoretical maximum number of values that can be returned is 5 million (5,000 x 1,000). Depending on the data set being queried, and the complexity of the query, memory protection limits may prevent a very large query from being executed. From Transaction SELECT uniques(host,5000) FACET appName LIMIT 1000 Copy Using tuple If you'd like to know the unique combinations of a handful of attributes, you can structure a query in the format SELECT uniques(tuple(x, y, ... z)) ...` to get all the unique tuples of values, to maintain their relationship. In the following query, tuple is used on index and cellName together to find uniques where those two values occur in combination. FROM NodeStatus SELECT uniques(tuple(index, cellName), 5) Copy capture(attribute, regular expression) Use the capture() to extract values from an attribute using a regular expression. Uses RE2 syntax. It takes two arguments: Attribute name Regular expression with capture syntax. Regex expressions in NRQL use Python-like syntax, r'...'. When capturing, use the RE2 named-capture syntax ...(?P<name> pattern )... to capture the contained pattern, given the specified name. Currently, only 1 capture group is supported. Please see the examples below. capture() within a SELECT clause condition The following will select the domain name of the website, removing https:// and any paths following the .com SELECT capture(pageUrl, r'https://(?P<baseUrl>.*.com)/.+') FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago Copy The following will capture only the first word of the error message. SELECT capture(errorMessage, r'(?P<firstWord>\\S+)\\s.+') FROM Transaction SINCE 1 hour ago where errorMessage is not null Copy capture() within a FACET clause condition The following will facet by the captured HTTP method. SELECT count(*) FROM Log WHERE message like '%HTTP%' FACET capture(message, r'.* \"(?P<httpMethod>[A-Z]+) .*') Copy capture() within a WHERE clause condition The following will filter the results based on Log events with message attribute that matches the regular expression where the captured job name is ExampleJob. SELECT message FROM Log WHERE capture(message, r'.*Job Failed: (?P<jobName>[A-Za-z]+),.*') = 'ExampleJob' SINCE 10 minutes ago Copy capture() with a numeric cast The following will capture sum of CPU Time from log lines. You must explicitly cast to numeric to do mathematical operations. SELECT sum(numeric(capture(message, r'.*CpuTime:\\s(?P<cpuTime>\\d+)'))) FROM Log WHERE message like '%CpuTime:%' SINCE 1 hour ago Copy Non-aggregator functions Use non-aggregator functions for non-numerical data in NRQL queries. earliest(attribute) Use the earliest( ) function to return the earliest value for an attribute over the specified time range. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If used in conjunction with a FACET it will return the most recent value for an attribute for each of the resulting facets. Get earliest country per user agent from PageView This query returns the earliest country code per each user agent from the PageView event. SELECT earliest(countryCode) FROM PageView FACET userAgentName Copy eventType() ...WHERE eventType() = 'EventNameHere'... ...FACET eventType()... Copy Use the eventType() function in a FACET clause to break out results by the selected data type or in a WHERE clause to filter results to a specific data type. This is particularly useful for targeting specific data types with the filter() and percentage() functions. Important In this context, \"event type\" refers to the types of data you can access with a NRQL query. Use eventType() in filter() function This query returns the percentage of total TransactionError results out of the total Transaction results. You can use the eventType() function to target specific types of data with the filter() function. SELECT 100 * filter(count(*), where eventType() = 'TransactionError') / filter(count(*), where eventType() = 'Transaction') FROM Transaction, TransactionError WHERE appName = 'App.Prod' TIMESERIES 2 Minutes SINCE 6 hours ago Copy Use eventType() with FACET This query displays a count of how many records each data type (Transaction and TransactionError) returns. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, TransactionError FACET eventType() TIMESERIES Copy filter(function(attribute), WHERE condition) Use the filter() function to limit the results for one of the aggregator functions in your SELECT statement. You can use filter() in conjunction with FACET or TIMESERIES. Filter is only useful when selecting multiple different aggregations such as SELECT filter(sum(x), WHERE attribute='a') AS 'A', filter(sum(x), WHERE attribute='b') AS 'B' .... Otherwise, it's better to just use the standard WHERE clause. Analyze purchases that used offer codes You could use filter() to compare the items bought in a set of transactions for those using an offer code versus those who aren't: Use the filter( ) function to limit the results for one of the aggregator functions in your SELECT statement. funnel(attribute, steps) Use the funnel() function to generate a funnel chart. It takes an attribute as its first argument. You then specify steps as WHERE clauses (with optional AS clauses for labels) separated by commas. For details and examples, see the funnels documentation. getField(attribute, field) Use the getField() function to extract a field from compound data types, such as metric data. It takes the following arguments: Metric type Supported fields summary count, total, max, min, type gauge count, total, max, min, latest, type distribution count, total, max, min, type counter count, type timeslice count, total, totalExclusive, min, and max Examples: SELECT max(getField(mySummary, count)) from Metric Copy SELECT sum(mySummary) from Metric where getField(mySummary, count) > 10 Copy histogram(attribute, ceiling [,number of buckets]) Use the histogram( ) function to generate histograms. It takes three arguments: Attribute name Maximum value of the sample range Total number of buckets (between 1 and 500, inclusive) Histogram of response times from PageView events This query results in a histogram of response times ranging up to 10 seconds over 20 buckets. SELECT histogram(duration, 10, 20) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy Prometheus histogram buckets histogram( ) accepts Prometheus histogram buckets: SELECT histogram(duration_bucket, 10, 20) FROM Metric SINCE 1 week ago Copy New Relic distribution metric histogram( ) accepts Distribution metric as an input: SELECT histogram(myDistributionMetric, 10, 20) FROM Metric SINCE 1 week ago Copy Histogram with a FACET clause Use histogram( ) with a FACET clause to generate a heatmap chart: SELECT histogram(duration) FROM PageView FACET appName SINCE 1 week ago Copy keyset() Using keyset() will allow you to see all of the attributes for a given data type over a given time range. It takes no arguments. It returns a JSON structure containing groups of string-typed keys, numeric-typed keys, boolean-typed keys, and all keys. See all attributes for a data type This query returns the attributes found for PageView events from the last day: SELECT keyset() FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago Copy latest(attribute) Use the latest( ) function to return the most recent value for an attribute over a specified time range. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If used in conjunction with a FACET it will return the most recent value for an attribute for each of the resulting facets. Get most recent country per user agent from PageView This query returns the most recent country code per each user agent from the PageView event. SELECT latest(countryCode) FROM PageView FACET userAgentName Copy Type conversion NRQL does not support \"coercion.\" This means that a float stored as a string is treated as a string and cannot be operated on by functions expecting float values. You can convert a string with a numeric value or a boolean with a string value to their numeric and boolean types with these functions: Use the numeric() function to convert a number with a string format to a numeric function. The function can be built into a query that uses math functions on query results or NRQL aggregator functions, such as average(). Use the boolean() function to convert a string value of \"true\" or \"false\" to the corresponding boolean value.",

NRQL allows you to query these New Relic data types: Event data from all New Relic products, including: APM events, like Transaction Browser monitoring events, like PageView Mobile monitoring events, like Mobile Infrastructure events, like ProcessSample Synthetics events, like SyntheticCheck Custom events, like those reported by the Event API Metric timeslice data (metrics reported by APM, browser, and mobile) The Metric data type (metrics reported by the Metric API and data sources that use that API) The Span data type (distributed tracing data) The Log data type (data from New Relic Logs) Tip Some data, like relationships between monitored entities, is not available via NRQL but is available using our NerdGraph API. Start using NRQL One way to start using NRQL and to understand what data you have available is to go to a NRQL interface (for example, the New Relic One query builder), type FROM, and press space. The interface will suggest available types of data: To see the attributes available for a specific data type, type FROM DATA_TYPE SELECT and press space. The interface will suggest available attributes. For example: To see the complete JSON associated with a data type, including all of its attributes, use the keyset() attribute. For example: FROM Transaction SELECT keyset() Copy NRQL is used behind the scenes to build some New Relic charts and dashboards. One way to learn NRQL is to find one of these NRQL-generated charts and start playing with the NRQL to create new, customized queries and charts: Charts built with NRQL will have View query as an option. You can then edit and customize that query to see how your changes affect the resulting visualization. Important To explore your data without having to use NRQL, use the data explorer. Learn more about querying data in New Relic. NRQL query examples Here's an example NRQL query of Transaction data, which is reported by APM. FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) FACET appName TIMESERIES auto Copy This would generate a chart that looks like: Here are some more query examples: Basic NRQL query of browser data Here's a NRQL query of PageView data from browser monitoring. SELECT uniqueCount(user) FROM PageView WHERE userAgentOS = 'Mac' FACET countryCode SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 20 Copy Attribute name with a space in it If a custom attribute name has a space in it, use backticks around the attribute name: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET `Logged-in user` Copy Querying multiple data sources To return data from two data sources, separate their data types with a comma. For example, this query returns a count of all APM transactions and browser events over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, PageView SINCE 3 days ago Copy Query returning multiple columns To return multiple columns from a dataset, separate the aggregator arguments with a comma: SELECT function(attribute), function(attribute) ... FROM ... Copy This query returns the minimum, average, and maximum duration for browser monitoring PageView events over the last week: SELECT min(duration), max(duration), average(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy See more NRQL query examples. NRQL syntax The syntax of a NRQL query is similar to standard SQL queries. Here is a breakdown of the structure of a NRQL query: SELECT function(attribute) [AS 'label'][, ...] FROM data type [WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...]][AS 'label'][, ...] [FACET attribute | function(attribute)] [LIMIT number] [SINCE time] [UNTIL time] [WITH TIMEZONE timezone] [COMPARE WITH time] [TIMESERIES time] Copy Basic rules include: NRQL condition Details Required values The SELECT statement and FROM clause are required. All other clauses are optional. You can start your query with either SELECT or FROM. Query string size The query string must be less than 4 KB. Case sensitivity The data type names and attribute names are case sensitive. NRQL clauses and functions are not case sensitive. Syntax for strings NRQL uses single quotes to designate strings. For example: ... where traceId = '030a573f0df02c57' Copy Attribute names with spaces Use backticks `` to quote a custom attribute name that has a space in it. For example: ... FACET `Logged-in user` Copy Data type coercion Insights does not support data type \"coercion.\" For more information, see Data type conversion. Use of math functions Basic and advanced math functions are supported in the SELECT statement. JOIN functions NRQL does not have the equivalent of the SQL JOIN function, but you can simulate a JOIN with custom attributes. Read more about NRQL syntax and functions.",

      "body": "BETA FEATURE This feature is currently in beta. Dimensional metrics are an industry standard for storing and querying metric data. All infrastructure metrics are stored as event data in New Relic, but you can also query them through dimensional metrics. In this page you can learn: The benefits of dimensional metrics. A few examples on how and where to use them. Known issues. Why it matters At New Relic we report metrics in several ways, including dimensional metrics, which are used by our metric API, Telemetry SDK, some open-source integrations, and our infrastructure services. This type of metric enables you to: Enjoy an improved query experience for Infrastructure data. Discover all your metrics in one place. Tap into more metric sources, such as Prometheus. For example, the query to get the maximum duration of your Lambda functions is simplified: Query with samples FROM ServerlessSample SELECT max(provider.duration.Maximum) WHERE provider = 'LambdaFunction' Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT max(aws.lambda.function.duration) Copy Get started No agent or integration updates are required to use these metrics. NRQL alerting based on dimensional metrics is also supported, except for data coming from cloud integrations (that is metrics from AWS polling integrations, GCP, and Azure). AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams metrics are ingested as dimensional metrics and NRQL alerts are recommended. Where and how to query dimensional metrics All current NRQL query features are supported. Queries can use WHERE, FACET, and time selection functions such as SINCE, UNTIL, and COMPARE WITH. The query builder in New Relic One supports metrics in both simple and advanced (NRQL) mode. Naming conventions for metrics and attributes All metric names and attributes for dimensional metrics follow the same naming convention in order to make them easy to find and use. Metric and attribute names are namespaced with dots: for example, the host. prefix is used for host metrics, the k8s. prefix is used for Kubernetes metrics, and aws. is used for AWS metrics. The graphic below shows how a ProcessSample that contains three metrics (cpuPercent, ioTotalReadBytes, and ioTotalWriteBytes) is split into three separate metrics. Note the updated naming of the metrics and the attributes. Dimensional metrics naming convention Examples Here are some examples of NQRL queries with and without dimensional metrics: AWS EBS query example Get the total write time by EBS Volume. Query with samples FROM BlockDeviceSample SELECT sum('provider.volumeTotalWriteTime.Sum') WHERE provider = 'EbsVolume' FACET entityName Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT sum(aws.ebs.volume.TotalWriteTime) FACET entity.name Copy Azure Service bus query example Maximum number of messages in an Azure Service Bus topic by resource group. Query with samples FROM AzureServiceBusTopicSample SELECT max(activeMessages.Maximum) FACET resourceGroupName Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT max(azure.servicebus.topic.activeMessages) FACET azure.resourceGroup Copy Azure functions query example Number of function executions Azure Functions over the past 6 hours by region over time. Query with samples FROM AzureFunctionsAppSample SELECT sum(functionExecutionCount.Total) FACET regionName TIMESERIES SINCE 6 hours ago Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT sum(azure.functions.app.functionExecutionCount) FACET azure.region TIMESERIES SINCE 6 hours ago Copy Azure VMs query example Compare the number of Azure VMs over the past thirty minutes with the same time a week ago. Query with samples FROM AzureVirtualMachineScaleSetSample SELECT uniqueCount(vMName) FACET name SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO COMPARE WITH 1 WEEK AGO Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT uniqueCount(azure.vms.vmName) FACET azure.resourceName WHERE azure.resourceType='Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachineScaleSets' SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO COMPARE WITH 1 WEEK AGO Copy NGINX query example The average number of NGINX requests per second over time. Query with samples FROM NginxSample SELECT average(net.requestsPerSecond) TIMESERIES Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT average(nginx.server.net.requestsPerSecond) TIMESERIES Copy MySQL query example The maximum number of used MySQL connections. Query with samples FROM MysqlSample SELECT max(net.maxUsedConnections) Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT max(mysql.node.net.maxUsedConnections) Copy Known limitations Metric queries with * do not return Infrastructure sample data (for example, SELECT * FROM Metric). In order to select attributes starting with tags. a metric name has to be provided. For example, SELECT uniques(tags.environment) FROM Metric WHERE metricName='aws.lambda.function.duration' does not work without the WHERE clause. Results may not be complete if the selection criteria matches too many samples. For example, SELECT uniqueCount(entity.guid) FROM Metric maps to all Infrastructure samples, and may return incomplete results. Initially there is no support for the newly introduced metric wildcarding feature (for example, SELECT average(host.swap%Bytes) FROM Metric).",

Syntax This document is a reference for the functions and clauses used in a NRQL query. Other resources for understanding NRQL: Intro to NRQL: explains what NRQL is used for, what data you can query with it, and basic NRQL syntax Examine NRQL queries used to build New Relic charts Learn how to query the Metric data type Simulate SQL JOIN functions Use funnels to evaluate a series of related data Format NRQL for querying with the Event API Query components Every NRQL query will begin with a SELECT statement or a FROM clause. All other clauses are optional. The clause definitions below also contain example NRQL queries. Required clauses Required: SELECT statement SELECT attribute ... Copy SELECT function(attribute) ... Copy The SELECT specifies what portion of a data type you want to query by specifying an attribute or a function. It's followed by one or more arguments separated by commas. In each argument you can: Get the values of all available attributes by using * as a wildcard. For example: SELECT * from Transaction. Get values associated with a specified attribute or multiple attributes specified in a comma separated list. Get aggregated values from specified attributes by selecting an aggregator function. Label the results returned in each argument with the AS clause. You can also use SELECT with basic math functions. Avg response time since last week This query returns the average response time since last week. SELECT average(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy Required: FROM clause SELECT ... FROM data type ... Copy Use the FROM clause to specify the data type you wish to query. You can start your query with FROM or with SELECT. You can merge values for the same attributes across multiple data types in a comma separated list. Query one data type This query returns the count of all APM transactions over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction SINCE 3 days ago Copy Query multiple data types This query returns the count of all APM transactions and browser events over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, PageView SINCE 3 days ago Copy Optional clauses AS clause SELECT ... AS 'label' ... Copy Use the AS clause to label an attribute, aggregator, step in a funnel, or the result of a math function with a string delimited by single quotes. The label is used in the resulting chart. Query using math function and AS This query returns the number of page views per session: SELECT count(*)/uniqueCount(session) AS 'Pageviews per Session' FROM PageView Copy Query using funnel and AS This query returns a count of people who have visited both the main page and the careers page of a site over the past week: SELECT funnel(SESSION, WHERE name='Controller/about/main' AS 'Step 1', WHERE name = 'Controller/about/careers' AS 'Step 2') FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy COMPARE WITH clause SELECT ... (SINCE or UNTIL) (integer units) AGO COMPARE WITH (integer units) AGO ... Copy Use the COMPARE WITH clause to compare the values for two different time ranges. COMPARE WITH requires a SINCE or UNTIL statement. The time specified by COMPARE WITH is relative to the time specified by SINCE or UNTIL. For example, SINCE 1 day ago COMPARE WITH 1 day ago compares yesterday with the day before. The time range for theCOMPARE WITH value is always the same as that specified by SINCE or UNTIL. For example, SINCE 2 hours ago COMPARE WITH 4 hours ago might compare 3:00pm through 5:00pm against 11:00am through 1:00pm. COMPARE WITH can be formatted as either a line chart or a billboard: With TIMESERIES, COMPARE WITH creates a line chart with the comparison mapped over time. Without TIMESERIES, COMPARE WITH generates a billboard with the current value and the percent change from the COMPARE WITH value. Example: This query returns data as a line chart showing the 95th percentile for the past hour compared to the same range one week ago. First as a single value, then as a line chart. SELECT percentile(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago COMPARE WITH 1 week AGO SELECT percentile(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago COMPARE WITH 1 week AGO TIMESERIES AUTO Copy EXTRAPOLATE clause You can use this clause with these data types: Transaction TransactionError Custom events reported via APM agent APIs The purpose of EXTRAPOLATE is to mathematically compensate for the effects of APM agent sampling of event data so that query results more closely represent the total activity in your system. This clause will be useful when a APM agent reports so many events that it often passes its harvest cycle reporting limits. When that occurs, the agent begins to sample events. When EXTRAPOLATE is used in a NRQL query that supports its use, the ratio between the reported events and the total events is used to extrapolate a close approximation of the total unsampled data. When it is used in a NRQL query that doesn’t support its use or that hasn’t used sampled data, it has no effect. Important Note that EXTRAPOLATE is most useful for homogenous data (like throughput or error rate). It's not effective when attempting to extrapolate a count of distinct things (like uniqueCount() or uniques()). This clause works only with NRQL queries that use one of the following aggregator functions: apdex average count histogram sum percentage (if function it takes as an argument supports EXTRAPOLATE) rate (if function it takes as an argument supports EXTRAPOLATE) stddev Example of extrapolating throughput A query that will show the extrapolated throughput of a service named interestingApplication. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction WHERE appName='interestingApplication' SINCE 60 minutes ago EXTRAPOLATE Copy Example of extrapolating throughput as a time series A query that will show the extrapolated throughput of a service named interestingApplication by transaction name, displayed as a time series. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction WHERE appName='interestingApplication' SINCE 60 minutes ago FACET name TIMESERIES 1 minute EXTRAPOLATE Copy FACET clause SELECT ... FACET attribute ... Copy Use FACET to separate and group your results by attribute values. For example, you could FACET your PageView data by deviceType to figure out what percentage of your traffic comes from mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. Use the LIMIT clause to specify how many facets appear (default is 10). For more complex grouping, use FACET CASES. FACET clauses support up to five attributes, separated by commas. The facets are sorted in descending order by the first field you provide in the SELECT clause. If you are faceting on attributes with more than 2,000 unique values, a subset of facet values is selected and sorted according to the query type. When selecting min(), max(), or count(), FACET uses those functions to determine how facets are picked and sorted. When selecting any other function, FACET uses the frequency of the attribute you are faceting on to determine how facets are picked and sorted. Faceted query using count() This query shows cities with the highest pageview counts. This query uses the total number of pageviews per city to determine how facets are picked and ordered. SELECT count(*) FROM PageView FACET city Copy Faceted query using uniqueCount() This query shows the cities that access the highest number of unique URLs. This query uses the total number of times a particular city appears in the results to determine how facets are picked and ordered. SELECT uniqueCount(pageUrl) FROM PageView FACET city Copy Grouping results across time Advanced segmentation and cohort analysis allow you to facet on bucket functions to more effectively break out your data. Cohort analysis is a way to group results together based on timestamps. You can separate them into buckets that cover a specified range of dates and times. FACET ... AS clause Use FACET ... AS to name facets using the AS keyword in queries. This clause is helpful for adding clearer or simplified names for facets in your results. It can also be used to rename facets in nested aggregation queries. FACET ... AS queries will change the facet names in results (when they appear as headers in tables, for example), but not the actual facet names themselves. FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) FACET response.headers.contentType AS 'content type' Copy FACET CASES clause SELECT ... FACET CASES ( WHERE attribute operator value, WHERE attribute operator value, ... ) ... Copy Use FACET CASES to break out your data by more complex conditions than possible with FACET. Separate multiple conditions with a comma ,. For example, you could query your PageView data and FACET CASES into categories like less than 1 second, from 1 to 10 seconds, and greater than 10 seconds. You can combine multiple attributes within your cases, and label the cases with the AS selector. Data points will be added to at most one facet case, the first facet case that they match. You may also use a time function with your attribute, and you can use the OR operator to facet results that don't match any of your specified cases. Basic usage with WHERE SELECT count(*) FROM PageView FACET CASES (WHERE duration < 1, WHERE duration > 1 and duration < 10, WHERE duration > 10) Copy Group based on multiple attributes This example groups results into one bucket where the transaction name contains login, and another where the URL contains login and a custom attribute indicates that the user was a paid user: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid') Copy Label groups with AS This example uses the AS selector to give your results a human-readable name: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%' AS 'Total Logins', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid' AS 'Feature Visits from Paid Users') Copy Facet non-matching data with OR This example uses the OR operator to facet results that didn't match any of your cases: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid') OR name Copy FACET ... ORDER BY clause In NRQL, the default is for the first aggregation in the SELECT clause to guide the selection of facets in a query. FACET ... ORDER BY allows you to override this default behavior by adding an aggregate function with the ORDER BY modifier to specify how facets are selected. Specifically, the clause will override the priority by which facets are chosen to be in the final result before being limited by the LIMIT clause. This clause can be used in querying but not for alerts or streaming. This example shows how to use FACET ... ORDER BY to find the average durations of app transactions, showing the top 10 (default limit) highest durations by apps which have the highest response size. In this case, if FACET ... ORDER BY is not used, the query results will instead show the top 10 by highest durations, with response size being irrelevant to the app selection. FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) TIMESERIES FACET appName ORDER BY max(responseSize) Copy Tip Because the operations are performed before the LIMIT clause is applied, FACET ... ORDER BY does not impact the sort of the final query results, which will be particularly noticeable in the results for non-timeseries queries. Important The ORDER BY modifier in this case works differently than the ORDER BY clause. When parsing queries that follow the format FACET attribute1 ORDER BY attribute2, New Relic will read these as FACET ... ORDER BY queries, but only if ORDER BY appears immediately after FACET. Otherwise ORDER BY will be interpreted by New Relic as a clause. LIMIT clause SELECT ... LIMIT count ... Copy Use the LIMIT clause to control the maximum number of facet values returned by FACET queries or the maximum number of items returned by SELECT * queries. This clause takes a single integer value as an argument. If the LIMIT clause is not specified, or no value is provided, the limit defaults to 10 for FACET queries and 100 in the case of SELECT * queries. The maximum allowed value for the LIMIT clause is 2,000. Query using LIMIT This query shows the top 20 countries by session count and provides 95th percentile of response time for each country for Windows users only. SELECT uniqueCount(session), percentile(duration, 95) FROM PageView WHERE userAgentOS = 'Windows' FACET countryCode LIMIT 20 SINCE YESTERDAY Copy OFFSET clause SELECT ... LIMIT count OFFSET count ... Copy Use the OFFSET clause with LIMIT to control the portion of rows returned by SELECT * or SELECT column queries. Like the LIMIT clause, OFFSET takes a single integer value as an argument. OFFSET sets the number of rows to be skipped before the selected rows of your query are returned. This is constrained by LIMIT. OFFSET rows are skipped starting from the most recent record. For example, the query SELECT interestingValue FROM Minute_Report LIMIT 5 OFFSET 1 returns the last 5 values from Minute_Report except for the most recent one. ORDER BY clause The ORDER BY clause allows you to specify how you want to sort your query results in queries that select event attributes by row. This query orders transactions by duration. FROM Transaction SELECT appName, duration ORDER BY duration Copy The default sort order is ascending, but this can be changed by adding the ASC or DESC modifiers. SHOW EVENT TYPES clause SHOW EVENT TYPES... Copy SHOW EVENT TYPES will return a list of all the data types present in your account for a specific time range. It is used as the first clause in a query instead of SELECT. Important In this context, \"event types\" refers to the data types you can access with a NRQL query. Data types in the last day This query will return all the data types present over the past day: SHOW EVENT TYPES SINCE 1 day ago Copy SINCE clause SELECT ... SINCE [numerical units AGO | phrase] ... Copy The default value is 1 hour ago. Use the SINCE clause to define the beginning of a time range for the returned data. When using NRQL, you can set a UTC timestamp or relative time range. You can specify a timezone for the query but not for the results. NRQL results are based on your system time. SLIDE BY clause The SLIDE BY clause supports a feature known as sliding windows. With sliding windows,SLIDE BY data is gathered into \"windows\" of time that overlap with each other. These windows can help to smooth out line graphs with a lot of variation in cases where the rolling aggregate (such as a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. To use SLIDE BY, place it in a query after the TIMESERIES clause. For example, this query pulls data in 5-minute windows with a 1-minute SLIDE BY interval, meaning that each window lasts 5 minutes, but window 1 starts at 0 minutes, window 2 starts at 1 minute, window 3 starts at 2 minutes, and so on. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY 1 minute Copy To learn more about how and when you can use SLIDE BY, see Create smoother charts with sliding windows. Use SLIDE BY with MAX or AUTO interval You can use sliding windows in combination with MAX or AUTO. However, MAX or AUTO may not be placed between TIMESERIES and SLIDE BY. This query will automatically decide a SLIDE BY window interval. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY AUTO Copy This query will set the SLIDE BY window to the maximum interval granularity. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY MAX Copy Important The SLIDE BY value as determined by AUTO or MAX can produce a step interval greater than the window size, which can cause gaps and unexpected results. TIMESERIES clause SELECT ... TIMESERIES integer units ... Copy Use the TIMESERIES clause to return data as a time series broken out by a specified period of time. Since TIMESERIES is used to trigger certain charts, there is no default value. To indicate the time range, use integer units. For example: TIMESERIES 1 minute TIMESERIES 30 minutes TIMESERIES 1 hour TIMESERIES 30 seconds TIMESERIES can be combined with arguments such as MAX, AUTO, and SLIDE BY to further tailor query results, as shown in the examples below. Important For functions such as average( ) or percentile( ), a large aggregation window can have a significant smoothing effect on outliers. This is true whether or not the query makes use of sliding windows. Use a set interval The value provided indicates the units used to break out the graph. For example, to present a one-day graph showing 30 minute increments: SELECT ... SINCE 1 day AGO TIMESERIES 30 minutes Copy Use an automatically set interval TIMESERIES can also be set to AUTO, which will divide your graph into a reasonable number of divisions. For example, a daily chart will be divided into 30 minute intervals and a weekly chart will be divided into 6 hour intervals. This query returns data as a line chart showing the 50th and 90th percentile of client-side transaction time for one week with a data point every 6 hours. SELECT average(duration), percentile(duration, 50, 90) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week AGO TIMESERIES AUTO Copy Use MAX interval You can set TIMESERIES to MAX, which will automatically adjust your time window to the maximum number of intervals allowed for a given time period. This allows you to update your time windows without having to manually update your TIMESERIES buckets and ensures your time window is being split into the peak number of intervals allowed. The maximum number of TIMESERIES buckets that will be returned is 366. For example, the following query creates 4-minute intervals, which is the ceiling for a daily chart. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction since 1 day ago TIMESERIES MAX Copy UNTIL clause SELECT ... UNTIL integer units AGO ... Copy The default value is NOW. Only use UNTIL to specify an end point other than the default. Use the UNTIL clause to define the end of a time range across which to return data. Once a time range has been specified, the data will be preserved and can be reviewed after the time range has ended. See Use the time picker to adjust time settings for detailed information and examples. WHERE clause Use the WHERE clause to filter results. NRQL returns the results that fulfill the condition(s) you specify in the clause. SELECT function(attribute) ... WHERE attribute [operator 'value' | IN ('value' [, 'value]) | IS [NOT] NULL ] [AND|OR ...] ... Copy If you specify more than one condition, separate the conditions by the operators AND or OR. If you want to simulate a SQL join, use custom attributes in a WHERE or FACET clause. Operators that the WHERE clause accepts Description =, !=, <, <=, >, >= NRQL accepts standard comparison operators. Example: state = 'WA' AND Used to define an intersection of two conditions. OR Used to define a union of two conditions. IS NULL Determines if an attribute has a null value. IS NOT NULL Determines if an attribute does not have a null value. IN Determines if the string value of an attribute is in a specified set. Using this method yields better performance than stringing together multiple WHERE clauses. Example: animalType IN ('cat', 'dog', 'fish') NOT IN Determines if the string value of an attribute is not in a specified set. Using this method yields better performance than stringing together multiple WHERE clauses. Values must be in parentheses, separated by commas. For example: SELECT * FROM PageView WHERE countryCode NOT IN ('CA', 'WA') Copy LIKE Determines if an attribute contains a specified sub-string. The string argument for the LIKE operator accepts the percent sign (%) as a wildcard anywhere in the string. If the substring does not begin or end the string you are matching against, the wildcard must begin or end the string. Examples: userAgentName LIKE 'IE%' IE IE Mobile userAgentName LIKE 'o%a%' Opera Opera Mini userAgentName LIKE 'o%a' Opera userAgentName LIKE '%o%a%' Opera Opera Mini Mozilla Gecko NOT LIKE Determines if an attribute does not contain a specified sub-string. RLIKE Determines if an attribute contains a specified Regex sub-string. Uses RE2 syntax. Examples: appName RLIKE r'z.*|q.*'' hostname RLIKE r'ip-10-351-[0-2]?[0-9]-.*' z-app q-app ip-10-351-19-237 ip-10-351-2-41 ip-10-351-24-238 ip-10-351-14-15 Important Regex defaults to full-string matching, therefore ^ and $ are implicit and you do not need to add them. NOT RLIKE Determines if an attribute does not contain a specified Regex sub-string. Uses RE2 syntax. Example query with three conditions This query returns the browser response time for pages with checkout in the URL for Safari users in the United States and Canada over the past 24 hours. SELECT histogram(duration, 50, 20) FROM PageView WHERE countryCode IN ('CA', 'US') AND userAgentName='Safari' AND pageUrl LIKE '%checkout%' SINCE 1 day ago Copy WITH METRIC_FORMAT clause For information on querying metric data, see Query metrics. WITH TIMEZONE clause SELECT ... WITH TIMEZONE (selected zone) ... Copy By default, query results are displayed in the timezone of the browser you're using. Use the WITH TIMEZONE clause to select a time zone for a date or time in the query that hasn't already had a time zone specified for it. For example, the query clause SINCE Monday UNTIL Tuesday WITH TIMEZONE 'America/New_York' will return data recorded from Monday at midnight, Eastern Standard Time, until midnight Tuesday, Eastern Standard Time.

Query metric data Metric data is more complex than other types of data. There are specific tips for querying it well. We have two types of metric data, each with their own query guidelines: Query dimensional metrics, which are reported by our Metric API and by some of our tools that use that API, like our Telemetry SDKs and our open-source telemetry integrations (OpenTelemetry, Kamon, Micrometer, more). Query metric timeslice data, which is our original metric data type reported by our APM, mobile monitoring, and browser monitoring. For more on understanding these data types, see Metric data types. Functions In this section we explain NRQL functions, both aggregator functions and non-aggregator functions. Aggregator functions You can use aggregator functions to filter and aggregate data. Some tips for using these: See New Relic University tutorials for Filter queries, Apdex queries, and Percentile queries. Or, go to the full online course Writing NRQL queries. If you're using an aggregator function multiple times in the same query (e.g., SELECT median(one_metric</var>), median(another_metric)), it can cause problems in displaying results. To solve this, use the AS function. For example: SELECT median(one_metric) as 'med-a', median(another_metric) as 'med-b' Data type \"coercion\" is not supported. Read about available type conversion functions. For how to display results over time, see Group results over time. Examples: SELECT histogram(duration, 10, 20) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy aggregationendtime() Use the aggregationendtime() function to return the time of the relevant aggregation. More specifically, for a given aggregate, the aggregationendtime() function provides the timestamp of the end of the time period of that aggregation. For example, in a timeseries query, for a data point that encompasses an hour’s worth of data, the function would return the timestamp of the end of that hour period. apdex(attribute, t: ) Use the apdex function to return an Apdex score for a single transaction or for all your transactions. The attribute can be any attribute based on response time, such as duration or backendDuration. The t: argument defines an Apdex T threshold in seconds. The Apdex score returned by the apdex( ) function is based only on execution time. It does not account for APM errors. If a transaction includes an error but completes in Apdex T or less, that transaction will be rated satisfying by the apdex ( ) function. Get Apdex for specific customers If you have defined custom attributes, you can filter based on those attributes. For example, you could monitor the Apdex for a particularly important customer: SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.4) FROM Transaction WHERE customerName='ReallyImportantCustomer' SINCE 1 day ago Copy Get Apdex for specific transaction Use the name attribute to return a score for a specific transaction, or return an overall Apdex by omitting name. This query returns an Apdex score for the Controller/notes/index transaction over the last hour: The apdex function returns an Apdex score that measures user satisfaction with your site. Arguments are a response time attribute and an Apdex T threshold in seconds. SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.5) from Transaction WHERE name='Controller/notes/index' SINCE 1 hour ago Copy Get overall Apdex for your app This example query returns an overall Apdex for the application over the last three weeks: SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.08) FROM Transaction SINCE 3 week ago Copy average(attribute) Use the average( ) function to return the average value for an attribute. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. buckets(attribute, ceiling [,number of buckets]) Use the buckets() function to aggregate data split up by a FACET clause into buckets based on ranges. You can bucket by any attribute that is stored as a numerical value in the New Relic database. It takes three arguments: Attribute name Maximum value of the sample range. Any outliers will appear in the final bucket. Total number of buckets For more information and examples, see Split your data into buckets. bucketPercentile(attribute) The bucketPercentile( ) function is the NRQL equivalent of the histogram_quantile function in Prometheus. It is intended to be used with dimensional metric data. Instead of the quantile, New Relic returns the percentile, which is the quantile * 100. Use the bucketPercentile( ) function to calculate the quantile from the histogram data in a Prometheus format. It takes the bucket name as an argument and reports percentiles along the bucket's boundaries: SELECT bucketPercentile(duration_bucket) FROM Metric SINCE 1 day ago Copy Optionally, you can add percentile specifications as an argument: SELECT bucketPercentile(duration_bucket, 50, 75, 90) FROM Metric SINCE 1 day ago Copy Because multiple metrics are used to make up Prometheus histogram data, you must query for specific Prometheus metrics in terms of the associated <basename>. For example, to compute percentiles from a Prometheus histogram, with the <basename> prometheus_http_request_duration_seconds using NRQL, use bucketPercentile(prometheus_http_request_duration_seconds_bucket, 50). Note how _ bucket is added to the end of the <basename> as a suffix. See the Prometheus.io documentation for more information. cardinality(attribute) Use the cardinality( ) function to obtain the number of combinations of all the dimensions (attributes) on a metric. It takes three arguments, all optional: Metric name: if present, cardinality( ) only computes the metric specified. Include: if present, the include list restricts the cardinality computation to those attributes. Exclude: if present, the exclude list causes those attributes to be ignored in the cardinality computation. SELECT cardinality(metric_name, include:{attribute_list}, exclude:{attribute_list}) Copy count(*) Use the count( ) function to return a count of available records. It takes a single argument; either *, an attribute, or a constant value. Currently, it follows typical SQL behavior and counts all records that have values for its argument. Since count(*) does not name a specific attribute, the results will be formatted in the default \"humanize\" format. derivative(attribute [,time interval]) derivative() finds the rate of change for a given dataset. The rate of change is calculated using a linear least-squares regression to approximate the derivative. Since this calculation requires comparing more than one datapoint, if only one datapoint is included in the evaluation range, the calculation is indeterminate and won't work, resulting in a null value. The time interval is the period for which the rate of change is calculated. For example, derivative(attributeName, 1 minute) will return the rate of change per minute. dimensions(include: {attributes}, exclude: {attributes}) Use the dimensions( ) function to return all the dimensional values on a data type. You can explicitly include or exclude specific attributes using the optional arguments: Include: if present, the include list limits dimensions( ) to those attributes. Exclude: if present, the dimensions( ) calculation ignores those attributes. FROM Metric SELECT count(node_filesystem_size) TIMESERIES FACET dimensions() Copy When used with a FACET clause, dimensions( ) produces a unique timeseries for all facets available on the event type, similar to how Prometheus behaves with non-aggregated queries. latestrate(attribute, time interval) Use the latestrate( ) function to return the rate of change of a value based on the last 2 data points. It takes the attribute in question as the first argument and the unit of time for the resulting rate as the second argument. The function returns a result in units of change in attribute/time interval. This function can be useful to provide the most recent rate of change for an attribute in order to see leading-edge trends. Get the most recent rate of change of PageView Duration This query returns the rate of change of duration based on the last 2 data points. It will be returned in units of duration/second because of the 1 SECOND argument. SELECT latestrate(duration, 1 SECOND) FROM PageView Copy max(attribute) Use the max( ) function to return the maximum recorded value of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. median(attribute) Use the median( ) function to return an attribute's median, or 50th percentile. For more information about percentile queries, see percentile(). Tip The median( ) query is only available when using the query builder. Median query This query will generate a line chart for the median value. SELECT median(duration) FROM PageView TIMESERIES AUTO Copy min(attribute) Use the min( ) function to return the minimum recorded value of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. minuteOf(attribute) Use the minuteOf() function to extract only the minute portion (i.e. 0-59) of an attribute holding a valid timestamp value. mod(attribute, divisor) Use the mod( ) function to return the floor modulus after dividing the value of the provided numeric attribute (the first argument, or dividend) by a numeric value (the second argument, or divisor). This modulo operation can be used within a WHERE clause condition to filter to an arbitrary subset of results or within a FACET clause as a way to subdivide the result set. mod() within a WHERE clause condition FROM Transaction SELECT * WHERE mod(port, 2) = 1 Copy mod() within a FACET clause FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT uniques(hostId, 10000) SINCE 1 day AGO FACET mod(hostId, 10) Copy percentage(function(attribute), WHERE condition) Use the percentage( ) function to return the percentage of a target data set that matches some condition. The first argument requires an aggregator function against the desired attribute. Use exactly two arguments (arguments after the first two will be ignored). If the attribute is not numeric, this function returns a value of 100%. percentile(attribute [, percentile [, ...]]) Use the percentile( ) function to return an attribute's approximate value at a given percentile. It requires an attribute and can take any number of arguments representing percentile points. The percentile() function enables percentiles to displays with up to three digits after the decimal point, providing greater precision. Percentile thresholds may be specified as decimal values, but be aware that for most data sets, percentiles closer than 0.1 from each other will not be resolved. Percentile display examples Use TIMESERIES to generate a line chart with percentiles mapped over time. Omit TIMESERIES to generate a billboard and attribute sheet showing aggregate values for the percentiles. If no percentiles are listed, the default is the 95th percentile. To return only the 50th percentile value, the median, you can also use median(). Basic percentile query This query will generate a line chart with lines for the 5th, 50th, and 95th percentile. SELECT percentile(duration, 5, 50, 95) FROM PageView TIMESERIES AUTO Copy predictLinear(attribute, [,time interval]) predictLinear() is an extension of the derivative() function. It uses a similar method of least-squares linear regression to predict the future values for a dataset. The time interval is how far the query will look into the future. For example, predictLinear(attributeName, 1 hour) is a linear prediction 1 hour into the future of the query time window. Generally, predictLinear() is helpful for continuously growing values like disk space, or predictions on large trends. Since predictLinear() is a linear regression, familiarity with the dataset being queried helps to ensure accurate long-term predictions. Any dataset which grows exponentially, logarithmically, or by other nonlinear means will likely only be successful in very short-term predictions. New Relic recommends against using predictLinear in TIMESERIES queries. This is because each bucket will be making an individual prediction based on its relative timeframe within the query, meaning that such queries will not show predictions from the end of the timeseries forward. rate(function(attribute) [,time interval]) Use the rate( ) function to visualize the frequency or rate of a given query per time interval. For example, you might want to know the number of pageviews per minute over an hour-long period or the count of unique sessions on your site per hour over a day-long period. Use TIMESERIES to generate a line chart with rates mapped over time. Omit TIMESERIES to generate a billboard showing a single rate value averaged over time. Basic rate query This query will generate a line chart showing the rate of throughput for APM transactions per 10 minutes over the past 6 hours. SELECT rate(count(*), 10 minute) FROM Transaction SINCE 6 hours ago TIMESERIES Copy round(attribute) Use the round( ) function to return the rounded value of an attribute. Optionally round( ) can take a second argument, to_nearest, to round the first argument to the closest multiple of the second one. to_nearest can be fractional. SELECT round(n [, to_nearest]) Copy stddev(attribute) Use the stddev( ) function to return one standard deviation for a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. stdvar(attribute) Use the stdvar( ) function to return the standard variance for a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. sum(attribute) Use the sum( ) function to return the sum recorded values of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. uniqueCount(attribute) Use the uniqueCount( ) function to return the number of unique values recorded for an attribute over the time range specified. Tip To optimize query performance, this function returns approximate results for queries that inspect more than 256 unique values. uniques(attribute [,limit]) Use the uniques( ) function to return a list of unique values recorded for an attribute over the time range specified. When used along with the facet clause, a list of unique attribute values will be returned per each facet value. The limit parameter is optional. When it is not provided, the default limit of 1,000 unique attribute values per facet is applied. You may specify a different limit value, up to a maximum of 10,000. The uniques( ) function will return the first set of unique attribute values discovered, until the limit is reached. Therefore, if you have 5,000 unique attribute values in your data set, and the limit is set to 1,000, the operator will return the first 1,000 unique values that it discovers, regardless of their frequency. The maximum number of values that can be returned in a query result is the product of the uniques( ) limit times the facet limit. In the following query, the theoretical maximum number of values that can be returned is 5 million (5,000 x 1,000). Depending on the data set being queried, and the complexity of the query, memory protection limits may prevent a very large query from being executed. From Transaction SELECT uniques(host,5000) FACET appName LIMIT 1000 Copy Using tuple If you'd like to know the unique combinations of a handful of attributes, you can structure a query in the format SELECT uniques(tuple(x, y, ... z)) ...` to get all the unique tuples of values, to maintain their relationship. In the following query, tuple is used on index and cellName together to find uniques where those two values occur in combination. FROM NodeStatus SELECT uniques(tuple(index, cellName), 5) Copy capture(attribute, regular expression) Use the capture() to extract values from an attribute using a regular expression. Uses RE2 syntax. It takes two arguments: Attribute name Regular expression with capture syntax. Regex expressions in NRQL use Python-like syntax, r'...'. When capturing, use the RE2 named-capture syntax ...(?P<name> pattern )... to capture the contained pattern, given the specified name. Currently, only 1 capture group is supported. Please see the examples below. capture() within a SELECT clause condition The following will select the domain name of the website, removing https:// and any paths following the .com SELECT capture(pageUrl, r'https://(?P<baseUrl>.*.com)/.+') FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago Copy The following will capture only the first word of the error message. SELECT capture(errorMessage, r'(?P<firstWord>\\S+)\\s.+') FROM Transaction SINCE 1 hour ago where errorMessage is not null Copy capture() within a FACET clause condition The following will facet by the captured HTTP method. SELECT count(*) FROM Log WHERE message like '%HTTP%' FACET capture(message, r'.* \"(?P<httpMethod>[A-Z]+) .*') Copy capture() within a WHERE clause condition The following will filter the results based on Log events with message attribute that matches the regular expression where the captured job name is ExampleJob. SELECT message FROM Log WHERE capture(message, r'.*Job Failed: (?P<jobName>[A-Za-z]+),.*') = 'ExampleJob' SINCE 10 minutes ago Copy capture() with a numeric cast The following will capture sum of CPU Time from log lines. You must explicitly cast to numeric to do mathematical operations. SELECT sum(numeric(capture(message, r'.*CpuTime:\\s(?P<cpuTime>\\d+)'))) FROM Log WHERE message like '%CpuTime:%' SINCE 1 hour ago Copy Non-aggregator functions Use non-aggregator functions for non-numerical data in NRQL queries. earliest(attribute) Use the earliest( ) function to return the earliest value for an attribute over the specified time range. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If used in conjunction with a FACET it will return the most recent value for an attribute for each of the resulting facets. Get earliest country per user agent from PageView This query returns the earliest country code per each user agent from the PageView event. SELECT earliest(countryCode) FROM PageView FACET userAgentName Copy eventType() ...WHERE eventType() = 'EventNameHere'... ...FACET eventType()... Copy Use the eventType() function in a FACET clause to break out results by the selected data type or in a WHERE clause to filter results to a specific data type. This is particularly useful for targeting specific data types with the filter() and percentage() functions. Important In this context, \"event type\" refers to the types of data you can access with a NRQL query. Use eventType() in filter() function This query returns the percentage of total TransactionError results out of the total Transaction results. You can use the eventType() function to target specific types of data with the filter() function. SELECT 100 * filter(count(*), where eventType() = 'TransactionError') / filter(count(*), where eventType() = 'Transaction') FROM Transaction, TransactionError WHERE appName = 'App.Prod' TIMESERIES 2 Minutes SINCE 6 hours ago Copy Use eventType() with FACET This query displays a count of how many records each data type (Transaction and TransactionError) returns. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, TransactionError FACET eventType() TIMESERIES Copy filter(function(attribute), WHERE condition) Use the filter() function to limit the results for one of the aggregator functions in your SELECT statement. You can use filter() in conjunction with FACET or TIMESERIES. Filter is only useful when selecting multiple different aggregations such as SELECT filter(sum(x), WHERE attribute='a') AS 'A', filter(sum(x), WHERE attribute='b') AS 'B' .... Otherwise, it's better to just use the standard WHERE clause. Analyze purchases that used offer codes You could use filter() to compare the items bought in a set of transactions for those using an offer code versus those who aren't: Use the filter( ) function to limit the results for one of the aggregator functions in your SELECT statement. funnel(attribute, steps) Use the funnel() function to generate a funnel chart. It takes an attribute as its first argument. You then specify steps as WHERE clauses (with optional AS clauses for labels) separated by commas. For details and examples, see the funnels documentation. getField(attribute, field) Use the getField() function to extract a field from compound data types, such as metric data. It takes the following arguments: Metric type Supported fields summary count, total, max, min, type gauge count, total, max, min, latest, type distribution count, total, max, min, type counter count, type timeslice count, total, totalExclusive, min, and max Examples: SELECT max(getField(mySummary, count)) from Metric Copy SELECT sum(mySummary) from Metric where getField(mySummary, count) > 10 Copy histogram(attribute, ceiling [,number of buckets]) Use the histogram( ) function to generate histograms. It takes three arguments: Attribute name Maximum value of the sample range Total number of buckets (between 1 and 500, inclusive) Histogram of response times from PageView events This query results in a histogram of response times ranging up to 10 seconds over 20 buckets. SELECT histogram(duration, 10, 20) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy Prometheus histogram buckets histogram( ) accepts Prometheus histogram buckets: SELECT histogram(duration_bucket, 10, 20) FROM Metric SINCE 1 week ago Copy New Relic distribution metric histogram( ) accepts Distribution metric as an input: SELECT histogram(myDistributionMetric, 10, 20) FROM Metric SINCE 1 week ago Copy Histogram with a FACET clause Use histogram( ) with a FACET clause to generate a heatmap chart: SELECT histogram(duration) FROM PageView FACET appName SINCE 1 week ago Copy keyset() Using keyset() will allow you to see all of the attributes for a given data type over a given time range. It takes no arguments. It returns a JSON structure containing groups of string-typed keys, numeric-typed keys, boolean-typed keys, and all keys. See all attributes for a data type This query returns the attributes found for PageView events from the last day: SELECT keyset() FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago Copy latest(attribute) Use the latest( ) function to return the most recent value for an attribute over a specified time range. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If used in conjunction with a FACET it will return the most recent value for an attribute for each of the resulting facets. Get most recent country per user agent from PageView This query returns the most recent country code per each user agent from the PageView event. SELECT latest(countryCode) FROM PageView FACET userAgentName Copy Type conversion NRQL does not support \"coercion.\" This means that a float stored as a string is treated as a string and cannot be operated on by functions expecting float values. You can convert a string with a numeric value or a boolean with a string value to their numeric and boolean types with these functions: Use the numeric() function to convert a number with a string format to a numeric function. The function can be built into a query that uses math functions on query results or NRQL aggregator functions, such as average(). Use the boolean() function to convert a string value of \"true\" or \"false\" to the corresponding boolean value.",

      "body": "One way to query your New Relic data is with the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). This resource explains what NRQL is, when and how you can use it, and basic syntax rules. For more detailed information on querying, including a listing of clauses and functions and example queries, see NRQL syntax, clauses, and functions. What is NRQL? NRQL is New Relic's SQL-like query language. You can use NRQL to retrieve detailed New Relic data and get insight into your applications, hosts, and business-important activity. Reasons to use NRQL include: To answer a question for the purpose of troubleshooting or business analysis To create a new chart To make API queries of New Relic data (for example, using our NerdGraph API) NRQL is used behind the scenes to generate some New Relic charts: Some New Relic charts are built using NRQL. One way to start using NRQL is to view a chart's query and then edit it to make your own custom chart. Where can you use NRQL? You can use NRQL in these places: New Relic One query builder NerdGraph: our GraphQL-format API, which includes options for making NRQL queries one.newrelic.com > Query your data: You can run a NRQL query in New Relic One. This NRQL query shows a count of distributed tracing spans faceted by their entity names. NRQL is one of several ways to query New Relic data. For more on all query options, see Query your data. What data can you query with NRQL? NRQL allows you to query these New Relic data types: Event data from all New Relic products, including: APM events, like Transaction Browser monitoring events, like PageView Mobile monitoring events, like Mobile Infrastructure events, like ProcessSample Synthetics events, like SyntheticCheck Custom events, like those reported by the Event API Metric timeslice data (metrics reported by APM, browser, and mobile) The Metric data type (metrics reported by the Metric API and data sources that use that API) The Span data type (distributed tracing data) The Log data type (data from New Relic Logs) Tip Some data, like relationships between monitored entities, is not available via NRQL but is available using our NerdGraph API. Start using NRQL One way to start using NRQL and to understand what data you have available is to go to a NRQL interface (for example, the New Relic One query builder), type FROM, and press space. The interface will suggest available types of data: To see the attributes available for a specific data type, type FROM DATA_TYPE SELECT and press space. The interface will suggest available attributes. For example: To see the complete JSON associated with a data type, including all of its attributes, use the keyset() attribute. For example: FROM Transaction SELECT keyset() Copy NRQL is used behind the scenes to build some New Relic charts and dashboards. One way to learn NRQL is to find one of these NRQL-generated charts and start playing with the NRQL to create new, customized queries and charts: Charts built with NRQL will have View query as an option. You can then edit and customize that query to see how your changes affect the resulting visualization. Important To explore your data without having to use NRQL, use the data explorer. Learn more about querying data in New Relic. NRQL query examples Here's an example NRQL query of Transaction data, which is reported by APM. FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) FACET appName TIMESERIES auto Copy This would generate a chart that looks like: Here are some more query examples: Basic NRQL query of browser data Here's a NRQL query of PageView data from browser monitoring. SELECT uniqueCount(user) FROM PageView WHERE userAgentOS = 'Mac' FACET countryCode SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 20 Copy Attribute name with a space in it If a custom attribute name has a space in it, use backticks around the attribute name: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET `Logged-in user` Copy Querying multiple data sources To return data from two data sources, separate their data types with a comma. For example, this query returns a count of all APM transactions and browser events over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, PageView SINCE 3 days ago Copy Query returning multiple columns To return multiple columns from a dataset, separate the aggregator arguments with a comma: SELECT function(attribute), function(attribute) ... FROM ... Copy This query returns the minimum, average, and maximum duration for browser monitoring PageView events over the last week: SELECT min(duration), max(duration), average(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy See more NRQL query examples. NRQL syntax The syntax of a NRQL query is similar to standard SQL queries. Here is a breakdown of the structure of a NRQL query: SELECT function(attribute) [AS 'label'][, ...] FROM data type [WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...]][AS 'label'][, ...] [FACET attribute | function(attribute)] [LIMIT number] [SINCE time] [UNTIL time] [WITH TIMEZONE timezone] [COMPARE WITH time] [TIMESERIES time] Copy Basic rules include: NRQL condition Details Required values The SELECT statement and FROM clause are required. All other clauses are optional. You can start your query with either SELECT or FROM. Query string size The query string must be less than 4 KB. Case sensitivity The data type names and attribute names are case sensitive. NRQL clauses and functions are not case sensitive. Syntax for strings NRQL uses single quotes to designate strings. For example: ... where traceId = '030a573f0df02c57' Copy Attribute names with spaces Use backticks `` to quote a custom attribute name that has a space in it. For example: ... FACET `Logged-in user` Copy Data type coercion Insights does not support data type \"coercion.\" For more information, see Data type conversion. Use of math functions Basic and advanced math functions are supported in the SELECT statement. JOIN functions NRQL does not have the equivalent of the SQL JOIN function, but you can simulate a JOIN with custom attributes. Read more about NRQL syntax and functions.",

      "body": "BETA FEATURE This feature is currently in beta. Dimensional metrics are an industry standard for storing and querying metric data. All infrastructure metrics are stored as event data in New Relic, but you can also query them through dimensional metrics. In this page you can learn: The benefits of dimensional metrics. A few examples on how and where to use them. Known issues. Why it matters At New Relic we report metrics in several ways, including dimensional metrics, which are used by our metric API, Telemetry SDK, some open-source integrations, and our infrastructure services. This type of metric enables you to: Enjoy an improved query experience for Infrastructure data. Discover all your metrics in one place. Tap into more metric sources, such as Prometheus. For example, the query to get the maximum duration of your Lambda functions is simplified: Query with samples FROM ServerlessSample SELECT max(provider.duration.Maximum) WHERE provider = 'LambdaFunction' Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT max(aws.lambda.function.duration) Copy Get started No agent or integration updates are required to use these metrics. NRQL alerting based on dimensional metrics is also supported, except for data coming from cloud integrations (that is metrics from AWS polling integrations, GCP, and Azure). AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams metrics are ingested as dimensional metrics and NRQL alerts are recommended. Where and how to query dimensional metrics All current NRQL query features are supported. Queries can use WHERE, FACET, and time selection functions such as SINCE, UNTIL, and COMPARE WITH. The query builder in New Relic One supports metrics in both simple and advanced (NRQL) mode. Naming conventions for metrics and attributes All metric names and attributes for dimensional metrics follow the same naming convention in order to make them easy to find and use. Metric and attribute names are namespaced with dots: for example, the host. prefix is used for host metrics, the k8s. prefix is used for Kubernetes metrics, and aws. is used for AWS metrics. The graphic below shows how a ProcessSample that contains three metrics (cpuPercent, ioTotalReadBytes, and ioTotalWriteBytes) is split into three separate metrics. Note the updated naming of the metrics and the attributes. Dimensional metrics naming convention Examples Here are some examples of NQRL queries with and without dimensional metrics: AWS EBS query example Get the total write time by EBS Volume. Query with samples FROM BlockDeviceSample SELECT sum('provider.volumeTotalWriteTime.Sum') WHERE provider = 'EbsVolume' FACET entityName Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT sum(aws.ebs.volume.TotalWriteTime) FACET entity.name Copy Azure Service bus query example Maximum number of messages in an Azure Service Bus topic by resource group. Query with samples FROM AzureServiceBusTopicSample SELECT max(activeMessages.Maximum) FACET resourceGroupName Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT max(azure.servicebus.topic.activeMessages) FACET azure.resourceGroup Copy Azure functions query example Number of function executions Azure Functions over the past 6 hours by region over time. Query with samples FROM AzureFunctionsAppSample SELECT sum(functionExecutionCount.Total) FACET regionName TIMESERIES SINCE 6 hours ago Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT sum(azure.functions.app.functionExecutionCount) FACET azure.region TIMESERIES SINCE 6 hours ago Copy Azure VMs query example Compare the number of Azure VMs over the past thirty minutes with the same time a week ago. Query with samples FROM AzureVirtualMachineScaleSetSample SELECT uniqueCount(vMName) FACET name SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO COMPARE WITH 1 WEEK AGO Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT uniqueCount(azure.vms.vmName) FACET azure.resourceName WHERE azure.resourceType='Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachineScaleSets' SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO COMPARE WITH 1 WEEK AGO Copy NGINX query example The average number of NGINX requests per second over time. Query with samples FROM NginxSample SELECT average(net.requestsPerSecond) TIMESERIES Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT average(nginx.server.net.requestsPerSecond) TIMESERIES Copy MySQL query example The maximum number of used MySQL connections. Query with samples FROM MysqlSample SELECT max(net.maxUsedConnections) Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT max(mysql.node.net.maxUsedConnections) Copy Known limitations Metric queries with * do not return Infrastructure sample data (for example, SELECT * FROM Metric). In order to select attributes starting with tags. a metric name has to be provided. For example, SELECT uniques(tags.environment) FROM Metric WHERE metricName='aws.lambda.function.duration' does not work without the WHERE clause. Results may not be complete if the selection criteria matches too many samples. For example, SELECT uniqueCount(entity.guid) FROM Metric maps to all Infrastructure samples, and may return incomplete results. Initially there is no support for the newly introduced metric wildcarding feature (for example, SELECT average(host.swap%Bytes) FROM Metric).",

All other clauses are optional. The clause definitions below also contain example NRQL queries. Required clauses Required: SELECT statement SELECT attribute ... Copy SELECT function(attribute) ... Copy The SELECT specifies what portion of a data type you want to query by specifying an attribute or a function. It's followed by one or more arguments separated by commas. In each argument you can: Get the values of all available attributes by using * as a wildcard. For example: SELECT * from Transaction. Get values associated with a specified attribute or multiple attributes specified in a comma separated list. Get aggregated values from specified attributes by selecting an aggregator function. Label the results returned in each argument with the AS clause. You can also use SELECT with basic math functions. Avg response time since last week This query returns the average response time since last week. SELECT average(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy Required: FROM clause SELECT ... FROM data type ... Copy Use the FROM clause to specify the data type you wish to query. You can start your query with FROM or with SELECT. You can merge values for the same attributes across multiple data types in a comma separated list. Query one data type This query returns the count of all APM transactions over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction SINCE 3 days ago Copy Query multiple data types This query returns the count of all APM transactions and browser events over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, PageView SINCE 3 days ago Copy Optional clauses AS clause SELECT ... AS 'label' ... Copy Use the AS clause to label an attribute, aggregator, step in a funnel, or the result of a math function with a string delimited by single quotes. The label is used in the resulting chart. Query using math function and AS This query returns the number of page views per session: SELECT count(*)/uniqueCount(session) AS 'Pageviews per Session' FROM PageView Copy Query using funnel and AS This query returns a count of people who have visited both the main page and the careers page of a site over the past week: SELECT funnel(SESSION, WHERE name='Controller/about/main' AS 'Step 1', WHERE name = 'Controller/about/careers' AS 'Step 2') FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy COMPARE WITH clause SELECT ... (SINCE or UNTIL) (integer units) AGO COMPARE WITH (integer units) AGO ... Copy Use the COMPARE WITH clause to compare the values for two different time ranges. COMPARE WITH requires a SINCE or UNTIL statement. The time specified by COMPARE WITH is relative to the time specified by SINCE or UNTIL. For example, SINCE 1 day ago COMPARE WITH 1 day ago compares yesterday with the day before. The time range for theCOMPARE WITH value is always the same as that specified by SINCE or UNTIL. For example, SINCE 2 hours ago COMPARE WITH 4 hours ago might compare 3:00pm through 5:00pm against 11:00am through 1:00pm. COMPARE WITH can be formatted as either a line chart or a billboard: With TIMESERIES, COMPARE WITH creates a line chart with the comparison mapped over time. Without TIMESERIES, COMPARE WITH generates a billboard with the current value and the percent change from the COMPARE WITH value. Example: This query returns data as a line chart showing the 95th percentile for the past hour compared to the same range one week ago. First as a single value, then as a line chart. SELECT percentile(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago COMPARE WITH 1 week AGO SELECT percentile(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago COMPARE WITH 1 week AGO TIMESERIES AUTO Copy EXTRAPOLATE clause You can use this clause with these data types: Transaction TransactionError Custom events reported via APM agent APIs The purpose of EXTRAPOLATE is to mathematically compensate for the effects of APM agent sampling of event data so that query results more closely represent the total activity in your system. This clause will be useful when a APM agent reports so many events that it often passes its harvest cycle reporting limits. When that occurs, the agent begins to sample events. When EXTRAPOLATE is used in a NRQL query that supports its use, the ratio between the reported events and the total events is used to extrapolate a close approximation of the total unsampled data. When it is used in a NRQL query that doesn’t support its use or that hasn’t used sampled data, it has no effect. Important Note that EXTRAPOLATE is most useful for homogenous data (like throughput or error rate). It's not effective when attempting to extrapolate a count of distinct things (like uniqueCount() or uniques()). This clause works only with NRQL queries that use one of the following aggregator functions: apdex average count histogram sum percentage (if function it takes as an argument supports EXTRAPOLATE) rate (if function it takes as an argument supports EXTRAPOLATE) stddev Example of extrapolating throughput A query that will show the extrapolated throughput of a service named interestingApplication. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction WHERE appName='interestingApplication' SINCE 60 minutes ago EXTRAPOLATE Copy Example of extrapolating throughput as a time series A query that will show the extrapolated throughput of a service named interestingApplication by transaction name, displayed as a time series. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction WHERE appName='interestingApplication' SINCE 60 minutes ago FACET name TIMESERIES 1 minute EXTRAPOLATE Copy FACET clause SELECT ... FACET attribute ... Copy Use FACET to separate and group your results by attribute values. For example, you could FACET your PageView data by deviceType to figure out what percentage of your traffic comes from mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. Use the LIMIT clause to specify how many facets appear (default is 10). For more complex grouping, use FACET CASES. FACET clauses support up to five attributes, separated by commas. The facets are sorted in descending order by the first field you provide in the SELECT clause. If you are faceting on attributes with more than 2,000 unique values, a subset of facet values is selected and sorted according to the query type. When selecting min(), max(), or count(), FACET uses those functions to determine how facets are picked and sorted. When selecting any other function, FACET uses the frequency of the attribute you are faceting on to determine how facets are picked and sorted. Faceted query using count() This query shows cities with the highest pageview counts. This query uses the total number of pageviews per city to determine how facets are picked and ordered. SELECT count(*) FROM PageView FACET city Copy Faceted query using uniqueCount() This query shows the cities that access the highest number of unique URLs. This query uses the total number of times a particular city appears in the results to determine how facets are picked and ordered. SELECT uniqueCount(pageUrl) FROM PageView FACET city Copy Grouping results across time Advanced segmentation and cohort analysis allow you to facet on bucket functions to more effectively break out your data. Cohort analysis is a way to group results together based on timestamps. You can separate them into buckets that cover a specified range of dates and times. FACET ... AS clause Use FACET ... AS to name facets using the AS keyword in queries. This clause is helpful for adding clearer or simplified names for facets in your results. It can also be used to rename facets in nested aggregation queries. FACET ... AS queries will change the facet names in results (when they appear as headers in tables, for example), but not the actual facet names themselves. FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) FACET response.headers.contentType AS 'content type' Copy FACET CASES clause SELECT ... FACET CASES ( WHERE attribute operator value, WHERE attribute operator value, ... ) ... Copy Use FACET CASES to break out your data by more complex conditions than possible with FACET. Separate multiple conditions with a comma ,. For example, you could query your PageView data and FACET CASES into categories like less than 1 second, from 1 to 10 seconds, and greater than 10 seconds. You can combine multiple attributes within your cases, and label the cases with the AS selector. Data points will be added to at most one facet case, the first facet case that they match. You may also use a time function with your attribute, and you can use the OR operator to facet results that don't match any of your specified cases. Basic usage with WHERE SELECT count(*) FROM PageView FACET CASES (WHERE duration < 1, WHERE duration > 1 and duration < 10, WHERE duration > 10) Copy Group based on multiple attributes This example groups results into one bucket where the transaction name contains login, and another where the URL contains login and a custom attribute indicates that the user was a paid user: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid') Copy Label groups with AS This example uses the AS selector to give your results a human-readable name: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%' AS 'Total Logins', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid' AS 'Feature Visits from Paid Users') Copy Facet non-matching data with OR This example uses the OR operator to facet results that didn't match any of your cases: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid') OR name Copy FACET ... ORDER BY clause In NRQL, the default is for the first aggregation in the SELECT clause to guide the selection of facets in a query. FACET ... ORDER BY allows you to override this default behavior by adding an aggregate function with the ORDER BY modifier to specify how facets are selected. Specifically, the clause will override the priority by which facets are chosen to be in the final result before being limited by the LIMIT clause. This clause can be used in querying but not for alerts or streaming. This example shows how to use FACET ... ORDER BY to find the average durations of app transactions, showing the top 10 (default limit) highest durations by apps which have the highest response size. In this case, if FACET ... ORDER BY is not used, the query results will instead show the top 10 by highest durations, with response size being irrelevant to the app selection. FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) TIMESERIES FACET appName ORDER BY max(responseSize) Copy Tip Because the operations are performed before the LIMIT clause is applied, FACET ... ORDER BY does not impact the sort of the final query results, which will be particularly noticeable in the results for non-timeseries queries. Important The ORDER BY modifier in this case works differently than the ORDER BY clause. When parsing queries that follow the format FACET attribute1 ORDER BY attribute2, New Relic will read these as FACET ... ORDER BY queries, but only if ORDER BY appears immediately after FACET. Otherwise ORDER BY will be interpreted by New Relic as a clause. LIMIT clause SELECT ... LIMIT count ... Copy Use the LIMIT clause to control the maximum number of facet values returned by FACET queries or the maximum number of items returned by SELECT * queries. This clause takes a single integer value as an argument. If the LIMIT clause is not specified, or no value is provided, the limit defaults to 10 for FACET queries and 100 in the case of SELECT * queries. The maximum allowed value for the LIMIT clause is 2,000. Query using LIMIT This query shows the top 20 countries by session count and provides 95th percentile of response time for each country for Windows users only. SELECT uniqueCount(session), percentile(duration, 95) FROM PageView WHERE userAgentOS = 'Windows' FACET countryCode LIMIT 20 SINCE YESTERDAY Copy OFFSET clause SELECT ... LIMIT count OFFSET count ... Copy Use the OFFSET clause with LIMIT to control the portion of rows returned by SELECT * or SELECT column queries. Like the LIMIT clause, OFFSET takes a single integer value as an argument. OFFSET sets the number of rows to be skipped before the selected rows of your query are returned. This is constrained by LIMIT. OFFSET rows are skipped starting from the most recent record. For example, the query SELECT interestingValue FROM Minute_Report LIMIT 5 OFFSET 1 returns the last 5 values from Minute_Report except for the most recent one. ORDER BY clause The ORDER BY clause allows you to specify how you want to sort your query results in queries that select event attributes by row. This query orders transactions by duration. FROM Transaction SELECT appName, duration ORDER BY duration Copy The default sort order is ascending, but this can be changed by adding the ASC or DESC modifiers. SHOW EVENT TYPES clause SHOW EVENT TYPES... Copy SHOW EVENT TYPES will return a list of all the data types present in your account for a specific time range. It is used as the first clause in a query instead of SELECT. Important In this context, \"event types\" refers to the data types you can access with a NRQL query. Data types in the last day This query will return all the data types present over the past day: SHOW EVENT TYPES SINCE 1 day ago Copy SINCE clause SELECT ... SINCE [numerical units AGO | phrase] ... Copy The default value is 1 hour ago. Use the SINCE clause to define the beginning of a time range for the returned data. When using NRQL, you can set a UTC timestamp or relative time range. You can specify a timezone for the query but not for the results. NRQL results are based on your system time. SLIDE BY clause The SLIDE BY clause supports a feature known as sliding windows. With sliding windows,SLIDE BY data is gathered into \"windows\" of time that overlap with each other. These windows can help to smooth out line graphs with a lot of variation in cases where the rolling aggregate (such as a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. To use SLIDE BY, place it in a query after the TIMESERIES clause. For example, this query pulls data in 5-minute windows with a 1-minute SLIDE BY interval, meaning that each window lasts 5 minutes, but window 1 starts at 0 minutes, window 2 starts at 1 minute, window 3 starts at 2 minutes, and so on. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY 1 minute Copy To learn more about how and when you can use SLIDE BY, see Create smoother charts with sliding windows. Use SLIDE BY with MAX or AUTO interval You can use sliding windows in combination with MAX or AUTO. However, MAX or AUTO may not be placed between TIMESERIES and SLIDE BY. This query will automatically decide a SLIDE BY window interval. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY AUTO Copy This query will set the SLIDE BY window to the maximum interval granularity. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY MAX Copy Important The SLIDE BY value as determined by AUTO or MAX can produce a step interval greater than the window size, which can cause gaps and unexpected results. TIMESERIES clause SELECT ... TIMESERIES integer units ... Copy Use the TIMESERIES clause to return data as a time series broken out by a specified period of time. Since TIMESERIES is used to trigger certain charts, there is no default value. To indicate the time range, use integer units. For example: TIMESERIES 1 minute TIMESERIES 30 minutes TIMESERIES 1 hour TIMESERIES 30 seconds TIMESERIES can be combined with arguments such as MAX, AUTO, and SLIDE BY to further tailor query results, as shown in the examples below. Important For functions such as average( ) or percentile( ), a large aggregation window can have a significant smoothing effect on outliers. This is true whether or not the query makes use of sliding windows. Use a set interval The value provided indicates the units used to break out the graph. For example, to present a one-day graph showing 30 minute increments: SELECT ... SINCE 1 day AGO TIMESERIES 30 minutes Copy Use an automatically set interval TIMESERIES can also be set to AUTO, which will divide your graph into a reasonable number of divisions. For example, a daily chart will be divided into 30 minute intervals and a weekly chart will be divided into 6 hour intervals. This query returns data as a line chart showing the 50th and 90th percentile of client-side transaction time for one week with a data point every 6 hours. SELECT average(duration), percentile(duration, 50, 90) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week AGO TIMESERIES AUTO Copy Use MAX interval You can set TIMESERIES to MAX, which will automatically adjust your time window to the maximum number of intervals allowed for a given time period. This allows you to update your time windows without having to manually update your TIMESERIES buckets and ensures your time window is being split into the peak number of intervals allowed. The maximum number of TIMESERIES buckets that will be returned is 366. For example, the following query creates 4-minute intervals, which is the ceiling for a daily chart. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction since 1 day ago TIMESERIES MAX Copy UNTIL clause SELECT ... UNTIL integer units AGO ... Copy The default value is NOW. Only use UNTIL to specify an end point other than the default. Use the UNTIL clause to define the end of a time range across which to return data. Once a time range has been specified, the data will be preserved and can be reviewed after the time range has ended. See Use the time picker to adjust time settings for detailed information and examples. WHERE clause Use the WHERE clause to filter results. NRQL returns the results that fulfill the condition(s) you specify in the clause. SELECT function(attribute) ... WHERE attribute [operator 'value' | IN ('value' [, 'value]) | IS [NOT] NULL ] [AND|OR ...] ... Copy If you specify more than one condition, separate the conditions by the operators AND or OR. If you want to simulate a SQL join, use custom attributes in a WHERE or FACET clause. Operators that the WHERE clause accepts Description =, !=, <, <=, >, >= NRQL accepts standard comparison operators. Example: state = 'WA' AND Used to define an intersection of two conditions. OR Used to define a union of two conditions. IS NULL Determines if an attribute has a null value. IS NOT NULL Determines if an attribute does not have a null value. IN Determines if the string value of an attribute is in a specified set. Using this method yields better performance than stringing together multiple WHERE clauses. Example: animalType IN ('cat', 'dog', 'fish') NOT IN Determines if the string value of an attribute is not in a specified set. Using this method yields better performance than stringing together multiple WHERE clauses. Values must be in parentheses, separated by commas. For example: SELECT * FROM PageView WHERE countryCode NOT IN ('CA', 'WA') Copy LIKE Determines if an attribute contains a specified sub-string. The string argument for the LIKE operator accepts the percent sign (%) as a wildcard anywhere in the string. If the substring does not begin or end the string you are matching against, the wildcard must begin or end the string. Examples: userAgentName LIKE 'IE%' IE IE Mobile userAgentName LIKE 'o%a%' Opera Opera Mini userAgentName LIKE 'o%a' Opera userAgentName LIKE '%o%a%' Opera Opera Mini Mozilla Gecko NOT LIKE Determines if an attribute does not contain a specified sub-string. RLIKE Determines if an attribute contains a specified Regex sub-string. Uses RE2 syntax. Examples: appName RLIKE r'z.*|q.*'' hostname RLIKE r'ip-10-351-[0-2]?[0-9]-.*' z-app q-app ip-10-351-19-237 ip-10-351-2-41 ip-10-351-24-238 ip-10-351-14-15 Important Regex defaults to full-string matching, therefore ^ and $ are implicit and you do not need to add them. NOT RLIKE Determines if an attribute does not contain a specified Regex sub-string. Uses RE2 syntax. Example query with three conditions This query returns the browser response time for pages with checkout in the URL for Safari users in the United States and Canada over the past 24 hours. SELECT histogram(duration, 50, 20) FROM PageView WHERE countryCode IN ('CA', 'US') AND userAgentName='Safari' AND pageUrl LIKE '%checkout%' SINCE 1 day ago Copy WITH METRIC_FORMAT clause For information on querying metric data, see Query metrics. WITH TIMEZONE clause SELECT ... WITH TIMEZONE (selected zone) ... Copy By default, query results are displayed in the timezone of the browser you're using. Use the WITH TIMEZONE clause to select a time zone for a date or time in the query that hasn't already had a time zone specified for it. For example, the query clause SINCE Monday UNTIL Tuesday WITH TIMEZONE 'America/New_York' will return data recorded from Monday at midnight, Eastern Standard Time, until midnight Tuesday, Eastern Standard Time.

Query metric data Metric data is more complex than other types of data. There are specific tips for querying it well. We have two types of metric data, each with their own query guidelines: Query dimensional metrics, which are reported by our Metric API and by some of our tools that use that API, like our Telemetry SDKs and our open-source telemetry integrations (OpenTelemetry, Kamon, Micrometer, more). Query metric timeslice data, which is our original metric data type reported by our APM, mobile monitoring, and browser monitoring. For more on understanding these data types, see Metric data types. Functions In this section we explain NRQL functions, both aggregator functions and non-aggregator functions. Aggregator functions You can use aggregator functions to filter and aggregate data. Some tips for using these: See New Relic University tutorials for Filter queries, Apdex queries, and Percentile queries. Or, go to the full online course Writing NRQL queries. If you're using an aggregator function multiple times in the same query (e.g., SELECT median(one_metric</var>), median(another_metric)), it can cause problems in displaying results. To solve this, use the AS function. For example: SELECT median(one_metric) as 'med-a', median(another_metric) as 'med-b' Data type \"coercion\" is not supported. Read about available type conversion functions. For how to display results over time, see Group results over time. Examples: SELECT histogram(duration, 10, 20) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy aggregationendtime() Use the aggregationendtime() function to return the time of the relevant aggregation. More specifically, for a given aggregate, the aggregationendtime() function provides the timestamp of the end of the time period of that aggregation. For example, in a timeseries query, for a data point that encompasses an hour’s worth of data, the function would return the timestamp of the end of that hour period. apdex(attribute, t: ) Use the apdex function to return an Apdex score for a single transaction or for all your transactions. The attribute can be any attribute based on response time, such as duration or backendDuration. The t: argument defines an Apdex T threshold in seconds. The Apdex score returned by the apdex( ) function is based only on execution time. It does not account for APM errors. If a transaction includes an error but completes in Apdex T or less, that transaction will be rated satisfying by the apdex ( ) function. Get Apdex for specific customers If you have defined custom attributes, you can filter based on those attributes. For example, you could monitor the Apdex for a particularly important customer: SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.4) FROM Transaction WHERE customerName='ReallyImportantCustomer' SINCE 1 day ago Copy Get Apdex for specific transaction Use the name attribute to return a score for a specific transaction, or return an overall Apdex by omitting name. This query returns an Apdex score for the Controller/notes/index transaction over the last hour: The apdex function returns an Apdex score that measures user satisfaction with your site. Arguments are a response time attribute and an Apdex T threshold in seconds. SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.5) from Transaction WHERE name='Controller/notes/index' SINCE 1 hour ago Copy Get overall Apdex for your app This example query returns an overall Apdex for the application over the last three weeks: SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.08) FROM Transaction SINCE 3 week ago Copy average(attribute) Use the average( ) function to return the average value for an attribute. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. buckets(attribute, ceiling [,number of buckets]) Use the buckets() function to aggregate data split up by a FACET clause into buckets based on ranges. You can bucket by any attribute that is stored as a numerical value in the New Relic database. It takes three arguments: Attribute name Maximum value of the sample range. Any outliers will appear in the final bucket. Total number of buckets For more information and examples, see Split your data into buckets. bucketPercentile(attribute) The bucketPercentile( ) function is the NRQL equivalent of the histogram_quantile function in Prometheus. It is intended to be used with dimensional metric data. Instead of the quantile, New Relic returns the percentile, which is the quantile * 100. Use the bucketPercentile( ) function to calculate the quantile from the histogram data in a Prometheus format. It takes the bucket name as an argument and reports percentiles along the bucket's boundaries: SELECT bucketPercentile(duration_bucket) FROM Metric SINCE 1 day ago Copy Optionally, you can add percentile specifications as an argument: SELECT bucketPercentile(duration_bucket, 50, 75, 90) FROM Metric SINCE 1 day ago Copy Because multiple metrics are used to make up Prometheus histogram data, you must query for specific Prometheus metrics in terms of the associated <basename>. For example, to compute percentiles from a Prometheus histogram, with the <basename> prometheus_http_request_duration_seconds using NRQL, use bucketPercentile(prometheus_http_request_duration_seconds_bucket, 50). Note how _ bucket is added to the end of the <basename> as a suffix. See the Prometheus.io documentation for more information. cardinality(attribute) Use the cardinality( ) function to obtain the number of combinations of all the dimensions (attributes) on a metric. It takes three arguments, all optional: Metric name: if present, cardinality( ) only computes the metric specified. Include: if present, the include list restricts the cardinality computation to those attributes. Exclude: if present, the exclude list causes those attributes to be ignored in the cardinality computation. SELECT cardinality(metric_name, include:{attribute_list}, exclude:{attribute_list}) Copy count(*) Use the count( ) function to return a count of available records. It takes a single argument; either *, an attribute, or a constant value. Currently, it follows typical SQL behavior and counts all records that have values for its argument. Since count(*) does not name a specific attribute, the results will be formatted in the default \"humanize\" format. derivative(attribute [,time interval]) derivative() finds the rate of change for a given dataset. The rate of change is calculated using a linear least-squares regression to approximate the derivative. Since this calculation requires comparing more than one datapoint, if only one datapoint is included in the evaluation range, the calculation is indeterminate and won't work, resulting in a null value. The time interval is the period for which the rate of change is calculated. For example, derivative(attributeName, 1 minute) will return the rate of change per minute. dimensions(include: {attributes}, exclude: {attributes}) Use the dimensions( ) function to return all the dimensional values on a data type. You can explicitly include or exclude specific attributes using the optional arguments: Include: if present, the include list limits dimensions( ) to those attributes. Exclude: if present, the dimensions( ) calculation ignores those attributes. FROM Metric SELECT count(node_filesystem_size) TIMESERIES FACET dimensions() Copy When used with a FACET clause, dimensions( ) produces a unique timeseries for all facets available on the event type, similar to how Prometheus behaves with non-aggregated queries. latestrate(attribute, time interval) Use the latestrate( ) function to return the rate of change of a value based on the last 2 data points. It takes the attribute in question as the first argument and the unit of time for the resulting rate as the second argument. The function returns a result in units of change in attribute/time interval. This function can be useful to provide the most recent rate of change for an attribute in order to see leading-edge trends. Get the most recent rate of change of PageView Duration This query returns the rate of change of duration based on the last 2 data points. It will be returned in units of duration/second because of the 1 SECOND argument. SELECT latestrate(duration, 1 SECOND) FROM PageView Copy max(attribute) Use the max( ) function to return the maximum recorded value of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. median(attribute) Use the median( ) function to return an attribute's median, or 50th percentile. For more information about percentile queries, see percentile(). Tip The median( ) query is only available when using the query builder. Median query This query will generate a line chart for the median value. SELECT median(duration) FROM PageView TIMESERIES AUTO Copy min(attribute) Use the min( ) function to return the minimum recorded value of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. minuteOf(attribute) Use the minuteOf() function to extract only the minute portion (i.e. 0-59) of an attribute holding a valid timestamp value. mod(attribute, divisor) Use the mod( ) function to return the floor modulus after dividing the value of the provided numeric attribute (the first argument, or dividend) by a numeric value (the second argument, or divisor). This modulo operation can be used within a WHERE clause condition to filter to an arbitrary subset of results or within a FACET clause as a way to subdivide the result set. mod() within a WHERE clause condition FROM Transaction SELECT * WHERE mod(port, 2) = 1 Copy mod() within a FACET clause FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT uniques(hostId, 10000) SINCE 1 day AGO FACET mod(hostId, 10) Copy percentage(function(attribute), WHERE condition) Use the percentage( ) function to return the percentage of a target data set that matches some condition. The first argument requires an aggregator function against the desired attribute. Use exactly two arguments (arguments after the first two will be ignored). If the attribute is not numeric, this function returns a value of 100%. percentile(attribute [, percentile [, ...]]) Use the percentile( ) function to return an attribute's approximate value at a given percentile. It requires an attribute and can take any number of arguments representing percentile points. The percentile() function enables percentiles to displays with up to three digits after the decimal point, providing greater precision. Percentile thresholds may be specified as decimal values, but be aware that for most data sets, percentiles closer than 0.1 from each other will not be resolved. Percentile display examples Use TIMESERIES to generate a line chart with percentiles mapped over time. Omit TIMESERIES to generate a billboard and attribute sheet showing aggregate values for the percentiles. If no percentiles are listed, the default is the 95th percentile. To return only the 50th percentile value, the median, you can also use median(). Basic percentile query This query will generate a line chart with lines for the 5th, 50th, and 95th percentile. SELECT percentile(duration, 5, 50, 95) FROM PageView TIMESERIES AUTO Copy predictLinear(attribute, [,time interval]) predictLinear() is an extension of the derivative() function. It uses a similar method of least-squares linear regression to predict the future values for a dataset. The time interval is how far the query will look into the future. For example, predictLinear(attributeName, 1 hour) is a linear prediction 1 hour into the future of the query time window. Generally, predictLinear() is helpful for continuously growing values like disk space, or predictions on large trends. Since predictLinear() is a linear regression, familiarity with the dataset being queried helps to ensure accurate long-term predictions. Any dataset which grows exponentially, logarithmically, or by other nonlinear means will likely only be successful in very short-term predictions. New Relic recommends against using predictLinear in TIMESERIES queries. This is because each bucket will be making an individual prediction based on its relative timeframe within the query, meaning that such queries will not show predictions from the end of the timeseries forward. rate(function(attribute) [,time interval]) Use the rate( ) function to visualize the frequency or rate of a given query per time interval. For example, you might want to know the number of pageviews per minute over an hour-long period or the count of unique sessions on your site per hour over a day-long period. Use TIMESERIES to generate a line chart with rates mapped over time. Omit TIMESERIES to generate a billboard showing a single rate value averaged over time. Basic rate query This query will generate a line chart showing the rate of throughput for APM transactions per 10 minutes over the past 6 hours. SELECT rate(count(*), 10 minute) FROM Transaction SINCE 6 hours ago TIMESERIES Copy round(attribute) Use the round( ) function to return the rounded value of an attribute. Optionally round( ) can take a second argument, to_nearest, to round the first argument to the closest multiple of the second one. to_nearest can be fractional. SELECT round(n [, to_nearest]) Copy stddev(attribute) Use the stddev( ) function to return one standard deviation for a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. stdvar(attribute) Use the stdvar( ) function to return the standard variance for a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. sum(attribute) Use the sum( ) function to return the sum recorded values of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. uniqueCount(attribute) Use the uniqueCount( ) function to return the number of unique values recorded for an attribute over the time range specified. Tip To optimize query performance, this function returns approximate results for queries that inspect more than 256 unique values. uniques(attribute [,limit]) Use the uniques( ) function to return a list of unique values recorded for an attribute over the time range specified. When used along with the facet clause, a list of unique attribute values will be returned per each facet value. The limit parameter is optional. When it is not provided, the default limit of 1,000 unique attribute values per facet is applied. You may specify a different limit value, up to a maximum of 10,000. The uniques( ) function will return the first set of unique attribute values discovered, until the limit is reached. Therefore, if you have 5,000 unique attribute values in your data set, and the limit is set to 1,000, the operator will return the first 1,000 unique values that it discovers, regardless of their frequency. The maximum number of values that can be returned in a query result is the product of the uniques( ) limit times the facet limit. In the following query, the theoretical maximum number of values that can be returned is 5 million (5,000 x 1,000). Depending on the data set being queried, and the complexity of the query, memory protection limits may prevent a very large query from being executed. From Transaction SELECT uniques(host,5000) FACET appName LIMIT 1000 Copy Using tuple If you'd like to know the unique combinations of a handful of attributes, you can structure a query in the format SELECT uniques(tuple(x, y, ... z)) ...` to get all the unique tuples of values, to maintain their relationship. In the following query, tuple is used on index and cellName together to find uniques where those two values occur in combination. FROM NodeStatus SELECT uniques(tuple(index, cellName), 5) Copy capture(attribute, regular expression) Use the capture() to extract values from an attribute using a regular expression. Uses RE2 syntax. It takes two arguments: Attribute name Regular expression with capture syntax. Regex expressions in NRQL use Python-like syntax, r'...'. When capturing, use the RE2 named-capture syntax ...(?P<name> pattern )... to capture the contained pattern, given the specified name. Currently, only 1 capture group is supported. Please see the examples below. capture() within a SELECT clause condition The following will select the domain name of the website, removing https:// and any paths following the .com SELECT capture(pageUrl, r'https://(?P<baseUrl>.*.com)/.+') FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago Copy The following will capture only the first word of the error message. SELECT capture(errorMessage, r'(?P<firstWord>\\S+)\\s.+') FROM Transaction SINCE 1 hour ago where errorMessage is not null Copy capture() within a FACET clause condition The following will facet by the captured HTTP method. SELECT count(*) FROM Log WHERE message like '%HTTP%' FACET capture(message, r'.* \"(?P<httpMethod>[A-Z]+) .*') Copy capture() within a WHERE clause condition The following will filter the results based on Log events with message attribute that matches the regular expression where the captured job name is ExampleJob. SELECT message FROM Log WHERE capture(message, r'.*Job Failed: (?P<jobName>[A-Za-z]+),.*') = 'ExampleJob' SINCE 10 minutes ago Copy capture() with a numeric cast The following will capture sum of CPU Time from log lines. You must explicitly cast to numeric to do mathematical operations. SELECT sum(numeric(capture(message, r'.*CpuTime:\\s(?P<cpuTime>\\d+)'))) FROM Log WHERE message like '%CpuTime:%' SINCE 1 hour ago Copy Non-aggregator functions Use non-aggregator functions for non-numerical data in NRQL queries. earliest(attribute) Use the earliest( ) function to return the earliest value for an attribute over the specified time range. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If used in conjunction with a FACET it will return the most recent value for an attribute for each of the resulting facets. Get earliest country per user agent from PageView This query returns the earliest country code per each user agent from the PageView event. SELECT earliest(countryCode) FROM PageView FACET userAgentName Copy eventType() ...WHERE eventType() = 'EventNameHere'... ...FACET eventType()... Copy Use the eventType() function in a FACET clause to break out results by the selected data type or in a WHERE clause to filter results to a specific data type. This is particularly useful for targeting specific data types with the filter() and percentage() functions. Important In this context, \"event type\" refers to the types of data you can access with a NRQL query. Use eventType() in filter() function This query returns the percentage of total TransactionError results out of the total Transaction results. You can use the eventType() function to target specific types of data with the filter() function. SELECT 100 * filter(count(*), where eventType() = 'TransactionError') / filter(count(*), where eventType() = 'Transaction') FROM Transaction, TransactionError WHERE appName = 'App.Prod' TIMESERIES 2 Minutes SINCE 6 hours ago Copy Use eventType() with FACET This query displays a count of how many records each data type (Transaction and TransactionError) returns. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, TransactionError FACET eventType() TIMESERIES Copy filter(function(attribute), WHERE condition) Use the filter() function to limit the results for one of the aggregator functions in your SELECT statement. You can use filter() in conjunction with FACET or TIMESERIES. Filter is only useful when selecting multiple different aggregations such as SELECT filter(sum(x), WHERE attribute='a') AS 'A', filter(sum(x), WHERE attribute='b') AS 'B' .... Otherwise, it's better to just use the standard WHERE clause. Analyze purchases that used offer codes You could use filter() to compare the items bought in a set of transactions for those using an offer code versus those who aren't: Use the filter( ) function to limit the results for one of the aggregator functions in your SELECT statement. funnel(attribute, steps) Use the funnel() function to generate a funnel chart. It takes an attribute as its first argument. You then specify steps as WHERE clauses (with optional AS clauses for labels) separated by commas. For details and examples, see the funnels documentation. getField(attribute, field) Use the getField() function to extract a field from compound data types, such as metric data. It takes the following arguments: Metric type Supported fields summary count, total, max, min, type gauge count, total, max, min, latest, type distribution count, total, max, min, type counter count, type timeslice count, total, totalExclusive, min, and max Examples: SELECT max(getField(mySummary, count)) from Metric Copy SELECT sum(mySummary) from Metric where getField(mySummary, count) > 10 Copy histogram(attribute, ceiling [,number of buckets]) Use the histogram( ) function to generate histograms. It takes three arguments: Attribute name Maximum value of the sample range Total number of buckets (between 1 and 500, inclusive) Histogram of response times from PageView events This query results in a histogram of response times ranging up to 10 seconds over 20 buckets. SELECT histogram(duration, 10, 20) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy Prometheus histogram buckets histogram( ) accepts Prometheus histogram buckets: SELECT histogram(duration_bucket, 10, 20) FROM Metric SINCE 1 week ago Copy New Relic distribution metric histogram( ) accepts Distribution metric as an input: SELECT histogram(myDistributionMetric, 10, 20) FROM Metric SINCE 1 week ago Copy Histogram with a FACET clause Use histogram( ) with a FACET clause to generate a heatmap chart: SELECT histogram(duration) FROM PageView FACET appName SINCE 1 week ago Copy keyset() Using keyset() will allow you to see all of the attributes for a given data type over a given time range. It takes no arguments. It returns a JSON structure containing groups of string-typed keys, numeric-typed keys, boolean-typed keys, and all keys. See all attributes for a data type This query returns the attributes found for PageView events from the last day: SELECT keyset() FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago Copy latest(attribute) Use the latest( ) function to return the most recent value for an attribute over a specified time range. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If used in conjunction with a FACET it will return the most recent value for an attribute for each of the resulting facets. Get most recent country per user agent from PageView This query returns the most recent country code per each user agent from the PageView event. SELECT latest(countryCode) FROM PageView FACET userAgentName Copy Type conversion NRQL does not support \"coercion.\" This means that a float stored as a string is treated as a string and cannot be operated on by functions expecting float values. You can convert a string with a numeric value or a boolean with a string value to their numeric and boolean types with these functions: Use the numeric() function to convert a number with a string format to a numeric function. The function can be built into a query that uses math functions on query results or NRQL aggregator functions, such as average(). Use the boolean() function to convert a string value of \"true\" or \"false\" to the corresponding boolean value.",

      "body": "One way to query your New Relic data is with the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). This resource explains what NRQL is, when and how you can use it, and basic syntax rules. For more detailed information on querying, including a listing of clauses and functions and example queries, see NRQL syntax, clauses, and functions. What is NRQL? NRQL is New Relic's SQL-like query language. You can use NRQL to retrieve detailed New Relic data and get insight into your applications, hosts, and business-important activity. Reasons to use NRQL include: To answer a question for the purpose of troubleshooting or business analysis To create a new chart To make API queries of New Relic data (for example, using our NerdGraph API) NRQL is used behind the scenes to generate some New Relic charts: Some New Relic charts are built using NRQL. One way to start using NRQL is to view a chart's query and then edit it to make your own custom chart. Where can you use NRQL? You can use NRQL in these places: New Relic One query builder NerdGraph: our GraphQL-format API, which includes options for making NRQL queries one.newrelic.com > Query your data: You can run a NRQL query in New Relic One. This NRQL query shows a count of distributed tracing spans faceted by their entity names. NRQL is one of several ways to query New Relic data. For more on all query options, see Query your data. What data can you query with NRQL? NRQL allows you to query these New Relic data types: Event data from all New Relic products, including: APM events, like Transaction Browser monitoring events, like PageView Mobile monitoring events, like Mobile Infrastructure events, like ProcessSample Synthetics events, like SyntheticCheck Custom events, like those reported by the Event API Metric timeslice data (metrics reported by APM, browser, and mobile) The Metric data type (metrics reported by the Metric API and data sources that use that API) The Span data type (distributed tracing data) The Log data type (data from New Relic Logs) Tip Some data, like relationships between monitored entities, is not available via NRQL but is available using our NerdGraph API. Start using NRQL One way to start using NRQL and to understand what data you have available is to go to a NRQL interface (for example, the New Relic One query builder), type FROM, and press space. The interface will suggest available types of data: To see the attributes available for a specific data type, type FROM DATA_TYPE SELECT and press space. The interface will suggest available attributes. For example: To see the complete JSON associated with a data type, including all of its attributes, use the keyset() attribute. For example: FROM Transaction SELECT keyset() Copy NRQL is used behind the scenes to build some New Relic charts and dashboards. One way to learn NRQL is to find one of these NRQL-generated charts and start playing with the NRQL to create new, customized queries and charts: Charts built with NRQL will have View query as an option. You can then edit and customize that query to see how your changes affect the resulting visualization. Important To explore your data without having to use NRQL, use the data explorer. Learn more about querying data in New Relic. NRQL query examples Here's an example NRQL query of Transaction data, which is reported by APM. FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) FACET appName TIMESERIES auto Copy This would generate a chart that looks like: Here are some more query examples: Basic NRQL query of browser data Here's a NRQL query of PageView data from browser monitoring. SELECT uniqueCount(user) FROM PageView WHERE userAgentOS = 'Mac' FACET countryCode SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 20 Copy Attribute name with a space in it If a custom attribute name has a space in it, use backticks around the attribute name: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET `Logged-in user` Copy Querying multiple data sources To return data from two data sources, separate their data types with a comma. For example, this query returns a count of all APM transactions and browser events over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, PageView SINCE 3 days ago Copy Query returning multiple columns To return multiple columns from a dataset, separate the aggregator arguments with a comma: SELECT function(attribute), function(attribute) ... FROM ... Copy This query returns the minimum, average, and maximum duration for browser monitoring PageView events over the last week: SELECT min(duration), max(duration), average(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy See more NRQL query examples. NRQL syntax The syntax of a NRQL query is similar to standard SQL queries. Here is a breakdown of the structure of a NRQL query: SELECT function(attribute) [AS 'label'][, ...] FROM data type [WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...]][AS 'label'][, ...] [FACET attribute | function(attribute)] [LIMIT number] [SINCE time] [UNTIL time] [WITH TIMEZONE timezone] [COMPARE WITH time] [TIMESERIES time] Copy Basic rules include: NRQL condition Details Required values The SELECT statement and FROM clause are required. All other clauses are optional. You can start your query with either SELECT or FROM. Query string size The query string must be less than 4 KB. Case sensitivity The data type names and attribute names are case sensitive. NRQL clauses and functions are not case sensitive. Syntax for strings NRQL uses single quotes to designate strings. For example: ... where traceId = '030a573f0df02c57' Copy Attribute names with spaces Use backticks `` to quote a custom attribute name that has a space in it. For example: ... FACET `Logged-in user` Copy Data type coercion Insights does not support data type \"coercion.\" For more information, see Data type conversion. Use of math functions Basic and advanced math functions are supported in the SELECT statement. JOIN functions NRQL does not have the equivalent of the SQL JOIN function, but you can simulate a JOIN with custom attributes. Read more about NRQL syntax and functions.",

      "body": "BETA FEATURE This feature is currently in beta. Dimensional metrics are an industry standard for storing and querying metric data. All infrastructure metrics are stored as event data in New Relic, but you can also query them through dimensional metrics. In this page you can learn: The benefits of dimensional metrics. A few examples on how and where to use them. Known issues. Why it matters At New Relic we report metrics in several ways, including dimensional metrics, which are used by our metric API, Telemetry SDK, some open-source integrations, and our infrastructure services. This type of metric enables you to: Enjoy an improved query experience for Infrastructure data. Discover all your metrics in one place. Tap into more metric sources, such as Prometheus. For example, the query to get the maximum duration of your Lambda functions is simplified: Query with samples FROM ServerlessSample SELECT max(provider.duration.Maximum) WHERE provider = 'LambdaFunction' Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT max(aws.lambda.function.duration) Copy Get started No agent or integration updates are required to use these metrics. NRQL alerting based on dimensional metrics is also supported, except for data coming from cloud integrations (that is metrics from AWS polling integrations, GCP, and Azure). AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams metrics are ingested as dimensional metrics and NRQL alerts are recommended. Where and how to query dimensional metrics All current NRQL query features are supported. Queries can use WHERE, FACET, and time selection functions such as SINCE, UNTIL, and COMPARE WITH. The query builder in New Relic One supports metrics in both simple and advanced (NRQL) mode. Naming conventions for metrics and attributes All metric names and attributes for dimensional metrics follow the same naming convention in order to make them easy to find and use. Metric and attribute names are namespaced with dots: for example, the host. prefix is used for host metrics, the k8s. prefix is used for Kubernetes metrics, and aws. is used for AWS metrics. The graphic below shows how a ProcessSample that contains three metrics (cpuPercent, ioTotalReadBytes, and ioTotalWriteBytes) is split into three separate metrics. Note the updated naming of the metrics and the attributes. Dimensional metrics naming convention Examples Here are some examples of NQRL queries with and without dimensional metrics: AWS EBS query example Get the total write time by EBS Volume. Query with samples FROM BlockDeviceSample SELECT sum('provider.volumeTotalWriteTime.Sum') WHERE provider = 'EbsVolume' FACET entityName Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT sum(aws.ebs.volume.TotalWriteTime) FACET entity.name Copy Azure Service bus query example Maximum number of messages in an Azure Service Bus topic by resource group. Query with samples FROM AzureServiceBusTopicSample SELECT max(activeMessages.Maximum) FACET resourceGroupName Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT max(azure.servicebus.topic.activeMessages) FACET azure.resourceGroup Copy Azure functions query example Number of function executions Azure Functions over the past 6 hours by region over time. Query with samples FROM AzureFunctionsAppSample SELECT sum(functionExecutionCount.Total) FACET regionName TIMESERIES SINCE 6 hours ago Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT sum(azure.functions.app.functionExecutionCount) FACET azure.region TIMESERIES SINCE 6 hours ago Copy Azure VMs query example Compare the number of Azure VMs over the past thirty minutes with the same time a week ago. Query with samples FROM AzureVirtualMachineScaleSetSample SELECT uniqueCount(vMName) FACET name SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO COMPARE WITH 1 WEEK AGO Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT uniqueCount(azure.vms.vmName) FACET azure.resourceName WHERE azure.resourceType='Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachineScaleSets' SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO COMPARE WITH 1 WEEK AGO Copy NGINX query example The average number of NGINX requests per second over time. Query with samples FROM NginxSample SELECT average(net.requestsPerSecond) TIMESERIES Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT average(nginx.server.net.requestsPerSecond) TIMESERIES Copy MySQL query example The maximum number of used MySQL connections. Query with samples FROM MysqlSample SELECT max(net.maxUsedConnections) Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT max(mysql.node.net.maxUsedConnections) Copy Known limitations Metric queries with * do not return Infrastructure sample data (for example, SELECT * FROM Metric). In order to select attributes starting with tags. a metric name has to be provided. For example, SELECT uniques(tags.environment) FROM Metric WHERE metricName='aws.lambda.function.duration' does not work without the WHERE clause. Results may not be complete if the selection criteria matches too many samples. For example, SELECT uniqueCount(entity.guid) FROM Metric maps to all Infrastructure samples, and may return incomplete results. Initially there is no support for the newly introduced metric wildcarding feature (for example, SELECT average(host.swap%Bytes) FROM Metric).",

Syntax This document is a reference for the functions and clauses used in a NRQL query. Other resources for understanding NRQL: Intro to NRQL: explains what NRQL is used for, what data you can query with it, and basic NRQL syntax Examine NRQL queries used to build New Relic charts Learn how to query the Metric data type Simulate SQL JOIN functions Use funnels to evaluate a series of related data Format NRQL for querying with the Event API Query components Every NRQL query will begin with a SELECT statement or a FROM clause. All other clauses are optional. The clause definitions below also contain example NRQL queries. Required clauses Required: SELECT statement SELECT attribute ... Copy SELECT function(attribute) ... Copy The SELECT specifies what portion of a data type you want to query by specifying an attribute or a function. It's followed by one or more arguments separated by commas. In each argument you can: Get the values of all available attributes by using * as a wildcard. For example: SELECT * from Transaction. Get values associated with a specified attribute or multiple attributes specified in a comma separated list. Get aggregated values from specified attributes by selecting an aggregator function. Label the results returned in each argument with the AS clause. You can also use SELECT with basic math functions. Avg response time since last week This query returns the average response time since last week. SELECT average(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy Required: FROM clause SELECT ... FROM data type ... Copy Use the FROM clause to specify the data type you wish to query. You can start your query with FROM or with SELECT. You can merge values for the same attributes across multiple data types in a comma separated list. Query one data type This query returns the count of all APM transactions over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction SINCE 3 days ago Copy Query multiple data types This query returns the count of all APM transactions and browser events over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, PageView SINCE 3 days ago Copy Optional clauses AS clause SELECT ... AS 'label' ... Copy Use the AS clause to label an attribute, aggregator, step in a funnel, or the result of a math function with a string delimited by single quotes. The label is used in the resulting chart. Query using math function and AS This query returns the number of page views per session: SELECT count(*)/uniqueCount(session) AS 'Pageviews per Session' FROM PageView Copy Query using funnel and AS This query returns a count of people who have visited both the main page and the careers page of a site over the past week: SELECT funnel(SESSION, WHERE name='Controller/about/main' AS 'Step 1', WHERE name = 'Controller/about/careers' AS 'Step 2') FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy COMPARE WITH clause SELECT ... (SINCE or UNTIL) (integer units) AGO COMPARE WITH (integer units) AGO ... Copy Use the COMPARE WITH clause to compare the values for two different time ranges. COMPARE WITH requires a SINCE or UNTIL statement. The time specified by COMPARE WITH is relative to the time specified by SINCE or UNTIL. For example, SINCE 1 day ago COMPARE WITH 1 day ago compares yesterday with the day before. The time range for theCOMPARE WITH value is always the same as that specified by SINCE or UNTIL. For example, SINCE 2 hours ago COMPARE WITH 4 hours ago might compare 3:00pm through 5:00pm against 11:00am through 1:00pm. COMPARE WITH can be formatted as either a line chart or a billboard: With TIMESERIES, COMPARE WITH creates a line chart with the comparison mapped over time. Without TIMESERIES, COMPARE WITH generates a billboard with the current value and the percent change from the COMPARE WITH value. Example: This query returns data as a line chart showing the 95th percentile for the past hour compared to the same range one week ago. First as a single value, then as a line chart. SELECT percentile(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago COMPARE WITH 1 week AGO SELECT percentile(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago COMPARE WITH 1 week AGO TIMESERIES AUTO Copy EXTRAPOLATE clause You can use this clause with these data types: Transaction TransactionError Custom events reported via APM agent APIs The purpose of EXTRAPOLATE is to mathematically compensate for the effects of APM agent sampling of event data so that query results more closely represent the total activity in your system. This clause will be useful when a APM agent reports so many events that it often passes its harvest cycle reporting limits. When that occurs, the agent begins to sample events. When EXTRAPOLATE is used in a NRQL query that supports its use, the ratio between the reported events and the total events is used to extrapolate a close approximation of the total unsampled data. When it is used in a NRQL query that doesn’t support its use or that hasn’t used sampled data, it has no effect. Important Note that EXTRAPOLATE is most useful for homogenous data (like throughput or error rate). It's not effective when attempting to extrapolate a count of distinct things (like uniqueCount() or uniques()). This clause works only with NRQL queries that use one of the following aggregator functions: apdex average count histogram sum percentage (if function it takes as an argument supports EXTRAPOLATE) rate (if function it takes as an argument supports EXTRAPOLATE) stddev Example of extrapolating throughput A query that will show the extrapolated throughput of a service named interestingApplication. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction WHERE appName='interestingApplication' SINCE 60 minutes ago EXTRAPOLATE Copy Example of extrapolating throughput as a time series A query that will show the extrapolated throughput of a service named interestingApplication by transaction name, displayed as a time series. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction WHERE appName='interestingApplication' SINCE 60 minutes ago FACET name TIMESERIES 1 minute EXTRAPOLATE Copy FACET clause SELECT ... FACET attribute ... Copy Use FACET to separate and group your results by attribute values. For example, you could FACET your PageView data by deviceType to figure out what percentage of your traffic comes from mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. Use the LIMIT clause to specify how many facets appear (default is 10). For more complex grouping, use FACET CASES. FACET clauses support up to five attributes, separated by commas. The facets are sorted in descending order by the first field you provide in the SELECT clause. If you are faceting on attributes with more than 2,000 unique values, a subset of facet values is selected and sorted according to the query type. When selecting min(), max(), or count(), FACET uses those functions to determine how facets are picked and sorted. When selecting any other function, FACET uses the frequency of the attribute you are faceting on to determine how facets are picked and sorted. Faceted query using count() This query shows cities with the highest pageview counts. This query uses the total number of pageviews per city to determine how facets are picked and ordered. SELECT count(*) FROM PageView FACET city Copy Faceted query using uniqueCount() This query shows the cities that access the highest number of unique URLs. This query uses the total number of times a particular city appears in the results to determine how facets are picked and ordered. SELECT uniqueCount(pageUrl) FROM PageView FACET city Copy Grouping results across time Advanced segmentation and cohort analysis allow you to facet on bucket functions to more effectively break out your data. Cohort analysis is a way to group results together based on timestamps. You can separate them into buckets that cover a specified range of dates and times. FACET ... AS clause Use FACET ... AS to name facets using the AS keyword in queries. This clause is helpful for adding clearer or simplified names for facets in your results. It can also be used to rename facets in nested aggregation queries. FACET ... AS queries will change the facet names in results (when they appear as headers in tables, for example), but not the actual facet names themselves. FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) FACET response.headers.contentType AS 'content type' Copy FACET CASES clause SELECT ... FACET CASES ( WHERE attribute operator value, WHERE attribute operator value, ... ) ... Copy Use FACET CASES to break out your data by more complex conditions than possible with FACET. Separate multiple conditions with a comma ,. For example, you could query your PageView data and FACET CASES into categories like less than 1 second, from 1 to 10 seconds, and greater than 10 seconds. You can combine multiple attributes within your cases, and label the cases with the AS selector. Data points will be added to at most one facet case, the first facet case that they match. You may also use a time function with your attribute, and you can use the OR operator to facet results that don't match any of your specified cases. Basic usage with WHERE SELECT count(*) FROM PageView FACET CASES (WHERE duration < 1, WHERE duration > 1 and duration < 10, WHERE duration > 10) Copy Group based on multiple attributes This example groups results into one bucket where the transaction name contains login, and another where the URL contains login and a custom attribute indicates that the user was a paid user: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid') Copy Label groups with AS This example uses the AS selector to give your results a human-readable name: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%' AS 'Total Logins', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid' AS 'Feature Visits from Paid Users') Copy Facet non-matching data with OR This example uses the OR operator to facet results that didn't match any of your cases: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid') OR name Copy FACET ... ORDER BY clause In NRQL, the default is for the first aggregation in the SELECT clause to guide the selection of facets in a query. FACET ... ORDER BY allows you to override this default behavior by adding an aggregate function with the ORDER BY modifier to specify how facets are selected. Specifically, the clause will override the priority by which facets are chosen to be in the final result before being limited by the LIMIT clause. This clause can be used in querying but not for alerts or streaming. This example shows how to use FACET ... ORDER BY to find the average durations of app transactions, showing the top 10 (default limit) highest durations by apps which have the highest response size. In this case, if FACET ... ORDER BY is not used, the query results will instead show the top 10 by highest durations, with response size being irrelevant to the app selection. FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) TIMESERIES FACET appName ORDER BY max(responseSize) Copy Tip Because the operations are performed before the LIMIT clause is applied, FACET ... ORDER BY does not impact the sort of the final query results, which will be particularly noticeable in the results for non-timeseries queries. Important The ORDER BY modifier in this case works differently than the ORDER BY clause. When parsing queries that follow the format FACET attribute1 ORDER BY attribute2, New Relic will read these as FACET ... ORDER BY queries, but only if ORDER BY appears immediately after FACET. Otherwise ORDER BY will be interpreted by New Relic as a clause. LIMIT clause SELECT ... LIMIT count ... Copy Use the LIMIT clause to control the maximum number of facet values returned by FACET queries or the maximum number of items returned by SELECT * queries. This clause takes a single integer value as an argument. If the LIMIT clause is not specified, or no value is provided, the limit defaults to 10 for FACET queries and 100 in the case of SELECT * queries. The maximum allowed value for the LIMIT clause is 2,000. Query using LIMIT This query shows the top 20 countries by session count and provides 95th percentile of response time for each country for Windows users only. SELECT uniqueCount(session), percentile(duration, 95) FROM PageView WHERE userAgentOS = 'Windows' FACET countryCode LIMIT 20 SINCE YESTERDAY Copy OFFSET clause SELECT ... LIMIT count OFFSET count ... Copy Use the OFFSET clause with LIMIT to control the portion of rows returned by SELECT * or SELECT column queries. Like the LIMIT clause, OFFSET takes a single integer value as an argument. OFFSET sets the number of rows to be skipped before the selected rows of your query are returned. This is constrained by LIMIT. OFFSET rows are skipped starting from the most recent record. For example, the query SELECT interestingValue FROM Minute_Report LIMIT 5 OFFSET 1 returns the last 5 values from Minute_Report except for the most recent one. ORDER BY clause The ORDER BY clause allows you to specify how you want to sort your query results in queries that select event attributes by row. This query orders transactions by duration. FROM Transaction SELECT appName, duration ORDER BY duration Copy The default sort order is ascending, but this can be changed by adding the ASC or DESC modifiers. SHOW EVENT TYPES clause SHOW EVENT TYPES... Copy SHOW EVENT TYPES will return a list of all the data types present in your account for a specific time range. It is used as the first clause in a query instead of SELECT. Important In this context, \"event types\" refers to the data types you can access with a NRQL query. Data types in the last day This query will return all the data types present over the past day: SHOW EVENT TYPES SINCE 1 day ago Copy SINCE clause SELECT ... SINCE [numerical units AGO | phrase] ... Copy The default value is 1 hour ago. Use the SINCE clause to define the beginning of a time range for the returned data. When using NRQL, you can set a UTC timestamp or relative time range. You can specify a timezone for the query but not for the results. NRQL results are based on your system time. SLIDE BY clause The SLIDE BY clause supports a feature known as sliding windows. With sliding windows,SLIDE BY data is gathered into \"windows\" of time that overlap with each other. These windows can help to smooth out line graphs with a lot of variation in cases where the rolling aggregate (such as a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. To use SLIDE BY, place it in a query after the TIMESERIES clause. For example, this query pulls data in 5-minute windows with a 1-minute SLIDE BY interval, meaning that each window lasts 5 minutes, but window 1 starts at 0 minutes, window 2 starts at 1 minute, window 3 starts at 2 minutes, and so on. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY 1 minute Copy To learn more about how and when you can use SLIDE BY, see Create smoother charts with sliding windows. Use SLIDE BY with MAX or AUTO interval You can use sliding windows in combination with MAX or AUTO. However, MAX or AUTO may not be placed between TIMESERIES and SLIDE BY. This query will automatically decide a SLIDE BY window interval. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY AUTO Copy This query will set the SLIDE BY window to the maximum interval granularity. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY MAX Copy Important The SLIDE BY value as determined by AUTO or MAX can produce a step interval greater than the window size, which can cause gaps and unexpected results. TIMESERIES clause SELECT ... TIMESERIES integer units ... Copy Use the TIMESERIES clause to return data as a time series broken out by a specified period of time. Since TIMESERIES is used to trigger certain charts, there is no default value. To indicate the time range, use integer units. For example: TIMESERIES 1 minute TIMESERIES 30 minutes TIMESERIES 1 hour TIMESERIES 30 seconds TIMESERIES can be combined with arguments such as MAX, AUTO, and SLIDE BY to further tailor query results, as shown in the examples below. Important For functions such as average( ) or percentile( ), a large aggregation window can have a significant smoothing effect on outliers. This is true whether or not the query makes use of sliding windows. Use a set interval The value provided indicates the units used to break out the graph. For example, to present a one-day graph showing 30 minute increments: SELECT ... SINCE 1 day AGO TIMESERIES 30 minutes Copy Use an automatically set interval TIMESERIES can also be set to AUTO, which will divide your graph into a reasonable number of divisions. For example, a daily chart will be divided into 30 minute intervals and a weekly chart will be divided into 6 hour intervals. This query returns data as a line chart showing the 50th and 90th percentile of client-side transaction time for one week with a data point every 6 hours. SELECT average(duration), percentile(duration, 50, 90) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week AGO TIMESERIES AUTO Copy Use MAX interval You can set TIMESERIES to MAX, which will automatically adjust your time window to the maximum number of intervals allowed for a given time period. This allows you to update your time windows without having to manually update your TIMESERIES buckets and ensures your time window is being split into the peak number of intervals allowed. The maximum number of TIMESERIES buckets that will be returned is 366. For example, the following query creates 4-minute intervals, which is the ceiling for a daily chart. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction since 1 day ago TIMESERIES MAX Copy UNTIL clause SELECT ... UNTIL integer units AGO ... Copy The default value is NOW. Only use UNTIL to specify an end point other than the default. Use the UNTIL clause to define the end of a time range across which to return data. Once a time range has been specified, the data will be preserved and can be reviewed after the time range has ended. See Use the time picker to adjust time settings for detailed information and examples. WHERE clause Use the WHERE clause to filter results. NRQL returns the results that fulfill the condition(s) you specify in the clause. SELECT function(attribute) ... WHERE attribute [operator 'value' | IN ('value' [, 'value]) | IS [NOT] NULL ] [AND|OR ...] ... Copy If you specify more than one condition, separate the conditions by the operators AND or OR. If you want to simulate a SQL join, use custom attributes in a WHERE or FACET clause. Operators that the WHERE clause accepts Description =, !=, <, <=, >, >= NRQL accepts standard comparison operators. Example: state = 'WA' AND Used to define an intersection of two conditions. OR Used to define a union of two conditions. IS NULL Determines if an attribute has a null value. IS NOT NULL Determines if an attribute does not have a null value. IN Determines if the string value of an attribute is in a specified set. Using this method yields better performance than stringing together multiple WHERE clauses. Example: animalType IN ('cat', 'dog', 'fish') NOT IN Determines if the string value of an attribute is not in a specified set. Using this method yields better performance than stringing together multiple WHERE clauses. Values must be in parentheses, separated by commas. For example: SELECT * FROM PageView WHERE countryCode NOT IN ('CA', 'WA') Copy LIKE Determines if an attribute contains a specified sub-string. The string argument for the LIKE operator accepts the percent sign (%) as a wildcard anywhere in the string. If the substring does not begin or end the string you are matching against, the wildcard must begin or end the string. Examples: userAgentName LIKE 'IE%' IE IE Mobile userAgentName LIKE 'o%a%' Opera Opera Mini userAgentName LIKE 'o%a' Opera userAgentName LIKE '%o%a%' Opera Opera Mini Mozilla Gecko NOT LIKE Determines if an attribute does not contain a specified sub-string. RLIKE Determines if an attribute contains a specified Regex sub-string. Uses RE2 syntax. Examples: appName RLIKE r'z.*|q.*'' hostname RLIKE r'ip-10-351-[0-2]?[0-9]-.*' z-app q-app ip-10-351-19-237 ip-10-351-2-41 ip-10-351-24-238 ip-10-351-14-15 Important Regex defaults to full-string matching, therefore ^ and $ are implicit and you do not need to add them. NOT RLIKE Determines if an attribute does not contain a specified Regex sub-string. Uses RE2 syntax. Example query with three conditions This query returns the browser response time for pages with checkout in the URL for Safari users in the United States and Canada over the past 24 hours. SELECT histogram(duration, 50, 20) FROM PageView WHERE countryCode IN ('CA', 'US') AND userAgentName='Safari' AND pageUrl LIKE '%checkout%' SINCE 1 day ago Copy WITH METRIC_FORMAT clause For information on querying metric data, see Query metrics. WITH TIMEZONE clause SELECT ... WITH TIMEZONE (selected zone) ... Copy By default, query results are displayed in the timezone of the browser you're using. Use the WITH TIMEZONE clause to select a time zone for a date or time in the query that hasn't already had a time zone specified for it. For example, the query clause SINCE Monday UNTIL Tuesday WITH TIMEZONE 'America/New_York' will return data recorded from Monday at midnight, Eastern Standard Time, until midnight Tuesday, Eastern Standard Time.

Query metric data Metric data is more complex than other types of data. There are specific tips for querying it well. We have two types of metric data, each with their own query guidelines: Query dimensional metrics, which are reported by our Metric API and by some of our tools that use that API, like our Telemetry SDKs and our open-source telemetry integrations (OpenTelemetry, Kamon, Micrometer, more). Query metric timeslice data, which is our original metric data type reported by our APM, mobile monitoring, and browser monitoring. For more on understanding these data types, see Metric data types. Functions In this section we explain NRQL functions, both aggregator functions and non-aggregator functions. Aggregator functions You can use aggregator functions to filter and aggregate data. Some tips for using these: See New Relic University tutorials for Filter queries, Apdex queries, and Percentile queries. Or, go to the full online course Writing NRQL queries. If you're using an aggregator function multiple times in the same query (e.g., SELECT median(one_metric</var>), median(another_metric)), it can cause problems in displaying results. To solve this, use the AS function. For example: SELECT median(one_metric) as 'med-a', median(another_metric) as 'med-b' Data type \"coercion\" is not supported. Read about available type conversion functions. For how to display results over time, see Group results over time. Examples: SELECT histogram(duration, 10, 20) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy aggregationendtime() Use the aggregationendtime() function to return the time of the relevant aggregation. More specifically, for a given aggregate, the aggregationendtime() function provides the timestamp of the end of the time period of that aggregation. For example, in a timeseries query, for a data point that encompasses an hour’s worth of data, the function would return the timestamp of the end of that hour period. apdex(attribute, t: ) Use the apdex function to return an Apdex score for a single transaction or for all your transactions. The attribute can be any attribute based on response time, such as duration or backendDuration. The t: argument defines an Apdex T threshold in seconds. The Apdex score returned by the apdex( ) function is based only on execution time. It does not account for APM errors. If a transaction includes an error but completes in Apdex T or less, that transaction will be rated satisfying by the apdex ( ) function. Get Apdex for specific customers If you have defined custom attributes, you can filter based on those attributes. For example, you could monitor the Apdex for a particularly important customer: SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.4) FROM Transaction WHERE customerName='ReallyImportantCustomer' SINCE 1 day ago Copy Get Apdex for specific transaction Use the name attribute to return a score for a specific transaction, or return an overall Apdex by omitting name. This query returns an Apdex score for the Controller/notes/index transaction over the last hour: The apdex function returns an Apdex score that measures user satisfaction with your site. Arguments are a response time attribute and an Apdex T threshold in seconds. SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.5) from Transaction WHERE name='Controller/notes/index' SINCE 1 hour ago Copy Get overall Apdex for your app This example query returns an overall Apdex for the application over the last three weeks: SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.08) FROM Transaction SINCE 3 week ago Copy average(attribute) Use the average( ) function to return the average value for an attribute. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. buckets(attribute, ceiling [,number of buckets]) Use the buckets() function to aggregate data split up by a FACET clause into buckets based on ranges. You can bucket by any attribute that is stored as a numerical value in the New Relic database. It takes three arguments: Attribute name Maximum value of the sample range. Any outliers will appear in the final bucket. Total number of buckets For more information and examples, see Split your data into buckets. bucketPercentile(attribute) The bucketPercentile( ) function is the NRQL equivalent of the histogram_quantile function in Prometheus. It is intended to be used with dimensional metric data. Instead of the quantile, New Relic returns the percentile, which is the quantile * 100. Use the bucketPercentile( ) function to calculate the quantile from the histogram data in a Prometheus format. It takes the bucket name as an argument and reports percentiles along the bucket's boundaries: SELECT bucketPercentile(duration_bucket) FROM Metric SINCE 1 day ago Copy Optionally, you can add percentile specifications as an argument: SELECT bucketPercentile(duration_bucket, 50, 75, 90) FROM Metric SINCE 1 day ago Copy Because multiple metrics are used to make up Prometheus histogram data, you must query for specific Prometheus metrics in terms of the associated <basename>. For example, to compute percentiles from a Prometheus histogram, with the <basename> prometheus_http_request_duration_seconds using NRQL, use bucketPercentile(prometheus_http_request_duration_seconds_bucket, 50). Note how _ bucket is added to the end of the <basename> as a suffix. See the Prometheus.io documentation for more information. cardinality(attribute) Use the cardinality( ) function to obtain the number of combinations of all the dimensions (attributes) on a metric. It takes three arguments, all optional: Metric name: if present, cardinality( ) only computes the metric specified. Include: if present, the include list restricts the cardinality computation to those attributes. Exclude: if present, the exclude list causes those attributes to be ignored in the cardinality computation. SELECT cardinality(metric_name, include:{attribute_list}, exclude:{attribute_list}) Copy count(*) Use the count( ) function to return a count of available records. It takes a single argument; either *, an attribute, or a constant value. Currently, it follows typical SQL behavior and counts all records that have values for its argument. Since count(*) does not name a specific attribute, the results will be formatted in the default \"humanize\" format. derivative(attribute [,time interval]) derivative() finds the rate of change for a given dataset. The rate of change is calculated using a linear least-squares regression to approximate the derivative. Since this calculation requires comparing more than one datapoint, if only one datapoint is included in the evaluation range, the calculation is indeterminate and won't work, resulting in a null value. The time interval is the period for which the rate of change is calculated. For example, derivative(attributeName, 1 minute) will return the rate of change per minute. dimensions(include: {attributes}, exclude: {attributes}) Use the dimensions( ) function to return all the dimensional values on a data type. You can explicitly include or exclude specific attributes using the optional arguments: Include: if present, the include list limits dimensions( ) to those attributes. Exclude: if present, the dimensions( ) calculation ignores those attributes. FROM Metric SELECT count(node_filesystem_size) TIMESERIES FACET dimensions() Copy When used with a FACET clause, dimensions( ) produces a unique timeseries for all facets available on the event type, similar to how Prometheus behaves with non-aggregated queries. latestrate(attribute, time interval) Use the latestrate( ) function to return the rate of change of a value based on the last 2 data points. It takes the attribute in question as the first argument and the unit of time for the resulting rate as the second argument. The function returns a result in units of change in attribute/time interval. This function can be useful to provide the most recent rate of change for an attribute in order to see leading-edge trends. Get the most recent rate of change of PageView Duration This query returns the rate of change of duration based on the last 2 data points. It will be returned in units of duration/second because of the 1 SECOND argument. SELECT latestrate(duration, 1 SECOND) FROM PageView Copy max(attribute) Use the max( ) function to return the maximum recorded value of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. median(attribute) Use the median( ) function to return an attribute's median, or 50th percentile. For more information about percentile queries, see percentile(). Tip The median( ) query is only available when using the query builder. Median query This query will generate a line chart for the median value. SELECT median(duration) FROM PageView TIMESERIES AUTO Copy min(attribute) Use the min( ) function to return the minimum recorded value of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. minuteOf(attribute) Use the minuteOf() function to extract only the minute portion (i.e. 0-59) of an attribute holding a valid timestamp value. mod(attribute, divisor) Use the mod( ) function to return the floor modulus after dividing the value of the provided numeric attribute (the first argument, or dividend) by a numeric value (the second argument, or divisor). This modulo operation can be used within a WHERE clause condition to filter to an arbitrary subset of results or within a FACET clause as a way to subdivide the result set. mod() within a WHERE clause condition FROM Transaction SELECT * WHERE mod(port, 2) = 1 Copy mod() within a FACET clause FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT uniques(hostId, 10000) SINCE 1 day AGO FACET mod(hostId, 10) Copy percentage(function(attribute), WHERE condition) Use the percentage( ) function to return the percentage of a target data set that matches some condition. The first argument requires an aggregator function against the desired attribute. Use exactly two arguments (arguments after the first two will be ignored). If the attribute is not numeric, this function returns a value of 100%. percentile(attribute [, percentile [, ...]]) Use the percentile( ) function to return an attribute's approximate value at a given percentile. It requires an attribute and can take any number of arguments representing percentile points. The percentile() function enables percentiles to displays with up to three digits after the decimal point, providing greater precision. Percentile thresholds may be specified as decimal values, but be aware that for most data sets, percentiles closer than 0.1 from each other will not be resolved. Percentile display examples Use TIMESERIES to generate a line chart with percentiles mapped over time. Omit TIMESERIES to generate a billboard and attribute sheet showing aggregate values for the percentiles. If no percentiles are listed, the default is the 95th percentile. To return only the 50th percentile value, the median, you can also use median(). Basic percentile query This query will generate a line chart with lines for the 5th, 50th, and 95th percentile. SELECT percentile(duration, 5, 50, 95) FROM PageView TIMESERIES AUTO Copy predictLinear(attribute, [,time interval]) predictLinear() is an extension of the derivative() function. It uses a similar method of least-squares linear regression to predict the future values for a dataset. The time interval is how far the query will look into the future. For example, predictLinear(attributeName, 1 hour) is a linear prediction 1 hour into the future of the query time window. Generally, predictLinear() is helpful for continuously growing values like disk space, or predictions on large trends. Since predictLinear() is a linear regression, familiarity with the dataset being queried helps to ensure accurate long-term predictions. Any dataset which grows exponentially, logarithmically, or by other nonlinear means will likely only be successful in very short-term predictions. New Relic recommends against using predictLinear in TIMESERIES queries. This is because each bucket will be making an individual prediction based on its relative timeframe within the query, meaning that such queries will not show predictions from the end of the timeseries forward. rate(function(attribute) [,time interval]) Use the rate( ) function to visualize the frequency or rate of a given query per time interval. For example, you might want to know the number of pageviews per minute over an hour-long period or the count of unique sessions on your site per hour over a day-long period. Use TIMESERIES to generate a line chart with rates mapped over time. Omit TIMESERIES to generate a billboard showing a single rate value averaged over time. Basic rate query This query will generate a line chart showing the rate of throughput for APM transactions per 10 minutes over the past 6 hours. SELECT rate(count(*), 10 minute) FROM Transaction SINCE 6 hours ago TIMESERIES Copy round(attribute) Use the round( ) function to return the rounded value of an attribute. Optionally round( ) can take a second argument, to_nearest, to round the first argument to the closest multiple of the second one. to_nearest can be fractional. SELECT round(n [, to_nearest]) Copy stddev(attribute) Use the stddev( ) function to return one standard deviation for a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. stdvar(attribute) Use the stdvar( ) function to return the standard variance for a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. sum(attribute) Use the sum( ) function to return the sum recorded values of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. uniqueCount(attribute) Use the uniqueCount( ) function to return the number of unique values recorded for an attribute over the time range specified. Tip To optimize query performance, this function returns approximate results for queries that inspect more than 256 unique values. uniques(attribute [,limit]) Use the uniques( ) function to return a list of unique values recorded for an attribute over the time range specified. When used along with the facet clause, a list of unique attribute values will be returned per each facet value. The limit parameter is optional. When it is not provided, the default limit of 1,000 unique attribute values per facet is applied. You may specify a different limit value, up to a maximum of 10,000. The uniques( ) function will return the first set of unique attribute values discovered, until the limit is reached. Therefore, if you have 5,000 unique attribute values in your data set, and the limit is set to 1,000, the operator will return the first 1,000 unique values that it discovers, regardless of their frequency. The maximum number of values that can be returned in a query result is the product of the uniques( ) limit times the facet limit. In the following query, the theoretical maximum number of values that can be returned is 5 million (5,000 x 1,000). Depending on the data set being queried, and the complexity of the query, memory protection limits may prevent a very large query from being executed. From Transaction SELECT uniques(host,5000) FACET appName LIMIT 1000 Copy Using tuple If you'd like to know the unique combinations of a handful of attributes, you can structure a query in the format SELECT uniques(tuple(x, y, ... z)) ...` to get all the unique tuples of values, to maintain their relationship. In the following query, tuple is used on index and cellName together to find uniques where those two values occur in combination. FROM NodeStatus SELECT uniques(tuple(index, cellName), 5) Copy capture(attribute, regular expression) Use the capture() to extract values from an attribute using a regular expression. Uses RE2 syntax. It takes two arguments: Attribute name Regular expression with capture syntax. Regex expressions in NRQL use Python-like syntax, r'...'. When capturing, use the RE2 named-capture syntax ...(?P<name> pattern )... to capture the contained pattern, given the specified name. Currently, only 1 capture group is supported. Please see the examples below. capture() within a SELECT clause condition The following will select the domain name of the website, removing https:// and any paths following the .com SELECT capture(pageUrl, r'https://(?P<baseUrl>.*.com)/.+') FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago Copy The following will capture only the first word of the error message. SELECT capture(errorMessage, r'(?P<firstWord>\\S+)\\s.+') FROM Transaction SINCE 1 hour ago where errorMessage is not null Copy capture() within a FACET clause condition The following will facet by the captured HTTP method. SELECT count(*) FROM Log WHERE message like '%HTTP%' FACET capture(message, r'.* \"(?P<httpMethod>[A-Z]+) .*') Copy capture() within a WHERE clause condition The following will filter the results based on Log events with message attribute that matches the regular expression where the captured job name is ExampleJob. SELECT message FROM Log WHERE capture(message, r'.*Job Failed: (?P<jobName>[A-Za-z]+),.*') = 'ExampleJob' SINCE 10 minutes ago Copy capture() with a numeric cast The following will capture sum of CPU Time from log lines. You must explicitly cast to numeric to do mathematical operations. SELECT sum(numeric(capture(message, r'.*CpuTime:\\s(?P<cpuTime>\\d+)'))) FROM Log WHERE message like '%CpuTime:%' SINCE 1 hour ago Copy Non-aggregator functions Use non-aggregator functions for non-numerical data in NRQL queries. earliest(attribute) Use the earliest( ) function to return the earliest value for an attribute over the specified time range. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If used in conjunction with a FACET it will return the most recent value for an attribute for each of the resulting facets. Get earliest country per user agent from PageView This query returns the earliest country code per each user agent from the PageView event. SELECT earliest(countryCode) FROM PageView FACET userAgentName Copy eventType() ...WHERE eventType() = 'EventNameHere'... ...FACET eventType()... Copy Use the eventType() function in a FACET clause to break out results by the selected data type or in a WHERE clause to filter results to a specific data type. This is particularly useful for targeting specific data types with the filter() and percentage() functions. Important In this context, \"event type\" refers to the types of data you can access with a NRQL query. Use eventType() in filter() function This query returns the percentage of total TransactionError results out of the total Transaction results. You can use the eventType() function to target specific types of data with the filter() function. SELECT 100 * filter(count(*), where eventType() = 'TransactionError') / filter(count(*), where eventType() = 'Transaction') FROM Transaction, TransactionError WHERE appName = 'App.Prod' TIMESERIES 2 Minutes SINCE 6 hours ago Copy Use eventType() with FACET This query displays a count of how many records each data type (Transaction and TransactionError) returns. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, TransactionError FACET eventType() TIMESERIES Copy filter(function(attribute), WHERE condition) Use the filter() function to limit the results for one of the aggregator functions in your SELECT statement. You can use filter() in conjunction with FACET or TIMESERIES. Filter is only useful when selecting multiple different aggregations such as SELECT filter(sum(x), WHERE attribute='a') AS 'A', filter(sum(x), WHERE attribute='b') AS 'B' .... Otherwise, it's better to just use the standard WHERE clause. Analyze purchases that used offer codes You could use filter() to compare the items bought in a set of transactions for those using an offer code versus those who aren't: Use the filter( ) function to limit the results for one of the aggregator functions in your SELECT statement. funnel(attribute, steps) Use the funnel() function to generate a funnel chart. It takes an attribute as its first argument. You then specify steps as WHERE clauses (with optional AS clauses for labels) separated by commas. For details and examples, see the funnels documentation. getField(attribute, field) Use the getField() function to extract a field from compound data types, such as metric data. It takes the following arguments: Metric type Supported fields summary count, total, max, min, type gauge count, total, max, min, latest, type distribution count, total, max, min, type counter count, type timeslice count, total, totalExclusive, min, and max Examples: SELECT max(getField(mySummary, count)) from Metric Copy SELECT sum(mySummary) from Metric where getField(mySummary, count) > 10 Copy histogram(attribute, ceiling [,number of buckets]) Use the histogram( ) function to generate histograms. It takes three arguments: Attribute name Maximum value of the sample range Total number of buckets (between 1 and 500, inclusive) Histogram of response times from PageView events This query results in a histogram of response times ranging up to 10 seconds over 20 buckets. SELECT histogram(duration, 10, 20) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy Prometheus histogram buckets histogram( ) accepts Prometheus histogram buckets: SELECT histogram(duration_bucket, 10, 20) FROM Metric SINCE 1 week ago Copy New Relic distribution metric histogram( ) accepts Distribution metric as an input: SELECT histogram(myDistributionMetric, 10, 20) FROM Metric SINCE 1 week ago Copy Histogram with a FACET clause Use histogram( ) with a FACET clause to generate a heatmap chart: SELECT histogram(duration) FROM PageView FACET appName SINCE 1 week ago Copy keyset() Using keyset() will allow you to see all of the attributes for a given data type over a given time range. It takes no arguments. It returns a JSON structure containing groups of string-typed keys, numeric-typed keys, boolean-typed keys, and all keys. See all attributes for a data type This query returns the attributes found for PageView events from the last day: SELECT keyset() FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago Copy latest(attribute) Use the latest( ) function to return the most recent value for an attribute over a specified time range. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If used in conjunction with a FACET it will return the most recent value for an attribute for each of the resulting facets. Get most recent country per user agent from PageView This query returns the most recent country code per each user agent from the PageView event. SELECT latest(countryCode) FROM PageView FACET userAgentName Copy Type conversion NRQL does not support \"coercion.\" This means that a float stored as a string is treated as a string and cannot be operated on by functions expecting float values. You can convert a string with a numeric value or a boolean with a string value to their numeric and boolean types with these functions: Use the numeric() function to convert a number with a string format to a numeric function. The function can be built into a query that uses math functions on query results or NRQL aggregator functions, such as average(). Use the boolean() function to convert a string value of \"true\" or \"false\" to the corresponding boolean value.",

      "body": "One way to query your New Relic data is with the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). This resource explains what NRQL is, when and how you can use it, and basic syntax rules. For more detailed information on querying, including a listing of clauses and functions and example queries, see NRQL syntax, clauses, and functions. What is NRQL? NRQL is New Relic's SQL-like query language. You can use NRQL to retrieve detailed New Relic data and get insight into your applications, hosts, and business-important activity. Reasons to use NRQL include: To answer a question for the purpose of troubleshooting or business analysis To create a new chart To make API queries of New Relic data (for example, using our NerdGraph API) NRQL is used behind the scenes to generate some New Relic charts: Some New Relic charts are built using NRQL. One way to start using NRQL is to view a chart's query and then edit it to make your own custom chart. Where can you use NRQL? You can use NRQL in these places: New Relic One query builder NerdGraph: our GraphQL-format API, which includes options for making NRQL queries one.newrelic.com > Query your data: You can run a NRQL query in New Relic One. This NRQL query shows a count of distributed tracing spans faceted by their entity names. NRQL is one of several ways to query New Relic data. For more on all query options, see Query your data. What data can you query with NRQL? NRQL allows you to query these New Relic data types: Event data from all New Relic products, including: APM events, like Transaction Browser monitoring events, like PageView Mobile monitoring events, like Mobile Infrastructure events, like ProcessSample Synthetics events, like SyntheticCheck Custom events, like those reported by the Event API Metric timeslice data (metrics reported by APM, browser, and mobile) The Metric data type (metrics reported by the Metric API and data sources that use that API) The Span data type (distributed tracing data) The Log data type (data from New Relic Logs) Tip Some data, like relationships between monitored entities, is not available via NRQL but is available using our NerdGraph API. Start using NRQL One way to start using NRQL and to understand what data you have available is to go to a NRQL interface (for example, the New Relic One query builder), type FROM, and press space. The interface will suggest available types of data: To see the attributes available for a specific data type, type FROM DATA_TYPE SELECT and press space. The interface will suggest available attributes. For example: To see the complete JSON associated with a data type, including all of its attributes, use the keyset() attribute. For example: FROM Transaction SELECT keyset() Copy NRQL is used behind the scenes to build some New Relic charts and dashboards. One way to learn NRQL is to find one of these NRQL-generated charts and start playing with the NRQL to create new, customized queries and charts: Charts built with NRQL will have View query as an option. You can then edit and customize that query to see how your changes affect the resulting visualization. Important To explore your data without having to use NRQL, use the data explorer. Learn more about querying data in New Relic. NRQL query examples Here's an example NRQL query of Transaction data, which is reported by APM. FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) FACET appName TIMESERIES auto Copy This would generate a chart that looks like: Here are some more query examples: Basic NRQL query of browser data Here's a NRQL query of PageView data from browser monitoring. SELECT uniqueCount(user) FROM PageView WHERE userAgentOS = 'Mac' FACET countryCode SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 20 Copy Attribute name with a space in it If a custom attribute name has a space in it, use backticks around the attribute name: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET `Logged-in user` Copy Querying multiple data sources To return data from two data sources, separate their data types with a comma. For example, this query returns a count of all APM transactions and browser events over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, PageView SINCE 3 days ago Copy Query returning multiple columns To return multiple columns from a dataset, separate the aggregator arguments with a comma: SELECT function(attribute), function(attribute) ... FROM ... Copy This query returns the minimum, average, and maximum duration for browser monitoring PageView events over the last week: SELECT min(duration), max(duration), average(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy See more NRQL query examples. NRQL syntax The syntax of a NRQL query is similar to standard SQL queries. Here is a breakdown of the structure of a NRQL query: SELECT function(attribute) [AS 'label'][, ...] FROM data type [WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...]][AS 'label'][, ...] [FACET attribute | function(attribute)] [LIMIT number] [SINCE time] [UNTIL time] [WITH TIMEZONE timezone] [COMPARE WITH time] [TIMESERIES time] Copy Basic rules include: NRQL condition Details Required values The SELECT statement and FROM clause are required. All other clauses are optional. You can start your query with either SELECT or FROM. Query string size The query string must be less than 4 KB. Case sensitivity The data type names and attribute names are case sensitive. NRQL clauses and functions are not case sensitive. Syntax for strings NRQL uses single quotes to designate strings. For example: ... where traceId = '030a573f0df02c57' Copy Attribute names with spaces Use backticks `` to quote a custom attribute name that has a space in it. For example: ... FACET `Logged-in user` Copy Data type coercion Insights does not support data type \"coercion.\" For more information, see Data type conversion. Use of math functions Basic and advanced math functions are supported in the SELECT statement. JOIN functions NRQL does not have the equivalent of the SQL JOIN function, but you can simulate a JOIN with custom attributes. Read more about NRQL syntax and functions.",

      "body": "NRQL is a query language you can use to query the New Relic database. This document explains NRQL syntax, clauses, components, and functions. Syntax This document is a reference for the functions and clauses used in a NRQL query. Other resources for understanding NRQL: Intro to NRQL: explains what NRQL is used for, what data you can query with it, and basic NRQL syntax Examine NRQL queries used to build New Relic charts Learn how to query the Metric data type Simulate SQL JOIN functions Use funnels to evaluate a series of related data Format NRQL for querying with the Event API Query components Every NRQL query will begin with a SELECT statement or a FROM clause. All other clauses are optional. The clause definitions below also contain example NRQL queries. Required clauses Required: SELECT statement SELECT attribute ... Copy SELECT function(attribute) ... Copy The SELECT specifies what portion of a data type you want to query by specifying an attribute or a function. It's followed by one or more arguments separated by commas. In each argument you can: Get the values of all available attributes by using * as a wildcard. For example: SELECT * from Transaction. Get values associated with a specified attribute or multiple attributes specified in a comma separated list. Get aggregated values from specified attributes by selecting an aggregator function. Label the results returned in each argument with the AS clause. You can also use SELECT with basic math functions. Avg response time since last week This query returns the average response time since last week. SELECT average(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy Required: FROM clause SELECT ... FROM data type ... Copy Use the FROM clause to specify the data type you wish to query. You can start your query with FROM or with SELECT. You can merge values for the same attributes across multiple data types in a comma separated list. Query one data type This query returns the count of all APM transactions over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction SINCE 3 days ago Copy Query multiple data types This query returns the count of all APM transactions and browser events over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, PageView SINCE 3 days ago Copy Optional clauses AS clause SELECT ... AS 'label' ... Copy Use the AS clause to label an attribute, aggregator, step in a funnel, or the result of a math function with a string delimited by single quotes. The label is used in the resulting chart. Query using math function and AS This query returns the number of page views per session: SELECT count(*)/uniqueCount(session) AS 'Pageviews per Session' FROM PageView Copy Query using funnel and AS This query returns a count of people who have visited both the main page and the careers page of a site over the past week: SELECT funnel(SESSION, WHERE name='Controller/about/main' AS 'Step 1', WHERE name = 'Controller/about/careers' AS 'Step 2') FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy COMPARE WITH clause SELECT ... (SINCE or UNTIL) (integer units) AGO COMPARE WITH (integer units) AGO ... Copy Use the COMPARE WITH clause to compare the values for two different time ranges. COMPARE WITH requires a SINCE or UNTIL statement. The time specified by COMPARE WITH is relative to the time specified by SINCE or UNTIL. For example, SINCE 1 day ago COMPARE WITH 1 day ago compares yesterday with the day before. The time range for theCOMPARE WITH value is always the same as that specified by SINCE or UNTIL. For example, SINCE 2 hours ago COMPARE WITH 4 hours ago might compare 3:00pm through 5:00pm against 11:00am through 1:00pm. COMPARE WITH can be formatted as either a line chart or a billboard: With TIMESERIES, COMPARE WITH creates a line chart with the comparison mapped over time. Without TIMESERIES, COMPARE WITH generates a billboard with the current value and the percent change from the COMPARE WITH value. Example: This query returns data as a line chart showing the 95th percentile for the past hour compared to the same range one week ago. First as a single value, then as a line chart. SELECT percentile(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago COMPARE WITH 1 week AGO SELECT percentile(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago COMPARE WITH 1 week AGO TIMESERIES AUTO Copy EXTRAPOLATE clause You can use this clause with these data types: Transaction TransactionError Custom events reported via APM agent APIs The purpose of EXTRAPOLATE is to mathematically compensate for the effects of APM agent sampling of event data so that query results more closely represent the total activity in your system. This clause will be useful when a APM agent reports so many events that it often passes its harvest cycle reporting limits. When that occurs, the agent begins to sample events. When EXTRAPOLATE is used in a NRQL query that supports its use, the ratio between the reported events and the total events is used to extrapolate a close approximation of the total unsampled data. When it is used in a NRQL query that doesn’t support its use or that hasn’t used sampled data, it has no effect. Important Note that EXTRAPOLATE is most useful for homogenous data (like throughput or error rate). It's not effective when attempting to extrapolate a count of distinct things (like uniqueCount() or uniques()). This clause works only with NRQL queries that use one of the following aggregator functions: apdex average count histogram sum percentage (if function it takes as an argument supports EXTRAPOLATE) rate (if function it takes as an argument supports EXTRAPOLATE) stddev Example of extrapolating throughput A query that will show the extrapolated throughput of a service named interestingApplication. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction WHERE appName='interestingApplication' SINCE 60 minutes ago EXTRAPOLATE Copy Example of extrapolating throughput as a time series A query that will show the extrapolated throughput of a service named interestingApplication by transaction name, displayed as a time series. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction WHERE appName='interestingApplication' SINCE 60 minutes ago FACET name TIMESERIES 1 minute EXTRAPOLATE Copy FACET clause SELECT ... FACET attribute ... Copy Use FACET to separate and group your results by attribute values. For example, you could FACET your PageView data by deviceType to figure out what percentage of your traffic comes from mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. Use the LIMIT clause to specify how many facets appear (default is 10). For more complex grouping, use FACET CASES. FACET clauses support up to five attributes, separated by commas. The facets are sorted in descending order by the first field you provide in the SELECT clause. If you are faceting on attributes with more than 2,000 unique values, a subset of facet values is selected and sorted according to the query type. When selecting min(), max(), or count(), FACET uses those functions to determine how facets are picked and sorted. When selecting any other function, FACET uses the frequency of the attribute you are faceting on to determine how facets are picked and sorted. Faceted query using count() This query shows cities with the highest pageview counts. This query uses the total number of pageviews per city to determine how facets are picked and ordered. SELECT count(*) FROM PageView FACET city Copy Faceted query using uniqueCount() This query shows the cities that access the highest number of unique URLs. This query uses the total number of times a particular city appears in the results to determine how facets are picked and ordered. SELECT uniqueCount(pageUrl) FROM PageView FACET city Copy Grouping results across time Advanced segmentation and cohort analysis allow you to facet on bucket functions to more effectively break out your data. Cohort analysis is a way to group results together based on timestamps. You can separate them into buckets that cover a specified range of dates and times. FACET ... AS clause Use FACET ... AS to name facets using the AS keyword in queries. This clause is helpful for adding clearer or simplified names for facets in your results. It can also be used to rename facets in nested aggregation queries. FACET ... AS queries will change the facet names in results (when they appear as headers in tables, for example), but not the actual facet names themselves. FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) FACET response.headers.contentType AS 'content type' Copy FACET CASES clause SELECT ... FACET CASES ( WHERE attribute operator value, WHERE attribute operator value, ... ) ... Copy Use FACET CASES to break out your data by more complex conditions than possible with FACET. Separate multiple conditions with a comma ,. For example, you could query your PageView data and FACET CASES into categories like less than 1 second, from 1 to 10 seconds, and greater than 10 seconds. You can combine multiple attributes within your cases, and label the cases with the AS selector. Data points will be added to at most one facet case, the first facet case that they match. You may also use a time function with your attribute, and you can use the OR operator to facet results that don't match any of your specified cases. Basic usage with WHERE SELECT count(*) FROM PageView FACET CASES (WHERE duration < 1, WHERE duration > 1 and duration < 10, WHERE duration > 10) Copy Group based on multiple attributes This example groups results into one bucket where the transaction name contains login, and another where the URL contains login and a custom attribute indicates that the user was a paid user: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid') Copy Label groups with AS This example uses the AS selector to give your results a human-readable name: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%' AS 'Total Logins', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid' AS 'Feature Visits from Paid Users') Copy Facet non-matching data with OR This example uses the OR operator to facet results that didn't match any of your cases: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid') OR name Copy FACET ... ORDER BY clause In NRQL, the default is for the first aggregation in the SELECT clause to guide the selection of facets in a query. FACET ... ORDER BY allows you to override this default behavior by adding an aggregate function with the ORDER BY modifier to specify how facets are selected. Specifically, the clause will override the priority by which facets are chosen to be in the final result before being limited by the LIMIT clause. This clause can be used in querying but not for alerts or streaming. This example shows how to use FACET ... ORDER BY to find the average durations of app transactions, showing the top 10 (default limit) highest durations by apps which have the highest response size. In this case, if FACET ... ORDER BY is not used, the query results will instead show the top 10 by highest durations, with response size being irrelevant to the app selection. FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) TIMESERIES FACET appName ORDER BY max(responseSize) Copy Tip Because the operations are performed before the LIMIT clause is applied, FACET ... ORDER BY does not impact the sort of the final query results, which will be particularly noticeable in the results for non-timeseries queries. Important The ORDER BY modifier in this case works differently than the ORDER BY clause. When parsing queries that follow the format FACET attribute1 ORDER BY attribute2, New Relic will read these as FACET ... ORDER BY queries, but only if ORDER BY appears immediately after FACET. Otherwise ORDER BY will be interpreted by New Relic as a clause. LIMIT clause SELECT ... LIMIT count ... Copy Use the LIMIT clause to control the maximum number of facet values returned by FACET queries or the maximum number of items returned by SELECT * queries. This clause takes a single integer value as an argument. If the LIMIT clause is not specified, or no value is provided, the limit defaults to 10 for FACET queries and 100 in the case of SELECT * queries. The maximum allowed value for the LIMIT clause is 2,000. Query using LIMIT This query shows the top 20 countries by session count and provides 95th percentile of response time for each country for Windows users only. SELECT uniqueCount(session), percentile(duration, 95) FROM PageView WHERE userAgentOS = 'Windows' FACET countryCode LIMIT 20 SINCE YESTERDAY Copy OFFSET clause SELECT ... LIMIT count OFFSET count ... Copy Use the OFFSET clause with LIMIT to control the portion of rows returned by SELECT * or SELECT column queries. Like the LIMIT clause, OFFSET takes a single integer value as an argument. OFFSET sets the number of rows to be skipped before the selected rows of your query are returned. This is constrained by LIMIT. OFFSET rows are skipped starting from the most recent record. For example, the query SELECT interestingValue FROM Minute_Report LIMIT 5 OFFSET 1 returns the last 5 values from Minute_Report except for the most recent one. ORDER BY clause The ORDER BY clause allows you to specify how you want to sort your query results in queries that select event attributes by row. This query orders transactions by duration. FROM Transaction SELECT appName, duration ORDER BY duration Copy The default sort order is ascending, but this can be changed by adding the ASC or DESC modifiers. SHOW EVENT TYPES clause SHOW EVENT TYPES... Copy SHOW EVENT TYPES will return a list of all the data types present in your account for a specific time range. It is used as the first clause in a query instead of SELECT. Important In this context, \"event types\" refers to the data types you can access with a NRQL query. Data types in the last day This query will return all the data types present over the past day: SHOW EVENT TYPES SINCE 1 day ago Copy SINCE clause SELECT ... SINCE [numerical units AGO | phrase] ... Copy The default value is 1 hour ago. Use the SINCE clause to define the beginning of a time range for the returned data. When using NRQL, you can set a UTC timestamp or relative time range. You can specify a timezone for the query but not for the results. NRQL results are based on your system time. SLIDE BY clause The SLIDE BY clause supports a feature known as sliding windows. With sliding windows,SLIDE BY data is gathered into \"windows\" of time that overlap with each other. These windows can help to smooth out line graphs with a lot of variation in cases where the rolling aggregate (such as a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. To use SLIDE BY, place it in a query after the TIMESERIES clause. For example, this query pulls data in 5-minute windows with a 1-minute SLIDE BY interval, meaning that each window lasts 5 minutes, but window 1 starts at 0 minutes, window 2 starts at 1 minute, window 3 starts at 2 minutes, and so on. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY 1 minute Copy To learn more about how and when you can use SLIDE BY, see Create smoother charts with sliding windows. Use SLIDE BY with MAX or AUTO interval You can use sliding windows in combination with MAX or AUTO. However, MAX or AUTO may not be placed between TIMESERIES and SLIDE BY. This query will automatically decide a SLIDE BY window interval. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY AUTO Copy This query will set the SLIDE BY window to the maximum interval granularity. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY MAX Copy Important The SLIDE BY value as determined by AUTO or MAX can produce a step interval greater than the window size, which can cause gaps and unexpected results. TIMESERIES clause SELECT ... TIMESERIES integer units ... Copy Use the TIMESERIES clause to return data as a time series broken out by a specified period of time. Since TIMESERIES is used to trigger certain charts, there is no default value. To indicate the time range, use integer units. For example: TIMESERIES 1 minute TIMESERIES 30 minutes TIMESERIES 1 hour TIMESERIES 30 seconds TIMESERIES can be combined with arguments such as MAX, AUTO, and SLIDE BY to further tailor query results, as shown in the examples below. Important For functions such as average( ) or percentile( ), a large aggregation window can have a significant smoothing effect on outliers. This is true whether or not the query makes use of sliding windows. Use a set interval The value provided indicates the units used to break out the graph. For example, to present a one-day graph showing 30 minute increments: SELECT ... SINCE 1 day AGO TIMESERIES 30 minutes Copy Use an automatically set interval TIMESERIES can also be set to AUTO, which will divide your graph into a reasonable number of divisions. For example, a daily chart will be divided into 30 minute intervals and a weekly chart will be divided into 6 hour intervals. This query returns data as a line chart showing the 50th and 90th percentile of client-side transaction time for one week with a data point every 6 hours. SELECT average(duration), percentile(duration, 50, 90) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week AGO TIMESERIES AUTO Copy Use MAX interval You can set TIMESERIES to MAX, which will automatically adjust your time window to the maximum number of intervals allowed for a given time period. This allows you to update your time windows without having to manually update your TIMESERIES buckets and ensures your time window is being split into the peak number of intervals allowed. The maximum number of TIMESERIES buckets that will be returned is 366. For example, the following query creates 4-minute intervals, which is the ceiling for a daily chart. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction since 1 day ago TIMESERIES MAX Copy UNTIL clause SELECT ... UNTIL integer units AGO ... Copy The default value is NOW. Only use UNTIL to specify an end point other than the default. Use the UNTIL clause to define the end of a time range across which to return data. Once a time range has been specified, the data will be preserved and can be reviewed after the time range has ended. See Use the time picker to adjust time settings for detailed information and examples. WHERE clause Use the WHERE clause to filter results. NRQL returns the results that fulfill the condition(s) you specify in the clause. SELECT function(attribute) ... WHERE attribute [operator 'value' | IN ('value' [, 'value]) | IS [NOT] NULL ] [AND|OR ...] ... Copy If you specify more than one condition, separate the conditions by the operators AND or OR. If you want to simulate a SQL join, use custom attributes in a WHERE or FACET clause. Operators that the WHERE clause accepts Description =, !=, <, <=, >, >= NRQL accepts standard comparison operators. Example: state = 'WA' AND Used to define an intersection of two conditions. OR Used to define a union of two conditions. IS NULL Determines if an attribute has a null value. IS NOT NULL Determines if an attribute does not have a null value. IN Determines if the string value of an attribute is in a specified set. Using this method yields better performance than stringing together multiple WHERE clauses. Example: animalType IN ('cat', 'dog', 'fish') NOT IN Determines if the string value of an attribute is not in a specified set. Using this method yields better performance than stringing together multiple WHERE clauses. Values must be in parentheses, separated by commas. For example: SELECT * FROM PageView WHERE countryCode NOT IN ('CA', 'WA') Copy LIKE Determines if an attribute contains a specified sub-string. The string argument for the LIKE operator accepts the percent sign (%) as a wildcard anywhere in the string. If the substring does not begin or end the string you are matching against, the wildcard must begin or end the string. Examples: userAgentName LIKE 'IE%' IE IE Mobile userAgentName LIKE 'o%a%' Opera Opera Mini userAgentName LIKE 'o%a' Opera userAgentName LIKE '%o%a%' Opera Opera Mini Mozilla Gecko NOT LIKE Determines if an attribute does not contain a specified sub-string. RLIKE Determines if an attribute contains a specified Regex sub-string. Uses RE2 syntax. Examples: appName RLIKE r'z.*|q.*'' hostname RLIKE r'ip-10-351-[0-2]?[0-9]-.*' z-app q-app ip-10-351-19-237 ip-10-351-2-41 ip-10-351-24-238 ip-10-351-14-15 Important Regex defaults to full-string matching, therefore ^ and $ are implicit and you do not need to add them. NOT RLIKE Determines if an attribute does not contain a specified Regex sub-string. Uses RE2 syntax. Example query with three conditions This query returns the browser response time for pages with checkout in the URL for Safari users in the United States and Canada over the past 24 hours. SELECT histogram(duration, 50, 20) FROM PageView WHERE countryCode IN ('CA', 'US') AND userAgentName='Safari' AND pageUrl LIKE '%checkout%' SINCE 1 day ago Copy WITH METRIC_FORMAT clause For information on querying metric data, see Query metrics. WITH TIMEZONE clause SELECT ... WITH TIMEZONE (selected zone) ... Copy By default, query results are displayed in the timezone of the browser you're using. Use the WITH TIMEZONE clause to select a time zone for a date or time in the query that hasn't already had a time zone specified for it. For example, the query clause SINCE Monday UNTIL Tuesday WITH TIMEZONE 'America/New_York' will return data recorded from Monday at midnight, Eastern Standard Time, until midnight Tuesday, Eastern Standard Time.

Query metric data Metric data is more complex than other types of data. There are specific tips for querying it well. We have two types of metric data, each with their own query guidelines: Query dimensional metrics, which are reported by our Metric API and by some of our tools that use that API, like our Telemetry SDKs and our open-source telemetry integrations (OpenTelemetry, Kamon, Micrometer, more). Query metric timeslice data, which is our original metric data type reported by our APM, mobile monitoring, and browser monitoring. For more on understanding these data types, see Metric data types. Functions In this section we explain NRQL functions, both aggregator functions and non-aggregator functions. Aggregator functions You can use aggregator functions to filter and aggregate data. Some tips for using these: See New Relic University tutorials for Filter queries, Apdex queries, and Percentile queries. Or, go to the full online course Writing NRQL queries. If you're using an aggregator function multiple times in the same query (e.g., SELECT median(one_metric</var>), median(another_metric)), it can cause problems in displaying results. To solve this, use the AS function. For example: SELECT median(one_metric) as 'med-a', median(another_metric) as 'med-b' Data type \"coercion\" is not supported. Read about available type conversion functions. For how to display results over time, see Group results over time. Examples: SELECT histogram(duration, 10, 20) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy aggregationendtime() Use the aggregationendtime() function to return the time of the relevant aggregation. More specifically, for a given aggregate, the aggregationendtime() function provides the timestamp of the end of the time period of that aggregation. For example, in a timeseries query, for a data point that encompasses an hour’s worth of data, the function would return the timestamp of the end of that hour period. apdex(attribute, t: ) Use the apdex function to return an Apdex score for a single transaction or for all your transactions. The attribute can be any attribute based on response time, such as duration or backendDuration. The t: argument defines an Apdex T threshold in seconds. The Apdex score returned by the apdex( ) function is based only on execution time. It does not account for APM errors. If a transaction includes an error but completes in Apdex T or less, that transaction will be rated satisfying by the apdex ( ) function. Get Apdex for specific customers If you have defined custom attributes, you can filter based on those attributes. For example, you could monitor the Apdex for a particularly important customer: SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.4) FROM Transaction WHERE customerName='ReallyImportantCustomer' SINCE 1 day ago Copy Get Apdex for specific transaction Use the name attribute to return a score for a specific transaction, or return an overall Apdex by omitting name. This query returns an Apdex score for the Controller/notes/index transaction over the last hour: The apdex function returns an Apdex score that measures user satisfaction with your site. Arguments are a response time attribute and an Apdex T threshold in seconds. SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.5) from Transaction WHERE name='Controller/notes/index' SINCE 1 hour ago Copy Get overall Apdex for your app This example query returns an overall Apdex for the application over the last three weeks: SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.08) FROM Transaction SINCE 3 week ago Copy average(attribute) Use the average( ) function to return the average value for an attribute. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. buckets(attribute, ceiling [,number of buckets]) Use the buckets() function to aggregate data split up by a FACET clause into buckets based on ranges. You can bucket by any attribute that is stored as a numerical value in the New Relic database. It takes three arguments: Attribute name Maximum value of the sample range. Any outliers will appear in the final bucket. Total number of buckets For more information and examples, see Split your data into buckets. bucketPercentile(attribute) The bucketPercentile( ) function is the NRQL equivalent of the histogram_quantile function in Prometheus. It is intended to be used with dimensional metric data. Instead of the quantile, New Relic returns the percentile, which is the quantile * 100. Use the bucketPercentile( ) function to calculate the quantile from the histogram data in a Prometheus format. It takes the bucket name as an argument and reports percentiles along the bucket's boundaries: SELECT bucketPercentile(duration_bucket) FROM Metric SINCE 1 day ago Copy Optionally, you can add percentile specifications as an argument: SELECT bucketPercentile(duration_bucket, 50, 75, 90) FROM Metric SINCE 1 day ago Copy Because multiple metrics are used to make up Prometheus histogram data, you must query for specific Prometheus metrics in terms of the associated <basename>. For example, to compute percentiles from a Prometheus histogram, with the <basename> prometheus_http_request_duration_seconds using NRQL, use bucketPercentile(prometheus_http_request_duration_seconds_bucket, 50). Note how _ bucket is added to the end of the <basename> as a suffix. See the Prometheus.io documentation for more information. cardinality(attribute) Use the cardinality( ) function to obtain the number of combinations of all the dimensions (attributes) on a metric. It takes three arguments, all optional: Metric name: if present, cardinality( ) only computes the metric specified. Include: if present, the include list restricts the cardinality computation to those attributes. Exclude: if present, the exclude list causes those attributes to be ignored in the cardinality computation. SELECT cardinality(metric_name, include:{attribute_list}, exclude:{attribute_list}) Copy count(*) Use the count( ) function to return a count of available records. It takes a single argument; either *, an attribute, or a constant value. Currently, it follows typical SQL behavior and counts all records that have values for its argument. Since count(*) does not name a specific attribute, the results will be formatted in the default \"humanize\" format. derivative(attribute [,time interval]) derivative() finds the rate of change for a given dataset. The rate of change is calculated using a linear least-squares regression to approximate the derivative. Since this calculation requires comparing more than one datapoint, if only one datapoint is included in the evaluation range, the calculation is indeterminate and won't work, resulting in a null value. The time interval is the period for which the rate of change is calculated. For example, derivative(attributeName, 1 minute) will return the rate of change per minute. dimensions(include: {attributes}, exclude: {attributes}) Use the dimensions( ) function to return all the dimensional values on a data type. You can explicitly include or exclude specific attributes using the optional arguments: Include: if present, the include list limits dimensions( ) to those attributes. Exclude: if present, the dimensions( ) calculation ignores those attributes. FROM Metric SELECT count(node_filesystem_size) TIMESERIES FACET dimensions() Copy When used with a FACET clause, dimensions( ) produces a unique timeseries for all facets available on the event type, similar to how Prometheus behaves with non-aggregated queries. latestrate(attribute, time interval) Use the latestrate( ) function to return the rate of change of a value based on the last 2 data points. It takes the attribute in question as the first argument and the unit of time for the resulting rate as the second argument. The function returns a result in units of change in attribute/time interval. This function can be useful to provide the most recent rate of change for an attribute in order to see leading-edge trends. Get the most recent rate of change of PageView Duration This query returns the rate of change of duration based on the last 2 data points. It will be returned in units of duration/second because of the 1 SECOND argument. SELECT latestrate(duration, 1 SECOND) FROM PageView Copy max(attribute) Use the max( ) function to return the maximum recorded value of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. median(attribute) Use the median( ) function to return an attribute's median, or 50th percentile. For more information about percentile queries, see percentile(). Tip The median( ) query is only available when using the query builder. Median query This query will generate a line chart for the median value. SELECT median(duration) FROM PageView TIMESERIES AUTO Copy min(attribute) Use the min( ) function to return the minimum recorded value of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. minuteOf(attribute) Use the minuteOf() function to extract only the minute portion (i.e. 0-59) of an attribute holding a valid timestamp value. mod(attribute, divisor) Use the mod( ) function to return the floor modulus after dividing the value of the provided numeric attribute (the first argument, or dividend) by a numeric value (the second argument, or divisor). This modulo operation can be used within a WHERE clause condition to filter to an arbitrary subset of results or within a FACET clause as a way to subdivide the result set. mod() within a WHERE clause condition FROM Transaction SELECT * WHERE mod(port, 2) = 1 Copy mod() within a FACET clause FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT uniques(hostId, 10000) SINCE 1 day AGO FACET mod(hostId, 10) Copy percentage(function(attribute), WHERE condition) Use the percentage( ) function to return the percentage of a target data set that matches some condition. The first argument requires an aggregator function against the desired attribute. Use exactly two arguments (arguments after the first two will be ignored). If the attribute is not numeric, this function returns a value of 100%. percentile(attribute [, percentile [, ...]]) Use the percentile( ) function to return an attribute's approximate value at a given percentile. It requires an attribute and can take any number of arguments representing percentile points. The percentile() function enables percentiles to displays with up to three digits after the decimal point, providing greater precision. Percentile thresholds may be specified as decimal values, but be aware that for most data sets, percentiles closer than 0.1 from each other will not be resolved. Percentile display examples Use TIMESERIES to generate a line chart with percentiles mapped over time. Omit TIMESERIES to generate a billboard and attribute sheet showing aggregate values for the percentiles. If no percentiles are listed, the default is the 95th percentile. To return only the 50th percentile value, the median, you can also use median(). Basic percentile query This query will generate a line chart with lines for the 5th, 50th, and 95th percentile. SELECT percentile(duration, 5, 50, 95) FROM PageView TIMESERIES AUTO Copy predictLinear(attribute, [,time interval]) predictLinear() is an extension of the derivative() function. It uses a similar method of least-squares linear regression to predict the future values for a dataset. The time interval is how far the query will look into the future. For example, predictLinear(attributeName, 1 hour) is a linear prediction 1 hour into the future of the query time window. Generally, predictLinear() is helpful for continuously growing values like disk space, or predictions on large trends. Since predictLinear() is a linear regression, familiarity with the dataset being queried helps to ensure accurate long-term predictions. Any dataset which grows exponentially, logarithmically, or by other nonlinear means will likely only be successful in very short-term predictions. New Relic recommends against using predictLinear in TIMESERIES queries. This is because each bucket will be making an individual prediction based on its relative timeframe within the query, meaning that such queries will not show predictions from the end of the timeseries forward. rate(function(attribute) [,time interval]) Use the rate( ) function to visualize the frequency or rate of a given query per time interval. For example, you might want to know the number of pageviews per minute over an hour-long period or the count of unique sessions on your site per hour over a day-long period. Use TIMESERIES to generate a line chart with rates mapped over time. Omit TIMESERIES to generate a billboard showing a single rate value averaged over time. Basic rate query This query will generate a line chart showing the rate of throughput for APM transactions per 10 minutes over the past 6 hours. SELECT rate(count(*), 10 minute) FROM Transaction SINCE 6 hours ago TIMESERIES Copy round(attribute) Use the round( ) function to return the rounded value of an attribute. Optionally round( ) can take a second argument, to_nearest, to round the first argument to the closest multiple of the second one. to_nearest can be fractional. SELECT round(n [, to_nearest]) Copy stddev(attribute) Use the stddev( ) function to return one standard deviation for a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. stdvar(attribute) Use the stdvar( ) function to return the standard variance for a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. sum(attribute) Use the sum( ) function to return the sum recorded values of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. uniqueCount(attribute) Use the uniqueCount( ) function to return the number of unique values recorded for an attribute over the time range specified. Tip To optimize query performance, this function returns approximate results for queries that inspect more than 256 unique values. uniques(attribute [,limit]) Use the uniques( ) function to return a list of unique values recorded for an attribute over the time range specified. When used along with the facet clause, a list of unique attribute values will be returned per each facet value. The limit parameter is optional. When it is not provided, the default limit of 1,000 unique attribute values per facet is applied. You may specify a different limit value, up to a maximum of 10,000. The uniques( ) function will return the first set of unique attribute values discovered, until the limit is reached. Therefore, if you have 5,000 unique attribute values in your data set, and the limit is set to 1,000, the operator will return the first 1,000 unique values that it discovers, regardless of their frequency. The maximum number of values that can be returned in a query result is the product of the uniques( ) limit times the facet limit. In the following query, the theoretical maximum number of values that can be returned is 5 million (5,000 x 1,000). Depending on the data set being queried, and the complexity of the query, memory protection limits may prevent a very large query from being executed. From Transaction SELECT uniques(host,5000) FACET appName LIMIT 1000 Copy Using tuple If you'd like to know the unique combinations of a handful of attributes, you can structure a query in the format SELECT uniques(tuple(x, y, ... z)) ...` to get all the unique tuples of values, to maintain their relationship. In the following query, tuple is used on index and cellName together to find uniques where those two values occur in combination. FROM NodeStatus SELECT uniques(tuple(index, cellName), 5) Copy capture(attribute, regular expression) Use the capture() to extract values from an attribute using a regular expression. Uses RE2 syntax. It takes two arguments: Attribute name Regular expression with capture syntax. Regex expressions in NRQL use Python-like syntax, r'...'. When capturing, use the RE2 named-capture syntax ...(?P<name> pattern )... to capture the contained pattern, given the specified name. Currently, only 1 capture group is supported. Please see the examples below. capture() within a SELECT clause condition The following will select the domain name of the website, removing https:// and any paths following the .com SELECT capture(pageUrl, r'https://(?P<baseUrl>.*.com)/.+') FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago Copy The following will capture only the first word of the error message. SELECT capture(errorMessage, r'(?P<firstWord>\\S+)\\s.+') FROM Transaction SINCE 1 hour ago where errorMessage is not null Copy capture() within a FACET clause condition The following will facet by the captured HTTP method. SELECT count(*) FROM Log WHERE message like '%HTTP%' FACET capture(message, r'.* \"(?P<httpMethod>[A-Z]+) .*') Copy capture() within a WHERE clause condition The following will filter the results based on Log events with message attribute that matches the regular expression where the captured job name is ExampleJob. SELECT message FROM Log WHERE capture(message, r'.*Job Failed: (?P<jobName>[A-Za-z]+),.*') = 'ExampleJob' SINCE 10 minutes ago Copy capture() with a numeric cast The following will capture sum of CPU Time from log lines. You must explicitly cast to numeric to do mathematical operations. SELECT sum(numeric(capture(message, r'.*CpuTime:\\s(?P<cpuTime>\\d+)'))) FROM Log WHERE message like '%CpuTime:%' SINCE 1 hour ago Copy Non-aggregator functions Use non-aggregator functions for non-numerical data in NRQL queries. earliest(attribute) Use the earliest( ) function to return the earliest value for an attribute over the specified time range. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If used in conjunction with a FACET it will return the most recent value for an attribute for each of the resulting facets. Get earliest country per user agent from PageView This query returns the earliest country code per each user agent from the PageView event. SELECT earliest(countryCode) FROM PageView FACET userAgentName Copy eventType() ...WHERE eventType() = 'EventNameHere'... ...FACET eventType()... Copy Use the eventType() function in a FACET clause to break out results by the selected data type or in a WHERE clause to filter results to a specific data type. This is particularly useful for targeting specific data types with the filter() and percentage() functions. Important In this context, \"event type\" refers to the types of data you can access with a NRQL query. Use eventType() in filter() function This query returns the percentage of total TransactionError results out of the total Transaction results. You can use the eventType() function to target specific types of data with the filter() function. SELECT 100 * filter(count(*), where eventType() = 'TransactionError') / filter(count(*), where eventType() = 'Transaction') FROM Transaction, TransactionError WHERE appName = 'App.Prod' TIMESERIES 2 Minutes SINCE 6 hours ago Copy Use eventType() with FACET This query displays a count of how many records each data type (Transaction and TransactionError) returns. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, TransactionError FACET eventType() TIMESERIES Copy filter(function(attribute), WHERE condition) Use the filter() function to limit the results for one of the aggregator functions in your SELECT statement. You can use filter() in conjunction with FACET or TIMESERIES. Filter is only useful when selecting multiple different aggregations such as SELECT filter(sum(x), WHERE attribute='a') AS 'A', filter(sum(x), WHERE attribute='b') AS 'B' .... Otherwise, it's better to just use the standard WHERE clause. Analyze purchases that used offer codes You could use filter() to compare the items bought in a set of transactions for those using an offer code versus those who aren't: Use the filter( ) function to limit the results for one of the aggregator functions in your SELECT statement. funnel(attribute, steps) Use the funnel() function to generate a funnel chart. It takes an attribute as its first argument. You then specify steps as WHERE clauses (with optional AS clauses for labels) separated by commas. For details and examples, see the funnels documentation. getField(attribute, field) Use the getField() function to extract a field from compound data types, such as metric data. It takes the following arguments: Metric type Supported fields summary count, total, max, min, type gauge count, total, max, min, latest, type distribution count, total, max, min, type counter count, type timeslice count, total, totalExclusive, min, and max Examples: SELECT max(getField(mySummary, count)) from Metric Copy SELECT sum(mySummary) from Metric where getField(mySummary, count) > 10 Copy histogram(attribute, ceiling [,number of buckets]) Use the histogram( ) function to generate histograms. It takes three arguments: Attribute name Maximum value of the sample range Total number of buckets (between 1 and 500, inclusive) Histogram of response times from PageView events This query results in a histogram of response times ranging up to 10 seconds over 20 buckets. SELECT histogram(duration, 10, 20) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy Prometheus histogram buckets histogram( ) accepts Prometheus histogram buckets: SELECT histogram(duration_bucket, 10, 20) FROM Metric SINCE 1 week ago Copy New Relic distribution metric histogram( ) accepts Distribution metric as an input: SELECT histogram(myDistributionMetric, 10, 20) FROM Metric SINCE 1 week ago Copy Histogram with a FACET clause Use histogram( ) with a FACET clause to generate a heatmap chart: SELECT histogram(duration) FROM PageView FACET appName SINCE 1 week ago Copy keyset() Using keyset() will allow you to see all of the attributes for a given data type over a given time range. It takes no arguments. It returns a JSON structure containing groups of string-typed keys, numeric-typed keys, boolean-typed keys, and all keys. See all attributes for a data type This query returns the attributes found for PageView events from the last day: SELECT keyset() FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago Copy latest(attribute) Use the latest( ) function to return the most recent value for an attribute over a specified time range. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If used in conjunction with a FACET it will return the most recent value for an attribute for each of the resulting facets. Get most recent country per user agent from PageView This query returns the most recent country code per each user agent from the PageView event. SELECT latest(countryCode) FROM PageView FACET userAgentName Copy Type conversion NRQL does not support \"coercion.\" This means that a float stored as a string is treated as a string and cannot be operated on by functions expecting float values. You can convert a string with a numeric value or a boolean with a string value to their numeric and boolean types with these functions: Use the numeric() function to convert a number with a string format to a numeric function. The function can be built into a query that uses math functions on query results or NRQL aggregator functions, such as average(). Use the boolean() function to convert a string value of \"true\" or \"false\" to the corresponding boolean value.",

      "body": "One way to query your New Relic data is with the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). This resource explains what NRQL is, when and how you can use it, and basic syntax rules. For more detailed information on querying, including a listing of clauses and functions and example queries, see NRQL syntax, clauses, and functions. What is NRQL? NRQL is New Relic's SQL-like query language. You can use NRQL to retrieve detailed New Relic data and get insight into your applications, hosts, and business-important activity. Reasons to use NRQL include: To answer a question for the purpose of troubleshooting or business analysis To create a new chart To make API queries of New Relic data (for example, using our NerdGraph API) NRQL is used behind the scenes to generate some New Relic charts: Some New Relic charts are built using NRQL. One way to start using NRQL is to view a chart's query and then edit it to make your own custom chart. Where can you use NRQL? You can use NRQL in these places: New Relic One query builder NerdGraph: our GraphQL-format API, which includes options for making NRQL queries one.newrelic.com > Query your data: You can run a NRQL query in New Relic One. This NRQL query shows a count of distributed tracing spans faceted by their entity names. NRQL is one of several ways to query New Relic data. For more on all query options, see Query your data. What data can you query with NRQL? NRQL allows you to query these New Relic data types: Event data from all New Relic products, including: APM events, like Transaction Browser monitoring events, like PageView Mobile monitoring events, like Mobile Infrastructure events, like ProcessSample Synthetics events, like SyntheticCheck Custom events, like those reported by the Event API Metric timeslice data (metrics reported by APM, browser, and mobile) The Metric data type (metrics reported by the Metric API and data sources that use that API) The Span data type (distributed tracing data) The Log data type (data from New Relic Logs) Tip Some data, like relationships between monitored entities, is not available via NRQL but is available using our NerdGraph API. Start using NRQL One way to start using NRQL and to understand what data you have available is to go to a NRQL interface (for example, the New Relic One query builder), type FROM, and press space. The interface will suggest available types of data: To see the attributes available for a specific data type, type FROM DATA_TYPE SELECT and press space. The interface will suggest available attributes. For example: To see the complete JSON associated with a data type, including all of its attributes, use the keyset() attribute. For example: FROM Transaction SELECT keyset() Copy NRQL is used behind the scenes to build some New Relic charts and dashboards. One way to learn NRQL is to find one of these NRQL-generated charts and start playing with the NRQL to create new, customized queries and charts: Charts built with NRQL will have View query as an option. You can then edit and customize that query to see how your changes affect the resulting visualization. Important To explore your data without having to use NRQL, use the data explorer. Learn more about querying data in New Relic. NRQL query examples Here's an example NRQL query of Transaction data, which is reported by APM. FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) FACET appName TIMESERIES auto Copy This would generate a chart that looks like: Here are some more query examples: Basic NRQL query of browser data Here's a NRQL query of PageView data from browser monitoring. SELECT uniqueCount(user) FROM PageView WHERE userAgentOS = 'Mac' FACET countryCode SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 20 Copy Attribute name with a space in it If a custom attribute name has a space in it, use backticks around the attribute name: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET `Logged-in user` Copy Querying multiple data sources To return data from two data sources, separate their data types with a comma. For example, this query returns a count of all APM transactions and browser events over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, PageView SINCE 3 days ago Copy Query returning multiple columns To return multiple columns from a dataset, separate the aggregator arguments with a comma: SELECT function(attribute), function(attribute) ... FROM ... Copy This query returns the minimum, average, and maximum duration for browser monitoring PageView events over the last week: SELECT min(duration), max(duration), average(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy See more NRQL query examples. NRQL syntax The syntax of a NRQL query is similar to standard SQL queries. Here is a breakdown of the structure of a NRQL query: SELECT function(attribute) [AS 'label'][, ...] FROM data type [WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...]][AS 'label'][, ...] [FACET attribute | function(attribute)] [LIMIT number] [SINCE time] [UNTIL time] [WITH TIMEZONE timezone] [COMPARE WITH time] [TIMESERIES time] Copy Basic rules include: NRQL condition Details Required values The SELECT statement and FROM clause are required. All other clauses are optional. You can start your query with either SELECT or FROM. Query string size The query string must be less than 4 KB. Case sensitivity The data type names and attribute names are case sensitive. NRQL clauses and functions are not case sensitive. Syntax for strings NRQL uses single quotes to designate strings. For example: ... where traceId = '030a573f0df02c57' Copy Attribute names with spaces Use backticks `` to quote a custom attribute name that has a space in it. For example: ... FACET `Logged-in user` Copy Data type coercion Insights does not support data type \"coercion.\" For more information, see Data type conversion. Use of math functions Basic and advanced math functions are supported in the SELECT statement. JOIN functions NRQL does not have the equivalent of the SQL JOIN function, but you can simulate a JOIN with custom attributes. Read more about NRQL syntax and functions.",

      "body": "This document provides information on FedRAMP-compliant endpoints in New Relic. For more information about our security accreditation for the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP), see our data encryption documentation. Customer FedRAMP obligations New Relic customers must meet all of the following requirements for New Relic’s FedRAMP environment: New Relic-approved customers: New Relic’s FedRAMP-Moderate authorized environment is only available to New Relic-approved customers. For more information, contact your New Relic account representative. Order form: Customer’s order form with New Relic must include customer’s eligibility for FedRAMP. Subscription level: Customer must have a current and valid subscription to New Relic Full-Stack Observability Enterprise or New Relic-approved subscription. Authorized New Relic endpoints: Customer must send its data only to New Relic’s FedRAMP-designated endpoints. Authorized services and features: Customer must use only FedRAMP audited and authorized New Relic services and features (see below). Overview of data sources There are multiple ways to get data into New Relic. This doc has two sections: Agent settings: for our APM agents, infrastructure agent, browser agent, and mobile agent. Data-ingest APIs: for our Metric API, Event API, Trace API, and Log API, and the integrations that use those APIs. Agents New Relic has several agents for reporting data, like our APM agents, infrastructure agents, mobile agents, and browser agent. Setting these agents to send FedRAMP-compliant data involves setting a configuration setting to use the relevant FedRAMP endpoint. APM agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance, all APM agent configurations must report to gov-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. Depending on the agent, you can either use code-based configuration or an environment variable. Here are details on enabling this: Language Code or environment variable C SDK In code: strcpy(_newrelic_app_config_t->redirect_collector, \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"); Copy Environment variable: none Go In code: app, err = newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"App Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(os.Getenv(\"NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY\")), func(cfg *newrelic.Config) { cfg.Host = \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" }, ) Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Java In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Or set a system property of: newrelic.config.host Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST .NET In your XML config next to the license key: <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" host=\"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"/> Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Node.js In newrelic.js: host: 'gov-collector.newrelic.com' Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST PHP In newrelic.ini: newrelic.daemon.collector_host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: none Python In newrelic.ini: [newrelic] host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Ruby In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Elixir (open source agent) In config.exs: config :new_relic_agent, host: \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST For more on configuring APM agents, see APM configuration. Mobile monitoring agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using our mobile monitoring agents, all agent configurations must report to gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. You must use code-based configuration. Environment variables are not available. Framework-specific configurations: Agent Code or environment variable Android In code: NewRelic.withApplicationToken({APP_TOKEN}) .usingCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\") .usingCrashCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\") .start(this.getApplication()); Copy Environment variable: none iOS In code: [NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:@\"{APP_TOKEN}\" andCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\" andCrashCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\"]; Copy Environment variable: none Infrastructure monitoring If you have infrastructure agent version 1.15.0 or higher, simply enable the FedRAMP configuration option. This enables FedRAMP compliancy for data reported by the infrastructure agent, and for any on-host integrations that work with the infrastructure agent to report data. Important The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration is not currently FedRAMP compliant. If you have an older agent version, use the following values to edit your YAML configuration: Infrastructure agent versions below 1.15.0 If you have an infrastructure agent version below 1.15.0, you must change three of the endpoints used for reporting. To set these endpoints, you can change your YAML configuration or use environment variables. YAML config field Endpoint URL collector_url https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy identity_url https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy command_channel_url https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy To edit environment variables, use these values: Environment variable Endpoint URL NRIA_COLLECTOR_URL https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_IDENTITY_URL https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_COMMAND_CHANNEL_URL https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy Browser agent To configure the browser agent to use a FedRAMP-compliant endpoint, you must use the copy-paste method method (other browser agent install methods are not supported) and edit the browser code’s script element tag so that the domain is gov-bam.nr-data.net for both beacon and errorBeacon, like this: window.NREUM||(NREUM={});NREUM.info={\"beacon\":\"gov-bam.nr-data.net\",\"errorBeacon\":\"gov-bam.nr-data.net\"... Copy Note: You only need to modify the beacon and errorBeacon properties in the NREUM.info object. These values will override the default values found in the NR loader script. Data-ingest APIs Below are details about the FedRAMP endpoint for our ingest APIs: Metric API, the Event API, the Log API, and the Trace API. Metric API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the Metric API, instead of sending metric data to the default Metric API endpoint of https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1, it must be sent to https://gov-metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1. The Metric API can be used directly but it's mainly used by various New Relic tools. Below are instructions showing where to edit the configuration for setting the FedRAMP endpoint. Telemetry integrations Here are instructions for our open source telemetry integrations that report metric data: Dropwizard: use the overrideUri configuration. Kamon: use the metric-ingest-url configuration. See Override endpoints. Micrometer: override the public String uri() method on your NewRelicRegistryConfig to return the new endpoint. See an example. Prometheus: Prometheus OpenMetrics: if you are using our nri-prometheus helm chart, you can change the endpoint in your values.yml file, like in this example. If you're using the nri-bundle chart, you need to nest this value under the nri-prometheus key to propagate it to the sub-chart. Remote write integration: not available. Telemetry SDKs Here are instructions for our Telemetry SDKs that report metric data: Go: use the MetricsURLOverride configuration. Java: in the MetricBatchSender section, configure the endpoint. See an example. .NET: use the MetricUrlOverride configuration. Node.js: edit the METRIC_HOST = 'metric-api.newrelic.com' configuration. Python: edit the HOST = \"metric-api.newrelic.com\" configuration. Event API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for the Event API, all traffic reporting to insights-collector.newrelic.com must instead report to gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com. The Event API endpoint is configurable for the following Telemetry SDKs. The Telemetry SDKs are used by our open-source telemetry integrations. Language Solution Java Telemetry SDK In code: SenderConfiguration configuration = SenderConfiguration .builder( \"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\", EventBatchSender.EVENTS_PATH) .build(); EventBatchSender eventBatchSender = EventBatchSender.create(configuration); Copy Python Telemetry SDK In code: event_client = EventClient(host=\"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\") Copy For more information, see our Telemetry API documentation in GitHub. Log API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Log API, the solution for almost all our logging tools is to replace the https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 endpoint with https://gov-log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1. Here are details for various tools: Log forwarders Here are details on changing the endpoint for our log forwarders: AWS Firelens: Add the endpoint property to the options field of the logConfiguration, similar to to the EU account endpoint change shown in these Firelens endpoint configuration instructions. Fluentbit: Use our Fluentbit endpoint configuration. Fluentd: Use our Fluentd endpoint instructions. Infrastructure agent: See FedRAMP for infrastructure. Kubernetes: Our Kubernetes integration logs are based on fluentbit’s output plugin. Use these endpoint instructions. Logstash: Use our Logstash endpoint configuration. Syslog: For configuring syslog clients, see TCP endpoint configuration. S3: Not available. Vector: Not available. To use the Log API directly, you'd edit the Log API endpoint configuration. Trace API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Trace API (including telemetry integrations that use this API), replace the https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1 endpoint with https://gov-trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1. Notes about FedRAMP compliance for other trace data: Trace data is reported by some of our agents, like our APM agents, browser agent, and mobile agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for that data, you would enable FedRAMP for the applicable agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for Infinite Tracing, you would create a new FedRAMP compliant trace observer from the New Relic Edge app.",

High Security vulnerability ratings At New Relic, we use four levels to rate security vulnerability. Rating Description Critical A vulnerability in a New Relic product or service that could be exploited to compromise the confidentiality or integrity of your data. High Atypical or unintended information is likely to be received by New Relic, potentially compromising the confidentiality or integrity of your data. Medium Atypical or unintended information could be received by New Relic, but the risk of compromise is mitigated by default configuration or standard security practices. Low Atypical or unintended information may be received by New Relic, but the vulnerability would be difficult to exploit, or it would have minimal impact. Report security vulnerabilities to New Relic New Relic is committed to the security of our customers and your data. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in one of our products, services, or websites, we welcome and greatly appreciate you reporting it to our coordinated disclosure program.

This vulnerability, which affects multiple sites across the Internet, could be remotely exploited to leak sensitive information. Action by New Relic New Relic has reviewed all of our sites and applications, and we have determined that the majority of our sites, including www.newrelic.com, rpm.newrelic.com, and insights.newrelic.com are not vulnerable to this issue. New Relic did discover that the Documentation site (docs.newrelic.com) was vulnerable. This has now been patched, and the SSL certificate has been replaced. Change your password New Relic has no evidence that any customer data (including user names and passwords) was exposed. However, if you have any concerns about your account's protection, you should change your password. This procedure is for users who sign in directly to APM and do not have partner accounts or SAML SSO enabled accounts: Go to rpm.newrelic.com > (account dropdown) > User preferences. Type your Current password. Type your new Password (meeting minimum requirements), and then re-type the new password in Password confirmation. Select Save user preferences.

This vulnerability, which affects multiple sites across the Internet, could be remotely exploited to leak sensitive information. Action by New Relic New Relic has reviewed all of our sites and applications, and we have determined that the majority of our sites, including www.newrelic.com, rpm.newrelic.com, and insights.newrelic.com are not vulnerable to this issue. New Relic did discover that the Documentation site (docs.newrelic.com) was vulnerable. This has now been patched, and the SSL certificate has been replaced. Change your password New Relic has no evidence that any customer data (including user names and passwords) was exposed. However, if you have any concerns about your account's protection, you should change your password. This procedure is for users who sign in directly to APM and do not have partner accounts or SAML SSO enabled accounts: Go to rpm.newrelic.com > (account dropdown) > User preferences. Type your Current password. Type your new Password (meeting minimum requirements), and then re-type the new password in Password confirmation. Select Save user preferences. Regenerate your API key. rpm.newrelic.com > (account dropdown) > User preferences: Anyone can change their own New Relic user name, account email, password, and other settings.",

High Security vulnerability ratings At New Relic, we use four levels to rate security vulnerability. Rating Description Critical A vulnerability in a New Relic product or service that could be exploited to compromise the confidentiality or integrity of your data. High Atypical or unintended information is likely to be received by New Relic, potentially compromising the confidentiality or integrity of your data. Medium Atypical or unintended information could be received by New Relic, but the risk of compromise is mitigated by default configuration or standard security practices. Low Atypical or unintended information may be received by New Relic, but the vulnerability would be difficult to exploit, or it would have minimal impact. Report security vulnerabilities to New Relic New Relic is committed to the security of our customers and your data. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in one of our products, services, or websites, we welcome and greatly appreciate you reporting it to our coordinated disclosure program.

For more information, download the New Relic FedRAMP Customer Responsibility Matrix (CRM) Worksheet as a PDF|87K. Customer FedRAMP obligations New Relic customers must meet all of the following requirements for New Relic’s FedRAMP environment: New Relic-approved customers: New Relic’s FedRAMP-Moderate authorized environment is only available to New Relic-approved customers. For more information, contact your New Relic account representative. Order form: Customer’s order form with New Relic must include customer’s eligibility for FedRAMP. Subscription level: Customer must have a current and valid subscription to New Relic Full-Stack Observability Enterprise or New Relic-approved subscription. Authorized New Relic endpoints: Customer must send its data only to New Relic’s FedRAMP-designated endpoints. Authorized services and features: Customer must use only FedRAMP audited and authorized New Relic services and features. Time frames New Relic's time frames for supported regulatory frameworks and annual audits include: SOC2 Type 2 audit: Reviews New Relic's implementation and maintenance of controls for the previous 12 months. The annual audit spans August 1 of the previous year through July 31 of the current year (for example, August 1, 2019 through July 31, 2020). FedRAMP Agency (Moderate): Reviews New Relic's implementation and maintenance of NIST 800-53 rev. 4 controls for the previous 12 months.

However, a new service may not be covered by one or more of our compliance programs at any given time throughout the year. This is primarily dependent on the timing when the service achieved General Availability (GA) status and the timing of the specific compliance program's annual authorization, certification, or assessment. You can use any New Relic service regardless of its compliance program status. However, if a service is not yet in scope of our compliance programs, we encourage you to consider your risk appetite in the decision to use the specific New Relic product or service. If you choose to use New Relic services that are not yet in our compliance program scope, you assume the responsibility to review, understand, and risk-manage your security controls as you deem appropriate. You also have the option to wait for New Relic to authorize these services before you use them.",

High Security vulnerability ratings At New Relic, we use four levels to rate security vulnerability. Rating Description Critical A vulnerability in a New Relic product or service that could be exploited to compromise the confidentiality or integrity of your data. High Atypical or unintended information is likely to be received by New Relic, potentially compromising the confidentiality or integrity of your data. Medium Atypical or unintended information could be received by New Relic, but the risk of compromise is mitigated by default configuration or standard security practices. Low Atypical or unintended information may be received by New Relic, but the vulnerability would be difficult to exploit, or it would have minimal impact. Report security vulnerabilities to New Relic New Relic is committed to the security of our customers and your data. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in one of our products, services, or websites, we welcome and greatly appreciate you reporting it to our coordinated disclosure program.

High Security vulnerability ratings At New Relic, we use four levels to rate security vulnerability. Rating Description Critical A vulnerability in a New Relic product or service that could be exploited to compromise the confidentiality or integrity of your data. High Atypical or unintended information is likely to be received by New Relic, potentially compromising the confidentiality or integrity of your data. Medium Atypical or unintended information could be received by New Relic, but the risk of compromise is mitigated by default configuration or standard security practices. Low Atypical or unintended information may be received by New Relic, but the vulnerability would be difficult to exploit, or it would have minimal impact. Report security vulnerabilities to New Relic New Relic is committed to the security of our customers and your data. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in one of our products, services, or websites, we welcome and greatly appreciate you reporting it to our coordinated disclosure program.

This vulnerability, which affects multiple sites across the Internet, could be remotely exploited to leak sensitive information. Action by New Relic New Relic has reviewed all of our sites and applications, and we have determined that the majority of our sites, including www.newrelic.com, rpm.newrelic.com, and insights.newrelic.com are not vulnerable to this issue. New Relic did discover that the Documentation site (docs.newrelic.com) was vulnerable. This has now been patched, and the SSL certificate has been replaced. Change your password New Relic has no evidence that any customer data (including user names and passwords) was exposed. However, if you have any concerns about your account's protection, you should change your password. This procedure is for users who sign in directly to APM and do not have partner accounts or SAML SSO enabled accounts: Go to rpm.newrelic.com > (account dropdown) > User preferences. Type your Current password. Type your new Password (meeting minimum requirements), and then re-type the new password in Password confirmation. Select Save user preferences.

This vulnerability, which affects multiple sites across the Internet, could be remotely exploited to leak sensitive information. Action by New Relic New Relic has reviewed all of our sites and applications, and we have determined that the majority of our sites, including www.newrelic.com, rpm.newrelic.com, and insights.newrelic.com are not vulnerable to this issue. New Relic did discover that the Documentation site (docs.newrelic.com) was vulnerable. This has now been patched, and the SSL certificate has been replaced. Change your password New Relic has no evidence that any customer data (including user names and passwords) was exposed. However, if you have any concerns about your account's protection, you should change your password. This procedure is for users who sign in directly to APM and do not have partner accounts or SAML SSO enabled accounts: Go to rpm.newrelic.com > (account dropdown) > User preferences. Type your Current password. Type your new Password (meeting minimum requirements), and then re-type the new password in Password confirmation. Select Save user preferences. Regenerate your API key. rpm.newrelic.com > (account dropdown) > User preferences: Anyone can change their own New Relic user name, account email, password, and other settings.",

High Security vulnerability ratings At New Relic, we use four levels to rate security vulnerability. Rating Description Critical A vulnerability in a New Relic product or service that could be exploited to compromise the confidentiality or integrity of your data. High Atypical or unintended information is likely to be received by New Relic, potentially compromising the confidentiality or integrity of your data. Medium Atypical or unintended information could be received by New Relic, but the risk of compromise is mitigated by default configuration or standard security practices. Low Atypical or unintended information may be received by New Relic, but the vulnerability would be difficult to exploit, or it would have minimal impact. Report security vulnerabilities to New Relic New Relic is committed to the security of our customers and your data. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in one of our products, services, or websites, we welcome and greatly appreciate you reporting it to our coordinated disclosure program.

For more information, download the New Relic FedRAMP Customer Responsibility Matrix (CRM) Worksheet as a PDF|87K. Customer FedRAMP obligations New Relic customers must meet all of the following requirements for New Relic’s FedRAMP environment: New Relic-approved customers: New Relic’s FedRAMP-Moderate authorized environment is only available to New Relic-approved customers. For more information, contact your New Relic account representative. Order form: Customer’s order form with New Relic must include customer’s eligibility for FedRAMP. Subscription level: Customer must have a current and valid subscription to New Relic Full-Stack Observability Enterprise or New Relic-approved subscription. Authorized New Relic endpoints: Customer must send its data only to New Relic’s FedRAMP-designated endpoints. Authorized services and features: Customer must use only FedRAMP audited and authorized New Relic services and features. Time frames New Relic's time frames for supported regulatory frameworks and annual audits include: SOC2 Type 2 audit: Reviews New Relic's implementation and maintenance of controls for the previous 12 months. The annual audit spans August 1 of the previous year through July 31 of the current year (for example, August 1, 2019 through July 31, 2020). FedRAMP Agency (Moderate): Reviews New Relic's implementation and maintenance of NIST 800-53 rev. 4 controls for the previous 12 months.

However, a new service may not be covered by one or more of our compliance programs at any given time throughout the year. This is primarily dependent on the timing when the service achieved General Availability (GA) status and the timing of the specific compliance program's annual authorization, certification, or assessment. You can use any New Relic service regardless of its compliance program status. However, if a service is not yet in scope of our compliance programs, we encourage you to consider your risk appetite in the decision to use the specific New Relic product or service. If you choose to use New Relic services that are not yet in our compliance program scope, you assume the responsibility to review, understand, and risk-manage your security controls as you deem appropriate. You also have the option to wait for New Relic to authorize these services before you use them.",

High Security vulnerability ratings At New Relic, we use four levels to rate security vulnerability. Rating Description Critical A vulnerability in a New Relic product or service that could be exploited to compromise the confidentiality or integrity of your data. High Atypical or unintended information is likely to be received by New Relic, potentially compromising the confidentiality or integrity of your data. Medium Atypical or unintended information could be received by New Relic, but the risk of compromise is mitigated by default configuration or standard security practices. Low Atypical or unintended information may be received by New Relic, but the vulnerability would be difficult to exploit, or it would have minimal impact. Report security vulnerabilities to New Relic New Relic is committed to the security of our customers and your data. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in one of our products, services, or websites, we welcome and greatly appreciate you reporting it to our coordinated disclosure program.

High Security vulnerability ratings At New Relic, we use four levels to rate security vulnerability. Rating Description Critical A vulnerability in a New Relic product or service that could be exploited to compromise the confidentiality or integrity of your data. High Atypical or unintended information is likely to be received by New Relic, potentially compromising the confidentiality or integrity of your data. Medium Atypical or unintended information could be received by New Relic, but the risk of compromise is mitigated by default configuration or standard security practices. Low Atypical or unintended information may be received by New Relic, but the vulnerability would be difficult to exploit, or it would have minimal impact. Report security vulnerabilities to New Relic New Relic is committed to the security of our customers and your data. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in one of our products, services, or websites, we welcome and greatly appreciate you reporting it to our coordinated disclosure program.

This vulnerability, which affects multiple sites across the Internet, could be remotely exploited to leak sensitive information. Action by New Relic New Relic has reviewed all of our sites and applications, and we have determined that the majority of our sites, including www.newrelic.com, rpm.newrelic.com, and insights.newrelic.com are not vulnerable to this issue. New Relic did discover that the Documentation site (docs.newrelic.com) was vulnerable. This has now been patched, and the SSL certificate has been replaced. Change your password New Relic has no evidence that any customer data (including user names and passwords) was exposed. However, if you have any concerns about your account's protection, you should change your password. This procedure is for users who sign in directly to APM and do not have partner accounts or SAML SSO enabled accounts: Go to rpm.newrelic.com > (account dropdown) > User preferences. Type your Current password. Type your new Password (meeting minimum requirements), and then re-type the new password in Password confirmation. Select Save user preferences.

This vulnerability, which affects multiple sites across the Internet, could be remotely exploited to leak sensitive information. Action by New Relic New Relic has reviewed all of our sites and applications, and we have determined that the majority of our sites, including www.newrelic.com, rpm.newrelic.com, and insights.newrelic.com are not vulnerable to this issue. New Relic did discover that the Documentation site (docs.newrelic.com) was vulnerable. This has now been patched, and the SSL certificate has been replaced. Change your password New Relic has no evidence that any customer data (including user names and passwords) was exposed. However, if you have any concerns about your account's protection, you should change your password. This procedure is for users who sign in directly to APM and do not have partner accounts or SAML SSO enabled accounts: Go to rpm.newrelic.com > (account dropdown) > User preferences. Type your Current password. Type your new Password (meeting minimum requirements), and then re-type the new password in Password confirmation. Select Save user preferences.

High Security vulnerability ratings At New Relic, we use four levels to rate security vulnerability. Rating Description Critical A vulnerability in a New Relic product or service that could be exploited to compromise the confidentiality or integrity of your data. High Atypical or unintended information is likely to be received by New Relic, potentially compromising the confidentiality or integrity of your data. Medium Atypical or unintended information could be received by New Relic, but the risk of compromise is mitigated by default configuration or standard security practices. Low Atypical or unintended information may be received by New Relic, but the vulnerability would be difficult to exploit, or it would have minimal impact. Report security vulnerabilities to New Relic New Relic is committed to the security of our customers and your data. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in one of our products, services, or websites, we welcome and greatly appreciate you reporting it to our coordinated disclosure program.

For more information, download the New Relic FedRAMP Customer Responsibility Matrix (CRM) Worksheet as a PDF|87K. Customer FedRAMP obligations New Relic customers must meet all of the following requirements for New Relic’s FedRAMP environment: New Relic-approved customers: New Relic’s FedRAMP-Moderate authorized environment is only available to New Relic-approved customers. For more information, contact your New Relic account representative. Order form: Customer’s order form with New Relic must include customer’s eligibility for FedRAMP. Subscription level: Customer must have a current and valid subscription to New Relic Full-Stack Observability Enterprise or New Relic-approved subscription. Authorized New Relic endpoints: Customer must send its data only to New Relic’s FedRAMP-designated endpoints. Authorized services and features: Customer must use only FedRAMP audited and authorized New Relic services and features. Time frames New Relic's time frames for supported regulatory frameworks and annual audits include: SOC2 Type 2 audit: Reviews New Relic's implementation and maintenance of controls for the previous 12 months. The annual audit spans August 1 of the previous year through July 31 of the current year (for example, August 1, 2019 through July 31, 2020). FedRAMP Agency (Moderate): Reviews New Relic's implementation and maintenance of NIST 800-53 rev. 4 controls for the previous 12 months.

However, a new service may not be covered by one or more of our compliance programs at any given time throughout the year. This is primarily dependent on the timing when the service achieved General Availability (GA) status and the timing of the specific compliance program's annual authorization, certification, or assessment. You can use any New Relic service regardless of its compliance program status. However, if a service is not yet in scope of our compliance programs, we encourage you to consider your risk appetite in the decision to use the specific New Relic product or service. If you choose to use New Relic services that are not yet in our compliance program scope, you assume the responsibility to review, understand, and risk-manage your security controls as you deem appropriate. You also have the option to wait for New Relic to authorize these services before you use them.",

High Security vulnerability ratings At New Relic, we use four levels to rate security vulnerability. Rating Description Critical A vulnerability in a New Relic product or service that could be exploited to compromise the confidentiality or integrity of your data. High Atypical or unintended information is likely to be received by New Relic, potentially compromising the confidentiality or integrity of your data. Medium Atypical or unintended information could be received by New Relic, but the risk of compromise is mitigated by default configuration or standard security practices. Low Atypical or unintended information may be received by New Relic, but the vulnerability would be difficult to exploit, or it would have minimal impact. Report security vulnerabilities to New Relic New Relic is committed to the security of our customers and your data. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in one of our products, services, or websites, we welcome and greatly appreciate you reporting it to our coordinated disclosure program.

High Security vulnerability ratings At New Relic, we use four levels to rate security vulnerability. Rating Description Critical A vulnerability in a New Relic product or service that could be exploited to compromise the confidentiality or integrity of your data. High Atypical or unintended information is likely to be received by New Relic, potentially compromising the confidentiality or integrity of your data. Medium Atypical or unintended information could be received by New Relic, but the risk of compromise is mitigated by default configuration or standard security practices. Low Atypical or unintended information may be received by New Relic, but the vulnerability would be difficult to exploit, or it would have minimal impact. Report security vulnerabilities to New Relic New Relic is committed to the security of our customers and your data. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in one of our products, services, or websites, we welcome and greatly appreciate you reporting it to our coordinated disclosure program.

This vulnerability, which affects multiple sites across the Internet, could be remotely exploited to leak sensitive information. Action by New Relic New Relic has reviewed all of our sites and applications, and we have determined that the majority of our sites, including www.newrelic.com, rpm.newrelic.com, and insights.newrelic.com are not vulnerable to this issue. New Relic did discover that the Documentation site (docs.newrelic.com) was vulnerable. This has now been patched, and the SSL certificate has been replaced. Change your password New Relic has no evidence that any customer data (including user names and passwords) was exposed. However, if you have any concerns about your account's protection, you should change your password. This procedure is for users who sign in directly to APM and do not have partner accounts or SAML SSO enabled accounts: Go to rpm.newrelic.com > (account dropdown) > User preferences. Type your Current password. Type your new Password (meeting minimum requirements), and then re-type the new password in Password confirmation. Select Save user preferences.

This vulnerability, which affects multiple sites across the Internet, could be remotely exploited to leak sensitive information. Action by New Relic New Relic has reviewed all of our sites and applications, and we have determined that the majority of our sites, including www.newrelic.com, rpm.newrelic.com, and insights.newrelic.com are not vulnerable to this issue. New Relic did discover that the Documentation site (docs.newrelic.com) was vulnerable. This has now been patched, and the SSL certificate has been replaced. Change your password New Relic has no evidence that any customer data (including user names and passwords) was exposed. However, if you have any concerns about your account's protection, you should change your password. This procedure is for users who sign in directly to APM and do not have partner accounts or SAML SSO enabled accounts: Go to rpm.newrelic.com > (account dropdown) > User preferences. Type your Current password. Type your new Password (meeting minimum requirements), and then re-type the new password in Password confirmation. Select Save user preferences. Regenerate your API key. rpm.newrelic.com > (account dropdown) > User preferences: Anyone can change their own New Relic user name, account email, password, and other settings.",

High Security vulnerability ratings At New Relic, we use four levels to rate security vulnerability. Rating Description Critical A vulnerability in a New Relic product or service that could be exploited to compromise the confidentiality or integrity of your data. High Atypical or unintended information is likely to be received by New Relic, potentially compromising the confidentiality or integrity of your data. Medium Atypical or unintended information could be received by New Relic, but the risk of compromise is mitigated by default configuration or standard security practices. Low Atypical or unintended information may be received by New Relic, but the vulnerability would be difficult to exploit, or it would have minimal impact. Report security vulnerabilities to New Relic New Relic is committed to the security of our customers and your data. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in one of our products, services, or websites, we welcome and greatly appreciate you reporting it to our coordinated disclosure program.

For more information, download the New Relic FedRAMP Customer Responsibility Matrix (CRM) Worksheet as a PDF|87K. Customer FedRAMP obligations New Relic customers must meet all of the following requirements for New Relic’s FedRAMP environment: New Relic-approved customers: New Relic’s FedRAMP-Moderate authorized environment is only available to New Relic-approved customers. For more information, contact your New Relic account representative. Order form: Customer’s order form with New Relic must include customer’s eligibility for FedRAMP. Subscription level: Customer must have a current and valid subscription to New Relic Full-Stack Observability Enterprise or New Relic-approved subscription. Authorized New Relic endpoints: Customer must send its data only to New Relic’s FedRAMP-designated endpoints. Authorized services and features: Customer must use only FedRAMP audited and authorized New Relic services and features. Time frames New Relic's time frames for supported regulatory frameworks and annual audits include: SOC2 Type 2 audit: Reviews New Relic's implementation and maintenance of controls for the previous 12 months. The annual audit spans August 1 of the previous year through July 31 of the current year (for example, August 1, 2019 through July 31, 2020). FedRAMP Agency (Moderate): Reviews New Relic's implementation and maintenance of NIST 800-53 rev. 4 controls for the previous 12 months.

However, a new service may not be covered by one or more of our compliance programs at any given time throughout the year. This is primarily dependent on the timing when the service achieved General Availability (GA) status and the timing of the specific compliance program's annual authorization, certification, or assessment. You can use any New Relic service regardless of its compliance program status. However, if a service is not yet in scope of our compliance programs, we encourage you to consider your risk appetite in the decision to use the specific New Relic product or service. If you choose to use New Relic services that are not yet in our compliance program scope, you assume the responsibility to review, understand, and risk-manage your security controls as you deem appropriate. You also have the option to wait for New Relic to authorize these services before you use them.",

High Security vulnerability ratings At New Relic, we use four levels to rate security vulnerability. Rating Description Critical A vulnerability in a New Relic product or service that could be exploited to compromise the confidentiality or integrity of your data. High Atypical or unintended information is likely to be received by New Relic, potentially compromising the confidentiality or integrity of your data. Medium Atypical or unintended information could be received by New Relic, but the risk of compromise is mitigated by default configuration or standard security practices. Low Atypical or unintended information may be received by New Relic, but the vulnerability would be difficult to exploit, or it would have minimal impact. Report security vulnerabilities to New Relic New Relic is committed to the security of our customers and your data. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in one of our products, services, or websites, we welcome and greatly appreciate you reporting it to our coordinated disclosure program.

High Security vulnerability ratings At New Relic, we use four levels to rate security vulnerability. Rating Description Critical A vulnerability in a New Relic product or service that could be exploited to compromise the confidentiality or integrity of your data. High Atypical or unintended information is likely to be received by New Relic, potentially compromising the confidentiality or integrity of your data. Medium Atypical or unintended information could be received by New Relic, but the risk of compromise is mitigated by default configuration or standard security practices. Low Atypical or unintended information may be received by New Relic, but the vulnerability would be difficult to exploit, or it would have minimal impact. Report security vulnerabilities to New Relic New Relic is committed to the security of our customers and your data. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in one of our products, services, or websites, we welcome and greatly appreciate you reporting it to our coordinated disclosure program.

This vulnerability, which affects multiple sites across the Internet, could be remotely exploited to leak sensitive information. Action by New Relic New Relic has reviewed all of our sites and applications, and we have determined that the majority of our sites, including www.newrelic.com, rpm.newrelic.com, and insights.newrelic.com are not vulnerable to this issue. New Relic did discover that the Documentation site (docs.newrelic.com) was vulnerable. This has now been patched, and the SSL certificate has been replaced. Change your password New Relic has no evidence that any customer data (including user names and passwords) was exposed. However, if you have any concerns about your account's protection, you should change your password. This procedure is for users who sign in directly to APM and do not have partner accounts or SAML SSO enabled accounts: Go to rpm.newrelic.com > (account dropdown) > User preferences. Type your Current password. Type your new Password (meeting minimum requirements), and then re-type the new password in Password confirmation. Select Save user preferences.

This vulnerability, which affects multiple sites across the Internet, could be remotely exploited to leak sensitive information. Action by New Relic New Relic has reviewed all of our sites and applications, and we have determined that the majority of our sites, including www.newrelic.com, rpm.newrelic.com, and insights.newrelic.com are not vulnerable to this issue. New Relic did discover that the Documentation site (docs.newrelic.com) was vulnerable. This has now been patched, and the SSL certificate has been replaced. Change your password New Relic has no evidence that any customer data (including user names and passwords) was exposed. However, if you have any concerns about your account's protection, you should change your password. This procedure is for users who sign in directly to APM and do not have partner accounts or SAML SSO enabled accounts: Go to rpm.newrelic.com > (account dropdown) > User preferences. Type your Current password. Type your new Password (meeting minimum requirements), and then re-type the new password in Password confirmation. Select Save user preferences.

High Security vulnerability ratings At New Relic, we use four levels to rate security vulnerability. Rating Description Critical A vulnerability in a New Relic product or service that could be exploited to compromise the confidentiality or integrity of your data. High Atypical or unintended information is likely to be received by New Relic, potentially compromising the confidentiality or integrity of your data. Medium Atypical or unintended information could be received by New Relic, but the risk of compromise is mitigated by default configuration or standard security practices. Low Atypical or unintended information may be received by New Relic, but the vulnerability would be difficult to exploit, or it would have minimal impact. Report security vulnerabilities to New Relic New Relic is committed to the security of our customers and your data. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in one of our products, services, or websites, we welcome and greatly appreciate you reporting it to our coordinated disclosure program.

For more information, download the New Relic FedRAMP Customer Responsibility Matrix (CRM) Worksheet as a PDF|87K. Customer FedRAMP obligations New Relic customers must meet all of the following requirements for New Relic’s FedRAMP environment: New Relic-approved customers: New Relic’s FedRAMP-Moderate authorized environment is only available to New Relic-approved customers. For more information, contact your New Relic account representative. Order form: Customer’s order form with New Relic must include customer’s eligibility for FedRAMP. Subscription level: Customer must have a current and valid subscription to New Relic Full-Stack Observability Enterprise or New Relic-approved subscription. Authorized New Relic endpoints: Customer must send its data only to New Relic’s FedRAMP-designated endpoints. Authorized services and features: Customer must use only FedRAMP audited and authorized New Relic services and features. Time frames New Relic's time frames for supported regulatory frameworks and annual audits include: SOC2 Type 2 audit: Reviews New Relic's implementation and maintenance of controls for the previous 12 months. The annual audit spans August 1 of the previous year through July 31 of the current year (for example, August 1, 2019 through July 31, 2020). FedRAMP Agency (Moderate): Reviews New Relic's implementation and maintenance of NIST 800-53 rev. 4 controls for the previous 12 months.

However, a new service may not be covered by one or more of our compliance programs at any given time throughout the year. This is primarily dependent on the timing when the service achieved General Availability (GA) status and the timing of the specific compliance program's annual authorization, certification, or assessment. You can use any New Relic service regardless of its compliance program status. However, if a service is not yet in scope of our compliance programs, we encourage you to consider your risk appetite in the decision to use the specific New Relic product or service. If you choose to use New Relic services that are not yet in our compliance program scope, you assume the responsibility to review, understand, and risk-manage your security controls as you deem appropriate. You also have the option to wait for New Relic to authorize these services before you use them.",

High Security vulnerability ratings At New Relic, we use four levels to rate security vulnerability. Rating Description Critical A vulnerability in a New Relic product or service that could be exploited to compromise the confidentiality or integrity of your data. High Atypical or unintended information is likely to be received by New Relic, potentially compromising the confidentiality or integrity of your data. Medium Atypical or unintended information could be received by New Relic, but the risk of compromise is mitigated by default configuration or standard security practices. Low Atypical or unintended information may be received by New Relic, but the vulnerability would be difficult to exploit, or it would have minimal impact. Report security vulnerabilities to New Relic New Relic is committed to the security of our customers and your data. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in one of our products, services, or websites, we welcome and greatly appreciate you reporting it to our coordinated disclosure program.

High Security vulnerability ratings At New Relic, we use four levels to rate security vulnerability. Rating Description Critical A vulnerability in a New Relic product or service that could be exploited to compromise the confidentiality or integrity of your data. High Atypical or unintended information is likely to be received by New Relic, potentially compromising the confidentiality or integrity of your data. Medium Atypical or unintended information could be received by New Relic, but the risk of compromise is mitigated by default configuration or standard security practices. Low Atypical or unintended information may be received by New Relic, but the vulnerability would be difficult to exploit, or it would have minimal impact. Report security vulnerabilities to New Relic New Relic is committed to the security of our customers and your data. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in one of our products, services, or websites, we welcome and greatly appreciate you reporting it to our coordinated disclosure program.

This vulnerability, which affects multiple sites across the Internet, could be remotely exploited to leak sensitive information. Action by New Relic New Relic has reviewed all of our sites and applications, and we have determined that the majority of our sites, including www.newrelic.com, rpm.newrelic.com, and insights.newrelic.com are not vulnerable to this issue. New Relic did discover that the Documentation site (docs.newrelic.com) was vulnerable. This has now been patched, and the SSL certificate has been replaced. Change your password New Relic has no evidence that any customer data (including user names and passwords) was exposed. However, if you have any concerns about your account's protection, you should change your password. This procedure is for users who sign in directly to APM and do not have partner accounts or SAML SSO enabled accounts: Go to rpm.newrelic.com > (account dropdown) > User preferences. Type your Current password. Type your new Password (meeting minimum requirements), and then re-type the new password in Password confirmation. Select Save user preferences.

This vulnerability, which affects multiple sites across the Internet, could be remotely exploited to leak sensitive information. Action by New Relic New Relic has reviewed all of our sites and applications, and we have determined that the majority of our sites, including www.newrelic.com, rpm.newrelic.com, and insights.newrelic.com are not vulnerable to this issue. New Relic did discover that the Documentation site (docs.newrelic.com) was vulnerable. This has now been patched, and the SSL certificate has been replaced. Change your password New Relic has no evidence that any customer data (including user names and passwords) was exposed. However, if you have any concerns about your account's protection, you should change your password. This procedure is for users who sign in directly to APM and do not have partner accounts or SAML SSO enabled accounts: Go to rpm.newrelic.com > (account dropdown) > User preferences. Type your Current password. Type your new Password (meeting minimum requirements), and then re-type the new password in Password confirmation. Select Save user preferences.

High Security vulnerability ratings At New Relic, we use four levels to rate security vulnerability. Rating Description Critical A vulnerability in a New Relic product or service that could be exploited to compromise the confidentiality or integrity of your data. High Atypical or unintended information is likely to be received by New Relic, potentially compromising the confidentiality or integrity of your data. Medium Atypical or unintended information could be received by New Relic, but the risk of compromise is mitigated by default configuration or standard security practices. Low Atypical or unintended information may be received by New Relic, but the vulnerability would be difficult to exploit, or it would have minimal impact. Report security vulnerabilities to New Relic New Relic is committed to the security of our customers and your data. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in one of our products, services, or websites, we welcome and greatly appreciate you reporting it to our coordinated disclosure program.

For more information, download the New Relic FedRAMP Customer Responsibility Matrix (CRM) Worksheet as a PDF|87K. Customer FedRAMP obligations New Relic customers must meet all of the following requirements for New Relic’s FedRAMP environment: New Relic-approved customers: New Relic’s FedRAMP-Moderate authorized environment is only available to New Relic-approved customers. For more information, contact your New Relic account representative. Order form: Customer’s order form with New Relic must include customer’s eligibility for FedRAMP. Subscription level: Customer must have a current and valid subscription to New Relic Full-Stack Observability Enterprise or New Relic-approved subscription. Authorized New Relic endpoints: Customer must send its data only to New Relic’s FedRAMP-designated endpoints. Authorized services and features: Customer must use only FedRAMP audited and authorized New Relic services and features. Time frames New Relic's time frames for supported regulatory frameworks and annual audits include: SOC2 Type 2 audit: Reviews New Relic's implementation and maintenance of controls for the previous 12 months. The annual audit spans August 1 of the previous year through July 31 of the current year (for example, August 1, 2019 through July 31, 2020). FedRAMP Agency (Moderate): Reviews New Relic's implementation and maintenance of NIST 800-53 rev. 4 controls for the previous 12 months.

However, a new service may not be covered by one or more of our compliance programs at any given time throughout the year. This is primarily dependent on the timing when the service achieved General Availability (GA) status and the timing of the specific compliance program's annual authorization, certification, or assessment. You can use any New Relic service regardless of its compliance program status. However, if a service is not yet in scope of our compliance programs, we encourage you to consider your risk appetite in the decision to use the specific New Relic product or service. If you choose to use New Relic services that are not yet in our compliance program scope, you assume the responsibility to review, understand, and risk-manage your security controls as you deem appropriate. You also have the option to wait for New Relic to authorize these services before you use them.",

High Security vulnerability ratings At New Relic, we use four levels to rate security vulnerability. Rating Description Critical A vulnerability in a New Relic product or service that could be exploited to compromise the confidentiality or integrity of your data. High Atypical or unintended information is likely to be received by New Relic, potentially compromising the confidentiality or integrity of your data. Medium Atypical or unintended information could be received by New Relic, but the risk of compromise is mitigated by default configuration or standard security practices. Low Atypical or unintended information may be received by New Relic, but the vulnerability would be difficult to exploit, or it would have minimal impact. Report security vulnerabilities to New Relic New Relic is committed to the security of our customers and your data. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in one of our products, services, or websites, we welcome and greatly appreciate you reporting it to our coordinated disclosure program.

      "body": "This document provides information on FedRAMP-compliant endpoints in New Relic. For more information about our security accreditation for the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP), see our data encryption documentation. Customer FedRAMP obligations New Relic customers must meet all of the following requirements for New Relic’s FedRAMP environment: New Relic-approved customers: New Relic’s FedRAMP-Moderate authorized environment is only available to New Relic-approved customers. For more information, contact your New Relic account representative. Order form: Customer’s order form with New Relic must include customer’s eligibility for FedRAMP. Subscription level: Customer must have a current and valid subscription to New Relic Full-Stack Observability Enterprise or New Relic-approved subscription. Authorized New Relic endpoints: Customer must send its data only to New Relic’s FedRAMP-designated endpoints. Authorized services and features: Customer must use only FedRAMP audited and authorized New Relic services and features (see below). Overview of data sources There are multiple ways to get data into New Relic. This doc has two sections: Agent settings: for our APM agents, infrastructure agent, browser agent, and mobile agent. Data-ingest APIs: for our Metric API, Event API, Trace API, and Log API, and the integrations that use those APIs. Agents New Relic has several agents for reporting data, like our APM agents, infrastructure agents, mobile agents, and browser agent. Setting these agents to send FedRAMP-compliant data involves setting a configuration setting to use the relevant FedRAMP endpoint. APM agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance, all APM agent configurations must report to gov-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. Depending on the agent, you can either use code-based configuration or an environment variable. Here are details on enabling this: Language Code or environment variable C SDK In code: strcpy(_newrelic_app_config_t->redirect_collector, \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"); Copy Environment variable: none Go In code: app, err = newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"App Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(os.Getenv(\"NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY\")), func(cfg *newrelic.Config) { cfg.Host = \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" }, ) Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Java In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Or set a system property of: newrelic.config.host Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST .NET In your XML config next to the license key: <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" host=\"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"/> Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Node.js In newrelic.js: host: 'gov-collector.newrelic.com' Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST PHP In newrelic.ini: newrelic.daemon.collector_host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: none Python In newrelic.ini: [newrelic] host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Ruby In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Elixir (open source agent) In config.exs: config :new_relic_agent, host: \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST For more on configuring APM agents, see APM configuration. Mobile monitoring agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using our mobile monitoring agents, all agent configurations must report to gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. You must use code-based configuration. Environment variables are not available. Framework-specific configurations: Agent Code or environment variable Android In code: NewRelic.withApplicationToken({APP_TOKEN}) .usingCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\") .usingCrashCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\") .start(this.getApplication()); Copy Environment variable: none iOS In code: [NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:@\"{APP_TOKEN}\" andCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\" andCrashCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\"]; Copy Environment variable: none Infrastructure monitoring If you have infrastructure agent version 1.15.0 or higher, simply enable the FedRAMP configuration option. This enables FedRAMP compliancy for data reported by the infrastructure agent, and for any on-host integrations that work with the infrastructure agent to report data. Important The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration is not currently FedRAMP compliant. If you have an older agent version, use the following values to edit your YAML configuration: Infrastructure agent versions below 1.15.0 If you have an infrastructure agent version below 1.15.0, you must change three of the endpoints used for reporting. To set these endpoints, you can change your YAML configuration or use environment variables. YAML config field Endpoint URL collector_url https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy identity_url https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy command_channel_url https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy To edit environment variables, use these values: Environment variable Endpoint URL NRIA_COLLECTOR_URL https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_IDENTITY_URL https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_COMMAND_CHANNEL_URL https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy Browser agent To configure the browser agent to use a FedRAMP-compliant endpoint, you must use the copy-paste method method (other browser agent install methods are not supported) and edit the browser code’s script element tag so that the domain is gov-bam.nr-data.net for both beacon and errorBeacon, like this: window.NREUM||(NREUM={});NREUM.info={\"beacon\":\"gov-bam.nr-data.net\",\"errorBeacon\":\"gov-bam.nr-data.net\"... Copy Note: You only need to modify the beacon and errorBeacon properties in the NREUM.info object. These values will override the default values found in the NR loader script. Data-ingest APIs Below are details about the FedRAMP endpoint for our ingest APIs: Metric API, the Event API, the Log API, and the Trace API. Metric API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the Metric API, instead of sending metric data to the default Metric API endpoint of https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1, it must be sent to https://gov-metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1. The Metric API can be used directly but it's mainly used by various New Relic tools. Below are instructions showing where to edit the configuration for setting the FedRAMP endpoint. Telemetry integrations Here are instructions for our open source telemetry integrations that report metric data: Dropwizard: use the overrideUri configuration. Kamon: use the metric-ingest-url configuration. See Override endpoints. Micrometer: override the public String uri() method on your NewRelicRegistryConfig to return the new endpoint. See an example. Prometheus: Prometheus OpenMetrics: if you are using our nri-prometheus helm chart, you can change the endpoint in your values.yml file, like in this example. If you're using the nri-bundle chart, you need to nest this value under the nri-prometheus key to propagate it to the sub-chart. Remote write integration: not available. Telemetry SDKs Here are instructions for our Telemetry SDKs that report metric data: Go: use the MetricsURLOverride configuration. Java: in the MetricBatchSender section, configure the endpoint. See an example. .NET: use the MetricUrlOverride configuration. Node.js: edit the METRIC_HOST = 'metric-api.newrelic.com' configuration. Python: edit the HOST = \"metric-api.newrelic.com\" configuration. Event API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for the Event API, all traffic reporting to insights-collector.newrelic.com must instead report to gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com. The Event API endpoint is configurable for the following Telemetry SDKs. The Telemetry SDKs are used by our open-source telemetry integrations. Language Solution Java Telemetry SDK In code: SenderConfiguration configuration = SenderConfiguration .builder( \"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\", EventBatchSender.EVENTS_PATH) .build(); EventBatchSender eventBatchSender = EventBatchSender.create(configuration); Copy Python Telemetry SDK In code: event_client = EventClient(host=\"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\") Copy For more information, see our Telemetry API documentation in GitHub. Log API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Log API, the solution for almost all our logging tools is to replace the https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 endpoint with https://gov-log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1. Here are details for various tools: Log forwarders Here are details on changing the endpoint for our log forwarders: AWS Firelens: Add the endpoint property to the options field of the logConfiguration, similar to to the EU account endpoint change shown in these Firelens endpoint configuration instructions. Fluentbit: Use our Fluentbit endpoint configuration. Fluentd: Use our Fluentd endpoint instructions. Infrastructure agent: See FedRAMP for infrastructure. Kubernetes: Our Kubernetes integration logs are based on fluentbit’s output plugin. Use these endpoint instructions. Logstash: Use our Logstash endpoint configuration. Syslog: For configuring syslog clients, see TCP endpoint configuration. S3: Not available. Vector: Not available. To use the Log API directly, you'd edit the Log API endpoint configuration. Trace API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Trace API (including telemetry integrations that use this API), replace the https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1 endpoint with https://gov-trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1. Notes about FedRAMP compliance for other trace data: Trace data is reported by some of our agents, like our APM agents, browser agent, and mobile agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for that data, you would enable FedRAMP for the applicable agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for Infinite Tracing, you would create a new FedRAMP compliant trace observer from the New Relic Edge app.",

This vulnerability, which affects multiple sites across the Internet, could be remotely exploited to leak sensitive information. Action by New Relic New Relic has reviewed all of our sites and applications, and we have determined that the majority of our sites, including www.newrelic.com, rpm.newrelic.com, and insights.newrelic.com are not vulnerable to this issue. New Relic did discover that the Documentation site (docs.newrelic.com) was vulnerable. This has now been patched, and the SSL certificate has been replaced. Change your password New Relic has no evidence that any customer data (including user names and passwords) was exposed. However, if you have any concerns about your account's protection, you should change your password. This procedure is for users who sign in directly to APM and do not have partner accounts or SAML SSO enabled accounts: Go to rpm.newrelic.com > (account dropdown) > User preferences. Type your Current password. Type your new Password (meeting minimum requirements), and then re-type the new password in Password confirmation. Select Save user preferences. Regenerate your API key. rpm.newrelic.com > (account dropdown) > User preferences: Anyone can change their own New Relic user name, account email, password, and other settings.",

High Security vulnerability ratings At New Relic, we use four levels to rate security vulnerability. Rating Description Critical A vulnerability in a New Relic product or service that could be exploited to compromise the confidentiality or integrity of your data. High Atypical or unintended information is likely to be received by New Relic, potentially compromising the confidentiality or integrity of your data. Medium Atypical or unintended information could be received by New Relic, but the risk of compromise is mitigated by default configuration or standard security practices. Low Atypical or unintended information may be received by New Relic, but the vulnerability would be difficult to exploit, or it would have minimal impact. Report security vulnerabilities to New Relic New Relic is committed to the security of our customers and your data. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in one of our products, services, or websites, we welcome and greatly appreciate you reporting it to our coordinated disclosure program.

Data-ingest APIs: for our Metric API, Event API, Trace API, and Log API, and the integrations that use those APIs. Agents New Relic has several agents for reporting data, like our APM agents, infrastructure agents, mobile agents, and browser agent. Setting these agents to send FedRAMP-compliant data involves setting a configuration setting to use the relevant FedRAMP endpoint. APM agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance, all APM agent configurations must report to gov-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. Depending on the agent, you can either use code-based configuration or an environment variable. Here are details on enabling this: Language Code or environment variable C SDK In code: strcpy(_newrelic_app_config_t->redirect_collector, \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"); Copy Environment variable: none Go In code: app, err = newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"App Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(os.Getenv(\"NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY\")), func(cfg *newrelic.Config) { cfg.Host = \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" }, ) Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Java In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Or set a system property of: newrelic.config.host Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST .NET In your XML config next to the license key: <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" host=\"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"/> Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Node.js In newrelic.js: host: 'gov-collector.newrelic.com' Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST PHP In newrelic.ini: newrelic.daemon.collector_host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: none Python In newrelic.ini: [newrelic] host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Ruby In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Elixir (open source agent) In config.exs: config :new_relic_agent, host: \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST For more on configuring APM agents, see APM configuration. Mobile monitoring agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using our mobile monitoring agents, all agent configurations must report to gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. You must use code-based configuration. Environment variables are not available. Framework-specific configurations: Agent Code or environment variable Android In code: NewRelic.withApplicationToken({APP_TOKEN}) .usingCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\") .usingCrashCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\") .start(this.getApplication()); Copy Environment variable: none iOS In code: [NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:@\"{APP_TOKEN}\" andCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\" andCrashCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\"]; Copy Environment variable: none Infrastructure monitoring If you have infrastructure agent version 1.15.0 or higher, simply enable the FedRAMP configuration option. This enables FedRAMP compliancy for data reported by the infrastructure agent, and for any on-host integrations that work with the infrastructure agent to report data. Important The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration is not currently FedRAMP compliant. If you have an older agent version, use the following values to edit your YAML configuration: Infrastructure agent versions below 1.15.0 If you have an infrastructure agent version below 1.15.0, you must change three of the endpoints used for reporting. To set these endpoints, you can change your YAML configuration or use environment variables. YAML config field Endpoint URL collector_url https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy identity_url https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy command_channel_url https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy To edit environment variables, use these values: Environment variable Endpoint URL NRIA_COLLECTOR_URL https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_IDENTITY_URL https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_COMMAND_CHANNEL_URL https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy Browser agent To configure the browser agent to use a FedRAMP-compliant endpoint, you must use the copy-paste method method (other browser agent install methods are not supported) and edit the browser code’s script element tag so that the domain is gov-bam.nr-data.net for both beacon and errorBeacon, like this: window.NREUM||(NREUM={});NREUM.info={\"beacon\":\"gov-bam.nr-data.net\",\"errorBeacon\":\"gov-bam.nr-data.net\"... Copy Note: You only need to modify the beacon and errorBeacon properties in the NREUM.info object. These values will override the default values found in the NR loader script. Data-ingest APIs Below are details about the FedRAMP endpoint for our ingest APIs: Metric API, the Event API, the Log API, and the Trace API. Metric API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the Metric API, instead of sending metric data to the default Metric API endpoint of https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1, it must be sent to https://gov-metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1. The Metric API can be used directly but it's mainly used by various New Relic tools. Below are instructions showing where to edit the configuration for setting the FedRAMP endpoint. Telemetry integrations Here are instructions for our open source telemetry integrations that report metric data: Dropwizard: use the overrideUri configuration. Kamon: use the metric-ingest-url configuration. See Override endpoints. Micrometer: override the public String uri() method on your NewRelicRegistryConfig to return the new endpoint. See an example. Prometheus: Prometheus OpenMetrics: if you are using our nri-prometheus helm chart, you can change the endpoint in your values.yml file, like in this example. If you're using the nri-bundle chart, you need to nest this value under the nri-prometheus key to propagate it to the sub-chart. Remote write integration: not available. Telemetry SDKs Here are instructions for our Telemetry SDKs that report metric data: Go: use the MetricsURLOverride configuration. Java: in the MetricBatchSender section, configure the endpoint. See an example. .NET: use the MetricUrlOverride configuration. Node.js: edit the METRIC_HOST = 'metric-api.newrelic.com' configuration. Python: edit the HOST = \"metric-api.newrelic.com\" configuration. Event API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for the Event API, all traffic reporting to insights-collector.newrelic.com must instead report to gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com. The Event API endpoint is configurable for the following Telemetry SDKs. The Telemetry SDKs are used by our open-source telemetry integrations. Language Solution Java Telemetry SDK In code: SenderConfiguration configuration = SenderConfiguration .builder( \"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\", EventBatchSender.EVENTS_PATH) .build(); EventBatchSender eventBatchSender = EventBatchSender.create(configuration); Copy Python Telemetry SDK In code: event_client = EventClient(host=\"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\") Copy For more information, see our Telemetry API documentation in GitHub. Log API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Log API, the solution for almost all our logging tools is to replace the https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 endpoint with https://gov-log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1. Here are details for various tools: Log forwarders Here are details on changing the endpoint for our log forwarders: AWS Firelens: Add the endpoint property to the options field of the logConfiguration, similar to to the EU account endpoint change shown in these Firelens endpoint configuration instructions. Fluentbit: Use our Fluentbit endpoint configuration. Fluentd: Use our Fluentd endpoint instructions. Infrastructure agent: See FedRAMP for infrastructure. Kubernetes: Our Kubernetes integration logs are based on fluentbit’s output plugin. Use these endpoint instructions. Logstash: Use our Logstash endpoint configuration. Syslog: For configuring syslog clients, see TCP endpoint configuration. S3: Not available. Vector: Not available. To use the Log API directly, you'd edit the Log API endpoint configuration. Trace API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Trace API (including telemetry integrations that use this API), replace the https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1 endpoint with https://gov-trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1. Notes about FedRAMP compliance for other trace data: Trace data is reported by some of our agents, like our APM agents, browser agent, and mobile agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for that data, you would enable FedRAMP for the applicable agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for Infinite Tracing, you would create a new FedRAMP compliant trace observer from the New Relic Edge app.",

      "body": "For customers with heightened regulatory or privacy needs, New Relic offers account-based, FIPS-compliant encryption-at-rest capabilities with unique keys per account. This protects data from inadvertent or intentional exposure, even in the event an attacker has access to the file system. It's important to maintain both a high level of protection and also optimal performance and long-term storage and retrieval of data. To do this, New Relic uses a two-tier system consisting of a data encryption key (DEK) and a master key, each with separate usage, storage, and rotation policies. For an overview of how we handle your data in transit and at rest, including details about the key management process for data encryption, see data encryption documentation. Encryption and decryption process When encryption at rest is enabled for an account, each new file is encrypted (AES-GCM with 256 bit keys) with a data encryption key that is unique to the account and the server writing the data. Each DEK is generated locally using a FIPS 140-2 validated cryptographic module on the server. Each account’s DEK is rotated every 24 hours or when it has been used to encrypt 64 GB of data. It can also be rotated manually, as-needed. The DEK that is used to encrypt a file is subsequently encrypted with the Master Key and appended in this wrapped format onto the encrypted data file. The key is encrypted remotely on our key management service (KMS), which is provided by AWS. In order to read a file, the process is reversed: First, the NRDB host on which the data resides extracts the wrapped DEK from the file and sends it to the KMS to be decrypted (unwrapped). Finally, the host decrypts the data file and processes it. Key rotation To prevent ciphertext attacks, a new data encryption key is generated for each account when the existing DEK has been used to encrypt 64 GB of data or every 24 hours if the data threshold is not met before then. The master key is used only to encrypt DEKs, so a ciphertext attack against it is improbable. In compliance with FIPS guidelines, the KMS automatically rotates the master key once a year. Each New Relic region contains a single master key, which is never transmitted out of the KMS. Key handling New Relic servers generate each DEK locally, and the plain text DEK is never written to disk. If an attacker gained access to process memory, they could retrieve the unencrypted DEK for that server and time period, but they would be unable to read data from any other time periods. The Master key is generated, stored, and used within a FIPS 140-2 validated hardware security module (HSM) on the KMS. Neither New Relic nor AWS employees can retrieve the plain text of the master key. Secure generation, management, backup, storage, and destruction are all handled and guaranteed by the KMS. Administrator access to key management functions is controlled and audited using AWS permissions and CloudTrail. FedRAMP authorization In addition to our usual review process for security-critical components, New Relic’s encryption system has been reviewed by a third party and found to meet all requirements of NIST SC-28(1) Protection of Information at Rest, SC-12(3) Cryptographic Key Establishment and Management, and SC-13 Cryptographic Protection. It is approved as part of our authorization for FedRAMP Moderate impact.",

This includes FIPS 140-2 compliance as well as security accreditation for the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP). New Relic is authorized for Moderate Impact SaaS Services (FedRAMP Authorized Moderate) for accounts that meet specific criteria. As a cloud service provider, we are committed to ensuring our compliance with FedRAMP's requirements for the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of your data. This document describes our data encryption methods, including who gets it, what data is encrypted, and how it works. For more information, see our security documentation and Security website, or contact your account representative. Encryption in transit All New Relic customers benefit from the security provided with data encryption in transit. TLS is required for all domains. Encryption in transit Comments Who gets it Data encryption in transit is automatically included in all New Relic subscriptions. What data is encrypted Encryption in transit applies to our agents and APIs. This also applies to any third-party telemetry sources that use TLS with New Relic, such as Prometheus OpenMetrics and other integrations. How it works Uses industry-standard transport layer security (TLS). Our preferred protocol for all domains is TLS 1.2. For more information about data transmission, firewalls, hosting, and storage, see our data security documentation. Disk encryption New Relic's disk-based encryption provides additional security while your data is at rest (FIPS 140-2 compliant). For more information, see the documentation about our Telemetry Data Platform and managing data retention. Disk-level encryption at rest Comments Who gets it Free for all New Relic customers where data is stored in Amazon AWS. What data is encrypted This encryption protects the physical disk where New Relic retains your data, including the following: Log management data Dimensional metrics data As we implement encryption at rest for additional telemetry types, your data will be encrypted automatically with no additional steps required by you. How it works New Relic uses Amazon AWS non-volatile, memory express SSD instance store volumes for disk-level data encryption at rest. The data on each instance storage device is encrypted using an XTS-AES-256 block cipher implemented in a hardware module on the instance. Encryption keys are generated using the hardware module and are unique to each instance storage device. All encryption keys are destroyed when the instance stops or terminates, and they cannot be recovered. As additional security measures: Disk-level encryption cannot be disabled. External encryption keys cannot be provided. Account-level encryption New Relic's account-level encryption at rest allows approved New Relic customers to benefit from even higher levels of security (FIPS 140-2 and FedRAMP Moderate compliant). Account-level encryption at rest Comments Who gets it Account-level data encryption depends on your New Relic subscription and your account hierarchy. For example, if your data is encrypted at the parent account level, your child account data also is automatically encrypted at rest. Available for: Government agencies Regulated industries, such as financial institutions and healthcare Other organizations that have heightened data protection needs or require compliance with PCI, HIPAA, or FedRAMP Account-level data encryption is available for approved customers. For more information, or to request account-level encryption, contact your New Relic account representative. Approved customers must send their data to New Relic's FedRAMP compliant endpoints. What data is encrypted Account-level encryption includes: Log management data Dimensional metrics used by Telemetry SDKs, Metric API, some integrations Events Distributed traces Backups for all data with account-level encryption How it works Master key: > Key management is performed outside New Relic's database with a FIPS 140-2 certified library using AES-GCM with 256-bit keys. The FIPS-certified Key Management System (KMS) rotates annually for each per-environment master key. The master key is generated inside a hardware security module (HSM) that is not exposed or stored externally. Data encryption key: Data files are encrypted with an account-specific data encryption key (DEK) generated on our hosts and rotated daily. The data encryption key is sent to the KMS to be encrypted (wrapped) by the master key, and the wrapped data encryption key is stored along with the data file. Process: Before reading a file, a host must first send the wrapped data encryption key to the KMS to be decrypted. To improve performance, an unwrapped data encryption key is cached temporarily on the host. For more information, see our documentation about key management for encryption at rest.",

      "body": "This document provides information on FedRAMP-compliant endpoints in New Relic. For more information about our security accreditation for the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP), see our data encryption documentation. Customer FedRAMP obligations New Relic customers must meet all of the following requirements for New Relic’s FedRAMP environment: New Relic-approved customers: New Relic’s FedRAMP-Moderate authorized environment is only available to New Relic-approved customers. For more information, contact your New Relic account representative. Order form: Customer’s order form with New Relic must include customer’s eligibility for FedRAMP. Subscription level: Customer must have a current and valid subscription to New Relic Full-Stack Observability Enterprise or New Relic-approved subscription. Authorized New Relic endpoints: Customer must send its data only to New Relic’s FedRAMP-designated endpoints. Authorized services and features: Customer must use only FedRAMP audited and authorized New Relic services and features (see below). Overview of data sources There are multiple ways to get data into New Relic. This doc has two sections: Agent settings: for our APM agents, infrastructure agent, browser agent, and mobile agent. Data-ingest APIs: for our Metric API, Event API, Trace API, and Log API, and the integrations that use those APIs. Agents New Relic has several agents for reporting data, like our APM agents, infrastructure agents, mobile agents, and browser agent. Setting these agents to send FedRAMP-compliant data involves setting a configuration setting to use the relevant FedRAMP endpoint. APM agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance, all APM agent configurations must report to gov-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. Depending on the agent, you can either use code-based configuration or an environment variable. Here are details on enabling this: Language Code or environment variable C SDK In code: strcpy(_newrelic_app_config_t->redirect_collector, \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"); Copy Environment variable: none Go In code: app, err = newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"App Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(os.Getenv(\"NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY\")), func(cfg *newrelic.Config) { cfg.Host = \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" }, ) Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Java In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Or set a system property of: newrelic.config.host Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST .NET In your XML config next to the license key: <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" host=\"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"/> Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Node.js In newrelic.js: host: 'gov-collector.newrelic.com' Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST PHP In newrelic.ini: newrelic.daemon.collector_host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: none Python In newrelic.ini: [newrelic] host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Ruby In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Elixir (open source agent) In config.exs: config :new_relic_agent, host: \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST For more on configuring APM agents, see APM configuration. Mobile monitoring agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using our mobile monitoring agents, all agent configurations must report to gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. You must use code-based configuration. Environment variables are not available. Framework-specific configurations: Agent Code or environment variable Android In code: NewRelic.withApplicationToken({APP_TOKEN}) .usingCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\") .usingCrashCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\") .start(this.getApplication()); Copy Environment variable: none iOS In code: [NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:@\"{APP_TOKEN}\" andCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\" andCrashCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\"]; Copy Environment variable: none Infrastructure monitoring If you have infrastructure agent version 1.15.0 or higher, simply enable the FedRAMP configuration option. This enables FedRAMP compliancy for data reported by the infrastructure agent, and for any on-host integrations that work with the infrastructure agent to report data. Important The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration is not currently FedRAMP compliant. If you have an older agent version, use the following values to edit your YAML configuration: Infrastructure agent versions below 1.15.0 If you have an infrastructure agent version below 1.15.0, you must change three of the endpoints used for reporting. To set these endpoints, you can change your YAML configuration or use environment variables. YAML config field Endpoint URL collector_url https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy identity_url https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy command_channel_url https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy To edit environment variables, use these values: Environment variable Endpoint URL NRIA_COLLECTOR_URL https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_IDENTITY_URL https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_COMMAND_CHANNEL_URL https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy Browser agent To configure the browser agent to use a FedRAMP-compliant endpoint, you must use the copy-paste method method (other browser agent install methods are not supported) and edit the browser code’s script element tag so that the domain is gov-bam.nr-data.net for both beacon and errorBeacon, like this: window.NREUM||(NREUM={});NREUM.info={\"beacon\":\"gov-bam.nr-data.net\",\"errorBeacon\":\"gov-bam.nr-data.net\"... Copy Note: You only need to modify the beacon and errorBeacon properties in the NREUM.info object. These values will override the default values found in the NR loader script. Data-ingest APIs Below are details about the FedRAMP endpoint for our ingest APIs: Metric API, the Event API, the Log API, and the Trace API. Metric API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the Metric API, instead of sending metric data to the default Metric API endpoint of https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1, it must be sent to https://gov-metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1. The Metric API can be used directly but it's mainly used by various New Relic tools. Below are instructions showing where to edit the configuration for setting the FedRAMP endpoint. Telemetry integrations Here are instructions for our open source telemetry integrations that report metric data: Dropwizard: use the overrideUri configuration. Kamon: use the metric-ingest-url configuration. See Override endpoints. Micrometer: override the public String uri() method on your NewRelicRegistryConfig to return the new endpoint. See an example. Prometheus: Prometheus OpenMetrics: if you are using our nri-prometheus helm chart, you can change the endpoint in your values.yml file, like in this example. If you're using the nri-bundle chart, you need to nest this value under the nri-prometheus key to propagate it to the sub-chart. Remote write integration: not available. Telemetry SDKs Here are instructions for our Telemetry SDKs that report metric data: Go: use the MetricsURLOverride configuration. Java: in the MetricBatchSender section, configure the endpoint. See an example. .NET: use the MetricUrlOverride configuration. Node.js: edit the METRIC_HOST = 'metric-api.newrelic.com' configuration. Python: edit the HOST = \"metric-api.newrelic.com\" configuration. Event API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for the Event API, all traffic reporting to insights-collector.newrelic.com must instead report to gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com. The Event API endpoint is configurable for the following Telemetry SDKs. The Telemetry SDKs are used by our open-source telemetry integrations. Language Solution Java Telemetry SDK In code: SenderConfiguration configuration = SenderConfiguration .builder( \"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\", EventBatchSender.EVENTS_PATH) .build(); EventBatchSender eventBatchSender = EventBatchSender.create(configuration); Copy Python Telemetry SDK In code: event_client = EventClient(host=\"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\") Copy For more information, see our Telemetry API documentation in GitHub. Log API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Log API, the solution for almost all our logging tools is to replace the https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 endpoint with https://gov-log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1. Here are details for various tools: Log forwarders Here are details on changing the endpoint for our log forwarders: AWS Firelens: Add the endpoint property to the options field of the logConfiguration, similar to to the EU account endpoint change shown in these Firelens endpoint configuration instructions. Fluentbit: Use our Fluentbit endpoint configuration. Fluentd: Use our Fluentd endpoint instructions. Infrastructure agent: See FedRAMP for infrastructure. Kubernetes: Our Kubernetes integration logs are based on fluentbit’s output plugin. Use these endpoint instructions. Logstash: Use our Logstash endpoint configuration. Syslog: For configuring syslog clients, see TCP endpoint configuration. S3: Not available. Vector: Not available. To use the Log API directly, you'd edit the Log API endpoint configuration. Trace API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Trace API (including telemetry integrations that use this API), replace the https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1 endpoint with https://gov-trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1. Notes about FedRAMP compliance for other trace data: Trace data is reported by some of our agents, like our APM agents, browser agent, and mobile agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for that data, you would enable FedRAMP for the applicable agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for Infinite Tracing, you would create a new FedRAMP compliant trace observer from the New Relic Edge app.",

      "body": "For customers with heightened regulatory or privacy needs, New Relic offers account-based, FIPS-compliant encryption-at-rest capabilities with unique keys per account. This protects data from inadvertent or intentional exposure, even in the event an attacker has access to the file system. It's important to maintain both a high level of protection and also optimal performance and long-term storage and retrieval of data. To do this, New Relic uses a two-tier system consisting of a data encryption key (DEK) and a master key, each with separate usage, storage, and rotation policies. For an overview of how we handle your data in transit and at rest, including details about the key management process for data encryption, see data encryption documentation. Encryption and decryption process When encryption at rest is enabled for an account, each new file is encrypted (AES-GCM with 256 bit keys) with a data encryption key that is unique to the account and the server writing the data. Each DEK is generated locally using a FIPS 140-2 validated cryptographic module on the server. Each account’s DEK is rotated every 24 hours or when it has been used to encrypt 64 GB of data. It can also be rotated manually, as-needed. The DEK that is used to encrypt a file is subsequently encrypted with the Master Key and appended in this wrapped format onto the encrypted data file. The key is encrypted remotely on our key management service (KMS), which is provided by AWS. In order to read a file, the process is reversed: First, the NRDB host on which the data resides extracts the wrapped DEK from the file and sends it to the KMS to be decrypted (unwrapped). Finally, the host decrypts the data file and processes it. Key rotation To prevent ciphertext attacks, a new data encryption key is generated for each account when the existing DEK has been used to encrypt 64 GB of data or every 24 hours if the data threshold is not met before then. The master key is used only to encrypt DEKs, so a ciphertext attack against it is improbable. In compliance with FIPS guidelines, the KMS automatically rotates the master key once a year. Each New Relic region contains a single master key, which is never transmitted out of the KMS. Key handling New Relic servers generate each DEK locally, and the plain text DEK is never written to disk. If an attacker gained access to process memory, they could retrieve the unencrypted DEK for that server and time period, but they would be unable to read data from any other time periods. The Master key is generated, stored, and used within a FIPS 140-2 validated hardware security module (HSM) on the KMS. Neither New Relic nor AWS employees can retrieve the plain text of the master key. Secure generation, management, backup, storage, and destruction are all handled and guaranteed by the KMS. Administrator access to key management functions is controlled and audited using AWS permissions and CloudTrail. FedRAMP authorization In addition to our usual review process for security-critical components, New Relic’s encryption system has been reviewed by a third party and found to meet all requirements of NIST SC-28(1) Protection of Information at Rest, SC-12(3) Cryptographic Key Establishment and Management, and SC-13 Cryptographic Protection. It is approved as part of our authorization for FedRAMP Moderate impact.",

      "body": "This document provides information on FedRAMP-compliant endpoints in New Relic. For more information about our security accreditation for the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP), see our data encryption documentation. Customer FedRAMP obligations New Relic customers must meet all of the following requirements for New Relic’s FedRAMP environment: New Relic-approved customers: New Relic’s FedRAMP-Moderate authorized environment is only available to New Relic-approved customers. For more information, contact your New Relic account representative. Order form: Customer’s order form with New Relic must include customer’s eligibility for FedRAMP. Subscription level: Customer must have a current and valid subscription to New Relic Full-Stack Observability Enterprise or New Relic-approved subscription. Authorized New Relic endpoints: Customer must send its data only to New Relic’s FedRAMP-designated endpoints. Authorized services and features: Customer must use only FedRAMP audited and authorized New Relic services and features (see below). Overview of data sources There are multiple ways to get data into New Relic. This doc has two sections: Agent settings: for our APM agents, infrastructure agent, browser agent, and mobile agent. Data-ingest APIs: for our Metric API, Event API, Trace API, and Log API, and the integrations that use those APIs. Agents New Relic has several agents for reporting data, like our APM agents, infrastructure agents, mobile agents, and browser agent. Setting these agents to send FedRAMP-compliant data involves setting a configuration setting to use the relevant FedRAMP endpoint. APM agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance, all APM agent configurations must report to gov-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. Depending on the agent, you can either use code-based configuration or an environment variable. Here are details on enabling this: Language Code or environment variable C SDK In code: strcpy(_newrelic_app_config_t->redirect_collector, \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"); Copy Environment variable: none Go In code: app, err = newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"App Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(os.Getenv(\"NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY\")), func(cfg *newrelic.Config) { cfg.Host = \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" }, ) Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Java In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Or set a system property of: newrelic.config.host Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST .NET In your XML config next to the license key: <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" host=\"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"/> Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Node.js In newrelic.js: host: 'gov-collector.newrelic.com' Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST PHP In newrelic.ini: newrelic.daemon.collector_host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: none Python In newrelic.ini: [newrelic] host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Ruby In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Elixir (open source agent) In config.exs: config :new_relic_agent, host: \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST For more on configuring APM agents, see APM configuration. Mobile monitoring agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using our mobile monitoring agents, all agent configurations must report to gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. You must use code-based configuration. Environment variables are not available. Framework-specific configurations: Agent Code or environment variable Android In code: NewRelic.withApplicationToken({APP_TOKEN}) .usingCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\") .usingCrashCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\") .start(this.getApplication()); Copy Environment variable: none iOS In code: [NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:@\"{APP_TOKEN}\" andCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\" andCrashCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\"]; Copy Environment variable: none Infrastructure monitoring If you have infrastructure agent version 1.15.0 or higher, simply enable the FedRAMP configuration option. This enables FedRAMP compliancy for data reported by the infrastructure agent, and for any on-host integrations that work with the infrastructure agent to report data. Important The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration is not currently FedRAMP compliant. If you have an older agent version, use the following values to edit your YAML configuration: Infrastructure agent versions below 1.15.0 If you have an infrastructure agent version below 1.15.0, you must change three of the endpoints used for reporting. To set these endpoints, you can change your YAML configuration or use environment variables. YAML config field Endpoint URL collector_url https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy identity_url https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy command_channel_url https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy To edit environment variables, use these values: Environment variable Endpoint URL NRIA_COLLECTOR_URL https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_IDENTITY_URL https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_COMMAND_CHANNEL_URL https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy Browser agent To configure the browser agent to use a FedRAMP-compliant endpoint, you must use the copy-paste method method (other browser agent install methods are not supported) and edit the browser code’s script element tag so that the domain is gov-bam.nr-data.net for both beacon and errorBeacon, like this: window.NREUM||(NREUM={});NREUM.info={\"beacon\":\"gov-bam.nr-data.net\",\"errorBeacon\":\"gov-bam.nr-data.net\"... Copy Note: You only need to modify the beacon and errorBeacon properties in the NREUM.info object. These values will override the default values found in the NR loader script. Data-ingest APIs Below are details about the FedRAMP endpoint for our ingest APIs: Metric API, the Event API, the Log API, and the Trace API. Metric API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the Metric API, instead of sending metric data to the default Metric API endpoint of https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1, it must be sent to https://gov-metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1. The Metric API can be used directly but it's mainly used by various New Relic tools. Below are instructions showing where to edit the configuration for setting the FedRAMP endpoint. Telemetry integrations Here are instructions for our open source telemetry integrations that report metric data: Dropwizard: use the overrideUri configuration. Kamon: use the metric-ingest-url configuration. See Override endpoints. Micrometer: override the public String uri() method on your NewRelicRegistryConfig to return the new endpoint. See an example. Prometheus: Prometheus OpenMetrics: if you are using our nri-prometheus helm chart, you can change the endpoint in your values.yml file, like in this example. If you're using the nri-bundle chart, you need to nest this value under the nri-prometheus key to propagate it to the sub-chart. Remote write integration: not available. Telemetry SDKs Here are instructions for our Telemetry SDKs that report metric data: Go: use the MetricsURLOverride configuration. Java: in the MetricBatchSender section, configure the endpoint. See an example. .NET: use the MetricUrlOverride configuration. Node.js: edit the METRIC_HOST = 'metric-api.newrelic.com' configuration. Python: edit the HOST = \"metric-api.newrelic.com\" configuration. Event API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for the Event API, all traffic reporting to insights-collector.newrelic.com must instead report to gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com. The Event API endpoint is configurable for the following Telemetry SDKs. The Telemetry SDKs are used by our open-source telemetry integrations. Language Solution Java Telemetry SDK In code: SenderConfiguration configuration = SenderConfiguration .builder( \"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\", EventBatchSender.EVENTS_PATH) .build(); EventBatchSender eventBatchSender = EventBatchSender.create(configuration); Copy Python Telemetry SDK In code: event_client = EventClient(host=\"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\") Copy For more information, see our Telemetry API documentation in GitHub. Log API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Log API, the solution for almost all our logging tools is to replace the https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 endpoint with https://gov-log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1. Here are details for various tools: Log forwarders Here are details on changing the endpoint for our log forwarders: AWS Firelens: Add the endpoint property to the options field of the logConfiguration, similar to to the EU account endpoint change shown in these Firelens endpoint configuration instructions. Fluentbit: Use our Fluentbit endpoint configuration. Fluentd: Use our Fluentd endpoint instructions. Infrastructure agent: See FedRAMP for infrastructure. Kubernetes: Our Kubernetes integration logs are based on fluentbit’s output plugin. Use these endpoint instructions. Logstash: Use our Logstash endpoint configuration. Syslog: For configuring syslog clients, see TCP endpoint configuration. S3: Not available. Vector: Not available. To use the Log API directly, you'd edit the Log API endpoint configuration. Trace API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Trace API (including telemetry integrations that use this API), replace the https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1 endpoint with https://gov-trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1. Notes about FedRAMP compliance for other trace data: Trace data is reported by some of our agents, like our APM agents, browser agent, and mobile agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for that data, you would enable FedRAMP for the applicable agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for Infinite Tracing, you would create a new FedRAMP compliant trace observer from the New Relic Edge app.",

This includes FIPS 140-2 compliance as well as security accreditation for the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP). New Relic is authorized for Moderate Impact SaaS Services (FedRAMP Authorized Moderate) for accounts that meet specific criteria. As a cloud service provider, we are committed to ensuring our compliance with FedRAMP's requirements for the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of your data. This document describes our data encryption methods, including who gets it, what data is encrypted, and how it works. For more information, see our security documentation and Security website, or contact your account representative. Encryption in transit All New Relic customers benefit from the security provided with data encryption in transit. TLS is required for all domains. Encryption in transit Comments Who gets it Data encryption in transit is automatically included in all New Relic subscriptions. What data is encrypted Encryption in transit applies to our agents and APIs. This also applies to any third-party telemetry sources that use TLS with New Relic, such as Prometheus OpenMetrics and other integrations. How it works Uses industry-standard transport layer security (TLS). Our preferred protocol for all domains is TLS 1.2. For more information about data transmission, firewalls, hosting, and storage, see our data security documentation. Disk encryption New Relic's disk-based encryption provides additional security while your data is at rest (FIPS 140-2 compliant). For more information, see the documentation about our Telemetry Data Platform and managing data retention. Disk-level encryption at rest Comments Who gets it Free for all New Relic customers where data is stored in Amazon AWS. What data is encrypted This encryption protects the physical disk where New Relic retains your data, including the following: Log management data Dimensional metrics data As we implement encryption at rest for additional telemetry types, your data will be encrypted automatically with no additional steps required by you. How it works New Relic uses Amazon AWS non-volatile, memory express SSD instance store volumes for disk-level data encryption at rest. The data on each instance storage device is encrypted using an XTS-AES-256 block cipher implemented in a hardware module on the instance. Encryption keys are generated using the hardware module and are unique to each instance storage device. All encryption keys are destroyed when the instance stops or terminates, and they cannot be recovered. As additional security measures: Disk-level encryption cannot be disabled. External encryption keys cannot be provided. Account-level encryption New Relic's account-level encryption at rest allows approved New Relic customers to benefit from even higher levels of security (FIPS 140-2 and FedRAMP Moderate compliant). Account-level encryption at rest Comments Who gets it Account-level data encryption depends on your New Relic subscription and your account hierarchy. For example, if your data is encrypted at the parent account level, your child account data also is automatically encrypted at rest. Available for: Government agencies Regulated industries, such as financial institutions and healthcare Other organizations that have heightened data protection needs or require compliance with PCI, HIPAA, or FedRAMP Account-level data encryption is available for approved customers. For more information, or to request account-level encryption, contact your New Relic account representative. Approved customers must send their data to New Relic's FedRAMP compliant endpoints. What data is encrypted Account-level encryption includes: Log management data Dimensional metrics used by Telemetry SDKs, Metric API, some integrations Events Distributed traces Backups for all data with account-level encryption How it works Master key: > Key management is performed outside New Relic's database with a FIPS 140-2 certified library using AES-GCM with 256-bit keys. The FIPS-certified Key Management System (KMS) rotates annually for each per-environment master key. The master key is generated inside a hardware security module (HSM) that is not exposed or stored externally. Data encryption key: Data files are encrypted with an account-specific data encryption key (DEK) generated on our hosts and rotated daily. The data encryption key is sent to the KMS to be encrypted (wrapped) by the master key, and the wrapped data encryption key is stored along with the data file. Process: Before reading a file, a host must first send the wrapped data encryption key to the KMS to be decrypted. To improve performance, an unwrapped data encryption key is cached temporarily on the host. For more information, see our documentation about key management for encryption at rest.",

Authorized New Relic endpoints: Customer must send its data only to New Relic’s FedRAMP-designated endpoints. Authorized services and features: Customer must use only FedRAMP audited and authorized New Relic services and features (see below). Overview of data sources There are multiple ways to get data into New Relic. This doc has two sections: Agent settings: for our APM agents, infrastructure agent, browser agent, and mobile agent. Data-ingest APIs: for our Metric API, Event API, Trace API, and Log API, and the integrations that use those APIs. Agents New Relic has several agents for reporting data, like our APM agents, infrastructure agents, mobile agents, and browser agent. Setting these agents to send FedRAMP-compliant data involves setting a configuration setting to use the relevant FedRAMP endpoint. APM agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance, all APM agent configurations must report to gov-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. Depending on the agent, you can either use code-based configuration or an environment variable. Here are details on enabling this: Language Code or environment variable C SDK In code: strcpy(_newrelic_app_config_t->redirect_collector, \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"); Copy Environment variable: none Go In code: app, err = newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"App Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(os.Getenv(\"NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY\")), func(cfg *newrelic.Config) { cfg.Host = \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" }, ) Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Java In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Or set a system property of: newrelic.config.host Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST .NET In your XML config next to the license key: <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" host=\"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"/> Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Node.js In newrelic.js: host: 'gov-collector.newrelic.com' Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST PHP In newrelic.ini: newrelic.daemon.collector_host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: none Python In newrelic.ini: [newrelic] host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Ruby In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Elixir (open source agent) In config.exs: config :new_relic_agent, host: \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST For more on configuring APM agents, see APM configuration. Mobile monitoring agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using our mobile monitoring agents, all agent configurations must report to gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. You must use code-based configuration. Environment variables are not available. Framework-specific configurations: Agent Code or environment variable Android In code: NewRelic.withApplicationToken({APP_TOKEN}) .usingCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\") .usingCrashCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\") .start(this.getApplication()); Copy Environment variable: none iOS In code: [NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:@\"{APP_TOKEN}\" andCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\" andCrashCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\"]; Copy Environment variable: none Infrastructure monitoring If you have infrastructure agent version 1.15.0 or higher, simply enable the FedRAMP configuration option. This enables FedRAMP compliancy for data reported by the infrastructure agent, and for any on-host integrations that work with the infrastructure agent to report data. Important The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration is not currently FedRAMP compliant. If you have an older agent version, use the following values to edit your YAML configuration: Infrastructure agent versions below 1.15.0 If you have an infrastructure agent version below 1.15.0, you must change three of the endpoints used for reporting. To set these endpoints, you can change your YAML configuration or use environment variables. YAML config field Endpoint URL collector_url https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy identity_url https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy command_channel_url https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy To edit environment variables, use these values: Environment variable Endpoint URL NRIA_COLLECTOR_URL https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_IDENTITY_URL https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_COMMAND_CHANNEL_URL https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy Browser agent To configure the browser agent to use a FedRAMP-compliant endpoint, you must use the copy-paste method method (other browser agent install methods are not supported) and edit the browser code’s script element tag so that the domain is gov-bam.nr-data.net for both beacon and errorBeacon, like this: window.NREUM||(NREUM={});NREUM.info={\"beacon\":\"gov-bam.nr-data.net\",\"errorBeacon\":\"gov-bam.nr-data.net\"... Copy Note: You only need to modify the beacon and errorBeacon properties in the NREUM.info object. These values will override the default values found in the NR loader script. Data-ingest APIs Below are details about the FedRAMP endpoint for our ingest APIs: Metric API, the Event API, the Log API, and the Trace API. Metric API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the Metric API, instead of sending metric data to the default Metric API endpoint of https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1, it must be sent to https://gov-metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1. The Metric API can be used directly but it's mainly used by various New Relic tools. Below are instructions showing where to edit the configuration for setting the FedRAMP endpoint. Telemetry integrations Here are instructions for our open source telemetry integrations that report metric data: Dropwizard: use the overrideUri configuration. Kamon: use the metric-ingest-url configuration. See Override endpoints. Micrometer: override the public String uri() method on your NewRelicRegistryConfig to return the new endpoint. See an example. Prometheus: Prometheus OpenMetrics: if you are using our nri-prometheus helm chart, you can change the endpoint in your values.yml file, like in this example. If you're using the nri-bundle chart, you need to nest this value under the nri-prometheus key to propagate it to the sub-chart. Remote write integration: not available. Telemetry SDKs Here are instructions for our Telemetry SDKs that report metric data: Go: use the MetricsURLOverride configuration. Java: in the MetricBatchSender section, configure the endpoint. See an example. .NET: use the MetricUrlOverride configuration. Node.js: edit the METRIC_HOST = 'metric-api.newrelic.com' configuration. Python: edit the HOST = \"metric-api.newrelic.com\" configuration. Event API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for the Event API, all traffic reporting to insights-collector.newrelic.com must instead report to gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com. The Event API endpoint is configurable for the following Telemetry SDKs. The Telemetry SDKs are used by our open-source telemetry integrations. Language Solution Java Telemetry SDK In code: SenderConfiguration configuration = SenderConfiguration .builder( \"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\", EventBatchSender.EVENTS_PATH) .build(); EventBatchSender eventBatchSender = EventBatchSender.create(configuration); Copy Python Telemetry SDK In code: event_client = EventClient(host=\"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\") Copy For more information, see our Telemetry API documentation in GitHub. Log API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Log API, the solution for almost all our logging tools is to replace the https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 endpoint with https://gov-log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1. Here are details for various tools: Log forwarders Here are details on changing the endpoint for our log forwarders: AWS Firelens: Add the endpoint property to the options field of the logConfiguration, similar to to the EU account endpoint change shown in these Firelens endpoint configuration instructions. Fluentbit: Use our Fluentbit endpoint configuration. Fluentd: Use our Fluentd endpoint instructions. Infrastructure agent: See FedRAMP for infrastructure. Kubernetes: Our Kubernetes integration logs are based on fluentbit’s output plugin. Use these endpoint instructions. Logstash: Use our Logstash endpoint configuration. Syslog: For configuring syslog clients, see TCP endpoint configuration. S3: Not available. Vector: Not available. To use the Log API directly, you'd edit the Log API endpoint configuration. Trace API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Trace API (including telemetry integrations that use this API), replace the https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1 endpoint with https://gov-trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1.

      "body": "For customers with heightened regulatory or privacy needs, New Relic offers account-based, FIPS-compliant encryption-at-rest capabilities with unique keys per account. This protects data from inadvertent or intentional exposure, even in the event an attacker has access to the file system. It's important to maintain both a high level of protection and also optimal performance and long-term storage and retrieval of data. To do this, New Relic uses a two-tier system consisting of a data encryption key (DEK) and a master key, each with separate usage, storage, and rotation policies. For an overview of how we handle your data in transit and at rest, including details about the key management process for data encryption, see data encryption documentation. Encryption and decryption process When encryption at rest is enabled for an account, each new file is encrypted (AES-GCM with 256 bit keys) with a data encryption key that is unique to the account and the server writing the data. Each DEK is generated locally using a FIPS 140-2 validated cryptographic module on the server. Each account’s DEK is rotated every 24 hours or when it has been used to encrypt 64 GB of data. It can also be rotated manually, as-needed. The DEK that is used to encrypt a file is subsequently encrypted with the Master Key and appended in this wrapped format onto the encrypted data file. The key is encrypted remotely on our key management service (KMS), which is provided by AWS. In order to read a file, the process is reversed: First, the NRDB host on which the data resides extracts the wrapped DEK from the file and sends it to the KMS to be decrypted (unwrapped). Finally, the host decrypts the data file and processes it. Key rotation To prevent ciphertext attacks, a new data encryption key is generated for each account when the existing DEK has been used to encrypt 64 GB of data or every 24 hours if the data threshold is not met before then. The master key is used only to encrypt DEKs, so a ciphertext attack against it is improbable. In compliance with FIPS guidelines, the KMS automatically rotates the master key once a year. Each New Relic region contains a single master key, which is never transmitted out of the KMS. Key handling New Relic servers generate each DEK locally, and the plain text DEK is never written to disk. If an attacker gained access to process memory, they could retrieve the unencrypted DEK for that server and time period, but they would be unable to read data from any other time periods. The Master key is generated, stored, and used within a FIPS 140-2 validated hardware security module (HSM) on the KMS. Neither New Relic nor AWS employees can retrieve the plain text of the master key. Secure generation, management, backup, storage, and destruction are all handled and guaranteed by the KMS. Administrator access to key management functions is controlled and audited using AWS permissions and CloudTrail. FedRAMP authorization In addition to our usual review process for security-critical components, New Relic’s encryption system has been reviewed by a third party and found to meet all requirements of NIST SC-28(1) Protection of Information at Rest, SC-12(3) Cryptographic Key Establishment and Management, and SC-13 Cryptographic Protection. It is approved as part of our authorization for FedRAMP Moderate impact.",

This includes FIPS 140-2 compliance as well as security accreditation for the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP). New Relic is authorized for Moderate Impact SaaS Services (FedRAMP Authorized Moderate) for accounts that meet specific criteria. As a cloud service provider, we are committed to ensuring our compliance with FedRAMP's requirements for the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of your data. This document describes our data encryption methods, including who gets it, what data is encrypted, and how it works. For more information, see our security documentation and Security website, or contact your account representative. Encryption in transit All New Relic customers benefit from the security provided with data encryption in transit. TLS is required for all domains. Encryption in transit Comments Who gets it Data encryption in transit is automatically included in all New Relic subscriptions. What data is encrypted Encryption in transit applies to our agents and APIs. This also applies to any third-party telemetry sources that use TLS with New Relic, such as Prometheus OpenMetrics and other integrations. How it works Uses industry-standard transport layer security (TLS). Our preferred protocol for all domains is TLS 1.2. For more information about data transmission, firewalls, hosting, and storage, see our data security documentation. Disk encryption New Relic's disk-based encryption provides additional security while your data is at rest (FIPS 140-2 compliant). For more information, see the documentation about our Telemetry Data Platform and managing data retention. Disk-level encryption at rest Comments Who gets it Free for all New Relic customers where data is stored in Amazon AWS. What data is encrypted This encryption protects the physical disk where New Relic retains your data, including the following: Log management data Dimensional metrics data As we implement encryption at rest for additional telemetry types, your data will be encrypted automatically with no additional steps required by you. How it works New Relic uses Amazon AWS non-volatile, memory express SSD instance store volumes for disk-level data encryption at rest. The data on each instance storage device is encrypted using an XTS-AES-256 block cipher implemented in a hardware module on the instance. Encryption keys are generated using the hardware module and are unique to each instance storage device. All encryption keys are destroyed when the instance stops or terminates, and they cannot be recovered. As additional security measures: Disk-level encryption cannot be disabled. External encryption keys cannot be provided. Account-level encryption New Relic's account-level encryption at rest allows approved New Relic customers to benefit from even higher levels of security (FIPS 140-2 and FedRAMP Moderate compliant). Account-level encryption at rest Comments Who gets it Account-level data encryption depends on your New Relic subscription and your account hierarchy. For example, if your data is encrypted at the parent account level, your child account data also is automatically encrypted at rest. Available for: Government agencies Regulated industries, such as financial institutions and healthcare Other organizations that have heightened data protection needs or require compliance with PCI, HIPAA, or FedRAMP Account-level data encryption is available for approved customers. For more information, or to request account-level encryption, contact your New Relic account representative. Approved customers must send their data to New Relic's FedRAMP compliant endpoints. What data is encrypted Account-level encryption includes: Log management data Dimensional metrics used by Telemetry SDKs, Metric API, some integrations Events Distributed traces Backups for all data with account-level encryption How it works Master key: > Key management is performed outside New Relic's database with a FIPS 140-2 certified library using AES-GCM with 256-bit keys. The FIPS-certified Key Management System (KMS) rotates annually for each per-environment master key. The master key is generated inside a hardware security module (HSM) that is not exposed or stored externally. Data encryption key: Data files are encrypted with an account-specific data encryption key (DEK) generated on our hosts and rotated daily. The data encryption key is sent to the KMS to be encrypted (wrapped) by the master key, and the wrapped data encryption key is stored along with the data file. Process: Before reading a file, a host must first send the wrapped data encryption key to the KMS to be decrypted. To improve performance, an unwrapped data encryption key is cached temporarily on the host. For more information, see our documentation about key management for encryption at rest.",

Authorized New Relic endpoints: Customer must send its data only to New Relic’s FedRAMP-designated endpoints. Authorized services and features: Customer must use only FedRAMP audited and authorized New Relic services and features (see below). Overview of data sources There are multiple ways to get data into New Relic. This doc has two sections: Agent settings: for our APM agents, infrastructure agent, browser agent, and mobile agent. Data-ingest APIs: for our Metric API, Event API, Trace API, and Log API, and the integrations that use those APIs. Agents New Relic has several agents for reporting data, like our APM agents, infrastructure agents, mobile agents, and browser agent. Setting these agents to send FedRAMP-compliant data involves setting a configuration setting to use the relevant FedRAMP endpoint. APM agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance, all APM agent configurations must report to gov-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. Depending on the agent, you can either use code-based configuration or an environment variable. Here are details on enabling this: Language Code or environment variable C SDK In code: strcpy(_newrelic_app_config_t->redirect_collector, \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"); Copy Environment variable: none Go In code: app, err = newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"App Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(os.Getenv(\"NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY\")), func(cfg *newrelic.Config) { cfg.Host = \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" }, ) Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Java In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Or set a system property of: newrelic.config.host Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST .NET In your XML config next to the license key: <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" host=\"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"/> Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Node.js In newrelic.js: host: 'gov-collector.newrelic.com' Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST PHP In newrelic.ini: newrelic.daemon.collector_host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: none Python In newrelic.ini: [newrelic] host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Ruby In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Elixir (open source agent) In config.exs: config :new_relic_agent, host: \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST For more on configuring APM agents, see APM configuration. Mobile monitoring agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using our mobile monitoring agents, all agent configurations must report to gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. You must use code-based configuration. Environment variables are not available. Framework-specific configurations: Agent Code or environment variable Android In code: NewRelic.withApplicationToken({APP_TOKEN}) .usingCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\") .usingCrashCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\") .start(this.getApplication()); Copy Environment variable: none iOS In code: [NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:@\"{APP_TOKEN}\" andCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\" andCrashCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\"]; Copy Environment variable: none Infrastructure monitoring If you have infrastructure agent version 1.15.0 or higher, simply enable the FedRAMP configuration option. This enables FedRAMP compliancy for data reported by the infrastructure agent, and for any on-host integrations that work with the infrastructure agent to report data. Important The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration is not currently FedRAMP compliant. If you have an older agent version, use the following values to edit your YAML configuration: Infrastructure agent versions below 1.15.0 If you have an infrastructure agent version below 1.15.0, you must change three of the endpoints used for reporting. To set these endpoints, you can change your YAML configuration or use environment variables. YAML config field Endpoint URL collector_url https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy identity_url https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy command_channel_url https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy To edit environment variables, use these values: Environment variable Endpoint URL NRIA_COLLECTOR_URL https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_IDENTITY_URL https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_COMMAND_CHANNEL_URL https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy Browser agent To configure the browser agent to use a FedRAMP-compliant endpoint, you must use the copy-paste method method (other browser agent install methods are not supported) and edit the browser code’s script element tag so that the domain is gov-bam.nr-data.net for both beacon and errorBeacon, like this: window.NREUM||(NREUM={});NREUM.info={\"beacon\":\"gov-bam.nr-data.net\",\"errorBeacon\":\"gov-bam.nr-data.net\"... Copy Note: You only need to modify the beacon and errorBeacon properties in the NREUM.info object. These values will override the default values found in the NR loader script. Data-ingest APIs Below are details about the FedRAMP endpoint for our ingest APIs: Metric API, the Event API, the Log API, and the Trace API. Metric API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the Metric API, instead of sending metric data to the default Metric API endpoint of https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1, it must be sent to https://gov-metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1. The Metric API can be used directly but it's mainly used by various New Relic tools. Below are instructions showing where to edit the configuration for setting the FedRAMP endpoint. Telemetry integrations Here are instructions for our open source telemetry integrations that report metric data: Dropwizard: use the overrideUri configuration. Kamon: use the metric-ingest-url configuration. See Override endpoints. Micrometer: override the public String uri() method on your NewRelicRegistryConfig to return the new endpoint. See an example. Prometheus: Prometheus OpenMetrics: if you are using our nri-prometheus helm chart, you can change the endpoint in your values.yml file, like in this example. If you're using the nri-bundle chart, you need to nest this value under the nri-prometheus key to propagate it to the sub-chart. Remote write integration: not available. Telemetry SDKs Here are instructions for our Telemetry SDKs that report metric data: Go: use the MetricsURLOverride configuration. Java: in the MetricBatchSender section, configure the endpoint. See an example. .NET: use the MetricUrlOverride configuration. Node.js: edit the METRIC_HOST = 'metric-api.newrelic.com' configuration. Python: edit the HOST = \"metric-api.newrelic.com\" configuration. Event API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for the Event API, all traffic reporting to insights-collector.newrelic.com must instead report to gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com. The Event API endpoint is configurable for the following Telemetry SDKs. The Telemetry SDKs are used by our open-source telemetry integrations. Language Solution Java Telemetry SDK In code: SenderConfiguration configuration = SenderConfiguration .builder( \"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\", EventBatchSender.EVENTS_PATH) .build(); EventBatchSender eventBatchSender = EventBatchSender.create(configuration); Copy Python Telemetry SDK In code: event_client = EventClient(host=\"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\") Copy For more information, see our Telemetry API documentation in GitHub. Log API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Log API, the solution for almost all our logging tools is to replace the https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 endpoint with https://gov-log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1. Here are details for various tools: Log forwarders Here are details on changing the endpoint for our log forwarders: AWS Firelens: Add the endpoint property to the options field of the logConfiguration, similar to to the EU account endpoint change shown in these Firelens endpoint configuration instructions. Fluentbit: Use our Fluentbit endpoint configuration. Fluentd: Use our Fluentd endpoint instructions. Infrastructure agent: See FedRAMP for infrastructure. Kubernetes: Our Kubernetes integration logs are based on fluentbit’s output plugin. Use these endpoint instructions. Logstash: Use our Logstash endpoint configuration. Syslog: For configuring syslog clients, see TCP endpoint configuration. S3: Not available. Vector: Not available. To use the Log API directly, you'd edit the Log API endpoint configuration. Trace API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Trace API (including telemetry integrations that use this API), replace the https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1 endpoint with https://gov-trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1. Notes about FedRAMP compliance for other trace data: Trace data is reported by some of our agents, like our APM agents, browser agent, and mobile agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for that data, you would enable FedRAMP for the applicable agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for Infinite Tracing, you would create a new FedRAMP compliant trace observer from the New Relic Edge app.",

      "body": "This document provides information on FedRAMP-compliant endpoints in New Relic. For more information about our security accreditation for the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP), see our data encryption documentation. Customer FedRAMP obligations New Relic customers must meet all of the following requirements for New Relic’s FedRAMP environment: New Relic-approved customers: New Relic’s FedRAMP-Moderate authorized environment is only available to New Relic-approved customers. For more information, contact your New Relic account representative. Order form: Customer’s order form with New Relic must include customer’s eligibility for FedRAMP.

Authorized New Relic endpoints: Customer must send its data only to New Relic’s FedRAMP-designated endpoints. Authorized services and features: Customer must use only FedRAMP audited and authorized New Relic services and features (see below). Overview of data sources There are multiple ways to get data into New Relic. This doc has two sections: Agent settings: for our APM agents, infrastructure agent, browser agent, and mobile agent. Data-ingest APIs: for our Metric API, Event API, Trace API, and Log API, and the integrations that use those APIs. Agents New Relic has several agents for reporting data, like our APM agents, infrastructure agents, mobile agents, and browser agent. Setting these agents to send FedRAMP-compliant data involves setting a configuration setting to use the relevant FedRAMP endpoint. APM agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance, all APM agent configurations must report to gov-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. Depending on the agent, you can either use code-based configuration or an environment variable. Here are details on enabling this: Language Code or environment variable C SDK In code: strcpy(_newrelic_app_config_t->redirect_collector, \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"); Copy Environment variable: none Go In code: app, err = newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"App Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(os.Getenv(\"NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY\")), func(cfg *newrelic.Config) { cfg.Host = \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" }, ) Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Java In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Or set a system property of: newrelic.config.host Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST .NET In your XML config next to the license key: <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" host=\"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"/> Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Node.js In newrelic.js: host: 'gov-collector.newrelic.com' Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST PHP In newrelic.ini: newrelic.daemon.collector_host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: none Python In newrelic.ini: [newrelic] host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Ruby In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Elixir (open source agent) In config.exs: config :new_relic_agent, host: \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST For more on configuring APM agents, see APM configuration. Mobile monitoring agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using our mobile monitoring agents, all agent configurations must report to gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. You must use code-based configuration. Environment variables are not available. Framework-specific configurations: Agent Code or environment variable Android In code: NewRelic.withApplicationToken({APP_TOKEN}) .usingCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\") .usingCrashCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\") .start(this.getApplication()); Copy Environment variable: none iOS In code: [NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:@\"{APP_TOKEN}\" andCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\" andCrashCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\"]; Copy Environment variable: none Infrastructure monitoring If you have infrastructure agent version 1.15.0 or higher, simply enable the FedRAMP configuration option. This enables FedRAMP compliancy for data reported by the infrastructure agent, and for any on-host integrations that work with the infrastructure agent to report data. Important The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration is not currently FedRAMP compliant. If you have an older agent version, use the following values to edit your YAML configuration: Infrastructure agent versions below 1.15.0 If you have an infrastructure agent version below 1.15.0, you must change three of the endpoints used for reporting. To set these endpoints, you can change your YAML configuration or use environment variables. YAML config field Endpoint URL collector_url https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy identity_url https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy command_channel_url https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy To edit environment variables, use these values: Environment variable Endpoint URL NRIA_COLLECTOR_URL https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_IDENTITY_URL https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_COMMAND_CHANNEL_URL https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy Browser agent To configure the browser agent to use a FedRAMP-compliant endpoint, you must use the copy-paste method method (other browser agent install methods are not supported) and edit the browser code’s script element tag so that the domain is gov-bam.nr-data.net for both beacon and errorBeacon, like this: window.NREUM||(NREUM={});NREUM.info={\"beacon\":\"gov-bam.nr-data.net\",\"errorBeacon\":\"gov-bam.nr-data.net\"... Copy Note: You only need to modify the beacon and errorBeacon properties in the NREUM.info object. These values will override the default values found in the NR loader script. Data-ingest APIs Below are details about the FedRAMP endpoint for our ingest APIs: Metric API, the Event API, the Log API, and the Trace API. Metric API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the Metric API, instead of sending metric data to the default Metric API endpoint of https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1, it must be sent to https://gov-metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1. The Metric API can be used directly but it's mainly used by various New Relic tools. Below are instructions showing where to edit the configuration for setting the FedRAMP endpoint. Telemetry integrations Here are instructions for our open source telemetry integrations that report metric data: Dropwizard: use the overrideUri configuration. Kamon: use the metric-ingest-url configuration. See Override endpoints. Micrometer: override the public String uri() method on your NewRelicRegistryConfig to return the new endpoint. See an example. Prometheus: Prometheus OpenMetrics: if you are using our nri-prometheus helm chart, you can change the endpoint in your values.yml file, like in this example. If you're using the nri-bundle chart, you need to nest this value under the nri-prometheus key to propagate it to the sub-chart. Remote write integration: not available. Telemetry SDKs Here are instructions for our Telemetry SDKs that report metric data: Go: use the MetricsURLOverride configuration. Java: in the MetricBatchSender section, configure the endpoint. See an example. .NET: use the MetricUrlOverride configuration. Node.js: edit the METRIC_HOST = 'metric-api.newrelic.com' configuration. Python: edit the HOST = \"metric-api.newrelic.com\" configuration. Event API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for the Event API, all traffic reporting to insights-collector.newrelic.com must instead report to gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com. The Event API endpoint is configurable for the following Telemetry SDKs. The Telemetry SDKs are used by our open-source telemetry integrations. Language Solution Java Telemetry SDK In code: SenderConfiguration configuration = SenderConfiguration .builder( \"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\", EventBatchSender.EVENTS_PATH) .build(); EventBatchSender eventBatchSender = EventBatchSender.create(configuration); Copy Python Telemetry SDK In code: event_client = EventClient(host=\"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\") Copy For more information, see our Telemetry API documentation in GitHub. Log API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Log API, the solution for almost all our logging tools is to replace the https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 endpoint with https://gov-log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1. Here are details for various tools: Log forwarders Here are details on changing the endpoint for our log forwarders: AWS Firelens: Add the endpoint property to the options field of the logConfiguration, similar to to the EU account endpoint change shown in these Firelens endpoint configuration instructions. Fluentbit: Use our Fluentbit endpoint configuration. Fluentd: Use our Fluentd endpoint instructions. Infrastructure agent: See FedRAMP for infrastructure. Kubernetes: Our Kubernetes integration logs are based on fluentbit’s output plugin. Use these endpoint instructions. Logstash: Use our Logstash endpoint configuration. Syslog: For configuring syslog clients, see TCP endpoint configuration. S3: Not available. Vector: Not available. To use the Log API directly, you'd edit the Log API endpoint configuration. Trace API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Trace API (including telemetry integrations that use this API), replace the https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1 endpoint with https://gov-trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1. Notes about FedRAMP compliance for other trace data: Trace data is reported by some of our agents, like our APM agents, browser agent, and mobile agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for that data, you would enable FedRAMP for the applicable agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for Infinite Tracing, you would create a new FedRAMP compliant trace observer from the New Relic Edge app.",

      "body": "New Relic takes your data privacy seriously. Our principles-based approach aims to go beyond the legal requirements for consent. We understand your concerns when you entrust us with your data, and we always strive to embrace your expectations and preferences. This document provides links to detailed information about the privacy and security measures we take to protect you and your customers' data privacy. Our monitoring tools are data-agnostic; they don't require sensitive materials, and many of them don't require any personal data. You are responsible for ensuring that your systems are appropriately set up and configured so that they don't send inappropriate personal data or sensitive materials to New Relic monitoring tools. For additional information about policies, credentials, audits, and other resources, see our New Relic security website. Tip New Relic now offers the option of HIPPA-enabled accounts for customers meeting certain requirements. To learn more, see HIPAA readiness at New Relic. Personal data transfer (Privacy Shield and SCC) The Schrems case ruling invalidates Privacy Shield. However, it explicitly reaffirms the validity of Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) as an appropriate legal mechanism to transfer personal data outside of the European Union. You can find more information in How the Demise of Privacy Shield Affects Your New Relic Account. If you want to send personal data from the EU, we offer an appropriate data processing agreement (DPA) with SCC to govern the transfer of that data in accordance with the Schrems decision. For more information, consult our Data Processing Addendum FAQ, or download our pre-signed DPA (PDF|697 KB). Compliance with legal requirements We always strive to comply with all applicable laws as they take effect. This includes the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and all relevant US State laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Our disk-based encryption provides additional security while your data is at rest (FIPS 140-2 compliant). In addition, we are authorized for Moderate Impact SaaS Services (FedRAMP Authorized Moderate) for accounts that meet specific criteria. For privacy-related details about New Relic's contractual and regulatory commitments for services, see: Terms of Service or Master Subscription Agreement Data Protection Agreement Services Privacy Notice For more information about annual audits, see Regulatory audits for New Relic services. Privacy by design and by default New Relic follows \"privacy by design\" principles as part of our overarching security program. For example, when New Relic agents capture a webpage or referrer URL, all query parameters are stripped by default. Here are examples of how we incorporate privacy considerations into our data and security practices. Personal data requests (GDPR, CCPA, etc.) New Relic strives to comply with all applicable laws as they take effect. This includes the European Union's GDPR and ePrivacy Directive and all applicable privacy laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in the US. For more information about our process when responding to requests to access or delete personal data, see New Relic personal data requests. Events and attributes You can query events and attributes, as well as create charts and alert conditions about this data. For a complete list of all events and attributes tracked by New Relic agents, see our data dictionary. Events and attributes example: If you use the Infrastructure ProcessSample event's commandLine attribute, by default we strip options and arguments from the full command line to prevent accidental leakage of sensitive information. Dropping data at ingest Dropping data gives you control over the data that you send to New Relic, including any personal data that you configured to be collected. By dropping specific events or attributes from events, you determine what data New Relic ultimately stores so that you can query, alert on, and analyze it. For more information, see Drop data using NerdGraph. When our agents refer to data obfuscation, the agent actually removes the data before sending it to New Relic. The data cannot be recovered. For example, with APM queries, the Record SQL? value defaults to obfuscated. This strips the string literals and numeric sequences and then replaces them with the ? character. You can mask sensitive information in HTTP or HTTPS requests. For example, queries about distributed traces and transaction traces are obfuscated by default, in which case they cannot be recovered. For more information, see the documentation for specific New Relic services, including: APM transaction traces Distributed tracing Technical security controls We use a comprehensive set of technical controls to support general security needs as well as security for data we receive. For more information, see our documentation about data security, data encryption, and high security mode for APM agents. Organizational security controls New Relic maintains a number of internal policies and procedures to guide employees in privacy-related subjects such as data classification and handling, data retention, handling of personal data, fulfilling personal data requests, incident response, etc. All employees must complete the security and privacy training upon hiring and renew this training annually. Account security Our role-based account structure gives you direct control over who can access or change your account settings. For more information, see Users and roles. Retention of your data Our Telemetry Data Platform is the single source of truth for all your operational data, empowering you to ask and answer any question in milliseconds. This platform stores different types of data for different periods of time. The Data retention page in our UI provides information on how long your data will be stored in the New Relic database (NRDB). For more information, see Manage data retention. New Relic account emails By default, we communicate with you for a variety of purposes related to your status as New Relic subscribers. This includes product engagement, support, alert notifications, updates, billings, etc. Individual users can unsubscribe from certain communications. General email preferences are managed through the account user interface. For more information, see Account email settings. Alert notification emails are managed through the alerting UI. Account changes (NrAuditEvent) To view changes made to your account's users or to record configuration changes, query NrAuditEvent events. To be notified about account changes, create NRQL alert conditions. For more about available NrAuditEvent attributes, see our data dictionary. Account usage For more about usage, see Manage data. Security for products and services We publish security bulletins with detailed information about vulnerabilities, remediation strategies, and applicable updates for affected software. To receive notifications for future advisories, use either of these options: Subscribe to our security bulletins RSS feed. Select the Watching option in our Explorers Hub's Security notifications community channel to receive email alerts. The following summarizes how individual New Relic products and components ensure security, with links to additional details. Alerts and Applied Intelligence By default, our alerting services do not record any personal data. In addition, they automatically set default permissions for individual account users and access levels within account structures. For more information, see our documentation about Applied Intelligence, as well as our rules and limits for alerts. APIs APIs simply are interfaces for data exchange automation. APIs have no knowledge of the content being transferred. We require authorized users to provide their API keys to monitor subscription usage, manage account user permissions, query data, and perform other automated tasks. For more information, see Introduction to New Relic APIs. APM APM agents monitor your applications' performance. By default, APM agents do not record any personal data. For more information, see our APM security documentation. Browser monitoring Our browser monitoring agent allows you to monitor the performance of their websites. For more information, see: Browser security documentation Visitor's IP address New Relic cookies used by browser Enabling or disabling cookie collection for session tracking Diagnostics The New Relic Diagnostics service inspects relevant system information and any other necessary information (such as logs and config files) to perform diagnostic checks that assess configuration and operability. By default, this data is not transmitted to New Relic. You do have the option to upload this information to a support ticket over HTTPS. For more information, see the Diagnostics security documentation. Infrastructure monitoring The Infrastructure agent allows you to monitor the performance of components in your ecosystem, such as servers, platforms, operating systems, databases, etc. Infrastructure may record the userID and username of users connecting to Infrastructure resources. For more information, see the security documentation for infrastructure monitoring. Integrations and serverless monitoring Our integrations services allow you to retrieve and load data into the New Relic database from a variety of sources, including: Cloud-based integrations On-host integrations in containerized environments, such as Kubernetes On-host integrations built by New Relic On-host integrations built by the open-source community On-host integrations built by you Depending on the integration, different types of data may be recorded so that you can monitor the integrations in New Relic. The integration services are data agnostic. They will have no knowledge of whether the imported data contains any personal information. For more information, see the documentation for the specific integration, including: Amazon Web Services (AWS) Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Kubernetes Microsoft Azure On-host integrations Open source on-host integrations Serverless function monitoring Logs management Due to the nature of our logs management service, you have direct control over what data is reported to New Relic. To ensure data privacy and to limit the types of information New Relic receives, no customer data is captured except what you supply in your API calls or log forwarder configuration. All data for the logs service is then reported to New Relic over HTTPS. The logs service does mask number patterns that appear to be for items such as credit cards or Social Security numbers. For more information, see the Logs security documentation. Mobile monitoring By default, our mobile monitoring service collects two pieces of personal data: The IP address is used to derive high-level geographical data, and then is discarded. A device ID is generated by New Relic and is used for billing purposes. For more information, see our security documentation for mobile monitoring. Synthetic monitoring The synthetic monitoring service uses monitors distributed throughout data centers around the world. It captures what is essentially performance data of simulated traffic. By default, it does not capture any personal data. For more information, see the data privacy and security documentation for synthetic monitoring. If you configure the synthetic service to monitor areas of websites that are located behind a login page, take care to create a non-personal login dedicated to this purpose. This will reduce the risk of unintended personal data exposure. For example, to securely store sensitive information, such as passwords, API keys, and user names, you can use secured credentials for scripted browsers and API tests. The synthetic monitoring service also supports a variety of authentication mechanisms. Depending on the type of monitor you choose, this includes Basic, Digest, NTLM, and NTLMv2. You can also control which of your users can access your monitors and private locations. For more information, see our documentation about user role-based permissions.",

This is primarily dependent on the timing when the service achieved General Availability (GA) status and the timing of the specific compliance program's annual authorization, certification, or assessment. You can use any New Relic service regardless of its compliance program status. However, if a service is not yet in scope of our compliance programs, we encourage you to consider your risk appetite in the decision to use the specific New Relic product or service. If you choose to use New Relic services that are not yet in our compliance program scope, you assume the responsibility to review, understand, and risk-manage your security controls as you deem appropriate. You also have the option to wait for New Relic to authorize these services before you use them.",

      "body": "This document provides information on FedRAMP-compliant endpoints in New Relic. For more information about our security accreditation for the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP), see our data encryption documentation. Customer FedRAMP obligations New Relic customers must meet all of the following requirements for New Relic’s FedRAMP environment: New Relic-approved customers: New Relic’s FedRAMP-Moderate authorized environment is only available to New Relic-approved customers. For more information, contact your New Relic account representative. Order form: Customer’s order form with New Relic must include customer’s eligibility for FedRAMP. Subscription level: Customer must have a current and valid subscription to New Relic Full-Stack Observability Enterprise or New Relic-approved subscription. Authorized New Relic endpoints: Customer must send its data only to New Relic’s FedRAMP-designated endpoints. Authorized services and features: Customer must use only FedRAMP audited and authorized New Relic services and features (see below). Overview of data sources There are multiple ways to get data into New Relic. This doc has two sections: Agent settings: for our APM agents, infrastructure agent, browser agent, and mobile agent. Data-ingest APIs: for our Metric API, Event API, Trace API, and Log API, and the integrations that use those APIs. Agents New Relic has several agents for reporting data, like our APM agents, infrastructure agents, mobile agents, and browser agent. Setting these agents to send FedRAMP-compliant data involves setting a configuration setting to use the relevant FedRAMP endpoint. APM agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance, all APM agent configurations must report to gov-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. Depending on the agent, you can either use code-based configuration or an environment variable. Here are details on enabling this: Language Code or environment variable C SDK In code: strcpy(_newrelic_app_config_t->redirect_collector, \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"); Copy Environment variable: none Go In code: app, err = newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"App Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(os.Getenv(\"NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY\")), func(cfg *newrelic.Config) { cfg.Host = \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" }, ) Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Java In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Or set a system property of: newrelic.config.host Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST .NET In your XML config next to the license key: <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" host=\"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"/> Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Node.js In newrelic.js: host: 'gov-collector.newrelic.com' Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST PHP In newrelic.ini: newrelic.daemon.collector_host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: none Python In newrelic.ini: [newrelic] host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Ruby In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Elixir (open source agent) In config.exs: config :new_relic_agent, host: \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST For more on configuring APM agents, see APM configuration. Mobile monitoring agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using our mobile monitoring agents, all agent configurations must report to gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. You must use code-based configuration. Environment variables are not available. Framework-specific configurations: Agent Code or environment variable Android In code: NewRelic.withApplicationToken({APP_TOKEN}) .usingCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\") .usingCrashCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\") .start(this.getApplication()); Copy Environment variable: none iOS In code: [NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:@\"{APP_TOKEN}\" andCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\" andCrashCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\"]; Copy Environment variable: none Infrastructure monitoring If you have infrastructure agent version 1.15.0 or higher, simply enable the FedRAMP configuration option. This enables FedRAMP compliancy for data reported by the infrastructure agent, and for any on-host integrations that work with the infrastructure agent to report data. Important The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration is not currently FedRAMP compliant. If you have an older agent version, use the following values to edit your YAML configuration: Infrastructure agent versions below 1.15.0 If you have an infrastructure agent version below 1.15.0, you must change three of the endpoints used for reporting. To set these endpoints, you can change your YAML configuration or use environment variables. YAML config field Endpoint URL collector_url https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy identity_url https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy command_channel_url https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy To edit environment variables, use these values: Environment variable Endpoint URL NRIA_COLLECTOR_URL https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_IDENTITY_URL https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_COMMAND_CHANNEL_URL https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy Browser agent To configure the browser agent to use a FedRAMP-compliant endpoint, you must use the copy-paste method method (other browser agent install methods are not supported) and edit the browser code’s script element tag so that the domain is gov-bam.nr-data.net for both beacon and errorBeacon, like this: window.NREUM||(NREUM={});NREUM.info={\"beacon\":\"gov-bam.nr-data.net\",\"errorBeacon\":\"gov-bam.nr-data.net\"... Copy Note: You only need to modify the beacon and errorBeacon properties in the NREUM.info object. These values will override the default values found in the NR loader script. Data-ingest APIs Below are details about the FedRAMP endpoint for our ingest APIs: Metric API, the Event API, the Log API, and the Trace API. Metric API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the Metric API, instead of sending metric data to the default Metric API endpoint of https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1, it must be sent to https://gov-metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1. The Metric API can be used directly but it's mainly used by various New Relic tools. Below are instructions showing where to edit the configuration for setting the FedRAMP endpoint. Telemetry integrations Here are instructions for our open source telemetry integrations that report metric data: Dropwizard: use the overrideUri configuration. Kamon: use the metric-ingest-url configuration. See Override endpoints. Micrometer: override the public String uri() method on your NewRelicRegistryConfig to return the new endpoint. See an example. Prometheus: Prometheus OpenMetrics: if you are using our nri-prometheus helm chart, you can change the endpoint in your values.yml file, like in this example. If you're using the nri-bundle chart, you need to nest this value under the nri-prometheus key to propagate it to the sub-chart. Remote write integration: not available. Telemetry SDKs Here are instructions for our Telemetry SDKs that report metric data: Go: use the MetricsURLOverride configuration. Java: in the MetricBatchSender section, configure the endpoint. See an example. .NET: use the MetricUrlOverride configuration. Node.js: edit the METRIC_HOST = 'metric-api.newrelic.com' configuration. Python: edit the HOST = \"metric-api.newrelic.com\" configuration. Event API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for the Event API, all traffic reporting to insights-collector.newrelic.com must instead report to gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com. The Event API endpoint is configurable for the following Telemetry SDKs. The Telemetry SDKs are used by our open-source telemetry integrations. Language Solution Java Telemetry SDK In code: SenderConfiguration configuration = SenderConfiguration .builder( \"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\", EventBatchSender.EVENTS_PATH) .build(); EventBatchSender eventBatchSender = EventBatchSender.create(configuration); Copy Python Telemetry SDK In code: event_client = EventClient(host=\"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\") Copy For more information, see our Telemetry API documentation in GitHub. Log API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Log API, the solution for almost all our logging tools is to replace the https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 endpoint with https://gov-log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1. Here are details for various tools: Log forwarders Here are details on changing the endpoint for our log forwarders: AWS Firelens: Add the endpoint property to the options field of the logConfiguration, similar to to the EU account endpoint change shown in these Firelens endpoint configuration instructions. Fluentbit: Use our Fluentbit endpoint configuration. Fluentd: Use our Fluentd endpoint instructions. Infrastructure agent: See FedRAMP for infrastructure. Kubernetes: Our Kubernetes integration logs are based on fluentbit’s output plugin. Use these endpoint instructions. Logstash: Use our Logstash endpoint configuration. Syslog: For configuring syslog clients, see TCP endpoint configuration. S3: Not available. Vector: Not available. To use the Log API directly, you'd edit the Log API endpoint configuration. Trace API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Trace API (including telemetry integrations that use this API), replace the https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1 endpoint with https://gov-trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1. Notes about FedRAMP compliance for other trace data: Trace data is reported by some of our agents, like our APM agents, browser agent, and mobile agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for that data, you would enable FedRAMP for the applicable agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for Infinite Tracing, you would create a new FedRAMP compliant trace observer from the New Relic Edge app.",

      "body": "New Relic takes your data privacy seriously. Our principles-based approach aims to go beyond the legal requirements for consent. We understand your concerns when you entrust us with your data, and we always strive to embrace your expectations and preferences. This document provides links to detailed information about the privacy and security measures we take to protect you and your customers' data privacy. Our monitoring tools are data-agnostic; they don't require sensitive materials, and many of them don't require any personal data. You are responsible for ensuring that your systems are appropriately set up and configured so that they don't send inappropriate personal data or sensitive materials to New Relic monitoring tools. For additional information about policies, credentials, audits, and other resources, see our New Relic security website. Tip New Relic now offers the option of HIPPA-enabled accounts for customers meeting certain requirements. To learn more, see HIPAA readiness at New Relic. Personal data transfer (Privacy Shield and SCC) The Schrems case ruling invalidates Privacy Shield. However, it explicitly reaffirms the validity of Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) as an appropriate legal mechanism to transfer personal data outside of the European Union. You can find more information in How the Demise of Privacy Shield Affects Your New Relic Account. If you want to send personal data from the EU, we offer an appropriate data processing agreement (DPA) with SCC to govern the transfer of that data in accordance with the Schrems decision. For more information, consult our Data Processing Addendum FAQ, or download our pre-signed DPA (PDF|697 KB). Compliance with legal requirements We always strive to comply with all applicable laws as they take effect. This includes the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and all relevant US State laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Our disk-based encryption provides additional security while your data is at rest (FIPS 140-2 compliant). In addition, we are authorized for Moderate Impact SaaS Services (FedRAMP Authorized Moderate) for accounts that meet specific criteria. For privacy-related details about New Relic's contractual and regulatory commitments for services, see: Terms of Service or Master Subscription Agreement Data Protection Agreement Services Privacy Notice For more information about annual audits, see Regulatory audits for New Relic services. Privacy by design and by default New Relic follows \"privacy by design\" principles as part of our overarching security program. For example, when New Relic agents capture a webpage or referrer URL, all query parameters are stripped by default. Here are examples of how we incorporate privacy considerations into our data and security practices. Personal data requests (GDPR, CCPA, etc.) New Relic strives to comply with all applicable laws as they take effect. This includes the European Union's GDPR and ePrivacy Directive and all applicable privacy laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in the US. For more information about our process when responding to requests to access or delete personal data, see New Relic personal data requests. Events and attributes You can query events and attributes, as well as create charts and alert conditions about this data. For a complete list of all events and attributes tracked by New Relic agents, see our data dictionary. Events and attributes example: If you use the Infrastructure ProcessSample event's commandLine attribute, by default we strip options and arguments from the full command line to prevent accidental leakage of sensitive information. Dropping data at ingest Dropping data gives you control over the data that you send to New Relic, including any personal data that you configured to be collected. By dropping specific events or attributes from events, you determine what data New Relic ultimately stores so that you can query, alert on, and analyze it. For more information, see Drop data using NerdGraph. When our agents refer to data obfuscation, the agent actually removes the data before sending it to New Relic. The data cannot be recovered. For example, with APM queries, the Record SQL? value defaults to obfuscated. This strips the string literals and numeric sequences and then replaces them with the ? character. You can mask sensitive information in HTTP or HTTPS requests. For example, queries about distributed traces and transaction traces are obfuscated by default, in which case they cannot be recovered. For more information, see the documentation for specific New Relic services, including: APM transaction traces Distributed tracing Technical security controls We use a comprehensive set of technical controls to support general security needs as well as security for data we receive. For more information, see our documentation about data security, data encryption, and high security mode for APM agents. Organizational security controls New Relic maintains a number of internal policies and procedures to guide employees in privacy-related subjects such as data classification and handling, data retention, handling of personal data, fulfilling personal data requests, incident response, etc. All employees must complete the security and privacy training upon hiring and renew this training annually. Account security Our role-based account structure gives you direct control over who can access or change your account settings. For more information, see Users and roles. Retention of your data Our Telemetry Data Platform is the single source of truth for all your operational data, empowering you to ask and answer any question in milliseconds. This platform stores different types of data for different periods of time. The Data retention page in our UI provides information on how long your data will be stored in the New Relic database (NRDB). For more information, see Manage data retention. New Relic account emails By default, we communicate with you for a variety of purposes related to your status as New Relic subscribers. This includes product engagement, support, alert notifications, updates, billings, etc. Individual users can unsubscribe from certain communications. General email preferences are managed through the account user interface. For more information, see Account email settings. Alert notification emails are managed through the alerting UI. Account changes (NrAuditEvent) To view changes made to your account's users or to record configuration changes, query NrAuditEvent events. To be notified about account changes, create NRQL alert conditions. For more about available NrAuditEvent attributes, see our data dictionary. Account usage For more about usage, see Manage data. Security for products and services We publish security bulletins with detailed information about vulnerabilities, remediation strategies, and applicable updates for affected software. To receive notifications for future advisories, use either of these options: Subscribe to our security bulletins RSS feed. Select the Watching option in our Explorers Hub's Security notifications community channel to receive email alerts. The following summarizes how individual New Relic products and components ensure security, with links to additional details. Alerts and Applied Intelligence By default, our alerting services do not record any personal data. In addition, they automatically set default permissions for individual account users and access levels within account structures. For more information, see our documentation about Applied Intelligence, as well as our rules and limits for alerts. APIs APIs simply are interfaces for data exchange automation. APIs have no knowledge of the content being transferred. We require authorized users to provide their API keys to monitor subscription usage, manage account user permissions, query data, and perform other automated tasks. For more information, see Introduction to New Relic APIs. APM APM agents monitor your applications' performance. By default, APM agents do not record any personal data. For more information, see our APM security documentation. Browser monitoring Our browser monitoring agent allows you to monitor the performance of their websites. For more information, see: Browser security documentation Visitor's IP address New Relic cookies used by browser Enabling or disabling cookie collection for session tracking Diagnostics The New Relic Diagnostics service inspects relevant system information and any other necessary information (such as logs and config files) to perform diagnostic checks that assess configuration and operability. By default, this data is not transmitted to New Relic. You do have the option to upload this information to a support ticket over HTTPS. For more information, see the Diagnostics security documentation. Infrastructure monitoring The Infrastructure agent allows you to monitor the performance of components in your ecosystem, such as servers, platforms, operating systems, databases, etc. Infrastructure may record the userID and username of users connecting to Infrastructure resources. For more information, see the security documentation for infrastructure monitoring. Integrations and serverless monitoring Our integrations services allow you to retrieve and load data into the New Relic database from a variety of sources, including: Cloud-based integrations On-host integrations in containerized environments, such as Kubernetes On-host integrations built by New Relic On-host integrations built by the open-source community On-host integrations built by you Depending on the integration, different types of data may be recorded so that you can monitor the integrations in New Relic. The integration services are data agnostic. They will have no knowledge of whether the imported data contains any personal information. For more information, see the documentation for the specific integration, including: Amazon Web Services (AWS) Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Kubernetes Microsoft Azure On-host integrations Open source on-host integrations Serverless function monitoring Logs management Due to the nature of our logs management service, you have direct control over what data is reported to New Relic. To ensure data privacy and to limit the types of information New Relic receives, no customer data is captured except what you supply in your API calls or log forwarder configuration. All data for the logs service is then reported to New Relic over HTTPS. The logs service does mask number patterns that appear to be for items such as credit cards or Social Security numbers. For more information, see the Logs security documentation. Mobile monitoring By default, our mobile monitoring service collects two pieces of personal data: The IP address is used to derive high-level geographical data, and then is discarded. A device ID is generated by New Relic and is used for billing purposes. For more information, see our security documentation for mobile monitoring. Synthetic monitoring The synthetic monitoring service uses monitors distributed throughout data centers around the world. It captures what is essentially performance data of simulated traffic. By default, it does not capture any personal data. For more information, see the data privacy and security documentation for synthetic monitoring. If you configure the synthetic service to monitor areas of websites that are located behind a login page, take care to create a non-personal login dedicated to this purpose. This will reduce the risk of unintended personal data exposure. For example, to securely store sensitive information, such as passwords, API keys, and user names, you can use secured credentials for scripted browsers and API tests. The synthetic monitoring service also supports a variety of authentication mechanisms. Depending on the type of monitor you choose, this includes Basic, Digest, NTLM, and NTLMv2. You can also control which of your users can access your monitors and private locations. For more information, see our documentation about user role-based permissions.",

      "body": "This document provides information on FedRAMP-compliant endpoints in New Relic. For more information about our security accreditation for the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP), see our data encryption documentation. Customer FedRAMP obligations New Relic customers must meet all of the following requirements for New Relic’s FedRAMP environment: New Relic-approved customers: New Relic’s FedRAMP-Moderate authorized environment is only available to New Relic-approved customers. For more information, contact your New Relic account representative. Order form: Customer’s order form with New Relic must include customer’s eligibility for FedRAMP. Subscription level: Customer must have a current and valid subscription to New Relic Full-Stack Observability Enterprise or New Relic-approved subscription. Authorized New Relic endpoints: Customer must send its data only to New Relic’s FedRAMP-designated endpoints. Authorized services and features: Customer must use only FedRAMP audited and authorized New Relic services and features (see below). Overview of data sources There are multiple ways to get data into New Relic. This doc has two sections: Agent settings: for our APM agents, infrastructure agent, browser agent, and mobile agent. Data-ingest APIs: for our Metric API, Event API, Trace API, and Log API, and the integrations that use those APIs. Agents New Relic has several agents for reporting data, like our APM agents, infrastructure agents, mobile agents, and browser agent. Setting these agents to send FedRAMP-compliant data involves setting a configuration setting to use the relevant FedRAMP endpoint. APM agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance, all APM agent configurations must report to gov-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. Depending on the agent, you can either use code-based configuration or an environment variable. Here are details on enabling this: Language Code or environment variable C SDK In code: strcpy(_newrelic_app_config_t->redirect_collector, \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"); Copy Environment variable: none Go In code: app, err = newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"App Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(os.Getenv(\"NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY\")), func(cfg *newrelic.Config) { cfg.Host = \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" }, ) Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Java In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Or set a system property of: newrelic.config.host Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST .NET In your XML config next to the license key: <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" host=\"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"/> Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Node.js In newrelic.js: host: 'gov-collector.newrelic.com' Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST PHP In newrelic.ini: newrelic.daemon.collector_host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: none Python In newrelic.ini: [newrelic] host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Ruby In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Elixir (open source agent) In config.exs: config :new_relic_agent, host: \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST For more on configuring APM agents, see APM configuration. Mobile monitoring agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using our mobile monitoring agents, all agent configurations must report to gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. You must use code-based configuration. Environment variables are not available. Framework-specific configurations: Agent Code or environment variable Android In code: NewRelic.withApplicationToken({APP_TOKEN}) .usingCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\") .usingCrashCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\") .start(this.getApplication()); Copy Environment variable: none iOS In code: [NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:@\"{APP_TOKEN}\" andCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\" andCrashCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\"]; Copy Environment variable: none Infrastructure monitoring If you have infrastructure agent version 1.15.0 or higher, simply enable the FedRAMP configuration option. This enables FedRAMP compliancy for data reported by the infrastructure agent, and for any on-host integrations that work with the infrastructure agent to report data. Important The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration is not currently FedRAMP compliant. If you have an older agent version, use the following values to edit your YAML configuration: Infrastructure agent versions below 1.15.0 If you have an infrastructure agent version below 1.15.0, you must change three of the endpoints used for reporting. To set these endpoints, you can change your YAML configuration or use environment variables. YAML config field Endpoint URL collector_url https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy identity_url https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy command_channel_url https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy To edit environment variables, use these values: Environment variable Endpoint URL NRIA_COLLECTOR_URL https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_IDENTITY_URL https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_COMMAND_CHANNEL_URL https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy Browser agent To configure the browser agent to use a FedRAMP-compliant endpoint, you must use the copy-paste method method (other browser agent install methods are not supported) and edit the browser code’s script element tag so that the domain is gov-bam.nr-data.net for both beacon and errorBeacon, like this: window.NREUM||(NREUM={});NREUM.info={\"beacon\":\"gov-bam.nr-data.net\",\"errorBeacon\":\"gov-bam.nr-data.net\"... Copy Note: You only need to modify the beacon and errorBeacon properties in the NREUM.info object. These values will override the default values found in the NR loader script. Data-ingest APIs Below are details about the FedRAMP endpoint for our ingest APIs: Metric API, the Event API, the Log API, and the Trace API. Metric API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the Metric API, instead of sending metric data to the default Metric API endpoint of https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1, it must be sent to https://gov-metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1. The Metric API can be used directly but it's mainly used by various New Relic tools. Below are instructions showing where to edit the configuration for setting the FedRAMP endpoint. Telemetry integrations Here are instructions for our open source telemetry integrations that report metric data: Dropwizard: use the overrideUri configuration. Kamon: use the metric-ingest-url configuration. See Override endpoints. Micrometer: override the public String uri() method on your NewRelicRegistryConfig to return the new endpoint. See an example. Prometheus: Prometheus OpenMetrics: if you are using our nri-prometheus helm chart, you can change the endpoint in your values.yml file, like in this example. If you're using the nri-bundle chart, you need to nest this value under the nri-prometheus key to propagate it to the sub-chart. Remote write integration: not available. Telemetry SDKs Here are instructions for our Telemetry SDKs that report metric data: Go: use the MetricsURLOverride configuration. Java: in the MetricBatchSender section, configure the endpoint. See an example. .NET: use the MetricUrlOverride configuration. Node.js: edit the METRIC_HOST = 'metric-api.newrelic.com' configuration. Python: edit the HOST = \"metric-api.newrelic.com\" configuration. Event API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for the Event API, all traffic reporting to insights-collector.newrelic.com must instead report to gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com. The Event API endpoint is configurable for the following Telemetry SDKs. The Telemetry SDKs are used by our open-source telemetry integrations. Language Solution Java Telemetry SDK In code: SenderConfiguration configuration = SenderConfiguration .builder( \"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\", EventBatchSender.EVENTS_PATH) .build(); EventBatchSender eventBatchSender = EventBatchSender.create(configuration); Copy Python Telemetry SDK In code: event_client = EventClient(host=\"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\") Copy For more information, see our Telemetry API documentation in GitHub. Log API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Log API, the solution for almost all our logging tools is to replace the https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 endpoint with https://gov-log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1. Here are details for various tools: Log forwarders Here are details on changing the endpoint for our log forwarders: AWS Firelens: Add the endpoint property to the options field of the logConfiguration, similar to to the EU account endpoint change shown in these Firelens endpoint configuration instructions. Fluentbit: Use our Fluentbit endpoint configuration. Fluentd: Use our Fluentd endpoint instructions. Infrastructure agent: See FedRAMP for infrastructure. Kubernetes: Our Kubernetes integration logs are based on fluentbit’s output plugin. Use these endpoint instructions. Logstash: Use our Logstash endpoint configuration. Syslog: For configuring syslog clients, see TCP endpoint configuration. S3: Not available. Vector: Not available. To use the Log API directly, you'd edit the Log API endpoint configuration. Trace API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Trace API (including telemetry integrations that use this API), replace the https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1 endpoint with https://gov-trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1. Notes about FedRAMP compliance for other trace data: Trace data is reported by some of our agents, like our APM agents, browser agent, and mobile agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for that data, you would enable FedRAMP for the applicable agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for Infinite Tracing, you would create a new FedRAMP compliant trace observer from the New Relic Edge app.",

However, a new service may not be covered by one or more of our compliance programs at any given time throughout the year. This is primarily dependent on the timing when the service achieved General Availability (GA) status and the timing of the specific compliance program's annual authorization, certification, or assessment. You can use any New Relic service regardless of its compliance program status. However, if a service is not yet in scope of our compliance programs, we encourage you to consider your risk appetite in the decision to use the specific New Relic product or service. If you choose to use New Relic services that are not yet in our compliance program scope, you assume the responsibility to review, understand, and risk-manage your security controls as you deem appropriate. You also have the option to wait for New Relic to authorize these services before you use them.",

      "body": "This document provides information on FedRAMP-compliant endpoints in New Relic. For more information about our security accreditation for the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP), see our data encryption documentation. Customer FedRAMP obligations New Relic customers must meet all of the following requirements for New Relic’s FedRAMP environment: New Relic-approved customers: New Relic’s FedRAMP-Moderate authorized environment is only available to New Relic-approved customers. For more information, contact your New Relic account representative. Order form: Customer’s order form with New Relic must include customer’s eligibility for FedRAMP. Subscription level: Customer must have a current and valid subscription to New Relic Full-Stack Observability Enterprise or New Relic-approved subscription. Authorized New Relic endpoints: Customer must send its data only to New Relic’s FedRAMP-designated endpoints. Authorized services and features: Customer must use only FedRAMP audited and authorized New Relic services and features (see below). Overview of data sources There are multiple ways to get data into New Relic. This doc has two sections: Agent settings: for our APM agents, infrastructure agent, browser agent, and mobile agent. Data-ingest APIs: for our Metric API, Event API, Trace API, and Log API, and the integrations that use those APIs. Agents New Relic has several agents for reporting data, like our APM agents, infrastructure agents, mobile agents, and browser agent. Setting these agents to send FedRAMP-compliant data involves setting a configuration setting to use the relevant FedRAMP endpoint. APM agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance, all APM agent configurations must report to gov-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. Depending on the agent, you can either use code-based configuration or an environment variable. Here are details on enabling this: Language Code or environment variable C SDK In code: strcpy(_newrelic_app_config_t->redirect_collector, \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"); Copy Environment variable: none Go In code: app, err = newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"App Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(os.Getenv(\"NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY\")), func(cfg *newrelic.Config) { cfg.Host = \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" }, ) Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Java In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Or set a system property of: newrelic.config.host Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST .NET In your XML config next to the license key: <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" host=\"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"/> Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Node.js In newrelic.js: host: 'gov-collector.newrelic.com' Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST PHP In newrelic.ini: newrelic.daemon.collector_host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: none Python In newrelic.ini: [newrelic] host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Ruby In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Elixir (open source agent) In config.exs: config :new_relic_agent, host: \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST For more on configuring APM agents, see APM configuration. Mobile monitoring agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using our mobile monitoring agents, all agent configurations must report to gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. You must use code-based configuration. Environment variables are not available. Framework-specific configurations: Agent Code or environment variable Android In code: NewRelic.withApplicationToken({APP_TOKEN}) .usingCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\") .usingCrashCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\") .start(this.getApplication()); Copy Environment variable: none iOS In code: [NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:@\"{APP_TOKEN}\" andCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\" andCrashCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\"]; Copy Environment variable: none Infrastructure monitoring If you have infrastructure agent version 1.15.0 or higher, simply enable the FedRAMP configuration option. This enables FedRAMP compliancy for data reported by the infrastructure agent, and for any on-host integrations that work with the infrastructure agent to report data. Important The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration is not currently FedRAMP compliant. If you have an older agent version, use the following values to edit your YAML configuration: Infrastructure agent versions below 1.15.0 If you have an infrastructure agent version below 1.15.0, you must change three of the endpoints used for reporting. To set these endpoints, you can change your YAML configuration or use environment variables. YAML config field Endpoint URL collector_url https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy identity_url https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy command_channel_url https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy To edit environment variables, use these values: Environment variable Endpoint URL NRIA_COLLECTOR_URL https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_IDENTITY_URL https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_COMMAND_CHANNEL_URL https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy Browser agent To configure the browser agent to use a FedRAMP-compliant endpoint, you must use the copy-paste method method (other browser agent install methods are not supported) and edit the browser code’s script element tag so that the domain is gov-bam.nr-data.net for both beacon and errorBeacon, like this: window.NREUM||(NREUM={});NREUM.info={\"beacon\":\"gov-bam.nr-data.net\",\"errorBeacon\":\"gov-bam.nr-data.net\"... Copy Note: You only need to modify the beacon and errorBeacon properties in the NREUM.info object. These values will override the default values found in the NR loader script. Data-ingest APIs Below are details about the FedRAMP endpoint for our ingest APIs: Metric API, the Event API, the Log API, and the Trace API. Metric API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the Metric API, instead of sending metric data to the default Metric API endpoint of https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1, it must be sent to https://gov-metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1. The Metric API can be used directly but it's mainly used by various New Relic tools. Below are instructions showing where to edit the configuration for setting the FedRAMP endpoint. Telemetry integrations Here are instructions for our open source telemetry integrations that report metric data: Dropwizard: use the overrideUri configuration. Kamon: use the metric-ingest-url configuration. See Override endpoints. Micrometer: override the public String uri() method on your NewRelicRegistryConfig to return the new endpoint. See an example. Prometheus: Prometheus OpenMetrics: if you are using our nri-prometheus helm chart, you can change the endpoint in your values.yml file, like in this example. If you're using the nri-bundle chart, you need to nest this value under the nri-prometheus key to propagate it to the sub-chart. Remote write integration: not available. Telemetry SDKs Here are instructions for our Telemetry SDKs that report metric data: Go: use the MetricsURLOverride configuration. Java: in the MetricBatchSender section, configure the endpoint. See an example. .NET: use the MetricUrlOverride configuration. Node.js: edit the METRIC_HOST = 'metric-api.newrelic.com' configuration. Python: edit the HOST = \"metric-api.newrelic.com\" configuration. Event API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for the Event API, all traffic reporting to insights-collector.newrelic.com must instead report to gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com. The Event API endpoint is configurable for the following Telemetry SDKs. The Telemetry SDKs are used by our open-source telemetry integrations. Language Solution Java Telemetry SDK In code: SenderConfiguration configuration = SenderConfiguration .builder( \"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\", EventBatchSender.EVENTS_PATH) .build(); EventBatchSender eventBatchSender = EventBatchSender.create(configuration); Copy Python Telemetry SDK In code: event_client = EventClient(host=\"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\") Copy For more information, see our Telemetry API documentation in GitHub. Log API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Log API, the solution for almost all our logging tools is to replace the https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 endpoint with https://gov-log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1. Here are details for various tools: Log forwarders Here are details on changing the endpoint for our log forwarders: AWS Firelens: Add the endpoint property to the options field of the logConfiguration, similar to to the EU account endpoint change shown in these Firelens endpoint configuration instructions. Fluentbit: Use our Fluentbit endpoint configuration. Fluentd: Use our Fluentd endpoint instructions. Infrastructure agent: See FedRAMP for infrastructure. Kubernetes: Our Kubernetes integration logs are based on fluentbit’s output plugin. Use these endpoint instructions. Logstash: Use our Logstash endpoint configuration. Syslog: For configuring syslog clients, see TCP endpoint configuration. S3: Not available. Vector: Not available. To use the Log API directly, you'd edit the Log API endpoint configuration. Trace API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Trace API (including telemetry integrations that use this API), replace the https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1 endpoint with https://gov-trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1. Notes about FedRAMP compliance for other trace data: Trace data is reported by some of our agents, like our APM agents, browser agent, and mobile agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for that data, you would enable FedRAMP for the applicable agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for Infinite Tracing, you would create a new FedRAMP compliant trace observer from the New Relic Edge app.",

However, a new service may not be covered by one or more of our compliance programs at any given time throughout the year. This is primarily dependent on the timing when the service achieved General Availability (GA) status and the timing of the specific compliance program's annual authorization, certification, or assessment. You can use any New Relic service regardless of its compliance program status. However, if a service is not yet in scope of our compliance programs, we encourage you to consider your risk appetite in the decision to use the specific New Relic product or service. If you choose to use New Relic services that are not yet in our compliance program scope, you assume the responsibility to review, understand, and risk-manage your security controls as you deem appropriate. You also have the option to wait for New Relic to authorize these services before you use them.",

In the requirements building phase the security engineer performs a risk assessment and then adds security requirements for the project. Privacy and compliance experts are added to the project teams as needed. Design During the design phase, the New Relic security engineer collaborates with the stakeholders, engineering leaders, and architects to get a detailed shared understanding of the feature. Security engineers at New Relic contribute to the design process with stakeholders by creating a threat model documenting any acceptance criteria, features, or requirements to securely implement the feature. Using the threat model, the security engineer adds detailed specifications for the required controls to the project. Build Each product engineer receives secure coding training which includes topics such as the OWASP top 10, input sanitization, and using the secure frameworks and process already in place at New Relic. In the build phase the engineering team implements appropriate security features in the project following secure coding standards at New Relic. Verification Once feature complete, every pull request must be code reviewed by another engineer with write access to the code repository. In addition to code scanning software automatically checking for vulnerabilities against security policies, security engineers verify that safeguards and controls recommended in design, requirements, and assessment phases were implemented when needed. New Relic performs static code and composition analysis to look for vulnerabilities in the code and dependencies. Deploy New Relic is in the process of including hashes and signatures. Anyone downloading files published by New Relic will be able to confirm their downloaded file has not been tampered with and is identical to the one published by New Relic. Deployed code is monitored by stakeholders and product engineers in order to continue the iterative development process.

Framework-specific configurations: Agent Code or environment variable Android In code: NewRelic.withApplicationToken({APP_TOKEN}) .usingCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\") .usingCrashCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\") .start(this.getApplication()); Copy Environment variable: none iOS In code: [NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:@\"{APP_TOKEN}\" andCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\" andCrashCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\"]; Copy Environment variable: none Infrastructure monitoring If you have infrastructure agent version 1.15.0 or higher, simply enable the FedRAMP configuration option. This enables FedRAMP compliancy for data reported by the infrastructure agent, and for any on-host integrations that work with the infrastructure agent to report data. Important The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration is not currently FedRAMP compliant. If you have an older agent version, use the following values to edit your YAML configuration: Infrastructure agent versions below 1.15.0 If you have an infrastructure agent version below 1.15.0, you must change three of the endpoints used for reporting. To set these endpoints, you can change your YAML configuration or use environment variables. YAML config field Endpoint URL collector_url https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy identity_url https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy command_channel_url https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy To edit environment variables, use these values: Environment variable Endpoint URL NRIA_COLLECTOR_URL https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_IDENTITY_URL https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_COMMAND_CHANNEL_URL https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy Browser agent To configure the browser agent to use a FedRAMP-compliant endpoint, you must use the copy-paste method method (other browser agent install methods are not supported) and edit the browser code’s script element tag so that the domain is gov-bam.nr-data.net for both beacon and errorBeacon, like this: window.NREUM||(NREUM={});NREUM.info={\"beacon\":\"gov-bam.nr-data.net\",\"errorBeacon\":\"gov-bam.nr-data.net\"... Copy Note: You only need to modify the beacon and errorBeacon properties in the NREUM.info object. These values will override the default values found in the NR loader script. Data-ingest APIs Below are details about the FedRAMP endpoint for our ingest APIs: Metric API, the Event API, the Log API, and the Trace API. Metric API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the Metric API, instead of sending metric data to the default Metric API endpoint of https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1, it must be sent to https://gov-metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1. The Metric API can be used directly but it's mainly used by various New Relic tools. Below are instructions showing where to edit the configuration for setting the FedRAMP endpoint. Telemetry integrations Here are instructions for our open source telemetry integrations that report metric data: Dropwizard: use the overrideUri configuration. Kamon: use the metric-ingest-url configuration. See Override endpoints. Micrometer: override the public String uri() method on your NewRelicRegistryConfig to return the new endpoint. See an example. Prometheus: Prometheus OpenMetrics: if you are using our nri-prometheus helm chart, you can change the endpoint in your values.yml file, like in this example. If you're using the nri-bundle chart, you need to nest this value under the nri-prometheus key to propagate it to the sub-chart. Remote write integration: not available. Telemetry SDKs Here are instructions for our Telemetry SDKs that report metric data: Go: use the MetricsURLOverride configuration. Java: in the MetricBatchSender section, configure the endpoint. See an example. .NET: use the MetricUrlOverride configuration. Node.js: edit the METRIC_HOST = 'metric-api.newrelic.com' configuration. Python: edit the HOST = \"metric-api.newrelic.com\" configuration. Event API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for the Event API, all traffic reporting to insights-collector.newrelic.com must instead report to gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com. The Event API endpoint is configurable for the following Telemetry SDKs. The Telemetry SDKs are used by our open-source telemetry integrations. Language Solution Java Telemetry SDK In code: SenderConfiguration configuration = SenderConfiguration .builder( \"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\", EventBatchSender.EVENTS_PATH) .build(); EventBatchSender eventBatchSender = EventBatchSender.create(configuration); Copy Python Telemetry SDK In code: event_client = EventClient(host=\"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\") Copy For more information, see our Telemetry API documentation in GitHub. Log API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Log API, the solution for almost all our logging tools is to replace the https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 endpoint with https://gov-log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1. Here are details for various tools: Log forwarders Here are details on changing the endpoint for our log forwarders: AWS Firelens: Add the endpoint property to the options field of the logConfiguration, similar to to the EU account endpoint change shown in these Firelens endpoint configuration instructions. Fluentbit: Use our Fluentbit endpoint configuration. Fluentd: Use our Fluentd endpoint instructions. Infrastructure agent: See FedRAMP for infrastructure. Kubernetes: Our Kubernetes integration logs are based on fluentbit’s output plugin. Use these endpoint instructions. Logstash: Use our Logstash endpoint configuration. Syslog: For configuring syslog clients, see TCP endpoint configuration. S3: Not available. Vector: Not available. To use the Log API directly, you'd edit the Log API endpoint configuration. Trace API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Trace API (including telemetry integrations that use this API), replace the https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1 endpoint with https://gov-trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1. Notes about FedRAMP compliance for other trace data: Trace data is reported by some of our agents, like our APM agents, browser agent, and mobile agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for that data, you would enable FedRAMP for the applicable agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for Infinite Tracing, you would create a new FedRAMP compliant trace observer from the New Relic Edge app.",

      "body": "New Relic currently provides independent integrations with AWS to collect performance metrics and metadata for more than 50 AWS services. With the new AWS Metric Streams integration, you only need a single service, AWS CloudWatch, to gather all AWS metrics and custom namespaces and send them to New Relic. Why does this matter? Our current system, which relies on individual integrations, runs on a polling fleet and calls multiple AWS APIs at regular intervals to retrieve the metrics and metadata. Using AWS CloudWatch significantly improves how metrics are gathered, overcoming some of the limitations of using the individual integrations. API mode Stream mode It requires an integration with each AWS service to collect the metrics. All CloudWatch metrics from all AWS services and custom namespaces are available in New Relic at once, without needing a specific integration to be built or updated. There are two exceptions: percentiles and a small number of metrics that are made available to CloudWatch with more than 2 hours delay, and therefore not included in the stream. It adds an additional delay to metrics being available in New Relic for alerting and dashboarding. The fastest polling interval we offer today is 5 minutes. Latency is significantly improved, since metrics are streamed in less than two minutes since they are made available in AWS CouldWatch. It may lead to AWS API throttling for large AWS environments. AWS API throttling is eliminated. Set up a Metric Stream to send CloudWatch metrics to New Relic To stream CloudWatch metrics to New Relic you need to create Kinesis Data Firehose and point it to New Relic and then create a CloudWatch Metric Stream that sends metrics to that Firehose. How to map New Relic and AWS accounts and regions If you manage multiple AWS accounts, then each account needs to be connected to New Relic. If you manage multiple regions within those accounts, then each region needs to be configured with a different Kinesis Data Firehose pointing to New Relic. You will typically map one or many AWS accounts to a single New Relic account. Guided setup using CloudFormation First, you need to link each of your AWS accounts with your New Relic account. To do so: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. You may automate this step with NerdGraph. Next, set up the metric stream using the CloudFormation template we provide in the last step of our UI. This template is provided as a base to setup the integration on a single region, and can be customized and extended based on your requirements. Manual setup using AWS Console, API, or calls Create a Kinesis Data Firehose Delivery Stream and configure the following destination parameters: Source: Direct PUT or other sources Data transformation: Disabled Record format conversion: Disabled Destination: Third-party service provider Ensure the following settings are defined: Third-party service provider: New Relic - Metrics New Relic configuration HTTP endpoint URL - US Datacenter: https://aws-api.newrelic.com/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 HTTP endpoint URL - EU Datacenter: https://aws-api.eu01.nr-data.net/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 API key: Enter your license key Content encoding: GZIP Retry duration: 60 S3 backup mode: Failed data only S3 bucket: select a bucket or create a new one to store metrics that failed to be sent. New Relic buffer conditions Buffer size: 1 MB Buffer interval: 60 (seconds) Permissions IAM role: Create or update IAM role Create the metric stream. Go to CloudWatch service in your AWS console and select the Streams option under the Metrics menu. Click on Create metric stream. Determine the right configuration based on your use cases: Use inclusion and exclusion filters to select which services should push metrics to New Relic. Select your Kinesis Data Firehose. Define a meaningful name for the stream (for example, newrelic-metric-stream). Change default output format to Open Telemetry 0.7 (JSON is not supported) Confirm the creation of the metric stream. Alternatively, you can find instructions on the AWS documentation in order to create the CloudWatch metric stream using a CloudFormation template, API, or the CLI. Add the new AWS account in the Metric streams mode in the New Relic UI. Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. Tip The following are the minimal permissions that should be granted on the AWS role configured in New Relic so that CloudWatch metrics can be enriched with additional service metadata and custom tags when applicable: config:BatchGetResourceConfig config:ListDiscoveredResources tag:GetResources Copy The New Relic UI currently recommends the ReadOnlyAccess policy over these individual items so that New Relic has proper permissions to collect service data that's not available in AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams. Validate your data is received correctly To confirm you are receiving data from the Metric Streams, follow the steps below: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, and search for the Stream accounts. You can check the following: Account status dashboard. Useful to confirm that metric data is being received (errors, number of namespaces/metrics ingested, etc.) Explore your data. Use the Data Explorer to find a specific set of metrics, access all dimensions available for a given metric and more. Metrics naming convention Metrics received from AWS CloudWatch are stored in New Relic as dimensional metrics following this convention: Metrics are prefixed by the AWS namespace, all lowercase, where / is replaced with . : AWS/EC2 -> aws.ec2 AWS/ApplicationELB -> aws.applicationelb The original AWS metric name with its original case: aws.ec2.CPUUtilization aws.s3.5xxErrors aws.sns.NumberOfMessagesPublished If the resource the metric belongs to has a specific namespace prefix, it is used. If the resource the metric belongs to doesn't have a specific namespace prefix, metrics use the aws. prefix. aws.Region aws.s3.BucketName Current namespaces supported by AWS can be found in the CloudWatch documentation website. Query Experience, metric storage and mapping Metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch are stored as dimensional metrics of type summary and can be queried using NRQL. We have mapped metrics from the current cloud integrations to the new mappings that will come from AWS Metric Streams. You can continue to use the current metric naming, and queries will continue to work and pick data from AWS Metric Streams and the current cloud integrations. Check our documentation on how current cloud integrations metrics map to the new metric naming. All metrics coming from the metric stream will have these attributes: aws.MetricStreamArn collector.name = ‘cloudwatch-metric-streams’. AWS namespaces' entities in the New Relic Explorer We generate New Relic entities for most used AWS namespaces and will continue adding support for more namespaces. When we generate New Relic entities for a namespace you can expect to: Browse those entities in the New Relic Explorer. Access an out-of-the-box entity dashboard for those entities. Get metrics and entities from that namespace decorated with AWS tags. Collecting AWS tags requires that you have given New Relic the tag:GetResources permission which is part of the setup process in the UI. AWS tags show in metrics as tag.AWSTagName; for example, if you have set a Team AWS tag on the resource, it will show as tag.Team. Leverage all the built-in features that are part of the Explorer. Important Lookout view in Entity Explorer is not compatible with entities created from the AWS Metric Streams integration at this time. Set alert conditions You can create NRQL alert conditions on metrics from a metric stream. Make sure your filter limits data to metrics from the CloudWatch metric stream only. To do that, construct your queries like this: SELECT sum('aws.s3.5xxErrors') FROM Metric WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' FACET aws.accountId, aws.s3.BucketName Copy Then, to make sure that alerts processes the data correctly, configure the advanced signal settings. These settings are needed because AWS CloudWatch receives metrics from services with a certain delay (for example, Amazon guarantees that 90% of EC2 metrics are available in CloudWatch within 7 minutes of them being generated). Moreover, streaming metrics from AWS to New Relic adds up to 1 minute additional delay, mostly due to buffering data in the Firehose. To configure the signal settings, under Condition Settings, click on Advanced Signal Settings and enter the following values: Aggregation window. We recommend setting it to 1 minute. If you are having issues with flapping alerts or alerts not triggering, consider increasing it to 2 minutes. Offset evaluation by. Depending on the service, CloudWatch may send metrics with a certain delay. The value is set in windows. With a 1-minute aggregation window, setting the offset to 8 ensures the majority of the metrics are evaluated correctly. You may be able to use a lower offset if the delay introduced by AWS and Firehose is less. Fill data gaps with. Leave this void, or use Last known value if gaps in the data coming from AWS lead to false positives or negatives. See our documentation on how to create NRQL alerts for more details. Tags collection New Relic provides enhanced dimensions from metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch metric streams. Resource and custom tags are automatically pulled from most services and are used to decorate metrics with additional dimensions. Use the data explorer to see which tags are available on each AWS metric. The following query shows an example of tags being collected and queried as dimensions in metrics: SELECT average(`aws.rds.CPUUtilization`) FROM Metric FACET `tags.mycustomtag` SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy Note that not all metrics have their custom tags as dimensions. Currently, only metrics linked to entities in the New Relic Explorer have their custom tags associated. The AWS CloudWatch metric stream doesn't include tags as part of the stream message, hence, additional processing is required on the New Relic side. Metadata collection Like with custom tags, New Relic also pulls metadata information from relevant AWS services in order to decorate AWS CloudWatch metrics with enriched metadata collected from AWS Services APIs. This metadata is accessible in New Relic as additional dimensions on the metrics provided by AWS CloudWatch. This is an optional capability that's complementary to the CloudWatch Metric Streams integration. The solution relies on AWS Config, which might incur in additional costs in your AWS account. AWS Config provides granular controls to determine which services and resources are recorded. New Relic will only ingest metadata from the available resources in your AWS account. The following services / namespaces are supported: EC2 Lambda RDS ALB/NLB S3 API Gateway (excluding API v1) ELB EBS DynamoDB ECS Curated dashboards A set of dashboards for different AWS Services is available in the New Relic One Quickstarts app. Get access to the Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to browse and import dashboards: Navigate to the Apps catalog in New Relic One. Search and select the Quickstarts app. Click on the Add this app link in the top-right corner. To enable the app, select target accounts and confirm clicking the Update account button. If applicable, review and confirm the Terms and Conditions of Use. Note that it might take a few minutes until permissions are applied and the app is ready to be used. Once available, confirm the app is enabled. The Quickstarts app will be listed in the Apps catalog. Import dashboards from Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to import any of the curated dashboards: Navigate to Apps and open the Quickstarts app. Browse the AWS Dashboards. If you don't find a dashboard for your AWS service please submit your feedback on the top navigation bar or feel free to contribute with your own dashboard. Select the dashboard, confirm the target account and initial dashboard name. A copy of the dashboard should be imported in the target account. Additional customization is possible using any of the New Relic One dashboarding features. Manage your data New Relic provides a set of tools to keep track of the data being ingested in your account. Go to Manage your data in the settings menu to see all details. Metrics ingested from AWS Metric Streams integrations are considered in the Metric bucket. If you need a more granular view of the data you can use the bytecountestimate() function on Metric in order to estimate the data being ingested. For example, the following query represents data ingested from all metrics processed via AWS Metric Streams integration in the last 30 days (in bytes): FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate() where collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams' since 30 day ago Copy We recommend the following actions to control the data being ingested: Make sure metric streams are enabled only on the AWS accounts and regions you want to monitor with New Relic. Use the inclusion and exclusion filters in the CloudWatch Metric Stream in order to select which services / namespaces are being collected. Consider using drop data rules to discard metrics based on custom filters (for example, drop metrics by namespace and tag, tag value, or any other valid NRQL criteria). Important Metrics sent via AWS Metric Streams count against your Metric API limits for the New Relic account where data will be ingested. Migrating from AWS API polling integrations When metrics are sent via Metric Streams to New Relic, if the same metrics are being retrieved using the current poll-based integrations, those metrics will be duplicated. For example, alerts and dashboards that use sum or count will return twice the actual number. This includes alerts and dashboards that use metrics that have a .Sum suffix. We recommend sending the data to a non-production New Relic account where you can safely do tests. If that is not an option, then AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream filters are available to include or exclude certain namespaces that can cause trouble. Alternatively, you can use filtering on queries to distinguish between metrics that come from Metric Streams and those that come through polling. All metrics coming from Metric Streams are tagged with collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams'. Migration steps On a typical deployment, migrating from API polling to metric stream involves the following steps (we recommend trying this on a dev / staging environment first): Go through the AWS UI in New Relic (or use NerdGraph APIs) to link your AWS account with New Relic. This is currently needed even if your AWS account is already linked with polling integrations. Make sure you complete the last step in the onboarding, which involves enabling AWS CloudWatch metric stream and the AWS Kinesis Data Firehose to push metrics to New Relic. Complete this step for any additional AWS region you want to monitor, since AWS CloudWatch requires one stream per region. Ensure metrics are received from all connected regions and namespaces. This may take several minutes. Disable all unnecessary polling integrations in the previous AWS provider account. The following integrations still need to be enabled since they aren't fully replaced by metric streams: AWS Billing, AWS CloudTrail, AWS Health, AWS Trusted Advisor. Query, dashboard, and alert considerations AWS Metric Streams integration uses the Metric API to push metrics in the dimensional metric format. Poll-based integrations push metrics based on events (for example, ComputeSample event), and will be migrated to dimensional metrics in the future. To assist in this transition, New Relic provides a mechanism (known as shimming) that transparently lets you write queries in any format. Then these queries are processed as expected based on the source that's available (metrics or events). This mechanism works both ways, from events to metrics, and viceversa. Please consider the following when migrating from poll-based integrations: Custom dashboards that use poll-based AWS integration events should work as expected. Alert conditions that use poll-based AWS events might need to be adapted with dimensional metric format. Use the NRQL source for the alert condition. Entities in New Relic Explorer might be duplicated for up to 24 hours. Integrations not fully replaced by metric streams The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration only collects CloudWatch metrics, resource metadata and custom tags. The following API polling integrations still need to be enabled to get complete visibility from AWS: AWS Billing AWS CloudTrail AWS Health AWS Trusted Advisor AWS VPC Infrastructure Agent metrics and EC2 metadata decoration As with the EC2 API polling integration, when the infrastructure agent is installed on a host and the EC2 namespace is active via AWS CloudWatch metric stream integration, then all the infrastructure agent events and metrics are decorated with additional metadata. The following attributes will decorate infrastructure samples (some might not be applicable on all environments): awsAvailabilityZone, ec2InstanceId, ec2PublicDnsName, ec2State, ec2EbsOptimized, ec2PublicIpAddress, ec2PrivateIpAddress, ec2VpcId, ec2AmiId, ec2PrivateDnsName, ec2KeyName, ec2SubnetId, ec2InstanceType, ec2Hypervisor, ec2Architecture, ec2RootDeviceType, ec2RootDeviceName, ec2VirtualizationType, ec2PlacementGroupName, ec2PlacementGroupTenancy.",

Additionally, you can: Query your usage data to get more detail than is available in the UI. Set up NRQL alert conditions to get notifications about changes in your usage. Note that account hierarchy may affect queried data. See Account structure. Available data types Usage data is attached to these events: NrConsumption records usage every hour, and is the equivalent of \"real-time\" usage. Use this event to observe usage trends over time. NrMTDConsumption generates aggregate values from the NrConsumption event. Use this event to see usage or estimated cost for a billing period. NrUsage records usage every hour and is used to see usage reported per product. To see changes made to your account (for example, user management changes), you can query NrAuditEvent. Query examples The View your usage UI displays your data usage and billable user count. If you need more detail than that UI provides, you can use these NRQL queries. For definitions of some of the attributes used in these queries, see Attributes. Data usage queries Here are some data usage query examples: Daily data usage This query totals your billable ingested data, and displays a daily value for the past three months: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE 3 months ago TIMESERIES 1 day Copy Daily usage by source This query totals your billable ingested data, and displays a daily value for the past three months faceted by the source: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE 3 months ago FACET usageMetric TIMESERIES 1 day Copy Metrics ingest by source This query breaks down Metric data by the top ten metric names. You could also facet by appName or host to adjust the analysis. FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate()/10e8 as 'GB Estimate' SINCE '2021-04-01' UNTIL '2021-04-08' FACET metricName LIMIT 10 TIMESERIES 1 day Copy Month-to-date data usage This query shows the current full user count. In other words, it shows how much you'd be billed for your data for that month if you were billed right now. FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE this month Copy Month-to-date estimated data cost This query shows the estimated cost of your ingested data: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(estimatedCost) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE this month Copy User count queries Here are some user-related query examples. For details on how users are counted, see User count calculations. Month-to-date full users This query shows the billable full users for the month. In other words, it shows how much you'd be billed for your users for that month if you were billed right now. FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(usersBillable) SINCE this month Copy This query shows how many full users were counted by hour. This is useful for seeing how the full user count changed over time. from NrConsumption SELECT max(FullUsers) SINCE 10 days ago TIMESERIES 1 hour Copy Projected monthly full user count This query shows a projected count of monthly users. This query would not be good for using in a dashboard; it requires values based on a) the days remaining in the month, b) the start of the month. Here's an example querying the projected end-of-month count with 10 days left in that month: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT predictLinear(FullUsers, 10 days) SINCE '2020-09-01' Copy Count full users and basic users The usage UI shows the count of full users and basic users.

      "body": "Starting April 12, 2021, we're allowing some customers who have users on our original user model to self-serve and migrate those users to be on the New Relic One user model. Background On July 30, 2020, we released a new and improved user model called the New Relic One user model. This newer model offers a simpler, more efficient way to manage users and their access to roles and accounts. At first, this new model was available mainly to new customers, while users in pre-existing New Relic organizations remained on our original user model. But now some original-user-model organizations that meet some requirements can use a migration wizard to migrate their users to the new model. When that migration process is complete, your users are on the New Relic One user model and you’ll have new procedures for managing your users and their access to accounts. Benefits When you migrate your users to this model, benefits include: Viewing and managing all users from multiple accounts in one place. Fewer steps to add and manage users. Flexible authentication options. More granular roles for user management. For Enterprise customers: access to automated user management via identity providers. Learn more about the benefits of the new model. Requirements Requirements include: You must be on the original user model. If you aren't sure which you are, see Determine user model. To use the user migration wizard, you must have the Owner role. Recommendations and considerations We have some recommendations below that apply to organizations who choose to do the user migration on their own. Note that these considerations won't apply if you're being helped by a New Relic representative; in that case, your account representative will give you guidance. We recommend not using the user migration wizard in these circumstances: If your organization has more than 20 accounts (unless you're getting help from a New Relic representative). Note that this refers to having 20 or more accounts, not users. If you frequently add accounts. Currently, users on the new user model require New Relic assistance to add accounts. If you think any of the new user model impacts and limitations might affect you negatively. If you require account-level roles for user management capabilities. Roles related to user management (ability to add and update users, change user type, create access grants) currently apply across an organization and can't be assigned at an account level. If you have questions about whether you should use the user migration wizard, talk to your New Relic account representative. Understand user management concepts During the user migration procedure, you'll have a choice to either grant all your users access to all your organization's accounts, or to assign more granular access (set the roles and accounts your user groups have access to). The more you need to partition access to accounts or roles, the more it will help you to understand some basics about the newer user management concepts. Here's a brief summary: Users are grouped in a container called an \"authentication domain\". The domain governs how users are added to New Relic (manually with the UI or automatically via SCIM). It also governs how users log in (manually with email/password or using SAML SSO). Most organizations will have just one or two authentication domains: one for the default manual settings and another for the more automatic methods. Users can be assigned to one or more groups (for example, our default Admin group or a custom group like Contractors). For large organizations, users are often assigned to multiple groups. When you want to give a user group access to a specific role and a specific account, you must create an access grant. For example, you may give a Contractors group access to our default All product admin role on one or more of your accounts, or give that group a custom role. To learn more, see User management concepts. Optional: plan out user groups and access grants If you'll need to do a good amount of partitioning of users' access to accounts or roles, you'll want to think about how you'll implement groups for your organization. Here are some tips for how different types of organizations may use groups: For organizations with a good number of accounts, a common configuration is to have one user group with the Organization manager role (organization-level management capabilities), one group with the Authentication domain manager (user management capabilities), a group with the Billing user (billing-related capabilities) on the primary (first) account, and then configuring various users groups for admins, users, and other roles as needed on your other accounts. Customers with smaller and/oor flatter organizations that are okay with transparency for all teams across all of their data could have as little as one or two groups. For organizations where all data is in a single account, a common configuration might be having five or six groups. Migrate your users with the migration wizard Before you start, be sure you've read the requirements. To start using the wizard: From one.newrelic.com, click Apps in the top navigation. In the table of apps, click the User migration walkthrough app. Optional: If you want more help and context, see the sections below for tips and recommendations for specific migration wizard pages. If you've successfully completed migration, learn how to manage your users. Step 1: Create admins Tips: You can either a) import all current admins for your account or b) specify the admins that should have access to user management capabilities. Note that you can add more admin users and edit permissions after you complete the migration process. If you've already used the wizard to set up an admin on the new user model, have the admin sign in using their new user record to access the migration tool. The user migration wizard, when completed, destroys the old user record, but if you've started the user migration process without completing it, you may have users with access to both the original and new record, as shown below: If a user on the new model has been created and the migration process hasn't been completed, they may have access to both the original user record and the new user records. If you plan on migrating only a portion of your users to the new user model to start, we recommend leaving some original user model admins so that you have an admin to manage your users on the original model. Step 2: Set up organization You may choose a) a guided setup that allows more configuration options, or b) an automatic setup with fewer steps. Some notes on the automatic setup: It won't transition SSO or AUM-implemented SCIM configurations. Instead, users will be provisioned manually and will log in manually with their username and password. It provides all users with access to all accounts. If you use SSO or AUM today or require some accounts to be inaccessible by certain user groups, don't use the automatic option. Step 3: Name your organization Name your organization something descriptive and easily recognizable. Step 4: Authentication domain settings This section controls how users are provisioned (added to New Relic) and how they authenticate (log in). Note that choosing SAML SSO or SCIM setup will require you to exit the migration wizard and configure things elsewhere in the New Relic UI. Here's more detail about the two authentication domain sections: Managing users For how users are added and managed, you can select Manually or Identity provider. The option to use your identity provider to provision users is available only if your organization has Enterprise edition. If you choose Identity provider, you must follow additional steps for using specific identity providers. Once you do that, these users are created on the new user model and synced in New Relic based on your identity provider configuration. Note that if you're already using an app made by Okta, Azure, or OneLogin, you'll probably need to use a newer version made for New Relic's newer user model. For more on this, see Identity provider apps. After you complete provisioning users, you can confirm that these users have been added by seeing if they’re in the new User management UI. If you’ve selected the guided workflow, we’ll match these users by email address. There will be no need to later complete the user import step for these users given they’ll have been brought into New Relic via your identity provider. When done, you can skip ahead to the Migrate assets step. Login methods If you chose Manually for managing users, you have a choice for how those users log in. You can select either a) email/password login or b) single sign on (SSO). Note that SSO is available only for organizations with Pro or Enterprise edition. You can select multiple authentication methods based on your needs. For example, you might use SSO for your employees and username/password for contractors. If you select SSO, you must complete additional configuration steps. You can complete the procedure for setting up SSO, and then come back to the migration wizard to continue the migration process. If you select more than one authentication method, note that you’ll need to add a new authentication domain. Note that if you're already using an identity provider's New Relic app, you'll probably need to use a newer version made for New Relic's newer user model. For more on this, see Identity provider apps, below. A note about identity provider apps Okta, Azure, and OneLogin have New Relic apps for both the original user model and the New Relic One user model. The original apps are titled \"New Relic by account\" while the newer apps are titled \"New Relic by organization.\" If you're already using one of the New Relic apps, it's likely made for the original user model, which means you'll need to set up a new app. Step 5: Import existing users Recommended: Download the full list of existing original user model users before choosing to import users. This will be a useful resource and serve as a backup, if you need it. After downloading your original user model users, you can upload all users or just some of them. This step will create user records on the New Relic One user model. In a later step, you’ll be able to transition these users' assets. The new user record that's created has the same login credentials: there is no need to reset passwords. If a user has a pending email verification status (pending being verified), that will also be transitioned over. Important tips: Ensure the new users' email addresses match their original user record email addresses, including matching exact case. We use email addresses as the key value to match users and, in a later step, to transition their user-associated assets. Once you complete this step and create new user records, we highly recommend completing the migration process without delay. If you don't complete the steps to migrate assets and delete the original user record, a user may see two user records when logging in (see login screenshot from Step 1) or else may be missing assets they expect to see (like dashboards). Step 6: Access settings This step allows you to determine the level of access your users have. If you need to map user access to specific accounts and roles, then you'll want to set up groups and access grants at this stage. You'll need to create an access grant for each account that you want a group to have access to. For example, a DevOps group might have five different access grants, each giving the group access to a different account. This procedure is done separately from the user migration wizard procedure. For more on how to create access grants, see the user management tutorial. Step 7: Migrate user assets Upon completion of this step, personal assets, such as dashboards and favorites, are migrated to new user records and the original user record is deleted. If a user has access to several organizations (for example, if that user is a contractor), the user won't be fully deleted until all organizations migrate their users. It's possible that such a user will find themselves with both the original user record and new user records (see login screenshot in Page 1 section).

      "body": "Starting April 12, 2021, we're allowing some customers who have users on our original user model to self-serve and migrate those users to be on the New Relic One user model. Background On July 30, 2020, we released a new and improved user model called the New Relic One user model. This newer model offers a simpler, more efficient way to manage users and their access to roles and accounts. At first, this new model was available mainly to new customers, while users in pre-existing New Relic organizations remained on our original user model. But now some original-user-model organizations that meet some requirements can use a migration wizard to migrate their users to the new model. When that migration process is complete, your users are on the New Relic One user model and you’ll have new procedures for managing your users and their access to accounts. Benefits When you migrate your users to this model, benefits include: Viewing and managing all users from multiple accounts in one place. Fewer steps to add and manage users. Flexible authentication options. More granular roles for user management. For Enterprise customers: access to automated user management via identity providers. Learn more about the benefits of the new model. Requirements Requirements include: You must be on the original user model. If you aren't sure which you are, see Determine user model. To use the user migration wizard, you must have the Owner role. Recommendations and considerations We have some recommendations below that apply to organizations who choose to do the user migration on their own. Note that these considerations won't apply if you're being helped by a New Relic representative; in that case, your account representative will give you guidance. We recommend not using the user migration wizard in these circumstances: If your organization has more than 20 accounts (unless you're getting help from a New Relic representative). Note that this refers to having 20 or more accounts, not users. If you frequently add accounts. Currently, users on the new user model require New Relic assistance to add accounts. If you think any of the new user model impacts and limitations might affect you negatively. If you require account-level roles for user management capabilities. Roles related to user management (ability to add and update users, change user type, create access grants) currently apply across an organization and can't be assigned at an account level. If you have questions about whether you should use the user migration wizard, talk to your New Relic account representative. Understand user management concepts During the user migration procedure, you'll have a choice to either grant all your users access to all your organization's accounts, or to assign more granular access (set the roles and accounts your user groups have access to). The more you need to partition access to accounts or roles, the more it will help you to understand some basics about the newer user management concepts. Here's a brief summary: Users are grouped in a container called an \"authentication domain\". The domain governs how users are added to New Relic (manually with the UI or automatically via SCIM). It also governs how users log in (manually with email/password or using SAML SSO). Most organizations will have just one or two authentication domains: one for the default manual settings and another for the more automatic methods. Users can be assigned to one or more groups (for example, our default Admin group or a custom group like Contractors). For large organizations, users are often assigned to multiple groups. When you want to give a user group access to a specific role and a specific account, you must create an access grant. For example, you may give a Contractors group access to our default All product admin role on one or more of your accounts, or give that group a custom role. To learn more, see User management concepts. Optional: plan out user groups and access grants If you'll need to do a good amount of partitioning of users' access to accounts or roles, you'll want to think about how you'll implement groups for your organization. Here are some tips for how different types of organizations may use groups: For organizations with a good number of accounts, a common configuration is to have one user group with the Organization manager role (organization-level management capabilities), one group with the Authentication domain manager (user management capabilities), a group with the Billing user (billing-related capabilities) on the primary (first) account, and then configuring various users groups for admins, users, and other roles as needed on your other accounts. Customers with smaller and/oor flatter organizations that are okay with transparency for all teams across all of their data could have as little as one or two groups. For organizations where all data is in a single account, a common configuration might be having five or six groups. Migrate your users with the migration wizard Before you start, be sure you've read the requirements. To start using the wizard: From one.newrelic.com, click Apps in the top navigation. In the table of apps, click the User migration walkthrough app. Optional: If you want more help and context, see the sections below for tips and recommendations for specific migration wizard pages. If you've successfully completed migration, learn how to manage your users. Step 1: Create admins Tips: You can either a) import all current admins for your account or b) specify the admins that should have access to user management capabilities. Note that you can add more admin users and edit permissions after you complete the migration process. If you've already used the wizard to set up an admin on the new user model, have the admin sign in using their new user record to access the migration tool. The user migration wizard, when completed, destroys the old user record, but if you've started the user migration process without completing it, you may have users with access to both the original and new record, as shown below: If a user on the new model has been created and the migration process hasn't been completed, they may have access to both the original user record and the new user records. If you plan on migrating only a portion of your users to the new user model to start, we recommend leaving some original user model admins so that you have an admin to manage your users on the original model. Step 2: Set up organization You may choose a) a guided setup that allows more configuration options, or b) an automatic setup with fewer steps. Some notes on the automatic setup: It won't transition SSO or AUM-implemented SCIM configurations. Instead, users will be provisioned manually and will log in manually with their username and password. It provides all users with access to all accounts. If you use SSO or AUM today or require some accounts to be inaccessible by certain user groups, don't use the automatic option. Step 3: Name your organization Name your organization something descriptive and easily recognizable. Step 4: Authentication domain settings This section controls how users are provisioned (added to New Relic) and how they authenticate (log in). Note that choosing SAML SSO or SCIM setup will require you to exit the migration wizard and configure things elsewhere in the New Relic UI. Here's more detail about the two authentication domain sections: Managing users For how users are added and managed, you can select Manually or Identity provider. The option to use your identity provider to provision users is available only if your organization has Enterprise edition. If you choose Identity provider, you must follow additional steps for using specific identity providers. Once you do that, these users are created on the new user model and synced in New Relic based on your identity provider configuration. Note that if you're already using an app made by Okta, Azure, or OneLogin, you'll probably need to use a newer version made for New Relic's newer user model. For more on this, see Identity provider apps. After you complete provisioning users, you can confirm that these users have been added by seeing if they’re in the new User management UI. If you’ve selected the guided workflow, we’ll match these users by email address. There will be no need to later complete the user import step for these users given they’ll have been brought into New Relic via your identity provider. When done, you can skip ahead to the Migrate assets step. Login methods If you chose Manually for managing users, you have a choice for how those users log in. You can select either a) email/password login or b) single sign on (SSO). Note that SSO is available only for organizations with Pro or Enterprise edition. You can select multiple authentication methods based on your needs. For example, you might use SSO for your employees and username/password for contractors. If you select SSO, you must complete additional configuration steps. You can complete the procedure for setting up SSO, and then come back to the migration wizard to continue the migration process. If you select more than one authentication method, note that you’ll need to add a new authentication domain. Note that if you're already using an identity provider's New Relic app, you'll probably need to use a newer version made for New Relic's newer user model. For more on this, see Identity provider apps, below. A note about identity provider apps Okta, Azure, and OneLogin have New Relic apps for both the original user model and the New Relic One user model. The original apps are titled \"New Relic by account\" while the newer apps are titled \"New Relic by organization.\" If you're already using one of the New Relic apps, it's likely made for the original user model, which means you'll need to set up a new app. Step 5: Import existing users Recommended: Download the full list of existing original user model users before choosing to import users. This will be a useful resource and serve as a backup, if you need it. After downloading your original user model users, you can upload all users or just some of them. This step will create user records on the New Relic One user model. In a later step, you’ll be able to transition these users' assets. The new user record that's created has the same login credentials: there is no need to reset passwords. If a user has a pending email verification status (pending being verified), that will also be transitioned over. Important tips: Ensure the new users' email addresses match their original user record email addresses, including matching exact case. We use email addresses as the key value to match users and, in a later step, to transition their user-associated assets. Once you complete this step and create new user records, we highly recommend completing the migration process without delay. If you don't complete the steps to migrate assets and delete the original user record, a user may see two user records when logging in (see login screenshot from Step 1) or else may be missing assets they expect to see (like dashboards). Step 6: Access settings This step allows you to determine the level of access your users have. If you need to map user access to specific accounts and roles, then you'll want to set up groups and access grants at this stage. You'll need to create an access grant for each account that you want a group to have access to. For example, a DevOps group might have five different access grants, each giving the group access to a different account. This procedure is done separately from the user migration wizard procedure. For more on how to create access grants, see the user management tutorial. Step 7: Migrate user assets Upon completion of this step, personal assets, such as dashboards and favorites, are migrated to new user records and the original user record is deleted. If a user has access to several organizations (for example, if that user is a contractor), the user won't be fully deleted until all organizations migrate their users. It's possible that such a user will find themselves with both the original user record and new user records (see login screenshot in Page 1 section). Step 8: Review and finish If you're migrating users in chunks and not all at once, you can go through the migration workflow several times with different groups of users. You can only click Finish Setup when all users in the organization are migrated. After you're done Once your users are migrated to the new user model, you can find and manage them by clicking the account dropdown, clicking Administration, and using these UI pages: User management: use this to view and add users, change their type (basic versus full), change their group, and approve user upgrade requests.

      "body": "New Relic has APM language agents for C, Go, Java, Node.js, .NET, PHP, Python, and Ruby. Each of these offers several ways to leverage the power of distributed tracing: Quick start for standard distributed tracing (recommended): A fast way to get started Infinite Tracing: An advanced alternative to standard distributed tracing Older APM agents: Tracing options if you have older APM agents Manual instrumentation: Tips if automatic instrumentation doesn't work Tip If you want to get more background before getting started, check out these topics: How span sampling works explains distributed tracing options. Impacts to APM tells you what to expect if you are a current APM user but haven't set up distributed tracing. Quick start for standard distributed tracing (recommended): This is the best approach to set up standard distributed tracing if you haven't installed any APM agents for your services yet, or if you want to instrument additional services. Tip You'll need a New Relic account to set up distributed tracing. If you don't already have one, you can quickly create a free account. Step 1. Identify services Figure out which services you want to instrument so they each send trace data to New Relic. Step 2. Instrument each service with an APM agent We have installation assistants for a variety of languages to help you instrument each service. You should run the installation assistant for each service you want to instrument to ensure that each installation has a unique application name. To start the assistant, click the link for your language: APM: C APM: Golang APM: Java APM: .NET APM: Node.js APM: PHP APM: Python APM: Ruby Tip This quick-start approach with the installation assistant automatically enables distributed tracing for each service you run it on, but if you already have a APM agent that you want to participate in distributed tracing, you'll need to manually enable distributed tracing. See Options for older APM agents. Step 3. View traces After you instrument each of your services with APM agents, generate some traffic in your application so we can capture some traces. Here are two ways to view your traces in the UI: View traces that include a specific service Here's one way you can see traces for a particular service: Go to one.newrelic.com. Click APM in the top menu bar. Click your service. In the left navigation's Monitor section, click Distributed tracing. If you don't see the traces you want, you can filter by the trace.id. View traces across accounts This option allows you to search all traces across all New Relic accounts in your organization that you have access to. Go to one.newrelic.com. Click Browse data in the top menu bar, and then click Traces. Select your entity in the left pane. If you don't see the traces you want, you can filter by the trace.id. For more help finding your traces in the UI: Understand and use the distributed tracing UI Query distributed trace data Set up Infinite Tracing (advanced option) Standard distributed tracing for APM agents (above) captures up to 10% of your traces, but if you want us to analyze all your data and find the most relevant traces, you can set up Infinite Tracing. This alternative to standard distributed tracing is available for all APM language agents except C SDK. Tip To learn more about this feature, see Infinite Tracing. Before beginning, first ensure you meet the requirements. Step 1. Complete the instrumentation for standard distributed tracing in the quick start above The Infinite Tracing setup builds on the instrumentation step from the Quick start for standard distributed tracing. Step 2. Set up the trace observer The trace observer is a New Relic AWS-based service that collects and analyzes all your traces. Follow the instructions in Set up trace observer. When you're done, return here with your trace observer information and continue with the next step to configure the agent. Step 3: Configure the agent for Infinite Tracing Infinite Tracing configuration settings include the standard distributed tracing plus information about the trace observer.

Manual instrumentation (If automatic instrumentation doesn't work) Recommendation: Before performing any custom instrumentation, read: How distributed tracing works Troubleshoot missing data If a service is not passing the trace header to other services, you can use the distributed tracing payload APIs to instrument the calling service and the called service. The calling service uses an API call to generate a payload, which is accepted by the called service. Instrument the calling service To instrument the calling service: Ensure the version of the APM agent that monitors the calling service supports distributed tracing. Invoke the agent API call for generating a distributed trace payload: C SDK | Go | Java | .NET | Node.js | PHP | Python | Ruby. Important To maintain proper ordering of spans in a trace, ensure you generate the payload in the context of the span that sends it. Add that payload to the call made to the destination service (for example, in a header). (Optional) Identify the call as an external call: C SDK Go Java .NET: n/a Node.js PHP: n/a Python Ruby Instrument the called service To instrument the called service: Ensure the version of the APM agent that monitors the called service supports distributed tracing. If the New Relic agent on the called service does not identify a New Relic transaction, use the agent API to declare a transaction: C SDK One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload() is called, a NULL pointer is returned. To solve this problem, follow the procedures to create a transaction with the C SDK. Go One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when Transaction.InsertDistributedTraceHeaders(h http.Header) is called, no headers are inserted. To create a transaction, see Instrument Go transactions. Java One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when Transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(Headers) is called, no headers are inserted (this API requires agent 6.4.0+). To create a transaction, see Java agent transaction-related APIs. .NET One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: CreateDistributedTracePayload() returns an empty payload. To create a transaction, see Introduction to .NET custom instrumentation. Node.js One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: the Node.js agent logs will report an error similar to this: No transaction found when calling Transaction.acceptDistributedTracePayload. Copy Use startWebTransaction to create a web transaction or startBackgroundTransaction to capture a non-web transaction. PHP One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers() returns false. To create a transaction, see newrelic_start_transaction. Python To tell that a transaction is not in progress: when transaction = current_transaction() is run, transaction is None. Or, if result = accept_distributed_trace_payload(payload) is run, then the result is False. Use background_task to report a non-web transaction. For more on Python instrumentation, see Monitor transactions and segments. Ruby If you are using a Rack-based web framework and have enabled New Relic's Rack instrumentation, the Ruby agent will handle starting a transaction for you. For other use cases, see the add_transaction_tracer API method. Extract the payload from the call that you received (for example, in a header). Invoke the call for accepting the payload: C SDK | Go | Java | .NET | PHP | Node.js | Python | Ruby.",

      "body": "Problem You’re attempting to enable serverless monitoring for AWS Lambda and are having an issue or error. Solution There are two common problems related to not completing all of the enablement procedures: Not seeing data on CloudWatch metrics UI page. This means the AWS integration step wasn't completed. Not seeing data on Troubleshooting category UI pages. If you aren't seeing data on the Distributed tracing, Errors, and Invocations UI tabs, this means the APM agent instrumentation step wasn't completed. Besides these basic enablement problems, there are some additional problems that may cause an issue: CloudWatch error \"HTTP error 401: unauthorized.\" This is due to an incorrect API Key. The --nr-api-keyargument in the Configure AWS enable step takes your user key, which is different from the REST API key. Custom metrics are missing. Lambda monitoring is not compatible with our custom metrics. Use custom attributes to add metadata. Invocations missing. To see invocation breakdown details, distributed tracing must be enabled as part of the Lambda instrumentation step. Distributed tracing is required so that span details can be displayed in the invocation details pane. You've completed the installation, integration, and instrumentation steps correctly, and your function is sending logs to CloudWatch but you're not seeing traces for specific dependencies (or any traces) in the UI. This may result from the order of layer merging (if you're using our Lambda layers) or from the order of import (if you're instrumenting manually): If you're instrumenting with layers: make sure in your function configuration that the New Relic layer is merged before other layers (though if your function uses webpack, the New Relic layer should be merged after the webpack layer). If you're instrumenting a Node function manually, make sure that your function imports newrelic and @newrelic/aws-sdk before it imports any dependencies you expect to monitor. If none of these solutions help you, contact our support team. The following information will help you when you talk to support technicians: Has the Lambda function appeared in the UI before? If so, what is the name of the function? If some data for the Lambda function is appearing in the UI, what specific data is appearing? What APM language agent are you using to instrument the function? Recommended: Attach your CloudWatch logs to the ticket To provide our support team with logging information when opening a ticket: Invoke the function in AWS Lambda. Click on the logs link after your function runs. This will take you to the CloudWatch logs in AWS. On the left-hand sidebar in AWS, under Logs, click on Insights. Select your function and also the newrelic-log-ingestion stream. Apply an appropriate Time Filter, and a log entry limit (the default of 20 may not be enough). Under Actions select Copy query results (ASCII). Paste the copied text into a new text file, then save and upload the text file to the ticket. Important The NR_LAMBDA_MONITORING payload contains all the information the agent attempts to send up, including metrics, events, some AWS account metadata, invocations and errors data. Note that some of that data (for example, our legacy metrics) will not make it to our UI because our ingest pipeline does not consume them.",

      "body": "The New Relic Lambda monitoring stack There are several important parts to Lambda monitoring: Your function The New Relic agent or SDK The New Relic Lambda Extension New Relic's backend The New Relic One Lambda UI Your function Your function is the code you want to understand. You want to know when it's encountering errors, why it's slow, or how often it gets invoked. New Relic agent or SDK This is a library that New Relic provides for the language that your function is written in. Its job is to do the actual monitoring of your code. It measures the duration of your function invocations, notes errors that occur, records details about the source events, and your functions responses. To do this, it needs to wrap around your Lambda invocation handler function. With a bit more work on your part, you can break your invocation into interesting segments, and tie together the interaction of your function with other functions and services, providing a holistic view of your serverless application. New Relic Lambda Extension This sidecar process runs inside the Lambda execution environment, alongside your code. It enhances the telemetry that the agent collects, and sends it to New Relic's back end in batches. It can also send your function's logs to New Relic. The extension is a small application that integrates tightly with the AWS Lambda lifecycle, and works to minimize both the time it takes your telemetry to arrive at New Relic, and the impact that instrumentation has on your function's latency and throughput. See more about our Lambda extension. New Relic's backend The New Relic service receives your telemetry, processes it into AwsLambdaInvocation, AwsLambdaInvocationError, Span, and custom events, and stores all that in our telemetry database: NRDB. Lambda UI in New Relic One Lambda functions aren't quite like traditional services, so the experience of managing them is a little different from the classic APM experience. Inside New Relic One, Lambda functions have a custom UI, which quickly surfaces the most important information about your function, and integrates closely with our logging and distributed tracing features. Backed by NRDB and NRQL, you can also write custom dashboards and alerts for your functions. The legacy CloudWatch path Older integrations send telemetry in a slightly different way. Instead of passing it off to the extension, the Agent writes it out to CloudWatch as a log line. By adding a log subscription filter to pipe your function logs into the aws-log-ingestion Lambda function, we can recover that telemetry log line, and forward it on to New Relic, along with some interesting platform telemetry. Experience has shown that this approach has some considerable drawbacks. The AWS CloudWatch service is pretty expensive. After the free tier, log ingestion can easily eclipse the charges you pay to New Relic to ingest your telemetry. Plus, CloudWatch doesn't have a very good record when it comes to timeliness. CloudWatch log lines take many seconds, sometimes several minutes in cases of high load, to make their way to our log collection function. This delays time to glass, and fogs the view you have of your application at high load times, when an immediate, clear view of application performance is most critical.",

DistributedTraceSummary MobileRequest MobileRequestError Span Transaction TransactionError InfrastructureEvent Data sources : InfrastructureCloudTrail InfrastructureEvent describes changes (deltas) that occur in a system's live state. When an inventory or system state is added, removed, or changed, Infrastructure will produce an InfrastructureEvent that logs that activity. Attribute name Definition Data types category A New Relic category used to organize events in the UI. For example: automation, notification, and service. InfrastructureEvent changeType A simple classification of the type of change made to the entity: added, modified, or removed. InfrastructureEvent changedPath The fully specified name of the item that changed. This is constructed by taking the source and adding one or more additional path elements that uniquely identify the item that changed. InfrastructureEvent deltaId Delta refers to a recorded change in the system. The deltaId is a number used by New Relic to organize incoming inventory change data. InfrastructureEvent eventId The unique ID of the event, generated by New Relic. InfrastructureEvent format The type of infrastructure event. Each format type includes attributes that may be used to render the event in the UI. InfrastructureEvent newStatus The new agent status: disconnected or connected. InfrastructureEvent newValue If a change is made to the entity, this attribute contains the new value of the inventory that was changed. This will have no value if no change has been made. The value will display approximately 4K bytes of data. InfrastructureEvent oldValue If a change is made to the entity, this attribute contains the old value of the inventory that was changed. This will be blank if no change has been made. InfrastructureEvent provider For integrations that use generic event types (like the DatastoreSample event), the provider value specifies the source of the data (the service, or a sub-category of data from that service). Some Insights events are generic and are used by several integrations. For example, the DatastoreSample event is used by several integrations, including the AWS DynamoDB integration and the AWS RDS integration. In these cases, the provider attribute value represents the source of that attribute. This will usually be the service that data comes from or, for integrations that use several provider values, a certain sub-category of data from that service. When a provider value is present for a generic event, that event will have additional integration-specific attributes attached to it. Here’s an example of an Insights NRQL query that returns the attributes present for a DatastoreSample event reported by the AWS RDS integration: SELECT * from DatastoreSample where provider = 'RdsDbCluster' InfrastructureEvent source The fully specified origin of this inventory item. This is typically in the form category/plugin, where plugin is the generic word used for the tool that gathered this data. InfrastructureEvent summary A summary of the change that happened. Uses a human-friendly string, such as Agent disconnected. InfrastructureEvent violationUpdateType The type of change to the violation: For example: open or closed.

      "body": "On this page, you will learn how to manually instrument your lambda function. It's organized by runtime language. Go To instrument your Go-language Lambda: Download our Go agent package and place it in the same directory as your function. Install the agent: go get -u github.com/newrelic/go-agent/v3/newrelic. Install the nrlambda integration go get -u github.com/newrelic/go-agent/v3/integrations/nrlambda. In your Lambda code, import our components, create an application, and update how you start your Lambda. See our GitHub repo for an example of an instrumented Lambda. Optional: Add custom events that will be associated with your Lambda invocation by using the RecordCustomEvent API. For example: func handler(ctx context.Context) { if txn := newrelic.FromContext(ctx); nil != txn { txn.Application().RecordCustomEvent(\"MyEvent\", map[string]interface{}{ \"zip\": \"zap\", }) } fmt.Println(\"hello world!\") } Copy Build and zip your Lambda function and upload it to AWS. Zip and upload recommendations Here are suggestions for zipping and uploading the Lambda: Build the binary for execution on Linux. This produces a binary file called main. You can use: $ GOOS=linux go build -o main Copy Zip the binary into a deployment package using: $ zip deployment.zip main Copy Upload the zip file to AWS using either the AWS Lambda console or the AWS CLI. Name the handler main (to match the name given during the binary build). The following environment variables are not required for Lambda monitoring to function but they are required if you want your Lambda functions to be included in distributed traces. To enable distributed tracing, set these environment variables in the AWS console: NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID. Your account ID. NEW_RELIC_TRUSTED_ACCOUNT_KEY. This is also your account ID. If your account is a child account, this is the account ID for the root/parent account. Optional: To configure logging, see Go agent logging. Invoke the Lambda at least once. This creates a CloudWatch log group, which must be present for the next step to work. Our wrapper gathers data about the Lambda execution, generates a JSON message, and logs it to CloudWatch Logs. Next, you'll configure CloudWatch to send those logs to New Relic. Java Monitoring for AWS Lambda in Java doesn't use our APM Java agent. Instead, it uses these two OpenTracing dependencies: AWS Lambda OpenTracing Java SDK: OpenTracing instrumentation for AWS Lambda RequestHandler and RequestStreamHandler. Our AWS Lambda OpenTracing Tracer: An OpenTracing Tracer implementation designed to monitor AWS Lambda. It generates spans, error events, transaction events, error traces, and provides distributed tracing support. Tip Supported OpenTracing Versions OpenTracing 0.31.0: Lambda Tracer: com.newrelic.opentracing:newrelic-java-lambda:1.1.1 Lambda SDK: com.newrelic.opentracing:java-aws-lambda:1.0.0 OpenTracing 0.32.0, 0.33.0: Lambda Tracer: com.newrelic.opentracing:newrelic-java-lambda:2.1.1 Lambda SDK: com.newrelic.opentracing:java-aws-lambda:2.1.0 To instrument your Java Lambda: In your project’s build.gradle file, include our OpenTracing AWS Lambda Tracer and the AWS Lambda OpenTracing SDK dependencies: dependencies { compile(\"com.newrelic.opentracing:java-aws-lambda:2.1.0\") compile(\"com.newrelic.opentracing:newrelic-java-lambda:2.1.1\") compile(\"io.opentracing:opentracing-util:0.33.0\") } Copy Implement the AWS Lambda RequestHandler interface as shown in the Java Lambda example and override the doHandleRequest method. In the doHandleRequest method, call the LambdaTracing.instrument(...) API to create a root span to trace the lambda function's execution. This is also where you will define your business logic for the lambda function. Register a LambdaTracer.INSTANCE as the OpenTracing Global tracer, as shown in the Java Lambda example. Create a ZIP deployment package and upload it to AWS Lambda. Or deploy it via other means. In the AWS Lambda console, set the handler. For the example Java Lambda, the handler would be com.handler.example.MyLambdaHandler::handleRequest. Because handleRequest is assumed, you could also use com.handler.example.MyLambdaHandler. The following AWS console environment variables are required if you want your Lambda function to be included in distributed tracing. This is recommended. NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID. Your account ID. NEW_RELIC_PRIMARY_APPLICATION_ID. This is also your account ID. NEW_RELIC_TRUSTED_ACCOUNT_KEY. This is also your account ID. If your account is a child account, this must be the account ID for the root/parent account. Optional: In the Lambda console, enable debug logging by adding this environment variable: NEW_RELIC_DEBUG is true. Invoke the Lambda at least once. This creates a CloudWatch log group, which must be present for the next step to work. Our wrapper gathers data about the Lambda execution, generates a JSON message, and logs it to CloudWatch Logs. Next, you'll configure CloudWatch to send those logs to New Relic. Please see the AWS Lambda distributed tracing example for a complete project that illustrates common use cases such as: Distributed tracing between Lambda functions Manual span creation (aka custom instrumentation) Tracing external calls Adding custom attributes (aka Tags) to spans .NET Core Our monitoring of .NET Core-based AWS Lambda functions doesn't use our standard .NET Core APM agent. Instead, it uses a NuGet package. To instrument your .NET Core Lambda: In your Lambda Functions project, install the NewRelic.OpenTracing.AmazonLambda.Tracer NuGet package. Note: NewRelic.OpenTracing.AmazonLambda.Tracer depends on version 1.2.0+ of Amazon.Lambda.APIGatewayEvent NuGet package. If the environment already uses a lower version of Amazon.Lambda.APIGatewayEvent, the New Relic package may produce errors such as System.MissingMethodException . Import the NuGet package and OpenTracing utils: using OpenTracing.Util; using NewRelic.OpenTracing.AmazonLambda; Copy Instrument your function, as shown in this example: public class Function { static Function() { // Register The NewRelic Lambda Tracer Instance GlobalTracer.Register(NewRelic.OpenTracing.AmazonLambda.LambdaTracer.Instance); } public object FunctionWrapper(ILambdaContext context) { // Instantiate NewRelic TracingWrapper and pass your FunctionHandler as // an argument return new TracingRequestHandler().LambdaWrapper(FunctionHandler, context); } /// <summary> /// A simple function that takes a string and does a ToUpper /// </summary> /// <param name=\"input\"></param> /// <param name=\"context\"></param> /// <returns></returns> public object FunctionHandler(ILambdaContext context) { ... } } Copy Tip The arguments passed to FunctionWrapper must match the signature of FunctionHandler. If your handler function returns a Task, the Lambda wrapper will block on the return task until it completes, so that it can measure the duration and capture exceptions, if any are present. In addition, you may also inherit from the APIGatewayProxyFunction. For an example, see below: Async handler function public async Task<int> FunctionHandlerAsync(ILambdaContext lambdaContext) { return await new TracingRequestHandler().LambdaWrapper( ActualFunctionHandlerAsync, lambdaContext); } public async Task<APIGatewayProxyResponse> ActualFunctionHandlerAsync(ILambdaContext lambdaContext) { // Function can make other async operations here ... } Copy Inheriting from APIGatewayProxyFunction public class LambdaFunction : APIGatewayProxyFunction { static LambdaFunction() { // Register The NewRelic Lambda Tracer Instance OpenTracing.Util.GlobalTracer.Register(NewRelic.OpenTracing.AmazonLambda.LambdaTracer.Instance); } public override Task<APIGatewayProxyResponse> FunctionHandlerAsync(APIGatewayProxyRequest request, ILambdaContext lambdaContext) { Task<APIGatewayProxyResponse> task = new TracingRequestHandler().LambdaWrapper(ActualFunctionHandlerAsync, request, lambdaContext); return task; } public Task<APIGatewayProxyResponse> ActualFunctionHandlerAsync(APIGatewayProxyRequest request, ILambdaContext lambdaContext) { return base.FunctionHandlerAsync(request, lambdaContext); } } Copy Optional for SQS and SNS: Starting in version 1.0 of our .NET Lambda Tracer, distributed tracing support has been added for SQS and SNS. To enable distributed tracing for SQS or SNS you will need to complete the items in this step as well as setup the environment variables in the step that follows this one. Important Enabling distributed tracing support for SQS and SNS will disable automatic instrumentation for both of SQS and SNS and require the use of these wrappers to instrument them. Set the NEW_RELIC_USE_DT_WRAPPER environment variable to true. To instrument SQS and SNS calls you will need to use the provided wrappers. Using the SQS Wrapper The SQS wrapper supports wrapping the following methods: Amazon.SQS.AmazonSQSClient.SendMessageAsync(...) Amazon.SQS.AmazonSQSClient.SendMessageBatchAsync(...) Examples // SQS Client AmazonSQSClient client = new AmazonSQSClient(\"AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY\", AWS_REGION); // SendMessageRequest SendMessageRequest sendRequest = new SendMessageRequest(\"QUEUE_URI_STRING\", \"An SQS Message\"); Task<SendMessageResponse> responseOne = SQSWrapper.WrapRequest(client.SendMessageAsync, sendRequest); // String-based Task<SendMessageResponse> responseTwo = SQSWrapper.WrapRequest(client.SendMessageAsync, \"QUEUE_URI_STRING\", \"Another SQS Message\"); // SendMessageBatchRequest List<SendMessageBatchRequestEntry> batchEntries = new List<SendMessageBatchRequestEntry>(); batchEntries.Add(new SendMessageBatchRequestEntry(\"id1\", \"First SQS Message\")); batchEntries.Add(new SendMessageBatchRequestEntry(\"id2\", \"Second SQS Message\")); batchEntries.Add(new SendMessageBatchRequestEntry(\"id3\", \"Third SQS Message\")); SendMessageBatchRequest sendBatchRequest = new SendMessageBatchRequest(QUEUE_URI, batchEntries); Task<SendMessageBatchResponse> response = SQSWrapper.WrapRequest(client.SendMessageBatchAsync, sendBatchRequest); // SendMessageBatchRequestEntry List List<SendMessageBatchRequestEntry> moreBatchEntries = new List<SendMessageBatchRequestEntry>(); batchEntries.Add(new SendMessageBatchRequestEntry(\"id4\", \"Fourth SQS Message\")); batchEntries.Add(new SendMessageBatchRequestEntry(\"id5\", \"Fifth SQS Message\")); batchEntries.Add(new SendMessageBatchRequestEntry(\"id6\", \"Sixth SQS Message\")); Task<SendMessageBatchResponse> response = SQSWrapper.WrapRequest(client.SendMessageBatchAsync, moreBatchEntries); Copy Using the SNS Wrapper The SNS wrapper supports wrapping the following methods: Amazon.SimpleNotificationService.AmazonSimpleNotificationServiceClient.PublishAsync(...) Examples // SNS Client AmazonSimpleNotificationServiceClient client = new Amazon.SimpleNotificationService.AmazonSimpleNotificationServiceClient(\"AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY\", AWS_REGION); // PublishRequest - Phone Number PublishRequest phonePublishRequest = new PublishRequest(); phonePublishRequest.PhoneNumber = +1XXX5555100; phonePublishRequest.Message = \"An SNS Message for phones\"; Task<PublishResponse> phoneResponse = SNSWrapper.WrapRequest(client.PublishAsync, phonePublishRequest); // PublishRequest - ARN PublishRequest publishRequest = new PublishRequest(\"TOPIC_ARN\", \"An SNS Message\"); Task<PublishResponse> publishResponse = SNSWrapper.WrapRequest(client.PublishAsync, publishRequest); // String-based without subject Task<PublishResponse> ResponseOne = SNSWrapper.WrapRequest(client.PublishAsync, \"TOPIC_ARN\", \"Another SNS Message\"); // String-based with subject Task<PublishResponse> ResponseTwo = SNSWrapper.WrapRequest(client.PublishAsync, \"TOPIC_ARN\", \"Yet Another SNS Message\", \"A Subject\"); Copy The following environment variables are not required for Lambda monitoring to function but they are required if you want your Lambda functions to be included in distributed traces. To enable distributed tracing, set these environment variables in the AWS Lambda console: NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID: The account ID the Lambda is reporting to. NEW_RELIC_TRUSTED_ACCOUNT_KEY: This is also the account ID. If your account is a child account, this needs to be the account ID for the root/parent account. Ensure that the wrapper function (FunctionWrapper in above example) is set up as the function handler. Invoke the Lambda at least once. This creates a CloudWatch log group, which must be present for the next step to work. Our wrapper gathers data about the Lambda execution, generates a JSON message, and logs it to CloudWatch Logs. Next you'll configure CloudWatch to send those logs to New Relic. Node.js To instrument your Node.js Lambda: Download our Node.js agent package and place it in the same directory as your function, ensuring the agent is installed as a dependency in the node_modules directory. Use the Node Package Manager: npm install newrelic --save Copy Install our AWS SDK module alongside the Node.js agent: npm install @newrelic/aws-sdk --save Copy In your Lambda code, require the agent module and the AWS SDK at the top of the file, and wrap the handler function. For example: const newrelic = require('newrelic'); require('@newrelic/aws-sdk'); // Other module loads go under the two require statements above module.exports.handler = newrelic.setLambdaHandler((event, context, callback) => { // This is your handler function code console.log('Lambda executed'); callback(); }); Copy Optional: You can also add custom events to your Lambda using the recordCustomEvent API. For example: module.exports.handler = newrelic.setLambdaHandler((event, context, callback) => { newrelic.recordCustomEvent(‘MyEventType’, {foo: ‘bar’}); console.log('Lambda executed'); callback(); }); Copy Zip your Lambda function and the Node.js agent folder together. Requirements and recommendations: The New Relic files outside the New Relic agent folder don't need to be included. If your Lambda function file name is, for example, lambda_function.node, we recommend naming your zip file lambda_function.zip. Do not use a tarball. Your Lambda and its associated modules must all be in the zip file's root directory. This means that if you zip a folder that contains the files, it won't work. Upload the zipped file to your AWS Lambda account. In the AWS console, set these environment variables: NEW_RELIC_NO_CONFIG_FILE. Set to true if not using a configuration file. NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME: Your application name. NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID. Your account ID. NEW_RELIC_TRUSTED_ACCOUNT_KEY. This is also your account ID. If your account is a child account, this needs to be the account ID for the root/parent account. Optional: To run the agent in serverless mode outside of AWS in a local environment, set the environment variable NEW_RELIC_SERVERLESS_MODE_ENABLED to true. (When executing this in an AWS Lambda environment, the agent will automatically run in serverless mode. Do not use this variable if you're running in AWS.) Optional: To enable logging in serverless mode, set these environment variables: Set NEW_RELIC_LOG_ENABLED to true. Set NEW_RELIC_LOG to stdout for output to CloudWatch, or set to any writeable file location. The log level is set to info by default. See other log levels. Invoke the Lambda at least once. This creates a CloudWatch log group, which must be present for the next step to work. Our wrapper gathers data about the Lambda execution, generates a JSON message, and logs it to CloudWatch Logs. Next you'll configure CloudWatch to send those logs to New Relic. Python To instrument your Python Lambda: Download our Python agent package and place it in the same directory as your function. To do this, use pip: pip install -t . newrelic Copy Important If you use Homebrew, you may get this error: DistutilsOptionError: must supply either home or prefix/exec-prefix -- not both. For details, see the Homebrew GitHub post. In your Lambda code, import the Python agent module and decorate the handler function using the New Relic decorator. The New Relic package must be imported first in your code. Here's an example: import newrelic.agent newrelic.agent.initialize() @newrelic.agent.lambda_handler() def handler(event, context): ... Copy Optional: You can also add custom events to your Lambda using the record_custom_event API. Here's an example: @newrelic.agent.lambda_handler() def handler(event, context): newrelic.agent.record_custom_event('CustomEvent', {'foo': 'bar'}) … Copy Zip your lambda_function.py and newrelic/ folder together using these guidelines: The New Relic files outside the newrelic/ folder don't need to be included. If your Lambda function file name is, for example, lambda_function.py, name your zip file lambda_function.zip. Do not use a tarball. Your Lambda and its associated modules must all be in the zip file's root directory. This means that if you zip a folder that contains the files, it won't work. Upload the zipped file to your AWS Lambda account. In the AWS console, set this environment variable: NEW_RELIC_SERVERLESS_MODE_ENABLED. Set to true The following environment variables are not required for Lambda monitoring to function but they are required if you want your Lambda functions to be included in distributed traces. To enable distributed tracing, set these environment variables in the AWS console: NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED. Set to true. NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID. Your account ID. NEW_RELIC_TRUSTED_ACCOUNT_KEY. This is also your account ID. If your account is a child account, this needs to be the account ID for the root/parent account. Optional: To configure logging, use the NEW_RELIC_LOG and NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL environment variables in the AWS Console. Invoke the Lambda at least once. This creates a CloudWatch log group, which must be present for the next step to work. The New Relic decorator gathers data about the Lambda execution, generates a JSON message, and logs it to CloudWatch Logs. Next, configure CloudWatch to send those logs to New Relic.",

New Relic provides working minimal examples as a starting point for instrumenting your own serverless functions, so that you can become familiar with the necessary elements, test the account link, and use them as a reference for your own instrumentation. While there are many ways to manage and deploy Lambda functions, AWS CloudFormation is the mechanism we use for our examples. It requires minimal tooling, has first-party support, and underpins many of the third party deployment options as well. Example features Each of our basic examples is functionally identical, and illustrates the following New Relic features: Sending invocation telemetry to New Relic, via the New Relic Lambda Extension Adding custom attributes to the invocation event Adding custom events to the telemetry In addition, each demonstrates: Using the New Relic Lambda layer with your function Adding permissions to the function to access the AWS Secrets Manager and retrieve the New Relic license key Runtime-specific techinques for wrapping your handler, so that New Relic can capture telemetry Managing function log retention in CloudWatch Optionally, forwarding function logs to New Relic's logging product via the Lambda Extension Examples Our examples are published, alongside the New Relic Lambda Extension, in this GitHub repository. There's one for each Lambda runtime that New Relic can instrument: NodeJS Python Go Java .NET Tip As you test the examples, you may notice that telemetry isn't always sent right away. The AWS Lambda lifecycle places certain constraints on the execution of our agent and Lambda Extension. In addition, valuable platform telemetry is only available after an invocation has completed. The New Relic Extension balances overall performance against the need for timely telemetry delivery by buffering telemetry for a period of time, and delivering it to New Relic in batches, during a subsequent invocation (or during shutdown). In a production function, we find this works very well. When manually testing, it's often necessary to wait seven seconds, and then invoke a function again to give it an opportunity to deliver previously buffered telemetry. While we make an effort to keep the templates in our examples up to date, you can always find the latest New Relic Lambda layer for your region and runtime at our layers site. This site also offers an API, which you're welcome to use in your CI/CD pipeline to keep your own templates up to date. Distributed tracing In addition to our basic examples, we offer an example of how to integrate distributed tracing into a non-trivial serverless application in our distributed tracing example.

      "body": "New Relic currently provides independent integrations with AWS to collect performance metrics and metadata for more than 50 AWS services. With the new AWS Metric Streams integration, you only need a single service, AWS CloudWatch, to gather all AWS metrics and custom namespaces and send them to New Relic. Why does this matter? Our current system, which relies on individual integrations, runs on a polling fleet and calls multiple AWS APIs at regular intervals to retrieve the metrics and metadata. Using AWS CloudWatch significantly improves how metrics are gathered, overcoming some of the limitations of using the individual integrations. API mode Stream mode It requires an integration with each AWS service to collect the metrics. All CloudWatch metrics from all AWS services and custom namespaces are available in New Relic at once, without needing a specific integration to be built or updated. There are two exceptions: percentiles and a small number of metrics that are made available to CloudWatch with more than 2 hours delay, and therefore not included in the stream. It adds an additional delay to metrics being available in New Relic for alerting and dashboarding. The fastest polling interval we offer today is 5 minutes. Latency is significantly improved, since metrics are streamed in less than two minutes since they are made available in AWS CouldWatch. It may lead to AWS API throttling for large AWS environments. AWS API throttling is eliminated. Set up a Metric Stream to send CloudWatch metrics to New Relic To stream CloudWatch metrics to New Relic you need to create Kinesis Data Firehose and point it to New Relic and then create a CloudWatch Metric Stream that sends metrics to that Firehose. How to map New Relic and AWS accounts and regions If you manage multiple AWS accounts, then each account needs to be connected to New Relic. If you manage multiple regions within those accounts, then each region needs to be configured with a different Kinesis Data Firehose pointing to New Relic. You will typically map one or many AWS accounts to a single New Relic account. Guided setup using CloudFormation First, you need to link each of your AWS accounts with your New Relic account. To do so: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. You may automate this step with NerdGraph. Next, set up the metric stream using the CloudFormation template we provide in the last step of our UI. This template is provided as a base to setup the integration on a single region, and can be customized and extended based on your requirements. Manual setup using AWS Console, API, or calls Create a Kinesis Data Firehose Delivery Stream and configure the following destination parameters: Source: Direct PUT or other sources Data transformation: Disabled Record format conversion: Disabled Destination: Third-party service provider Ensure the following settings are defined: Third-party service provider: New Relic - Metrics New Relic configuration HTTP endpoint URL - US Datacenter: https://aws-api.newrelic.com/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 HTTP endpoint URL - EU Datacenter: https://aws-api.eu01.nr-data.net/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 API key: Enter your license key Content encoding: GZIP Retry duration: 60 S3 backup mode: Failed data only S3 bucket: select a bucket or create a new one to store metrics that failed to be sent. New Relic buffer conditions Buffer size: 1 MB Buffer interval: 60 (seconds) Permissions IAM role: Create or update IAM role Create the metric stream. Go to CloudWatch service in your AWS console and select the Streams option under the Metrics menu. Click on Create metric stream. Determine the right configuration based on your use cases: Use inclusion and exclusion filters to select which services should push metrics to New Relic. Select your Kinesis Data Firehose. Define a meaningful name for the stream (for example, newrelic-metric-stream). Change default output format to Open Telemetry 0.7 (JSON is not supported) Confirm the creation of the metric stream. Alternatively, you can find instructions on the AWS documentation in order to create the CloudWatch metric stream using a CloudFormation template, API, or the CLI. Add the new AWS account in the Metric streams mode in the New Relic UI. Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. Tip The following are the minimal permissions that should be granted on the AWS role configured in New Relic so that CloudWatch metrics can be enriched with additional service metadata and custom tags when applicable: config:BatchGetResourceConfig config:ListDiscoveredResources tag:GetResources Copy The New Relic UI currently recommends the ReadOnlyAccess policy over these individual items so that New Relic has proper permissions to collect service data that's not available in AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams. Validate your data is received correctly To confirm you are receiving data from the Metric Streams, follow the steps below: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, and search for the Stream accounts. You can check the following: Account status dashboard. Useful to confirm that metric data is being received (errors, number of namespaces/metrics ingested, etc.) Explore your data. Use the Data Explorer to find a specific set of metrics, access all dimensions available for a given metric and more. Metrics naming convention Metrics received from AWS CloudWatch are stored in New Relic as dimensional metrics following this convention: Metrics are prefixed by the AWS namespace, all lowercase, where / is replaced with . : AWS/EC2 -> aws.ec2 AWS/ApplicationELB -> aws.applicationelb The original AWS metric name with its original case: aws.ec2.CPUUtilization aws.s3.5xxErrors aws.sns.NumberOfMessagesPublished If the resource the metric belongs to has a specific namespace prefix, it is used. If the resource the metric belongs to doesn't have a specific namespace prefix, metrics use the aws. prefix. aws.Region aws.s3.BucketName Current namespaces supported by AWS can be found in the CloudWatch documentation website. Query Experience, metric storage and mapping Metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch are stored as dimensional metrics of type summary and can be queried using NRQL. We have mapped metrics from the current cloud integrations to the new mappings that will come from AWS Metric Streams. You can continue to use the current metric naming, and queries will continue to work and pick data from AWS Metric Streams and the current cloud integrations. Check our documentation on how current cloud integrations metrics map to the new metric naming. All metrics coming from the metric stream will have these attributes: aws.MetricStreamArn collector.name = ‘cloudwatch-metric-streams’. AWS namespaces' entities in the New Relic Explorer We generate New Relic entities for most used AWS namespaces and will continue adding support for more namespaces. When we generate New Relic entities for a namespace you can expect to: Browse those entities in the New Relic Explorer. Access an out-of-the-box entity dashboard for those entities. Get metrics and entities from that namespace decorated with AWS tags. Collecting AWS tags requires that you have given New Relic the tag:GetResources permission which is part of the setup process in the UI. AWS tags show in metrics as tag.AWSTagName; for example, if you have set a Team AWS tag on the resource, it will show as tag.Team. Leverage all the built-in features that are part of the Explorer. Important Lookout view in Entity Explorer is not compatible with entities created from the AWS Metric Streams integration at this time. Set alert conditions You can create NRQL alert conditions on metrics from a metric stream. Make sure your filter limits data to metrics from the CloudWatch metric stream only. To do that, construct your queries like this: SELECT sum('aws.s3.5xxErrors') FROM Metric WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' FACET aws.accountId, aws.s3.BucketName Copy Then, to make sure that alerts processes the data correctly, configure the advanced signal settings. These settings are needed because AWS CloudWatch receives metrics from services with a certain delay (for example, Amazon guarantees that 90% of EC2 metrics are available in CloudWatch within 7 minutes of them being generated). Moreover, streaming metrics from AWS to New Relic adds up to 1 minute additional delay, mostly due to buffering data in the Firehose. To configure the signal settings, under Condition Settings, click on Advanced Signal Settings and enter the following values: Aggregation window. We recommend setting it to 1 minute. If you are having issues with flapping alerts or alerts not triggering, consider increasing it to 2 minutes. Offset evaluation by. Depending on the service, CloudWatch may send metrics with a certain delay. The value is set in windows. With a 1-minute aggregation window, setting the offset to 8 ensures the majority of the metrics are evaluated correctly. You may be able to use a lower offset if the delay introduced by AWS and Firehose is less. Fill data gaps with. Leave this void, or use Last known value if gaps in the data coming from AWS lead to false positives or negatives. See our documentation on how to create NRQL alerts for more details. Tags collection New Relic provides enhanced dimensions from metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch metric streams. Resource and custom tags are automatically pulled from most services and are used to decorate metrics with additional dimensions. Use the data explorer to see which tags are available on each AWS metric. The following query shows an example of tags being collected and queried as dimensions in metrics: SELECT average(`aws.rds.CPUUtilization`) FROM Metric FACET `tags.mycustomtag` SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy Note that not all metrics have their custom tags as dimensions. Currently, only metrics linked to entities in the New Relic Explorer have their custom tags associated. The AWS CloudWatch metric stream doesn't include tags as part of the stream message, hence, additional processing is required on the New Relic side. Metadata collection Like with custom tags, New Relic also pulls metadata information from relevant AWS services in order to decorate AWS CloudWatch metrics with enriched metadata collected from AWS Services APIs. This metadata is accessible in New Relic as additional dimensions on the metrics provided by AWS CloudWatch. This is an optional capability that's complementary to the CloudWatch Metric Streams integration. The solution relies on AWS Config, which might incur in additional costs in your AWS account. AWS Config provides granular controls to determine which services and resources are recorded. New Relic will only ingest metadata from the available resources in your AWS account. The following services / namespaces are supported: EC2 Lambda RDS ALB/NLB S3 API Gateway (excluding API v1) ELB EBS DynamoDB ECS Curated dashboards A set of dashboards for different AWS Services is available in the New Relic One Quickstarts app. Get access to the Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to browse and import dashboards: Navigate to the Apps catalog in New Relic One. Search and select the Quickstarts app. Click on the Add this app link in the top-right corner. To enable the app, select target accounts and confirm clicking the Update account button. If applicable, review and confirm the Terms and Conditions of Use. Note that it might take a few minutes until permissions are applied and the app is ready to be used. Once available, confirm the app is enabled. The Quickstarts app will be listed in the Apps catalog. Import dashboards from Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to import any of the curated dashboards: Navigate to Apps and open the Quickstarts app. Browse the AWS Dashboards. If you don't find a dashboard for your AWS service please submit your feedback on the top navigation bar or feel free to contribute with your own dashboard. Select the dashboard, confirm the target account and initial dashboard name. A copy of the dashboard should be imported in the target account. Additional customization is possible using any of the New Relic One dashboarding features. Manage your data New Relic provides a set of tools to keep track of the data being ingested in your account. Go to Manage your data in the settings menu to see all details. Metrics ingested from AWS Metric Streams integrations are considered in the Metric bucket. If you need a more granular view of the data you can use the bytecountestimate() function on Metric in order to estimate the data being ingested. For example, the following query represents data ingested from all metrics processed via AWS Metric Streams integration in the last 30 days (in bytes): FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate() where collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams' since 30 day ago Copy We recommend the following actions to control the data being ingested: Make sure metric streams are enabled only on the AWS accounts and regions you want to monitor with New Relic. Use the inclusion and exclusion filters in the CloudWatch Metric Stream in order to select which services / namespaces are being collected. Consider using drop data rules to discard metrics based on custom filters (for example, drop metrics by namespace and tag, tag value, or any other valid NRQL criteria). Important Metrics sent via AWS Metric Streams count against your Metric API limits for the New Relic account where data will be ingested. Migrating from AWS API polling integrations When metrics are sent via Metric Streams to New Relic, if the same metrics are being retrieved using the current poll-based integrations, those metrics will be duplicated. For example, alerts and dashboards that use sum or count will return twice the actual number. This includes alerts and dashboards that use metrics that have a .Sum suffix. We recommend sending the data to a non-production New Relic account where you can safely do tests. If that is not an option, then AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream filters are available to include or exclude certain namespaces that can cause trouble. Alternatively, you can use filtering on queries to distinguish between metrics that come from Metric Streams and those that come through polling. All metrics coming from Metric Streams are tagged with collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams'. Migration steps On a typical deployment, migrating from API polling to metric stream involves the following steps (we recommend trying this on a dev / staging environment first): Go through the AWS UI in New Relic (or use NerdGraph APIs) to link your AWS account with New Relic. This is currently needed even if your AWS account is already linked with polling integrations. Make sure you complete the last step in the onboarding, which involves enabling AWS CloudWatch metric stream and the AWS Kinesis Data Firehose to push metrics to New Relic. Complete this step for any additional AWS region you want to monitor, since AWS CloudWatch requires one stream per region. Ensure metrics are received from all connected regions and namespaces. This may take several minutes. Disable all unnecessary polling integrations in the previous AWS provider account. The following integrations still need to be enabled since they aren't fully replaced by metric streams: AWS Billing, AWS CloudTrail, AWS Health, AWS Trusted Advisor. Query, dashboard, and alert considerations AWS Metric Streams integration uses the Metric API to push metrics in the dimensional metric format. Poll-based integrations push metrics based on events (for example, ComputeSample event), and will be migrated to dimensional metrics in the future. To assist in this transition, New Relic provides a mechanism (known as shimming) that transparently lets you write queries in any format. Then these queries are processed as expected based on the source that's available (metrics or events). This mechanism works both ways, from events to metrics, and viceversa. Please consider the following when migrating from poll-based integrations: Custom dashboards that use poll-based AWS integration events should work as expected. Alert conditions that use poll-based AWS events might need to be adapted with dimensional metric format. Use the NRQL source for the alert condition. Entities in New Relic Explorer might be duplicated for up to 24 hours. Integrations not fully replaced by metric streams The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration only collects CloudWatch metrics, resource metadata and custom tags. The following API polling integrations still need to be enabled to get complete visibility from AWS: AWS Billing AWS CloudTrail AWS Health AWS Trusted Advisor AWS VPC Infrastructure Agent metrics and EC2 metadata decoration As with the EC2 API polling integration, when the infrastructure agent is installed on a host and the EC2 namespace is active via AWS CloudWatch metric stream integration, then all the infrastructure agent events and metrics are decorated with additional metadata. The following attributes will decorate infrastructure samples (some might not be applicable on all environments): awsAvailabilityZone, ec2InstanceId, ec2PublicDnsName, ec2State, ec2EbsOptimized, ec2PublicIpAddress, ec2PrivateIpAddress, ec2VpcId, ec2AmiId, ec2PrivateDnsName, ec2KeyName, ec2SubnetId, ec2InstanceType, ec2Hypervisor, ec2Architecture, ec2RootDeviceType, ec2RootDeviceName, ec2VirtualizationType, ec2PlacementGroupName, ec2PlacementGroupTenancy.",

Add or edit custom tags New Relic automatically imports custom tags you have added or edited for your AWS resources. Most metrics received via CloudWatch metric streams will have custom tags as dimensions. For API Polling integrations, if you don't see any tags in the Add filter menu of the Filter sets sidebar within a few minutes, delete the integration and try again: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS. Select the edit icon. Remove individual integrations or the entire account linkage as needed. Note that not all integrations support tags collection. You can enable (and disable) tags collection in the integration settings. Disconnect your AWS integrations You can disable one or more integrations anytime and still keep your AWS account connected to New Relic. However, New Relic recommends that you do not disable EC2 or EBS monitoring. These two integrations add important metadata to your EC2 instances and EBS volumes in New Relic. To uninstall your services completely from New Relic infrastructure Integrations, unlink your AWS account. Regional support China regions are not supported.",

This Lambda monitoring feature is not the same as the Lambda monitoring integration, which only uses CloudWatch data. Serverless Lambda monitoring is more extensive and uses both CloudWatch data and code-level instrumentation to deliver more in-depth monitoring. Why it matters Do you need to rapidly instrument monitoring and observability to your serverless functions without resorting to code changes? Our Lambda layer provides unified visibility into the most detailed behaviors of your Lambda functions so you can understand what's going on in your serverless applications. Use all this information to troubleshoot your systems and optimize your functions so they can function faster and deliver with confidence on serverless architectures. Spend less time instrumenting, and more time building. Lambda monitoring gives you: Every invocation of your Lambda functions, including performance data like detailed duration, cold starts, exceptions, and tracebacks. AWS Lambda event source information, which provides context and attributes about events that triggered each AWS Lambda invocation, such as API Gateway, ALB SNS, SQS, DynamoDB, and more. Visibility into your entire ecosystem with distributed tracing: see the path of requests that led to your Lambda, and see Lambda spans in your other distributed traces. Logs in context, which provides full invocation and function level logs right along side the metrics, attributes, and trace data. Inventoried tags and metadata. We retrieve information from your AWS entities, giving you the ability to filter and facet down to the team, or specific metadata attributes on the function configuration or invocation itself. Easy ability to query your data with an automatic facet builder, which instantly facets your dashboards and charts by attribute or function to explore custom data, without having to write queries. Lambda data is displayed in its own dedicated UI in New Relic One. Access and requirements See Compatibility and requirements of AWS Lambda monitoring. Next steps: Enable and use Lambda monitoring To get started using our Lambda monitoring, see the installation and enablement instructions. To better understand how Lambda monitoring works, read about the New Relic Lambda monitoring stack. You can also set up alerts or add your own custom events or attributes.",

      "body": "The New Relic Lambda monitoring stack There are several important parts to Lambda monitoring: Your function The New Relic agent or SDK The New Relic Lambda Extension New Relic's backend The New Relic One Lambda UI Your function Your function is the code you want to understand. You want to know when it's encountering errors, why it's slow, or how often it gets invoked. New Relic agent or SDK This is a library that New Relic provides for the language that your function is written in. Its job is to do the actual monitoring of your code. It measures the duration of your function invocations, notes errors that occur, records details about the source events, and your functions responses. To do this, it needs to wrap around your Lambda invocation handler function. With a bit more work on your part, you can break your invocation into interesting segments, and tie together the interaction of your function with other functions and services, providing a holistic view of your serverless application. New Relic Lambda Extension This sidecar process runs inside the Lambda execution environment, alongside your code. It enhances the telemetry that the agent collects, and sends it to New Relic's back end in batches. It can also send your function's logs to New Relic. The extension is a small application that integrates tightly with the AWS Lambda lifecycle, and works to minimize both the time it takes your telemetry to arrive at New Relic, and the impact that instrumentation has on your function's latency and throughput. See more about our Lambda extension. New Relic's backend The New Relic service receives your telemetry, processes it into AwsLambdaInvocation, AwsLambdaInvocationError, Span, and custom events, and stores all that in our telemetry database: NRDB. Lambda UI in New Relic One Lambda functions aren't quite like traditional services, so the experience of managing them is a little different from the classic APM experience. Inside New Relic One, Lambda functions have a custom UI, which quickly surfaces the most important information about your function, and integrates closely with our logging and distributed tracing features. Backed by NRDB and NRQL, you can also write custom dashboards and alerts for your functions. The legacy CloudWatch path Older integrations send telemetry in a slightly different way. Instead of passing it off to the extension, the Agent writes it out to CloudWatch as a log line. By adding a log subscription filter to pipe your function logs into the aws-log-ingestion Lambda function, we can recover that telemetry log line, and forward it on to New Relic, along with some interesting platform telemetry. Experience has shown that this approach has some considerable drawbacks. The AWS CloudWatch service is pretty expensive. After the free tier, log ingestion can easily eclipse the charges you pay to New Relic to ingest your telemetry. Plus, CloudWatch doesn't have a very good record when it comes to timeliness. CloudWatch log lines take many seconds, sometimes several minutes in cases of high load, to make their way to our log collection function. This delays time to glass, and fogs the view you have of your application at high load times, when an immediate, clear view of application performance is most critical.",

DistributedTraceSummary MobileRequest MobileRequestError Span Transaction TransactionError InfrastructureEvent Data sources : InfrastructureCloudTrail InfrastructureEvent describes changes (deltas) that occur in a system's live state. When an inventory or system state is added, removed, or changed, Infrastructure will produce an InfrastructureEvent that logs that activity. Attribute name Definition Data types category A New Relic category used to organize events in the UI. For example: automation, notification, and service. InfrastructureEvent changeType A simple classification of the type of change made to the entity: added, modified, or removed. InfrastructureEvent changedPath The fully specified name of the item that changed. This is constructed by taking the source and adding one or more additional path elements that uniquely identify the item that changed. InfrastructureEvent deltaId Delta refers to a recorded change in the system. The deltaId is a number used by New Relic to organize incoming inventory change data. InfrastructureEvent eventId The unique ID of the event, generated by New Relic. InfrastructureEvent format The type of infrastructure event. Each format type includes attributes that may be used to render the event in the UI. InfrastructureEvent newStatus The new agent status: disconnected or connected. InfrastructureEvent newValue If a change is made to the entity, this attribute contains the new value of the inventory that was changed. This will have no value if no change has been made. The value will display approximately 4K bytes of data. InfrastructureEvent oldValue If a change is made to the entity, this attribute contains the old value of the inventory that was changed. This will be blank if no change has been made. InfrastructureEvent provider For integrations that use generic event types (like the DatastoreSample event), the provider value specifies the source of the data (the service, or a sub-category of data from that service). Some Insights events are generic and are used by several integrations. For example, the DatastoreSample event is used by several integrations, including the AWS DynamoDB integration and the AWS RDS integration. In these cases, the provider attribute value represents the source of that attribute. This will usually be the service that data comes from or, for integrations that use several provider values, a certain sub-category of data from that service. When a provider value is present for a generic event, that event will have additional integration-specific attributes attached to it. Here’s an example of an Insights NRQL query that returns the attributes present for a DatastoreSample event reported by the AWS RDS integration: SELECT * from DatastoreSample where provider = 'RdsDbCluster' InfrastructureEvent source The fully specified origin of this inventory item. This is typically in the form category/plugin, where plugin is the generic word used for the tool that gathered this data. InfrastructureEvent summary A summary of the change that happened. Uses a human-friendly string, such as Agent disconnected. InfrastructureEvent violationUpdateType The type of change to the violation: For example: open or closed.

Integration for older runtimes requires a different strategy, but is possible. Python and NodeJS are by far the most popular languages in the Lambda ecosystem. The New Relic Lambda Layers for Node and Python include the very latest New Relic Agent version, and provide rich instrumentation with minimal configuration, right out of the box. Similarly, Go uses the New Relic Go Agent. We recommend building self-hosting Go lambda functions, because the latest AWS Lambda APIs are not supported in the AWS go1.x runtime. Fortunately, this is well supported by the AWS Lambda SDK for Go. New Relic recommends keeping the agent module up to date. Support is limited for agent versions older than 3.9.0. To minimize performance impact, we've taken a different approach with Java and .NET Core. New Relic provides OpenTelemetry SDKs for these runtimes. This approach requires a bit more code to integrate. For complete Lambda instrumentation, some of our agents included in our Lambda layers depend on a language-specific AWS SDK. If an AWS SDK is not used, Lambda data will appear as external service calls in the UI, with minimal detail. In other words, we rely on the AWS SDK to facilitate instrumentation of your function. For the following services, only the \"target\" (Lambda function name, SNS topic ARN, DynamoDB table name, etc.) is reported: Autoscaling, Athena, Batch, Cloud9, CodeBuild, DynamoDB, Greengrass, IoT, Kinesis (Streams, Firehose, Analytics, Video), Lambda, Lex, Machine Learning, MQ, Redshift, Rekognition, S3, SES, SimpleDB, SNS, SQS, Storage Gateway, and STS. About AWS costs Enabling serverless monitoring for AWS Lambda may result in Amazon Web Services charges. Our newrelic-log-ingestion Lambda function, which reports your Lambda data to us, is considered a Third Party Service: AWS charges resulting from your use of it are your responsibility. If you use the Lambda Extension, you can avoid the CloudWatch Logs ingest charge for the telemetry gathered by New Relic.",

Solution There are two common problems related to not completing all of the enablement procedures: Not seeing data on CloudWatch metrics UI page. This means the AWS integration step wasn't completed. Not seeing data on Troubleshooting category UI pages. If you aren't seeing data on the Distributed tracing, Errors, and Invocations UI tabs, this means the APM agent instrumentation step wasn't completed. Besides these basic enablement problems, there are some additional problems that may cause an issue: CloudWatch error \"HTTP error 401: unauthorized.\" This is due to an incorrect API Key. The --nr-api-keyargument in the Configure AWS enable step takes your user key, which is different from the REST API key. Custom metrics are missing. Lambda monitoring is not compatible with our custom metrics. Use custom attributes to add metadata. Invocations missing. To see invocation breakdown details, distributed tracing must be enabled as part of the Lambda instrumentation step. Distributed tracing is required so that span details can be displayed in the invocation details pane. You've completed the installation, integration, and instrumentation steps correctly, and your function is sending logs to CloudWatch but you're not seeing traces for specific dependencies (or any traces) in the UI. This may result from the order of layer merging (if you're using our Lambda layers) or from the order of import (if you're instrumenting manually): If you're instrumenting with layers: make sure in your function configuration that the New Relic layer is merged before other layers (though if your function uses webpack, the New Relic layer should be merged after the webpack layer). If you're instrumenting a Node function manually, make sure that your function imports newrelic and @newrelic/aws-sdk before it imports any dependencies you expect to monitor. If none of these solutions help you, contact our support team. The following information will help you when you talk to support technicians: Has the Lambda function appeared in the UI before? If so, what is the name of the function? If some data for the Lambda function is appearing in the UI, what specific data is appearing? What APM language agent are you using to instrument the function? Recommended: Attach your CloudWatch logs to the ticket To provide our support team with logging information when opening a ticket: Invoke the function in AWS Lambda. Click on the logs link after your function runs. This will take you to the CloudWatch logs in AWS. On the left-hand sidebar in AWS, under Logs, click on Insights. Select your function and also the newrelic-log-ingestion stream. Apply an appropriate Time Filter, and a log entry limit (the default of 20 may not be enough). Under Actions select Copy query results (ASCII). Paste the copied text into a new text file, then save and upload the text file to the ticket. Important The NR_LAMBDA_MONITORING payload contains all the information the agent attempts to send up, including metrics, events, some AWS account metadata, invocations and errors data. Note that some of that data (for example, our legacy metrics) will not make it to our UI because our ingest pipeline does not consume them.",

      "body": "The New Relic Lambda monitoring stack There are several important parts to Lambda monitoring: Your function The New Relic agent or SDK The New Relic Lambda Extension New Relic's backend The New Relic One Lambda UI Your function Your function is the code you want to understand. You want to know when it's encountering errors, why it's slow, or how often it gets invoked. New Relic agent or SDK This is a library that New Relic provides for the language that your function is written in. Its job is to do the actual monitoring of your code. It measures the duration of your function invocations, notes errors that occur, records details about the source events, and your functions responses. To do this, it needs to wrap around your Lambda invocation handler function. With a bit more work on your part, you can break your invocation into interesting segments, and tie together the interaction of your function with other functions and services, providing a holistic view of your serverless application. New Relic Lambda Extension This sidecar process runs inside the Lambda execution environment, alongside your code. It enhances the telemetry that the agent collects, and sends it to New Relic's back end in batches. It can also send your function's logs to New Relic. The extension is a small application that integrates tightly with the AWS Lambda lifecycle, and works to minimize both the time it takes your telemetry to arrive at New Relic, and the impact that instrumentation has on your function's latency and throughput. See more about our Lambda extension. New Relic's backend The New Relic service receives your telemetry, processes it into AwsLambdaInvocation, AwsLambdaInvocationError, Span, and custom events, and stores all that in our telemetry database: NRDB. Lambda UI in New Relic One Lambda functions aren't quite like traditional services, so the experience of managing them is a little different from the classic APM experience. Inside New Relic One, Lambda functions have a custom UI, which quickly surfaces the most important information about your function, and integrates closely with our logging and distributed tracing features. Backed by NRDB and NRQL, you can also write custom dashboards and alerts for your functions. The legacy CloudWatch path Older integrations send telemetry in a slightly different way. Instead of passing it off to the extension, the Agent writes it out to CloudWatch as a log line. By adding a log subscription filter to pipe your function logs into the aws-log-ingestion Lambda function, we can recover that telemetry log line, and forward it on to New Relic, along with some interesting platform telemetry. Experience has shown that this approach has some considerable drawbacks. The AWS CloudWatch service is pretty expensive. After the free tier, log ingestion can easily eclipse the charges you pay to New Relic to ingest your telemetry. Plus, CloudWatch doesn't have a very good record when it comes to timeliness. CloudWatch log lines take many seconds, sometimes several minutes in cases of high load, to make their way to our log collection function. This delays time to glass, and fogs the view you have of your application at high load times, when an immediate, clear view of application performance is most critical.",

This may result from the order of layer merging (if you're using our Lambda layers) or from the order of import (if you're instrumenting manually): If you're instrumenting with layers: make sure in your function configuration that the New Relic layer is merged before other layers (though if your function uses webpack, the New Relic layer should be merged after the webpack layer). If you're instrumenting a Node function manually, make sure that your function imports newrelic and @newrelic/aws-sdk before it imports any dependencies you expect to monitor. If none of these solutions help you, contact our support team. The following information will help you when you talk to support technicians: Has the Lambda function appeared in the UI before? If so, what is the name of the function? If some data for the Lambda function is appearing in the UI, what specific data is appearing? What APM language agent are you using to instrument the function? Recommended: Attach your CloudWatch logs to the ticket To provide our support team with logging information when opening a ticket: Invoke the function in AWS Lambda. Click on the logs link after your function runs. This will take you to the CloudWatch logs in AWS. On the left-hand sidebar in AWS, under Logs, click on Insights. Select your function and also the newrelic-log-ingestion stream. Apply an appropriate Time Filter, and a log entry limit (the default of 20 may not be enough).

      "body": "The New Relic Lambda monitoring stack There are several important parts to Lambda monitoring: Your function The New Relic agent or SDK The New Relic Lambda Extension New Relic's backend The New Relic One Lambda UI Your function Your function is the code you want to understand. You want to know when it's encountering errors, why it's slow, or how often it gets invoked. New Relic agent or SDK This is a library that New Relic provides for the language that your function is written in. Its job is to do the actual monitoring of your code. It measures the duration of your function invocations, notes errors that occur, records details about the source events, and your functions responses. To do this, it needs to wrap around your Lambda invocation handler function. With a bit more work on your part, you can break your invocation into interesting segments, and tie together the interaction of your function with other functions and services, providing a holistic view of your serverless application. New Relic Lambda Extension This sidecar process runs inside the Lambda execution environment, alongside your code. It enhances the telemetry that the agent collects, and sends it to New Relic's back end in batches. It can also send your function's logs to New Relic. The extension is a small application that integrates tightly with the AWS Lambda lifecycle, and works to minimize both the time it takes your telemetry to arrive at New Relic, and the impact that instrumentation has on your function's latency and throughput. See more about our Lambda extension. New Relic's backend The New Relic service receives your telemetry, processes it into AwsLambdaInvocation, AwsLambdaInvocationError, Span, and custom events, and stores all that in our telemetry database: NRDB. Lambda UI in New Relic One Lambda functions aren't quite like traditional services, so the experience of managing them is a little different from the classic APM experience. Inside New Relic One, Lambda functions have a custom UI, which quickly surfaces the most important information about your function, and integrates closely with our logging and distributed tracing features. Backed by NRDB and NRQL, you can also write custom dashboards and alerts for your functions. The legacy CloudWatch path Older integrations send telemetry in a slightly different way. Instead of passing it off to the extension, the Agent writes it out to CloudWatch as a log line. By adding a log subscription filter to pipe your function logs into the aws-log-ingestion Lambda function, we can recover that telemetry log line, and forward it on to New Relic, along with some interesting platform telemetry. Experience has shown that this approach has some considerable drawbacks. The AWS CloudWatch service is pretty expensive. After the free tier, log ingestion can easily eclipse the charges you pay to New Relic to ingest your telemetry. Plus, CloudWatch doesn't have a very good record when it comes to timeliness. CloudWatch log lines take many seconds, sometimes several minutes in cases of high load, to make their way to our log collection function. This delays time to glass, and fogs the view you have of your application at high load times, when an immediate, clear view of application performance is most critical.",

You want to know when it's encountering errors, why it's slow, or how often it gets invoked. New Relic agent or SDK This is a library that New Relic provides for the language that your function is written in. Its job is to do the actual monitoring of your code. It measures the duration of your function invocations, notes errors that occur, records details about the source events, and your functions responses. To do this, it needs to wrap around your Lambda invocation handler function. With a bit more work on your part, you can break your invocation into interesting segments, and tie together the interaction of your function with other functions and services, providing a holistic view of your serverless application. New Relic Lambda Extension This sidecar process runs inside the Lambda execution environment, alongside your code. It enhances the telemetry that the agent collects, and sends it to New Relic's back end in batches. It can also send your function's logs to New Relic. The extension is a small application that integrates tightly with the AWS Lambda lifecycle, and works to minimize both the time it takes your telemetry to arrive at New Relic, and the impact that instrumentation has on your function's latency and throughput. See more about our Lambda extension. New Relic's backend The New Relic service receives your telemetry, processes it into AwsLambdaInvocation, AwsLambdaInvocationError, Span, and custom events, and stores all that in our telemetry database: NRDB. Lambda UI in New Relic One Lambda functions aren't quite like traditional services, so the experience of managing them is a little different from the classic APM experience. Inside New Relic One, Lambda functions have a custom UI, which quickly surfaces the most important information about your function, and integrates closely with our logging and distributed tracing features. Backed by NRDB and NRQL, you can also write custom dashboards and alerts for your functions. The legacy CloudWatch path Older integrations send telemetry in a slightly different way. Instead of passing it off to the extension, the Agent writes it out to CloudWatch as a log line. By adding a log subscription filter to pipe your function logs into the aws-log-ingestion Lambda function, we can recover that telemetry log line, and forward it on to New Relic, along with some interesting platform telemetry. Experience has shown that this approach has some considerable drawbacks. The AWS CloudWatch service is pretty expensive. After the free tier, log ingestion can easily eclipse the charges you pay to New Relic to ingest your telemetry. Plus, CloudWatch doesn't have a very good record when it comes to timeliness. CloudWatch log lines take many seconds, sometimes several minutes in cases of high load, to make their way to our log collection function. This delays time to glass, and fogs the view you have of your application at high load times, when an immediate, clear view of application performance is most critical.",

This Lambda monitoring feature is not the same as the Lambda monitoring integration, which only uses CloudWatch data. Serverless Lambda monitoring is more extensive and uses both CloudWatch data and code-level instrumentation to deliver more in-depth monitoring. Why it matters Do you need to rapidly instrument monitoring and observability to your serverless functions without resorting to code changes? Our Lambda layer provides unified visibility into the most detailed behaviors of your Lambda functions so you can understand what's going on in your serverless applications. Use all this information to troubleshoot your systems and optimize your functions so they can function faster and deliver with confidence on serverless architectures. Spend less time instrumenting, and more time building. Lambda monitoring gives you: Every invocation of your Lambda functions, including performance data like detailed duration, cold starts, exceptions, and tracebacks. AWS Lambda event source information, which provides context and attributes about events that triggered each AWS Lambda invocation, such as API Gateway, ALB SNS, SQS, DynamoDB, and more. Visibility into your entire ecosystem with distributed tracing: see the path of requests that led to your Lambda, and see Lambda spans in your other distributed traces. Logs in context, which provides full invocation and function level logs right along side the metrics, attributes, and trace data. Inventoried tags and metadata. We retrieve information from your AWS entities, giving you the ability to filter and facet down to the team, or specific metadata attributes on the function configuration or invocation itself. Easy ability to query your data with an automatic facet builder, which instantly facets your dashboards and charts by attribute or function to explore custom data, without having to write queries.

Integration for older runtimes requires a different strategy, but is possible. Python and NodeJS are by far the most popular languages in the Lambda ecosystem. The New Relic Lambda Layers for Node and Python include the very latest New Relic Agent version, and provide rich instrumentation with minimal configuration, right out of the box. Similarly, Go uses the New Relic Go Agent. We recommend building self-hosting Go lambda functions, because the latest AWS Lambda APIs are not supported in the AWS go1.x runtime. Fortunately, this is well supported by the AWS Lambda SDK for Go. New Relic recommends keeping the agent module up to date. Support is limited for agent versions older than 3.9.0. To minimize performance impact, we've taken a different approach with Java and .NET Core. New Relic provides OpenTelemetry SDKs for these runtimes. This approach requires a bit more code to integrate. For complete Lambda instrumentation, some of our agents included in our Lambda layers depend on a language-specific AWS SDK. If an AWS SDK is not used, Lambda data will appear as external service calls in the UI, with minimal detail. In other words, we rely on the AWS SDK to facilitate instrumentation of your function.

You want to know when it's encountering errors, why it's slow, or how often it gets invoked. New Relic agent or SDK This is a library that New Relic provides for the language that your function is written in. Its job is to do the actual monitoring of your code. It measures the duration of your function invocations, notes errors that occur, records details about the source events, and your functions responses. To do this, it needs to wrap around your Lambda invocation handler function. With a bit more work on your part, you can break your invocation into interesting segments, and tie together the interaction of your function with other functions and services, providing a holistic view of your serverless application. New Relic Lambda Extension This sidecar process runs inside the Lambda execution environment, alongside your code. It enhances the telemetry that the agent collects, and sends it to New Relic's back end in batches. It can also send your function's logs to New Relic. The extension is a small application that integrates tightly with the AWS Lambda lifecycle, and works to minimize both the time it takes your telemetry to arrive at New Relic, and the impact that instrumentation has on your function's latency and throughput. See more about our Lambda extension. New Relic's backend The New Relic service receives your telemetry, processes it into AwsLambdaInvocation, AwsLambdaInvocationError, Span, and custom events, and stores all that in our telemetry database: NRDB. Lambda UI in New Relic One Lambda functions aren't quite like traditional services, so the experience of managing them is a little different from the classic APM experience. Inside New Relic One, Lambda functions have a custom UI, which quickly surfaces the most important information about your function, and integrates closely with our logging and distributed tracing features. Backed by NRDB and NRQL, you can also write custom dashboards and alerts for your functions. The legacy CloudWatch path Older integrations send telemetry in a slightly different way. Instead of passing it off to the extension, the Agent writes it out to CloudWatch as a log line. By adding a log subscription filter to pipe your function logs into the aws-log-ingestion Lambda function, we can recover that telemetry log line, and forward it on to New Relic, along with some interesting platform telemetry. Experience has shown that this approach has some considerable drawbacks. The AWS CloudWatch service is pretty expensive. After the free tier, log ingestion can easily eclipse the charges you pay to New Relic to ingest your telemetry. Plus, CloudWatch doesn't have a very good record when it comes to timeliness. CloudWatch log lines take many seconds, sometimes several minutes in cases of high load, to make their way to our log collection function. This delays time to glass, and fogs the view you have of your application at high load times, when an immediate, clear view of application performance is most critical.",

This Lambda monitoring feature is not the same as the Lambda monitoring integration, which only uses CloudWatch data. Serverless Lambda monitoring is more extensive and uses both CloudWatch data and code-level instrumentation to deliver more in-depth monitoring. Why it matters Do you need to rapidly instrument monitoring and observability to your serverless functions without resorting to code changes? Our Lambda layer provides unified visibility into the most detailed behaviors of your Lambda functions so you can understand what's going on in your serverless applications. Use all this information to troubleshoot your systems and optimize your functions so they can function faster and deliver with confidence on serverless architectures. Spend less time instrumenting, and more time building. Lambda monitoring gives you: Every invocation of your Lambda functions, including performance data like detailed duration, cold starts, exceptions, and tracebacks. AWS Lambda event source information, which provides context and attributes about events that triggered each AWS Lambda invocation, such as API Gateway, ALB SNS, SQS, DynamoDB, and more. Visibility into your entire ecosystem with distributed tracing: see the path of requests that led to your Lambda, and see Lambda spans in your other distributed traces. Logs in context, which provides full invocation and function level logs right along side the metrics, attributes, and trace data. Inventoried tags and metadata. We retrieve information from your AWS entities, giving you the ability to filter and facet down to the team, or specific metadata attributes on the function configuration or invocation itself. Easy ability to query your data with an automatic facet builder, which instantly facets your dashboards and charts by attribute or function to explore custom data, without having to write queries. Lambda data is displayed in its own dedicated UI in New Relic One. Access and requirements See Compatibility and requirements of AWS Lambda monitoring.

Recommended AWS Lambda language runtimes NodeJS: nodejs12.x, nodejs14.x Python: python3.7, python3.8, python3.9 Go: provided, provided.al2 Java: java8.al2, java11 .NET Core: dotnetcore3.1 AWS has older runtimes for these languages as well, but AWS has not chosen to support the latest Lambda APIs with those older runtimes. Integration for older runtimes requires a different strategy, but is possible. Python and NodeJS are by far the most popular languages in the Lambda ecosystem. The New Relic Lambda Layers for Node and Python include the very latest New Relic Agent version, and provide rich instrumentation with minimal configuration, right out of the box. Similarly, Go uses the New Relic Go Agent. We recommend building self-hosting Go lambda functions, because the latest AWS Lambda APIs are not supported in the AWS go1.x runtime. Fortunately, this is well supported by the AWS Lambda SDK for Go. New Relic recommends keeping the agent module up to date. Support is limited for agent versions older than 3.9.0. To minimize performance impact, we've taken a different approach with Java and .NET Core. New Relic provides OpenTelemetry SDKs for these runtimes. This approach requires a bit more code to integrate. For complete Lambda instrumentation, some of our agents included in our Lambda layers depend on a language-specific AWS SDK. If an AWS SDK is not used, Lambda data will appear as external service calls in the UI, with minimal detail. In other words, we rely on the AWS SDK to facilitate instrumentation of your function. For the following services, only the \"target\" (Lambda function name, SNS topic ARN, DynamoDB table name, etc.) is reported: Autoscaling, Athena, Batch, Cloud9, CodeBuild, DynamoDB, Greengrass, IoT, Kinesis (Streams, Firehose, Analytics, Video), Lambda, Lex, Machine Learning, MQ, Redshift, Rekognition, S3, SES, SimpleDB, SNS, SQS, Storage Gateway, and STS. About AWS costs Enabling serverless monitoring for AWS Lambda may result in Amazon Web Services charges. Our newrelic-log-ingestion Lambda function, which reports your Lambda data to us, is considered a Third Party Service: AWS charges resulting from your use of it are your responsibility. If you use the Lambda Extension, you can avoid the CloudWatch Logs ingest charge for the telemetry gathered by New Relic.",

      "body": "We use the data dictionary to provide information about data types (for example, Transaction, Metric, Log) and attached attributes. This is exposed in the New Relic query experience, on hovering over the data types and attributes. And we also expose the dictionary to the public. This doc contains info on how to add data to the dictionary. Note that currently we don't have infrastructure integration data in the dictionary. We also have very few attributes for the Metric data type, just a few basic default ones, despite there being many potential attributes attached to that data type depending on what the data source is. Data dictionary structure The data in the data dictionary is structured like this: Data types: sometimes called \"events\" for historical reasons, these are the NRDB data objects, like Transaction, Metric, Log, Span, etc. Attributes: these are key:value pairs attached to data types. One attribute can have multiple data types listed for it. For example, appName is on multiple data types. Data source: The New Relic product from which the data originates. With the current implementation, a data type must have a single data source assigned. This isn't ideal, as theoretically a data type can come from multiple sources. Add a new data type To add a new data type: Make a new folder in this directory, alongside the other directories: /docs-website/tree/develop/src/data-dictionary/events Copy Duplicate a data type file (for example, this Metric data type), place it in the new folder, and fill it out with the new info. For how to add attributes on a new data type, keep reading. Add attributes To add attributes: Our goal is to avoid adding redundant attributes entries, so you should first check to see if there's an existing attribute that has the same name and same general definition as the one you're trying to add. If it exists, edit that file to include the new data type (under events:). If an existing attribute is fairly close in definition but not exact, try to edit the definition so it works for all associated data types. If there is no existing attribute, create a new one. The easiest way is to copy an existing attribute file, edit all relevant fields to be accurate, and place it in the folder of the data type it's attached to (for example, Transaction). When writing an attribute, try to keep it as concise as possible, and avoid using links. For more on that, see Style. If the attribute has one of the units of measurement we use (like units: percentage (%)), add that to the front matter. For info on units, see Units. Attribute style guidelines When adding or editing attributes, some things to keep in mind: Aim for concise descriptions. Notes on this: Feel free to use sentence fragments. Feel free to edit definitions submitted from internal teams as sometimes their definitions will be overly long or have unneeded links. Some attributes are only present in some situations (for example, when a specific APM agent is used, or when a specific config option is true). We should avoid documenting most of these, with the idea that most customers will only care about the data because it's being reported for them, and won't care about the things that factor into the reasons why it wouldn't be reported. If it's thought that the addition would help customers who already have the data reporting understand the data better, you can include it. Write so it reads well as plain text. Details on this: Note that the docs site data dictionary has our usual docs styles available, but the query UI definitions have no styling available. This means that you should write definitions so that they are understandable without any styling, as plain text. You can often avoid any need for styling (for example, data types like Transaction are easy to understand as plain text, as are most phrasings that use attribute names or values. When plain text makes something too ambiguous and you need some styling, use back ticks to indicate attributes or values (for example, a definition like: Reported when ` category ` is ` http ` ). Using this also sets us up for success if we implement styling in the UI definitions in the future. We should avoid links because those aren't visible in the query UI; the query UI only displays plain text. However, every attribute entry in the query UI does display a 'See attribute in docs' link that links to the complete and normally formatted docs site entry. This means that we can use links provided that they will display in an easy to understand way in the query UI. For example, here's an example of an attribute that would read clearly in plain text despite not having a link. We should avoid using a link format like \"For more information, see Create an alert condition\", because it wouldn't read well in plain text, and would choose something like \"For more information, see our alert condition docs.\" Using units of measurement Attribute entries have an optional unit of measurement field in the front matter. For example, here the front matter for an attribute with a percent unit of measurement: --- name: cpuPercent type: attribute units: percentage (%) events: - ProcessSample --- Copy What unit of measurement to select for an attribute is sometimes obvious, like if the attribute value is measured in milliseconds (units: milliseconds (ms)) or seconds (units: seconds (s)) or a percentage (units: percentage (%)). We also have several units of measurement that are not obvious, like count, enum, rate, and ID. (Technically, these aren't actually \"units of measurement\" and are more just conceptual data types but we're doing it this way as a workaround so you can ignore the fact that units of measurement isn't actually accurate.) The main reason we want to specify this information is that this will control what kinds of queries or charts can be created or auto-suggested by New Relic. For example, the New Relic UI wouldn't want to auto-suggest a chart graphing the average of ID values because that wouldn't make any sense. So attributes with accurate units, such as data types, will help product provide more practical help/suggestions to customers in future. Here are some tips for the non-obvious unit types: count: This is a count of something, though not a count of time-based units. For a number to be a count, it must (a) only be capable of increasing during a given time/sampling period, and (b) have a theoretically uncapped range. This wouldn't be used for a count of time units; if it was a count of seconds, for example, you would just use 'seconds' as the unit of measurement. A couple of examples of a count: databaseCallCount threadConcurrency enum: enum is short for enumerated list. In other words, it is a specific range of numbers that represent other non-numeric elements. For example, an attribute that had HTTP error codes (404, 505, etc.) as possible values would be an enum. A range of numbers that represent color codes would be another example of an enum. (Theoretically, an enum can represent lists without numeric values but we have no need to categorize strings so we only care about numeric-value lists.) Example: httpResponsecode. rate: Use this for any rate (for example, count per second). These are typically for averaged rates over small units of time, like second or millisecond. We previously have used the unit of time for these attributes (for example, using seconds as the unit of measurement for a count per second rate), but now we want to use rate for these. This is necessary because the types of displays used for rates would be different than the types of displays used for a simpler duration/count measurement. Example: MySQL integration attribute db.innodb.dataReadBytesPerSecond, which has the definition \"Rate at which data is read from InnoDB tables in bytes per second.\" id: Use ID for any identification number attribute. Example: appId.",

      "body": "Important New Relic provides limited technical support for customers using .NET Framework 4.0 or earlier. This level of support includes ensuring that the following areas are configured as expected: Agent configuration System settings Network access Permissions settings You can perform most troubleshooting checks by using New Relic Diagnostics, with the exception of a few checks that must be done manually. If a New Relic Diagnostics check does find an issue, information on additional troubleshooting and potential resolutions will appear in your terminal. Agent version requirements To get the most out of your New Relic .NET Framework agent, make sure you follow New Relic's compatibility and requirements guidelines. Important Applications running on .NET Framework version 4.0 or lower require a New Relic .NET agent version lower than 7.0. Download and run the appropriate install package for your architecture: 32-bit installer 64-bit installer Agent configuration Limited technical support to troubleshoot your basic installation and configuration includes: Check if the .NET agent is present and has valid configuration files. If the agent is installed, check for the agent's core .dll. If the config file is valid, check for expected elements. For example, include a manual check that it conforms to the standards laid out in the .xsd. Instrumentation Limited technical support to troubleshoot if instrumentation is possible includes: Check if WAS registry keys and required values are present and valid. Check W3SVC registry keys and required values are present and valid. Check ENV (non-IIS/global environment variables) reg keys and required values are present and valid. Verify if instrumentation is possible by using these key checks to determine what types of apps can be monitored. Confirm that the process has the necessary environment variables loaded. For example, use a tool such as the Microsoft Sysinternals Process Explorer. Web app Some checks require elevated permissions. For best results, run New Relic Diagnostics from an Admin shell. Limited technical support to troubleshoot running web apps with the .NET agent installed includes: Check for any running W3WP processes, and get their pid. Check for key .dll required for instrumentation. For example, if there are any W3WP processes, check if the New Relic profiler .dll and mscorelib.dll are loaded into the process. Applications not hosted on IIS [#non-IIS apps] Limited technical support to troubleshoot apps not hosted on IIS includes: When using the MSI, ensure the Instrument all option has been enabled. Check that the custom instrumentation file has been created, is in the proper place, and is accurate. If applicable, include a manual check that it conforms to the standards laid out in the .xsd. Network access and permissions Limited technical support to troubleshoot system network access and permissions applies to any agent version, and includes: Check system network access and permissions. Run collector tests. For example, check whether the URL https://collector.newrelic.com/status/mongrel is up and the server can connect to it. Check whether the config file contains any proxy settings, if proxy info has been passed to New Relic Diagnostics, and if these settings allow for connection to New Relic collectors. Check if New Relic Diagnostics is running as admin. New Relic Diagnostics must run as admin to help ensure accuracy of some other tests. Also, admin rights are required to install the .NET agent. Agent logs Limited technical support to troubleshoot information available from .NET agent logs includes: Gather any available agent logs. Check the log level. Check for known issues noted in the logs. Troubleshooting log files may require you to work directly with New Relic Support. Framework version Limited technical support depends on which .NET agent version you are using. New Relic Support will check what framework versions of the .NET agent are installed on the system. Full URL in OpenRasta requests When using OpenRasta instrumentation, the full URL may be captured on instrumented requests. This may result in query strings being collected that may contain sensitive information. See security bulletin NR19-01.",

If there are no special requirements, write: Compatible with all agent versions. Description Describe the behavior of the call with as much detail as possible. Do not describe what individual parameters do except in broad strokes; details of parameters and call variants belong under the Parameters heading. Similarly, do not describe return values. When cross-referencing another API call, format its name with code blocks, and include parentheses () like this: anotherCoolMethod(). Tip You can include callouts, but use discretion.

Do not include newrelic. prefixes unless they are integral to the call name (as in the PHP agent). Do not include parentheses () in the call itself. For example: apiStyleGuidelines (Example agent API) Copy Short title guidelines For the doc's short title: Include only the method name. Do not include newrelic. prefixes unless they are integral to the call name (as in the PHP agent). Do not include parentheses (). Adjust if necessary to fit on a single line in the category's sidebar. For example: apiStyleGuidelines Copy Syntax guidelines Important The Python and iOS agents use their own guidelines. For those guidelines, see the existing methods in those languages. Document each variant of a call on its own line. Do not use any formatting except italicizing the data type. Wrap optional parameters (including the comma separator) in square brackets []. Indicate the variable portion by prefacing it with a dollar sign $.

      "body": "This document is a template for an API tutorial document: Please skim the entire template first to understand the expected structure for this type of doc. Then, clone this doc using the Clone content link in the Page tools box. Delete all content up to Introduction (this heading won't be visible). For the doc title (the field at top of page): Doc should be named in a practical, use-case-focused way. Example: Add custom attributes to transactions Introduction (this heading will not be visible) Provide a brief explanation of what this document will teach customers, and why it is valuable for customers to know how to do that. Focus on the value the API provides to the customers and mention specific, common use cases. Any relevant notes about support/compatability should go here, too. Here's an example from the Java API asynchronous tutorial doc: New Relic for Java includes an API to instrument asynchronous activity. For supported frameworks, the Java agent usually instruments async work automatically. However, the async API can be useful for adding more detail to your data. This document provides examples of using tokens and segments to instrument your app. Optional: Provide an overview for complex processes This is an optional section for complicated tutorials that involve either using several methods in one procedure or that have different alternate steps you can take to achieve similar results. This section can link to lower-down sections to allow users to skip around as needed. For simple tutorials, this section isn't necessary. For an example, see this section of the Java async tutorial. Provide a procedure to accomplish the task Tell the user how to accomplish the task, and link to the methods necessary to accomplish that task. As much as possible, we're looking to describe tasks in \"procedures\" (procedure is tech writer jargon for a series of numbered steps). This may be tough to do for fairly open-ended/variable tasks, but it will usually be possible to chunk the content at a fairly high-level to make it into a procedure. Along the way, explain what the importance of the procedure step is, and how one might verify that the step was done correctly. For code samples, avoid using large chunks of code. Instead, use smaller pieces of code and give context for how they are being used. (If you think a large app code example would be helpful, place that later in the doc in the Example section.) Tip For an example of an open-ended task segmented into procedural chunks, see the Asynchronous doc section Connecting async threads. For another example, see this TomCat GAE Flex procedure. Base your procedure on the simple structure below. Tech writers will edit your content to match our style and formatting requirements: Step 1. Do something... Methods and example code to implement the first step. For each step, if applicable, indicate the significance of that step (why it's important) and how the user might verify that the step was done correctly (for example, something showing up in UI, or running a verification test of some sort). If needed: Step 2. Do something else... Methods and example code to implement step 2. If needed: Step 3. Do something else... Methods and example code to implement step 3. Last step. Verify that the task was completed... Explain how a user would know they'd completed the task correctly. In particular, how would the user find the new change or data in the New Relic UI. What NR products and pages would the change be noticed on? If new data shows up in Insights, what event types can it be found under? Optional: Do something else with the API Same as above. Make as many headings and separate procedures as needed. Optional: Large example code block If you think a large app code example would be useful, place here. Within any code block, explain all New Relic functions/methods, not just the main methods. Instead of in-line comments, consider using highlighted sections underneath the code block to give additional context. Here's an example: Code block example The following code example shows a segment starting in the storeItem method to measure how long the Lambda statement is waiting in the thread pool. To stop timing the segment, you must call either .end() or .ignore(). If you don't want to report the segment as part of its parent transaction, call .ignore(). Otherwise, to report the segment as part of its parent transaction, call .end(). private void storeItem(long id) { Segment segment = NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction(). startSegment(\"storeItem\") ; segment. reportAsExternal (DatastoreParameters .product(\"H2\") .collection(null) .operation(\"insert\") .instance(\"localhost\", 8080) .databaseName(\"test\") .build()); // fire and forget DB_POOL.submit(() -> { segment.end(); insertData(id); }); } Copy The agent API calls in this sample are: startSegment(...): Begins the segment that will time the code. For more on this method, see the Javadoc. reportAsExternal(DatastoreParameters()): Associates the time with a datastore external call This will show up in APM with datastore data. For more information, see reportAsExternal API. segment.end(): Stops timing this segment. For more on this method, see the Javadoc.

Warn the user that they need to be on the most recent agent version. Instrument missing sections of your code with transactions To instrument your app, New Relic separates each path through your code into its own transaction. New Relic times (or “instruments”) the parent method in these transactions to measure your app’s overall performance, and collects transaction traces from long-running transactions for additional detail.

Enhance the metadata of a transaction Sometimes, the code you are targeting is visible in the New Relic UI, but some details of the method are not useful.

      "body": "We use the data dictionary to provide information about data types (for example, Transaction, Metric, Log) and attached attributes. This is exposed in the New Relic query experience, on hovering over the data types and attributes. And we also expose the dictionary to the public. This doc contains info on how to add data to the dictionary. Note that currently we don't have infrastructure integration data in the dictionary. We also have very few attributes for the Metric data type, just a few basic default ones, despite there being many potential attributes attached to that data type depending on what the data source is. Data dictionary structure The data in the data dictionary is structured like this: Data types: sometimes called \"events\" for historical reasons, these are the NRDB data objects, like Transaction, Metric, Log, Span, etc. Attributes: these are key:value pairs attached to data types. One attribute can have multiple data types listed for it. For example, appName is on multiple data types. Data source: The New Relic product from which the data originates. With the current implementation, a data type must have a single data source assigned. This isn't ideal, as theoretically a data type can come from multiple sources. Add a new data type To add a new data type: Make a new folder in this directory, alongside the other directories: /docs-website/tree/develop/src/data-dictionary/events Copy Duplicate a data type file (for example, this Metric data type), place it in the new folder, and fill it out with the new info. For how to add attributes on a new data type, keep reading. Add attributes To add attributes: Our goal is to avoid adding redundant attributes entries, so you should first check to see if there's an existing attribute that has the same name and same general definition as the one you're trying to add. If it exists, edit that file to include the new data type (under events:). If an existing attribute is fairly close in definition but not exact, try to edit the definition so it works for all associated data types. If there is no existing attribute, create a new one. The easiest way is to copy an existing attribute file, edit all relevant fields to be accurate, and place it in the folder of the data type it's attached to (for example, Transaction). When writing an attribute, try to keep it as concise as possible, and avoid using links. For more on that, see Style. If the attribute has one of the units of measurement we use (like units: percentage (%)), add that to the front matter. For info on units, see Units. Attribute style guidelines When adding or editing attributes, some things to keep in mind: Aim for concise descriptions. Notes on this: Feel free to use sentence fragments. Feel free to edit definitions submitted from internal teams as sometimes their definitions will be overly long or have unneeded links. Some attributes are only present in some situations (for example, when a specific APM agent is used, or when a specific config option is true). We should avoid documenting most of these, with the idea that most customers will only care about the data because it's being reported for them, and won't care about the things that factor into the reasons why it wouldn't be reported. If it's thought that the addition would help customers who already have the data reporting understand the data better, you can include it. Write so it reads well as plain text. Details on this: Note that the docs site data dictionary has our usual docs styles available, but the query UI definitions have no styling available. This means that you should write definitions so that they are understandable without any styling, as plain text. You can often avoid any need for styling (for example, data types like Transaction are easy to understand as plain text, as are most phrasings that use attribute names or values. When plain text makes something too ambiguous and you need some styling, use back ticks to indicate attributes or values (for example, a definition like: Reported when ` category ` is ` http ` ). Using this also sets us up for success if we implement styling in the UI definitions in the future. We should avoid links because those aren't visible in the query UI; the query UI only displays plain text. However, every attribute entry in the query UI does display a 'See attribute in docs' link that links to the complete and normally formatted docs site entry. This means that we can use links provided that they will display in an easy to understand way in the query UI. For example, here's an example of an attribute that would read clearly in plain text despite not having a link. We should avoid using a link format like \"For more information, see Create an alert condition\", because it wouldn't read well in plain text, and would choose something like \"For more information, see our alert condition docs.\" Using units of measurement Attribute entries have an optional unit of measurement field in the front matter. For example, here the front matter for an attribute with a percent unit of measurement: --- name: cpuPercent type: attribute units: percentage (%) events: - ProcessSample --- Copy What unit of measurement to select for an attribute is sometimes obvious, like if the attribute value is measured in milliseconds (units: milliseconds (ms)) or seconds (units: seconds (s)) or a percentage (units: percentage (%)). We also have several units of measurement that are not obvious, like count, enum, rate, and ID. (Technically, these aren't actually \"units of measurement\" and are more just conceptual data types but we're doing it this way as a workaround so you can ignore the fact that units of measurement isn't actually accurate.) The main reason we want to specify this information is that this will control what kinds of queries or charts can be created or auto-suggested by New Relic. For example, the New Relic UI wouldn't want to auto-suggest a chart graphing the average of ID values because that wouldn't make any sense. So attributes with accurate units, such as data types, will help product provide more practical help/suggestions to customers in future. Here are some tips for the non-obvious unit types: count: This is a count of something, though not a count of time-based units. For a number to be a count, it must (a) only be capable of increasing during a given time/sampling period, and (b) have a theoretically uncapped range. This wouldn't be used for a count of time units; if it was a count of seconds, for example, you would just use 'seconds' as the unit of measurement. A couple of examples of a count: databaseCallCount threadConcurrency enum: enum is short for enumerated list. In other words, it is a specific range of numbers that represent other non-numeric elements. For example, an attribute that had HTTP error codes (404, 505, etc.) as possible values would be an enum. A range of numbers that represent color codes would be another example of an enum. (Theoretically, an enum can represent lists without numeric values but we have no need to categorize strings so we only care about numeric-value lists.) Example: httpResponsecode. rate: Use this for any rate (for example, count per second). These are typically for averaged rates over small units of time, like second or millisecond. We previously have used the unit of time for these attributes (for example, using seconds as the unit of measurement for a count per second rate), but now we want to use rate for these. This is necessary because the types of displays used for rates would be different than the types of displays used for a simpler duration/count measurement. Example: MySQL integration attribute db.innodb.dataReadBytesPerSecond, which has the definition \"Rate at which data is read from InnoDB tables in bytes per second.\" id: Use ID for any identification number attribute. Example: appId.",

By following these guidelines, you'll make it easier for readers to skim and find what they need. How to organize information Comments Separate what and why from how. Define any necessary prerequisites, policies, or background information (the what and the why) before you step through the how (step-by-step procedures). Examples: Explain what the feature is and why it matters before telling readers how to use it. Describe any limitations with user permissions or subscription levels that would prevent them from using the feature. If the feature is available for any user or subscription level, don't bother to say so. Provide a roadmap for what users will be able to accomplish, so they know before starting a procedure that they have everything they need. Front-load directions with context. Make sure readers know where they need to be, before telling them what to do. In general, use (select an app) to describe what users select from the product index. Examples: Go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select an app or service). Select (account dropdown) > User preferences. On the command line, type gitk. Also, structure steps by front-loading context from the user's point of view. For example, instead of \"Go to x to do y,\" structure the step as \"To do y, go to x.\" Separate requirements from options. Example: Type the Email you use to sign in and to receive information from New Relic. Optional: Type additional user emails, separated by commas. Follow the \"five to nine\" guideline. Depending on the topic, organize the information so there is a maximum of five to nine chunks of information. For example, readers may start to get lost or overwhelmed after about five h2 sections or seven steps into a procedure. If you have more than nine h2 sections or steps, you might need to create an additional doc or procedure. Other organization tools to consider: Levels of headings Lists Collapsers Callouts Tables Code examples For more help section Use action-oriented titles Wherever possible, give your document or h2 heading a task- or action-oriented title. Focus on what users are trying to accomplish or the problem they're trying to solve. Use present-tense verbs, rather than \"-ing\" verbs. Quality Title example Bad The query history Okay View query history Good Query history: Create and edit NRQL queries Start the document with an introductory paragraph Unless the document is less than a single screen in length, begin with a brief paragraph that introduces the topic or summarizes the important points. Not sure where to start? Try writing all the content for your document first, and then add the introduction to the top to summarize your key points. Or use the introduction to expand on the text in your metaDescription in the metadata. Keep documents short The amount of content needed can help you decide whether you need one or more documents for the topic. If all of the document's contents apply directly to the title, then everything belongs in the same document. If several related sections could be logically split into individual documents, and the overall length of your document is more than about two screenfuls, split those sections into other documents. Be sure to include links to the related contents. If a large document needs to be broken into multiple smaller documents, consider whether they might be best grouped together in their own sub-category. Use the New Relic voice We strive for a voice that's approachable, expert, and visionary. Check out our voice guidelines for how to write content with these qualities. And keep in mind these essential writing tips that apply to any type of documentation. Guidelines Comments Be clear and direct. Remember to: Use present tense. Use active voice; avoid passive voice. Tell users what to do, not what they \"should\" do. If absolutely necessary, tell users what not to do in situations where unexpected results may occur. Whenever possible, provide an alternative suggestion when telling users what not to do. Example: Using active voice with an alternative suggestion for what not to do Do not use your config file to change this setting, because this could affect other processes. Instead, go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app or service) > Settings > Application. Write to aid localization and translation. Do not use euphemisms, idioms, jargon, or slang. Use the same terms and wording consistently. If you need to include an abbreviation or acronym, spell it out the first time it appears in the document. Always take a moment to ask yourself whether people will really understand the terms you are using in the way you're using them. Change doc titles and anchors Because changes to doc titles, anchors, and redirects can break links to other docs, please create an issue to request these types of changes and we'll help you out with that. Create and edit categories Because changes to categories can affect large groups of docs at once, please create an issue to request these types of changes and we'll help you out with that.

      "body": "New Relic Infrastructure on-host integrations can use one of two types of configuration formats. This document explains the older, legacy configuration format. Important New Relic recommends using the new standard improved configuration format. To update your configuration file to this new format, check the update section For an introduction to configuration, see Config overview. Configuration file structure An on-host integration that uses the standard configuration format requires two configuration files: A definition file A configuration file Definition file The definition file has a naming format like INTEGRATION_NAME-definition.yml. This file provides descriptive information about the integration, such as: the version of the JSON protocol it supports, a list of commands it can execute, and arguments that it accepts. It lives in this directory: Linux: /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations Copy Windows: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-integrations Copy Here's an example of an NGINX integration definition file with two command sections on a Linux system: name: com.myorg.nginx protocol_version: 2 description: Collect metric and configuration data from NGINX os: linux commands: metrics: command: - myorg-nginx - --metrics interval: 15 inventory: command: - myorg-nginx - --inventory interval: 120 prefix: integration/myorg-nginx Copy A definition file can be broken down into two parts: The header The commands section Definition file header Here are explanations of a definition file's header elements: Definition header field Description name Required. A unique name name to identify the integration for logging, internal metrics, etc. When the agent loads the config file, New Relic uses the name to look up the integration in the agent's registry. protocol_version Required. The version number of the protocol. New Relic uses this to ensure compatibility between the integration and the agent. If the agent does not recognize an integration's version, it will filter out that integration and create a log message. The current version of the JSON protocol is 2. For more on protocol changes, see SDK changes. description Optional. Human-friendly explanation of what the integration does. os Optional. The operating system where the integration runs. New Relic uses this to filter integrations that you intend to run only on specific operating systems. Default: Run the integration regardless of the os value. To restrict the integration to a specific operating system, use either of these options: linux windows Definition file commands After the header is a list of commands. The commands section defines: One or more independent operating modes for the executable The runtime data required for it to be executed The commands section is a YAML map of command definitions, where each key is the unique alias name of the command in the integration's config file that specifies the executable to run. Definition commands Description command Required. The actual command line to be executed as a YAML array of command parts. These are assembled to run the actual command. For simple commands, the array might be only a single element. Additional command rules include: command arguments: The command and any command line arguments that are shared for all instances of the integration configuration. command execution: The command will be executed in the same directory as the definition file. command path: Any commands available on the host's $PATH can be used. Executables located in the same directory as the definition file, or in a subdirectory of it, can be executed using a relative path. For example: Linux: To run an executable called myorg-nginx in the same directory as the definition file, you could use myorg-nginx or ./myorg-nginx. Linux systems will execute myorg-nginx as if the user used ./myorg-nginx. Windows: To run an executable called myorg-nginx.exe in the same directory as the definition file, you could use \\myorg-nginx.exe or .\\myorg-nginx.exe. Windows systems writing myorg-nginx.exe will be executed as if indicating the current path: .\\myorg-nginx.exe. To use a command installed inside a directory on the host's $PATH, simply use the command name. Example: python. To run any other executable which is neither on the host's $PATH nor within the integration's directory, use an absolute path to the executable. Example: /opt/jdk/bin/java. If the given executable name exists within the integration's directory but also exists elsewhere on the system $PATH, the version in the integration's directory takes precedence. interval Optional. The number of seconds between two consecutive executions of the command, in particular between the end of the previous execution and the start of the next execution. Default for metric polling: 30 seconds. Minimum (floor): 15 seconds. Alerts: For metrics being used for alerts, use an interval of 30 seconds or less. prefix Optional. The categorization of the inventory in the form of category/short_integration_name. Example: integration/myorg-nginx. The prefix is not a platform-specific path. The forward slash is the correct separator between the category and short_integration_name. The prefix can have a maximum of two levels. Otherwise inventory will not be reported. Default value if not set: integration/integration_name. Configuration file The configuration file has a naming format like INTEGRATION_NAME-config.yml. This file specifies which executables to run and the parameters required to run them. It lives in this directory: Linux: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/ Copy Windows: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d Copy Tip We recommend linting the YAML configuration files before using them to avoid formatting issues. Here's an example of a config file with one instance defined. Explanations of these fields are explained below the example. integration_name: com.myorg.nginx instances: - name: nginx1.myorg.com-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://127.0.0.1/status labels: environment: production role: load_balancer Copy Another example of a config file with two instances defined. integration_name: com.myorg.nginx instances: - name: nginx1.myorg.com-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://one.url/status labels: environment: production role: load_balancer - name: nginx2.myorg.com-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://another.url/status labels: environment: production role: load_balancer Copy Config file field definitions Config file field Description integration_name Required. This is the header and is used to identify which executables to run. This name must exactly match the name specified in the integration's definition file. Recommendation: To ensure unique names, use reverse domain name notation. name Required. This is the name for the specific invocation (instance) of the integration. This is used to help identify any log messages generated by this integration and is also useful for troubleshooting. command Required. This is the command to be executed. This must exactly match one of the unique alias names specified in the integration's definition file. arguments Optional. A YAML object where: Keys: The argument name. Transformed to upper case when set as environment variable. Values: The argument values. Passed through as is. The arguments are made available to an integration as a set of environment variables. Arguments in the config file cannot be capitalised and should use underscores to separate words. labels Optional. A YAML object where: Keys: The label name. Values: The defined label value. integration_user Optional. String with the name the agent will use for executing the integration binary. Default: depends on the usermode. By default, integrations are executed with the same user that's running the integration agent, nri-agent for privileged and unprivileged mode and root user for root mode. When present, the Infrastructure agent will execute the integration binary as the specified user. For example, to run the integration binary as the root user when running the agent in a usermode different than root, just add integration_user: root to the configuration file.",

      "body": "Introduction: This section will introduce the agent and the API in general terms. Talk about when a user would want the API, and alternatives to using the API (for example, instrumentation via XML file). Mention that the API is often unnecessary if your framework has “out of the box” support. Link to the root of your API reference, whether that is on-site or off-site. Warn the user that they need to be on the most recent agent version. Instrument missing sections of your code with transactions To instrument your app, New Relic separates each path through your code into its own transaction. New Relic times (or “instruments”) the parent method in these transactions to measure your app’s overall performance, and collects transaction traces from long-running transactions for additional detail. For more information about transactions, see transaction and transaction trace. Use these methods when New Relic is not instrumenting a particular part of your code at all: If you want to... Do this... Start timing a method New Relic is not instrumenting automatically... Create a new transaction.

See [ link to reference or tutorial doc for ignoreTransaction() equivalent] Time specific methods using segments If a transaction is already visible in the New Relic UI, but you don’t have enough data about a particular method that was called during that transaction, you can create segments to time those individual methods in greater detail. For example, you might want to time a particularly critical method with complex logic. Use these methods when you want to instrument a method within an existing transaction: If you want to... Do this... Time a particular method... See [ link to reference doc or tutorial doc for createTracer() equivalent]. Enhance the metadata of a transaction Sometimes, the code you are targeting is visible in the New Relic UI, but some details of the method are not useful. For example, the default name might not be helpful (perhaps it is causing a metric grouping issue), or you want to add custom attributes to your transactions so you can filter them in Insights. Use these methods when you want to change how New Relic instruments a transaction that’s already visible in the New Relic UI: If you want to... Do this... Change the name of a transaction...

See [ link to reference doc for ignoreApdex() equivalent]. Instrument asynchronous work For supported frameworks, the agent usually detects async work and instruments it correctly. However, if your app uses another framework, or the default async instrumentation is inaccurate, you can explicitly connect async work using tokens and segments. If you want to... Do this... Trace an async method that New Relic is already instrumenting... See [ link to tutorial doc]. Trace an async method that New Relic is not instrumenting... See [ link to tutorial doc]. Instrument calls to external services Use these methods to collect data about your app’s connections to other apps or databases: If you want to... Do this...

      "body": "This is a template. Feel free to copy the formatting tips in this template to organize the docs you create on the docs site. Then replace the template information with your own text, lists, and tables as needed. Before you create sections, start your doc with a brief introduction, usually no more than a paragraph, that helps readers understand what your doc will cover. Your introduction (and the structure of your doc) should help readers understand within ten seconds whether they are in the right place. Section example Begin each section with a meaningful H2 title. The docs site uses these to generate the contents, which appears automatically in the left navigation. If you want to include a screenshot with the section, provide a permalink for the Docs team to create the image for you. Due to security requirements, the Docs team manages all images on the docs site. Code example def article_url(category, article, options={}) url_for(options.reverse_merge( :controller => 'articles';, :action => 'show', :category => category, :article => article )) end Copy List example For multi-step, actionable procedures, use ordered lists (ol in HTML or numbers in Markdown). For example: Add require('newrelic'); as the first line of your app's main module. Use the command npm install newrelic --save for each application you want to monitor. For unordered lists, use bullets (ul in HTML or * in Markdown). For example: Black White For complex lists, consider using collapsers. Table example Tables help organize detailed lists so the information is easier to skim. Tables are easier to manage in HTML. For exammple: <table> <thead> <tr> <th width={200}> **Item** </th> <th> **Requirements** </th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td> Some thing </td> <td> More detailed information about it </td> </tr> <tr> <td> Another thing </td> <td> More detailed information about another thing </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> Copy Tables created in Markdown use three or more hyphens --- to create each column’s header, and pipes | to separate each column.

      "body": "Introduction: This section will introduce the agent and the API in general terms. Talk about when a user would want the API, and alternatives to using the API (for example, instrumentation via XML file). Mention that the API is often unnecessary if your framework has “out of the box” support. Link to the root of your API reference, whether that is on-site or off-site. Warn the user that they need to be on the most recent agent version. Instrument missing sections of your code with transactions To instrument your app, New Relic separates each path through your code into its own transaction. New Relic times (or “instruments”) the parent method in these transactions to measure your app’s overall performance, and collects transaction traces from long-running transactions for additional detail. For more information about transactions, see transaction and transaction trace. Use these methods when New Relic is not instrumenting a particular part of your code at all: If you want to...

See [ link to reference or tutorial doc for ignoreTransaction() equivalent] Time specific methods using segments If a transaction is already visible in the New Relic UI, but you don’t have enough data about a particular method that was called during that transaction, you can create segments to time those individual methods in greater detail. For example, you might want to time a particularly critical method with complex logic. Use these methods when you want to instrument a method within an existing transaction: If you want to... Do this... Time a particular method... See [ link to reference doc or tutorial doc for createTracer() equivalent]. Enhance the metadata of a transaction Sometimes, the code you are targeting is visible in the New Relic UI, but some details of the method are not useful. For example, the default name might not be helpful (perhaps it is causing a metric grouping issue), or you want to add custom attributes to your transactions so you can filter them in Insights.

Then replace the template information with your own text, lists, and tables as needed. Before you create sections, start your doc with a brief introduction, usually no more than a paragraph, that helps readers understand what your doc will cover. Your introduction (and the structure of your doc) should help readers understand within ten seconds whether they are in the right place. Section example Begin each section with a meaningful H2 title. The docs site uses these to generate the contents, which appears automatically in the left navigation. If you want to include a screenshot with the section, provide a permalink for the Docs team to create the image for you. Due to security requirements, the Docs team manages all images on the docs site. Code example def article_url(category, article, options={}) url_for(options.reverse_merge( :controller => 'articles';, :action => 'show', :category => category, :article => article )) end Copy List example For multi-step, actionable procedures, use ordered lists (ol in HTML or numbers in Markdown). For example: Add require('newrelic'); as the first line of your app's main module. Use the command npm install newrelic --save for each application you want to monitor. For unordered lists, use bullets (ul in HTML or * in Markdown). For example: Black White For complex lists, consider using collapsers. Table example Tables help organize detailed lists so the information is easier to skim. Tables are easier to manage in HTML.

      "body": "We use the data dictionary to provide information about data types (for example, Transaction, Metric, Log) and attached attributes. This is exposed in the New Relic query experience, on hovering over the data types and attributes. And we also expose the dictionary to the public. This doc contains info on how to add data to the dictionary. Note that currently we don't have infrastructure integration data in the dictionary. We also have very few attributes for the Metric data type, just a few basic default ones, despite there being many potential attributes attached to that data type depending on what the data source is. Data dictionary structure The data in the data dictionary is structured like this: Data types: sometimes called \"events\" for historical reasons, these are the NRDB data objects, like Transaction, Metric, Log, Span, etc. Attributes: these are key:value pairs attached to data types. One attribute can have multiple data types listed for it. For example, appName is on multiple data types. Data source: The New Relic product from which the data originates. With the current implementation, a data type must have a single data source assigned. This isn't ideal, as theoretically a data type can come from multiple sources. Add a new data type To add a new data type: Make a new folder in this directory, alongside the other directories: /docs-website/tree/develop/src/data-dictionary/events Copy Duplicate a data type file (for example, this Metric data type), place it in the new folder, and fill it out with the new info. For how to add attributes on a new data type, keep reading. Add attributes To add attributes: Our goal is to avoid adding redundant attributes entries, so you should first check to see if there's an existing attribute that has the same name and same general definition as the one you're trying to add. If it exists, edit that file to include the new data type (under events:). If an existing attribute is fairly close in definition but not exact, try to edit the definition so it works for all associated data types. If there is no existing attribute, create a new one. The easiest way is to copy an existing attribute file, edit all relevant fields to be accurate, and place it in the folder of the data type it's attached to (for example, Transaction). When writing an attribute, try to keep it as concise as possible, and avoid using links. For more on that, see Style. If the attribute has one of the units of measurement we use (like units: percentage (%)), add that to the front matter. For info on units, see Units. Attribute style guidelines When adding or editing attributes, some things to keep in mind: Aim for concise descriptions. Notes on this: Feel free to use sentence fragments. Feel free to edit definitions submitted from internal teams as sometimes their definitions will be overly long or have unneeded links. Some attributes are only present in some situations (for example, when a specific APM agent is used, or when a specific config option is true). We should avoid documenting most of these, with the idea that most customers will only care about the data because it's being reported for them, and won't care about the things that factor into the reasons why it wouldn't be reported. If it's thought that the addition would help customers who already have the data reporting understand the data better, you can include it. Write so it reads well as plain text. Details on this: Note that the docs site data dictionary has our usual docs styles available, but the query UI definitions have no styling available. This means that you should write definitions so that they are understandable without any styling, as plain text. You can often avoid any need for styling (for example, data types like Transaction are easy to understand as plain text, as are most phrasings that use attribute names or values. When plain text makes something too ambiguous and you need some styling, use back ticks to indicate attributes or values (for example, a definition like: Reported when ` category ` is ` http ` ). Using this also sets us up for success if we implement styling in the UI definitions in the future. We should avoid links because those aren't visible in the query UI; the query UI only displays plain text. However, every attribute entry in the query UI does display a 'See attribute in docs' link that links to the complete and normally formatted docs site entry. This means that we can use links provided that they will display in an easy to understand way in the query UI. For example, here's an example of an attribute that would read clearly in plain text despite not having a link. We should avoid using a link format like \"For more information, see Create an alert condition\", because it wouldn't read well in plain text, and would choose something like \"For more information, see our alert condition docs.\" Using units of measurement Attribute entries have an optional unit of measurement field in the front matter. For example, here the front matter for an attribute with a percent unit of measurement: --- name: cpuPercent type: attribute units: percentage (%) events: - ProcessSample --- Copy What unit of measurement to select for an attribute is sometimes obvious, like if the attribute value is measured in milliseconds (units: milliseconds (ms)) or seconds (units: seconds (s)) or a percentage (units: percentage (%)). We also have several units of measurement that are not obvious, like count, enum, rate, and ID. (Technically, these aren't actually \"units of measurement\" and are more just conceptual data types but we're doing it this way as a workaround so you can ignore the fact that units of measurement isn't actually accurate.) The main reason we want to specify this information is that this will control what kinds of queries or charts can be created or auto-suggested by New Relic. For example, the New Relic UI wouldn't want to auto-suggest a chart graphing the average of ID values because that wouldn't make any sense. So attributes with accurate units, such as data types, will help product provide more practical help/suggestions to customers in future. Here are some tips for the non-obvious unit types: count: This is a count of something, though not a count of time-based units. For a number to be a count, it must (a) only be capable of increasing during a given time/sampling period, and (b) have a theoretically uncapped range. This wouldn't be used for a count of time units; if it was a count of seconds, for example, you would just use 'seconds' as the unit of measurement. A couple of examples of a count: databaseCallCount threadConcurrency enum: enum is short for enumerated list. In other words, it is a specific range of numbers that represent other non-numeric elements. For example, an attribute that had HTTP error codes (404, 505, etc.) as possible values would be an enum. A range of numbers that represent color codes would be another example of an enum. (Theoretically, an enum can represent lists without numeric values but we have no need to categorize strings so we only care about numeric-value lists.) Example: httpResponsecode. rate: Use this for any rate (for example, count per second). These are typically for averaged rates over small units of time, like second or millisecond. We previously have used the unit of time for these attributes (for example, using seconds as the unit of measurement for a count per second rate), but now we want to use rate for these. This is necessary because the types of displays used for rates would be different than the types of displays used for a simpler duration/count measurement. Example: MySQL integration attribute db.innodb.dataReadBytesPerSecond, which has the definition \"Rate at which data is read from InnoDB tables in bytes per second.\" id: Use ID for any identification number attribute. Example: appId.",

Open homepage.yml, find the spot where the new tile will be, and add a new line with the relative link for the new tile. For example, - /docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/workloads/workloads-isolate-resolve-incidents-faster Save and check that your new tile builds properly on a local build. Commit, push, PR when you're ready. Add a new section to the home page On the translations.json page, add a new section modeled in the spot where you want the new section to appear. Include at least one title. For example, here's the TDP entry, with one tile: \"tdp\": { \"title\": \"Telemetry Data Platform\", \"description\": \"Ingest, visualize, and alert on all your telemetry data in one place.\", \"t1\": { \"title\": \"Introduction to Telemetry Data Platform\", \"description\": \"How to manage all your monitoring in one place.\" }, Copy When you're done creating the info, save the file. In the homepage.yml page, find the corresponding location for the new section, and add the short name you provided in the translation.json file, title, description, and tile URLs. For example, here's the corresponding TDP section on homepage.yml. tdp: title: Telemetry Data Platform description: Ingest, visualize, and alert on all your telemetry data in one place. tiles: - /docs/data-ingest-apis/get-data-new-relic/getting-started/get-started-telemetry-data-platform Copy Save, build locally, commit, PR.",

New release note To add a release note to the docs site: Find the most recent release note for your agent, and make a copy of it in the same folder. When you rename your copy, avoid potential version naming conflicts by using a - separator in your file name. For example, instead of agent-123, use agent-1-2-3 for version 1.2.3 and agent-12-3 for version 12.3. Fill in the subject, releaseDate, and version. If applicable, include the downloadLink field. Using our standard headings for New features, Improvements, and Bug fixes, add enough summary information in these sections to make a great release note. Link to docs or other resources where they can learn more. Commit your changes and submit a pull request. If your release is date-sensitive, make a note in your PR. A Tech Docs hero will review your release note content and approve your PR to get it published. You can also request others on your team to review your PR. We build and deploy the docs site a few times a day, and sometimes builds can take a few hours to complete. If your release is time-sensitive, ensure you've planned for enough time to get your docs live. What makes a great release note? Great release notes help users quickly become familiar with your important update, so they know why it matters. Great release notes also help our support and security teams. By encouraging users to keep current with your latest release, this reduces support time to solve problems on outdated versions. It also mitigates risks if any potential vulnerabilities have been resolved with your latest version. To write a great release note, be as specific as possible. For example: Briefly describe new functionality. Give an example of the value it provides, and link to more detailed information. Don't use vague wording such as \"various bug fixes.\" Instead, clearly state what has been improved, so readers will know if an issue they’ve experienced has been resolved. New release notes category This information is primarily for the Tech Docs team's use. To add a new release notes category, update the following areas of the docs site. (You do not need to update the releaseNote.js or releaseNoteLandingPage.js files in the nav/templates folder.) Before you submit your pull request to the GitHub docs site, check that the landing pages and placeholder release note build correctly in your localhost. Category landing page In /src/content/docs/release-notes, add the following: A folder for your new release notes category. The RSS feed link, page format, and date order for release notes listed on this page are generated automatically. For example, see the C SDK category landing page format. An index.mdx file in your new folder containing the subject. The subject is the name that will appear on the Release notes landing page. A placeholder release note in this folder for the agent team to fill out. If used, the downloadLink field in the release note will be formatted automatically in the published release note. Before the new category goes live, check with the team's Product Marketing Management (PMM) rep whether they want to include the link in an upcoming What's new post. Landing page In /src/content/docs/release-notes/index.mdx, add a new tile section in alphabetical order for your release notes category. Example: <TechTile name=\"Logs\" icon=\"logo-newrelic\" to=\"/docs/release-notes/logs-release-notes\" /> Copy Logos come from @newrelic/gatsby-theme-newrelic/icons/logo/. If a logo does not already exist for the new agent, use the standard logo-newrelic icon or an image in @newrelic/gatsby-theme-newrelic/icons/feathers.js. If you need other options, talk to the team's designer. Links from other categories Add a link to your new release notes category in the agent's documentation, typically in its Get started category. For more information, see our documentation about docs in multiple menus. Optional: Add a link in the agent's landing page text by updating the index.mdx file in its taxonomy.",

Warn the user that they need to be on the most recent agent version. Instrument missing sections of your code with transactions To instrument your app, New Relic separates each path through your code into its own transaction. New Relic times (or “instruments”) the parent method in these transactions to measure your app’s overall performance, and collects transaction traces from long-running transactions for additional detail.

See [ link to reference or tutorial doc for ignoreTransaction() equivalent] Time specific methods using segments If a transaction is already visible in the New Relic UI, but you don’t have enough data about a particular method that was called during that transaction, you can create segments to time those individual methods in greater detail.

Enhance the metadata of a transaction Sometimes, the code you are targeting is visible in the New Relic UI, but some details of the method are not useful.

      "body": "We use the data dictionary to provide information about data types (for example, Transaction, Metric, Log) and attached attributes. This is exposed in the New Relic query experience, on hovering over the data types and attributes. And we also expose the dictionary to the public. This doc contains info on how to add data to the dictionary. Note that currently we don't have infrastructure integration data in the dictionary. We also have very few attributes for the Metric data type, just a few basic default ones, despite there being many potential attributes attached to that data type depending on what the data source is. Data dictionary structure The data in the data dictionary is structured like this: Data types: sometimes called \"events\" for historical reasons, these are the NRDB data objects, like Transaction, Metric, Log, Span, etc. Attributes: these are key:value pairs attached to data types. One attribute can have multiple data types listed for it. For example, appName is on multiple data types. Data source: The New Relic product from which the data originates. With the current implementation, a data type must have a single data source assigned. This isn't ideal, as theoretically a data type can come from multiple sources. Add a new data type To add a new data type: Make a new folder in this directory, alongside the other directories: /docs-website/tree/develop/src/data-dictionary/events Copy Duplicate a data type file (for example, this Metric data type), place it in the new folder, and fill it out with the new info. For how to add attributes on a new data type, keep reading. Add attributes To add attributes: Our goal is to avoid adding redundant attributes entries, so you should first check to see if there's an existing attribute that has the same name and same general definition as the one you're trying to add. If it exists, edit that file to include the new data type (under events:). If an existing attribute is fairly close in definition but not exact, try to edit the definition so it works for all associated data types. If there is no existing attribute, create a new one. The easiest way is to copy an existing attribute file, edit all relevant fields to be accurate, and place it in the folder of the data type it's attached to (for example, Transaction). When writing an attribute, try to keep it as concise as possible, and avoid using links. For more on that, see Style. If the attribute has one of the units of measurement we use (like units: percentage (%)), add that to the front matter. For info on units, see Units. Attribute style guidelines When adding or editing attributes, some things to keep in mind: Aim for concise descriptions. Notes on this: Feel free to use sentence fragments. Feel free to edit definitions submitted from internal teams as sometimes their definitions will be overly long or have unneeded links. Some attributes are only present in some situations (for example, when a specific APM agent is used, or when a specific config option is true). We should avoid documenting most of these, with the idea that most customers will only care about the data because it's being reported for them, and won't care about the things that factor into the reasons why it wouldn't be reported. If it's thought that the addition would help customers who already have the data reporting understand the data better, you can include it. Write so it reads well as plain text. Details on this: Note that the docs site data dictionary has our usual docs styles available, but the query UI definitions have no styling available. This means that you should write definitions so that they are understandable without any styling, as plain text. You can often avoid any need for styling (for example, data types like Transaction are easy to understand as plain text, as are most phrasings that use attribute names or values. When plain text makes something too ambiguous and you need some styling, use back ticks to indicate attributes or values (for example, a definition like: Reported when ` category ` is ` http ` ). Using this also sets us up for success if we implement styling in the UI definitions in the future. We should avoid links because those aren't visible in the query UI; the query UI only displays plain text. However, every attribute entry in the query UI does display a 'See attribute in docs' link that links to the complete and normally formatted docs site entry. This means that we can use links provided that they will display in an easy to understand way in the query UI. For example, here's an example of an attribute that would read clearly in plain text despite not having a link. We should avoid using a link format like \"For more information, see Create an alert condition\", because it wouldn't read well in plain text, and would choose something like \"For more information, see our alert condition docs.\" Using units of measurement Attribute entries have an optional unit of measurement field in the front matter. For example, here the front matter for an attribute with a percent unit of measurement: --- name: cpuPercent type: attribute units: percentage (%) events: - ProcessSample --- Copy What unit of measurement to select for an attribute is sometimes obvious, like if the attribute value is measured in milliseconds (units: milliseconds (ms)) or seconds (units: seconds (s)) or a percentage (units: percentage (%)). We also have several units of measurement that are not obvious, like count, enum, rate, and ID. (Technically, these aren't actually \"units of measurement\" and are more just conceptual data types but we're doing it this way as a workaround so you can ignore the fact that units of measurement isn't actually accurate.) The main reason we want to specify this information is that this will control what kinds of queries or charts can be created or auto-suggested by New Relic. For example, the New Relic UI wouldn't want to auto-suggest a chart graphing the average of ID values because that wouldn't make any sense. So attributes with accurate units, such as data types, will help product provide more practical help/suggestions to customers in future. Here are some tips for the non-obvious unit types: count: This is a count of something, though not a count of time-based units. For a number to be a count, it must (a) only be capable of increasing during a given time/sampling period, and (b) have a theoretically uncapped range. This wouldn't be used for a count of time units; if it was a count of seconds, for example, you would just use 'seconds' as the unit of measurement. A couple of examples of a count: databaseCallCount threadConcurrency enum: enum is short for enumerated list. In other words, it is a specific range of numbers that represent other non-numeric elements. For example, an attribute that had HTTP error codes (404, 505, etc.) as possible values would be an enum. A range of numbers that represent color codes would be another example of an enum. (Theoretically, an enum can represent lists without numeric values but we have no need to categorize strings so we only care about numeric-value lists.) Example: httpResponsecode. rate: Use this for any rate (for example, count per second). These are typically for averaged rates over small units of time, like second or millisecond. We previously have used the unit of time for these attributes (for example, using seconds as the unit of measurement for a count per second rate), but now we want to use rate for these. This is necessary because the types of displays used for rates would be different than the types of displays used for a simpler duration/count measurement. Example: MySQL integration attribute db.innodb.dataReadBytesPerSecond, which has the definition \"Rate at which data is read from InnoDB tables in bytes per second.\" id: Use ID for any identification number attribute. Example: appId.",

      "body": "Callouts direct your attention to information of special importance or to information that doesn't fit smoothly into the main text. Consider your reader. If your doc has too many callouts, it might confuse your reader about what matters the most and distract them from what does. Use your callouts judiciously. Recommendation: Skim the complete doc. If there are too many callouts, decide which ones can be removed. Types of callouts Here's an example of the callout format: <Callout variant=\"tip\"> Your tip text goes here. It can have multiple paragraphs. </Callout> Copy On our docs site, we use these callout classes: Caution (callout-caution) Cautions scream at you that this could cause a crash or cost you data loss beyond the task at hand. Cautions use the callout-caution class. At a traffic light, a Caution would be red. Caution Avoid disabling auto-transaction naming, because metric grouping issues will likely occur. Instead, use API calls to name your transactions. Important (callout-important) Important notes urge awareness that this could impair the task at hand or cost you time if you ignore the text. Important notes use the callout-important class. At a traffic light, an Important note would be yellow. Important Custom events sent via the agent API are not compatible with high security mode. Tip (callout-tip) Tips whisper to you that this is nice to know, like a shortcut, best practice, or reminder, but is unnecessary to complete the task at hand. Tips use the callout-tip class. At a traffic light, a Tip would be a green light. Tip If you have integrated your New Relic account with a ticketing system such as Lighthouse, Pivotal Tracker, or Atlassian JIRA, you can use the note to file a ticket or story. User-related permissions For recommended wording, see User-related language and styles. Pricing (callout-pricing) Do not use. Pricing callouts let you know that you may need a specific subscription level in order to access the product or feature. Pricing callouts use the callout-pricing class. Typically, pricing callouts appear in the intro of a doc. See the example below for standard verbiage in the callout. With the new pricing model, these are rarely used. Tip Access to this feature depends on your subscription level. Custom callouts Custom callouts are available for special cases, such as beta docs. Here's what you can control with custom callouts: Title text: Change the callout label by inserting the title attribute like this: title=\"YOUR CUSTOM TITLE\". When you publish, this field is automatically converted to all capital letters. Color: The color is limited to the color of the variant you include, or if you don't include a variant, you get the default border color (blue-grey). Here is what the code looks like: <Callout variant=\"caution\" title=\"YOUR CUSTOM TITLE\"> Your callout message goes here! </Callout> Copy For beta docs, add a custom callout. Also, we recommend that you don't include a variant so you display the default color: Beta feature This feature is still in development, but we encourage you to try it out! Avoid callout fatigue Callout fatigue is what happens when there are too many callouts on a doc. A single callout is a great way to draw attention to important information, but the more callouts there are, the more likely it is that your reader won't read the callouts. Keep these things in mind when you're working with callouts: If you add a callout, remove a callout. Wherever possible, don't increase the number of callouts. Do not use stacked callouts. Stacked callouts are two or more callouts that follow directly one after another. Not only do not use these, but if you see this in a doc, take a few minutes to break these callouts up. Remove outdated callouts. As you're going through the docs site, if you see a callout that's outdated, for whatever reason, take a few minutes to delete it from the doc. Be stingy in your use of important and warning callouts. If we use important and warning callouts too often, they lose their effectiveness. Stacked callouts example Here's an example of the stacked callouts we'd love to avoid. Tip The more callouts there are, the more difficult it is to spot the information that's important. Important Not everything is important enough to put in a callout. Caution Think carefully before adding another callout on the page.",

      "body": "We use a variety of formatting to highlight code or other technical language. You can use the <code>, <pre>, and <var> tags to indicate \"raw\" technical content such as excerpts from a config file, an API method name, or a file path. For inline code or data (<code>) To surround small blocks of code or data (single words or lines), mark as code: Source: Use <code> tags. Markdown: Surround the text with backtick ` characters. For multi-line code blocks (<pre>) To surround longer blocks of data that run multiple lines, mark as preformatted text: Source: Use <pre> tags. Markdown: Do not use Markdown-style indented code formatting, as this can cause unexpected formatting problems. Highlight user input with <var> Use the <var> tag to highlight areas of a code block where a user is expected to supply their own value. For more context on when to use <var> tags, see < var> formatting guidelines. Follow these guidelines when you use <var> tags: Address the reader directly Use all caps and underscores _ to separate words (also known as SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE). Don't use other punctuation (such as wrapping the text in angle brackets). Exception: REST API examples use a ${VARNAME} syntax inspired by Bash conventions. Standard examples: echo \"license_key: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" | sudo tee -a /etc/newrelic-infra.yml Copy msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\newrelic-infra.msi Copy https://rpm.newrelic.com/accounts/ACCOUNT_ID/applications/APP_ID Copy REST API v2 example: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/${APPID}/metrics/data.xml\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${APIKEY}\" -i \\ -d 'names[]=HttpDispatcher&values[]=average_call_time&values[]=call_count&from=2014-03-01T20:59:00+00:00&to=2014-03-01T21:59:00+00:00&summarize=true' Copy Highlight important sections with <mark> Use the <mark> tag to highlight areas of a code block that are particularly important. Most commonly, <mark> is used to highlight New Relic API methods in sample code that contains a lot of \"other logic.\" When you use <mark>, you should usually follow the code block with a list of bullets that explain what each API call is doing and link to method syntax. For more context on when to use <mark> tags, see < mark> formatting guidelines. Examples: Example of using the <mark> tag private void storeItem(long id) { Segment segment = NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction(). startSegment(\"storeItem\") ; segment. reportAsExternal(DatastoreParameters .product(\"H2\") .collection(null) .operation(\"insert\") .instance(\"localhost\", 8080) .databaseName(\"test\") .build()) ; // fire and forget DB_POOL.submit(() -> { segment.end() ; insertData(id); }); } Copy The agent API calls in this sample are: startSegment(...): Begins the segment that will time the code. For method syntax, see the Javadoc. reportAsExternal(DatastoreParameters()): Associates the time with a datastore external call This will show up in APM with datastore data. For more information, see reportAsExternal API. For method syntax, see the Javadoc. segment.end(): Stops timing this segment. For method syntax, see the Javadoc. Add syntax highlighting To add syntax highlighting to a code block, add class=\"highlight\" to the <pre> tag. The syntax highlighter tries to auto-detect the language. If it's not working as expected, ensure the language is supported and specify the language by adding the a lang-LANG-NAME class (for example: lang-html). View a full list of supported languages for syntax highlighting. Element colors and themes are fully customizable. Link to other docs You can add <a href> tags inside a <pre> blocks, just as you would any other content. However, make sure to use them judiciously since they can be easy to miss. A good example is the Infrastructure config file template, where each config element links to the relevant section of the main config doc.",

      "body": "When you're creating a new doc, there's a lot to keep track of. You can use this checklist to make sure you've done everything. Title Check that: The doc's title effectively describes the contents. Procedural doc titles use active verbs; for example, Install not Installing. Introduction Check that: The introduction leads with an outcome and provides an overview of how to get there, so customers are confident they've found the right doc. It provides a short, readable overview of the doc's contents. Headings (H2s) Check that: Heading names are concise, yet provide information that helps readers to skim or skip to the section they want. Procedural H2s use active verbs, not the ing verb form. Text Check that the text: Optimizes for easier translation: Avoid idioms, slang, specific cultural references, etc. Tells a good story: Promotes the platform (other New Relic products, alerting, etc.). Includes examples and use cases, identifies personas, explains not only what it is or how to use it but why it matters. Includes hyperlinks in UI paths. Has no typos. Procedures Procedures use active voice and focus on steps (\"do this\"). Avoid burying tips or extra details in the steps. If the procedure includes prerequisites or background information, that information appears before (not buried inside) the ordered list of procedures. If a procedure or step branches, it splits the options so they are clearly visible as bullets, collapsers, etc. If the procedure says what not to do, it also describes what to do instead. Example: What not to do and what to do instead Do not monitor your own applications from the partnership owner account. Instead, create an account within the partnership, and monitor apps from that account. Structure The original tech writer or docs site contributor is the best judge of whether the draft doc is complete. However, in your peer edit, make notes if you have unanswered questions that aren't addressed within the doc or its cross references. Doc structure Comments Complete Check that the overall doc: Is complete, but stays on topic. Includes useful cross references, hyperlinks, and other suggestions to enhance the information, especially for SEO. Skimmable Readers can see at a glance what the doc is about and what to do. It's obvious what parts they can read and what parts they can skip. Visually clean The doc avoids excessive use of callouts, long sentences, or long paragraphs. Useful images For screenshots and images, check that: Full size images always have captions to explain their relevance. UI paths in captions always have hyperlinks. Cropped images clearly show their relevance, with or without captions. In addition, make sure that screenshots and images follow the docs site's security guidelines, and that no private information related to customers or New Relic is displayed. Levels of detail The doc uses H2s, H3s, bullets, tables, and clamshells to organize complex levels of information.",

      "body": "Landing pages are a specialized type of page that serve as the starting pages for various New Relic products. For example, you'll see landing pages for Application monitoring (APM) and Browser monitoring. Important This landing page information does not apply to the docs home page. If you need to create a new landing page, you can either copy an existing landing page, or you can modify the sample landing page shown at the bottom. The next sections look at what you need to include for each landing page. Front matter When you insert the front matter, be sure to designate the type as landingPage. Here's an example: --- title: APM type: landingPage --- Copy Tip In the front matter, the following are optional: tags, translate, and redirects. So, you can leave them out if they don't have any values. Introduction section Following the front matter, the first content section is a two-column introduction (also called the hero section). This includes the following: A <LandingPageHero> component wrapping all the introductory content. A <HeroContent> component wrapping the text portion of the introduction (the content in the left column). An image or video (appears in the right column). A caption (optional), which is wrapped by the <figcaption> component. Here's an example of the hero section that shows you where to insert your content: <LandingPageHero> <HeroContent> INSERT_PARAGRAPHS_FOR_YOUR_INTRODUCTION </HeroContent> ![INSERT_ALT-TEXT_HERE](./images/INSERT_IMAGE_FILE_NAME.png \"INSERT_THE_IMAGE_TITLE_HERE\") <figcaption> INSERT_OPTIONAL_CAPTION_USING_SAME_INDENTATION_AS_IMAGE </figcaption> </LandingPageHero> Copy Tiles Tiles are a series of boxes after the introduction. They contain the main subject areas for your product. You should just list these in order you want them to appear, and the cascading style sheet will render them across the page. Here's an example of a tile: <LandingPageTileGrid> <LandingPageTile title=\"INSERT_YOUR_BOX_TITLE_HERE.\" href=\"/docs/INSERT_THE_DIRECTORY_PATH_TO_THE_TARGET_LANDING_PAGE_INDEX.HTML\" icon=\"fe-INSERT_THE_ICON_NAME\" > INSERT_TILE_CONTENT_HERE... </LandingPageTile> ... Copy For each tile, do the following: Insert a value for title that explains the purpose of the category. Insert a value for href that links to the target landing page. If the target landing page is index.html, you can just include the directory path with no filename since index.html is the default (it doesn't cause any problems if you include index.html). Insert a value for icon by prefixing the icon name with fe- (Feather icons), logo- (third-party logos), or nr- (New Relic logos). For example, here is the format for a feather icon: fe-alert-triangle). Tip For more details about icons, see Embed images. Between the LandingPageTile tags, insert text, such as a bullet list with links to product documentation. Button for viewing all docs in the category After your tiles, you should have a single button that offers to take users to all the documentation for that category. The table of contents page that gets linked here is always at the same path as the landing page, but with /table-of-contents appended to it. These table of contents pages get built automatically for every landing page. For example, if this landing page was located at /docs/apm, this link should be /docs/apm/table-of-contents. Here's an example: <ButtonLink role=\"button\" to=\"INSERT_LINK_TO_DIRECTORY_WITH_ALL_THESE_DOCS/table-of-contents\" variant=\"normal\" > View all INSERT_YOUR_CATEGORY_HERE docs </ButtonLink> Copy Code sample Here's a sample landing page you could modify to suit your needs: --- title: INSERT_YOUR_TITLE_HERE type: landingPage --- <LandingPageHero> <HeroContent> INSERT_PARAGRAPHS_FOR_YOUR_INTRODUCTION </HeroContent> ![INSERT_ALT-TEXT_HERE](./images/INSERT_IMAGE_FILE_NAME.png \"INSERT_THE_IMAGE_TITLE_HERE\") <figcaption> INSERT_OPTIONAL_CAPTION_USING_SAME_INDENTATION_AS_IMAGE </figcaption> </LandingPageHero> <LandingPageTileGrid> <LandingPageTile title=\"INSERT_YOUR_BOX_TITLE_HERE\" icon=\"fe-INSERT_ICON_NAME_HERE\" > * [INSERT_LINK_NAME](INSERT_LINK_URL) Aliquam auctor mattis nisl ut iaculis. * [INSERT_LINK_NAME](INSERT_LINK_URL) Suspendisse pharetra elit sit amet risus euismod, a consectetur tortor vulputate. </LandingPageTile> <LandingPageTile title=\"INSERT_YOUR_BOX_TITLE_HERE\" icon=\"fe-INSERT_ICON_NAME_HERE\" > * Use [INSERT_LINK_NAME](INSERT_LINK_URL) to lectus diam, ornare vitae dui suscipit, laoreet ultrices lacus. * Mauris tempor massa ac augue mattis, nec pharetra quam mollis [INSERT_LINK_NAME](INSERT_LINK_URL). </LandingPageTile> <LandingPageTile title=\"INSERT_YOUR_BOX_TITLE_HERE\" icon=\"fe-INSERT_ICON_NAME_HERE\" > * Use [INSERT_LINK_NAME](INSERT_LINK_URL) rhoncus tortor vitae libero laoreet feugiat. * Donec dui elit, fermentum vel faucibus sed, rhoncus in felis [INSERT_LINK_NAME](INSERT_LINK_URL). </LandingPageTile> <LandingPageTile title=\"INSERT_YOUR_BOX_TITLE_HERE\" icon=\"fe-INSERT_ICON_NAME_HERE\" > * Use [INSERT_LINK_NAME](INSERT_LINK_URL) uspendisse pharetra elit sit amet risus euismod. * Pellentesque finibus magna vitae hendrerit gravida [INSERT_LINK_NAME](INSERT_LINK_URL). </LandingPageTile> <LandingPageTile title=\"INSERT_YOUR_BOX_TITLE_HERE\" icon=\"fe-INSERT_ICON_NAME_HERE\" > * Use [INSERT_LINK_NAME](INSERT_LINK_URL) Etiam imperdiet felis eu ipsum consequat tristique. * Etiam imperdiet felis eu ipsum consequat tristique [INSERT_LINK_NAME](INSERT_LINK_URL). </LandingPageTile> <LandingPageTile title=\"INSERT_YOUR_BOX_TITLE_HERE\" icon=\"fe-INSERT_ICON_NAME_HERE\" > * Use [INSERT_LINK_NAME](INSERT_LINK_URL) Quisque hendrerit, dolor sed sodales aliquet. * Vestibulum varius lectus ac velit euismod [INSERT_LINK_NAME](INSERT_LINK_URL). </LandingPageTile> </LandingPageTileGrid> <ButtonLink role=\"button\" to=\"INSERT_LINK_TO_DIRECTORY_WITH_ALL_THESE_DOCS/table-of-contents\" variant=\"normal\" > View all INSERT_YOUR_CATEGORY_HERE docs </ButtonLink> Copy",

      "body": "This page is for release notes for downloadable software. For product announcements, see What's new style guidelines. New release note To add a release note to the docs site: Find the most recent release note for your agent, and make a copy of it in the same folder. When you rename your copy, avoid potential version naming conflicts by using a - separator in your file name. For example, instead of agent-123, use agent-1-2-3 for version 1.2.3 and agent-12-3 for version 12.3. Fill in the subject, releaseDate, and version. If applicable, include the downloadLink field. Using our standard headings for New features, Improvements, and Bug fixes, add enough summary information in these sections to make a great release note. Link to docs or other resources where they can learn more. Commit your changes and submit a pull request. If your release is date-sensitive, make a note in your PR. A Tech Docs hero will review your release note content and approve your PR to get it published. You can also request others on your team to review your PR. We build and deploy the docs site a few times a day, and sometimes builds can take a few hours to complete. If your release is time-sensitive, ensure you've planned for enough time to get your docs live. What makes a great release note? Great release notes help users quickly become familiar with your important update, so they know why it matters. Great release notes also help our support and security teams. By encouraging users to keep current with your latest release, this reduces support time to solve problems on outdated versions. It also mitigates risks if any potential vulnerabilities have been resolved with your latest version. To write a great release note, be as specific as possible. For example: Briefly describe new functionality. Give an example of the value it provides, and link to more detailed information. Don't use vague wording such as \"various bug fixes.\" Instead, clearly state what has been improved, so readers will know if an issue they’ve experienced has been resolved. New release notes category This information is primarily for the Tech Docs team's use. To add a new release notes category, update the following areas of the docs site. (You do not need to update the releaseNote.js or releaseNoteLandingPage.js files in the nav/templates folder.) Before you submit your pull request to the GitHub docs site, check that the landing pages and placeholder release note build correctly in your localhost. Category landing page In /src/content/docs/release-notes, add the following: A folder for your new release notes category. The RSS feed link, page format, and date order for release notes listed on this page are generated automatically. For example, see the C SDK category landing page format. An index.mdx file in your new folder containing the subject. The subject is the name that will appear on the Release notes landing page. A placeholder release note in this folder for the agent team to fill out. If used, the downloadLink field in the release note will be formatted automatically in the published release note. Before the new category goes live, check with the team's Product Marketing Management (PMM) rep whether they want to include the link in an upcoming What's new post. Landing page In /src/content/docs/release-notes/index.mdx, add a new tile section in alphabetical order for your release notes category. Example: <TechTile name=\"Logs\" icon=\"logo-newrelic\" to=\"/docs/release-notes/logs-release-notes\" /> Copy Logos come from @newrelic/gatsby-theme-newrelic/icons/logo/. If a logo does not already exist for the new agent, use the standard logo-newrelic icon or an image in @newrelic/gatsby-theme-newrelic/icons/feathers.js. If you need other options, talk to the team's designer. Links from other categories Add a link to your new release notes category in the agent's documentation, typically in its Get started category. For more information, see our documentation about docs in multiple menus. Optional: Add a link in the agent's landing page text by updating the index.mdx file in its taxonomy.",

Title Check that: The doc's title effectively describes the contents. Procedural doc titles use active verbs; for example, Install not Installing. Introduction Check that: The introduction leads with an outcome and provides an overview of how to get there, so customers are confident they've found the right doc. It provides a short, readable overview of the doc's contents. Headings (H2s) Check that: Heading names are concise, yet provide information that helps readers to skim or skip to the section they want. Procedural H2s use active verbs, not the ing verb form. Text Check that the text: Optimizes for easier translation: Avoid idioms, slang, specific cultural references, etc. Tells a good story: Promotes the platform (other New Relic products, alerting, etc.). Includes examples and use cases, identifies personas, explains not only what it is or how to use it but why it matters. Includes hyperlinks in UI paths. Has no typos. Procedures Procedures use active voice and focus on steps (\"do this\"). Avoid burying tips or extra details in the steps. If the procedure includes prerequisites or background information, that information appears before (not buried inside) the ordered list of procedures. If a procedure or step branches, it splits the options so they are clearly visible as bullets, collapsers, etc. If the procedure says what not to do, it also describes what to do instead. Example: What not to do and what to do instead Do not monitor your own applications from the partnership owner account. Instead, create an account within the partnership, and monitor apps from that account. Structure The original tech writer or docs site contributor is the best judge of whether the draft doc is complete. However, in your peer edit, make notes if you have unanswered questions that aren't addressed within the doc or its cross references. Doc structure Comments Complete Check that the overall doc: Is complete, but stays on topic. Includes useful cross references, hyperlinks, and other suggestions to enhance the information, especially for SEO. Skimmable Readers can see at a glance what the doc is about and what to do. It's obvious what parts they can read and what parts they can skip. Visually clean The doc avoids excessive use of callouts, long sentences, or long paragraphs. Useful images For screenshots and images, check that: Full size images always have captions to explain their relevance. UI paths in captions always have hyperlinks. Cropped images clearly show their relevance, with or without captions. In addition, make sure that screenshots and images follow the docs site's security guidelines, and that no private information related to customers or New Relic is displayed.

      "body": "We welcome your contributions, whether you are a New Relic employee or a New Relic user! And we don't want you to worry about style. When you edit a file, tech writers on our team review it for style, grammar, and formatting. That said, if you're curious about our style guidelines, you're welcome (but not obligated) to take a look. Tip If your draft needs to be released on a specific date or within a specific timeframe (for example, right before a release), contact the Tech Docs @hero in the #documentation Slack channel. If you're not a New Relic employee, please create a GitHub issue. Edit a doc If you see a minor problem in our documentation that you want to quickly fix, you can use GitHub to edit the file and submit your pull request. A member of the Tech Docs team will review your edit and publish your changes. We'll follow up with you if we have any questions. Important You need a GitHub account to edit docs. If you don’t have one, you can create it here. To edit existing content without building the site locally: Find a doc you'd like to edit. Click Edit file on the top corner of the right nav. In the GitHub file, click on the pencil icon within the code block on the top right corner to access the markdown editor. Make your changes. Write a meaningful commit message and description, then commit your change by creating a new branch. Follow the prompts to submit your pull request. Please fill in as many details as possible in the provided template. And you're done! A member of the Tech Docs team will let you know when we've published your changes. For bigger projects If you'd like to create an entirely new page of documentation, or move existing content, file a Documentation Request, or contact us in the#documentation channel. The Documentation Team will review your request and follow up with you. If a new page is approved you may be asked to help write the page content. Follow the instructions above to submit a PR for your change. Create new docs You can use article templates or clone an existing doc as a template. To create a new doc: Clone the repo on your computer. In /src/content/docs/, find a good location for your doc. Using your text editor, create a new .mdx file or copy an existing doc. Write your content. Commit your changes and create a pull request. The Tech Docs team has two heroes watching for new pull requests. We'll help you get the content finalized and make sure that it's in the right place. Clone (copy) an existing doc Once you've cloned the docs-website repository, use your text editor to copy an existing doc. Rename and edit the copy and then save it as a new doc. If you want your cloned doc to be translated, follow standard procedures to request translation. Your cloned doc automatically inherits the original doc's frontmatter content. Make sure to change that, too. Delete pages If you are comfortable with deleting the page yourself, go for it. If not, ask us by: File an issue in the docs-website repo, or contact the @hero in the #documentation channel if you're a New Relic employee. The Documentation Team will review the request to delete an existing documentation page. If the deletion is approved, the Docs team will delete the page. Add or update license documentation To add or update New Relic license information, follow standard procedures to add or update documentation in the appropriate Licenses category on the docs site. Private edits If you have access to a private version of this repository, you can contribute and review content without sharing it publicly. Note that, with all of these steps, if you have SSH Keys set up, you will want to use the SSH URL (not the HTTPS URL). Request a future publication date (for New Relic employees) For docs work related to unreleased features, please use our beta repo (Internal New Relic link) If you create a new doc and submit a pull request in the private Docs repo and then contact the Tech Docs @hero in the #documentation Slack channel. The Tech Docs hero will follow up with you to get any additional details needed so that we can get this content published at the right time.",

      "body": "Callouts direct your attention to information of special importance or to information that doesn't fit smoothly into the main text. Consider your reader. If your doc has too many callouts, it might confuse your reader about what matters the most and distract them from what does. Use your callouts judiciously. Recommendation: Skim the complete doc. If there are too many callouts, decide which ones can be removed. Types of callouts Here's an example of the callout format: <Callout variant=\"tip\"> Your tip text goes here. It can have multiple paragraphs. </Callout> Copy On our docs site, we use these callout classes: Caution (callout-caution) Cautions scream at you that this could cause a crash or cost you data loss beyond the task at hand. Cautions use the callout-caution class. At a traffic light, a Caution would be red. Caution Avoid disabling auto-transaction naming, because metric grouping issues will likely occur. Instead, use API calls to name your transactions. Important (callout-important) Important notes urge awareness that this could impair the task at hand or cost you time if you ignore the text. Important notes use the callout-important class. At a traffic light, an Important note would be yellow. Important Custom events sent via the agent API are not compatible with high security mode. Tip (callout-tip) Tips whisper to you that this is nice to know, like a shortcut, best practice, or reminder, but is unnecessary to complete the task at hand. Tips use the callout-tip class. At a traffic light, a Tip would be a green light. Tip If you have integrated your New Relic account with a ticketing system such as Lighthouse, Pivotal Tracker, or Atlassian JIRA, you can use the note to file a ticket or story. User-related permissions For recommended wording, see User-related language and styles. Pricing (callout-pricing) Do not use. Pricing callouts let you know that you may need a specific subscription level in order to access the product or feature. Pricing callouts use the callout-pricing class. Typically, pricing callouts appear in the intro of a doc. See the example below for standard verbiage in the callout. With the new pricing model, these are rarely used. Tip Access to this feature depends on your subscription level. Custom callouts Custom callouts are available for special cases, such as beta docs. Here's what you can control with custom callouts: Title text: Change the callout label by inserting the title attribute like this: title=\"YOUR CUSTOM TITLE\". When you publish, this field is automatically converted to all capital letters. Color: The color is limited to the color of the variant you include, or if you don't include a variant, you get the default border color (blue-grey). Here is what the code looks like: <Callout variant=\"caution\" title=\"YOUR CUSTOM TITLE\"> Your callout message goes here! </Callout> Copy For beta docs, add a custom callout. Also, we recommend that you don't include a variant so you display the default color: Beta feature This feature is still in development, but we encourage you to try it out! Avoid callout fatigue Callout fatigue is what happens when there are too many callouts on a doc. A single callout is a great way to draw attention to important information, but the more callouts there are, the more likely it is that your reader won't read the callouts. Keep these things in mind when you're working with callouts: If you add a callout, remove a callout. Wherever possible, don't increase the number of callouts. Do not use stacked callouts. Stacked callouts are two or more callouts that follow directly one after another. Not only do not use these, but if you see this in a doc, take a few minutes to break these callouts up. Remove outdated callouts. As you're going through the docs site, if you see a callout that's outdated, for whatever reason, take a few minutes to delete it from the doc. Be stingy in your use of important and warning callouts. If we use important and warning callouts too often, they lose their effectiveness. Stacked callouts example Here's an example of the stacked callouts we'd love to avoid. Tip The more callouts there are, the more difficult it is to spot the information that's important. Important Not everything is important enough to put in a callout. Caution Think carefully before adding another callout on the page.",

      "body": "We use a variety of formatting to highlight code or other technical language. You can use the <code>, <pre>, and <var> tags to indicate \"raw\" technical content such as excerpts from a config file, an API method name, or a file path. For inline code or data (<code>) To surround small blocks of code or data (single words or lines), mark as code: Source: Use <code> tags. Markdown: Surround the text with backtick ` characters. For multi-line code blocks (<pre>) To surround longer blocks of data that run multiple lines, mark as preformatted text: Source: Use <pre> tags. Markdown: Do not use Markdown-style indented code formatting, as this can cause unexpected formatting problems. Highlight user input with <var> Use the <var> tag to highlight areas of a code block where a user is expected to supply their own value. For more context on when to use <var> tags, see < var> formatting guidelines. Follow these guidelines when you use <var> tags: Address the reader directly Use all caps and underscores _ to separate words (also known as SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE). Don't use other punctuation (such as wrapping the text in angle brackets). Exception: REST API examples use a ${VARNAME} syntax inspired by Bash conventions. Standard examples: echo \"license_key: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" | sudo tee -a /etc/newrelic-infra.yml Copy msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\newrelic-infra.msi Copy https://rpm.newrelic.com/accounts/ACCOUNT_ID/applications/APP_ID Copy REST API v2 example: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/${APPID}/metrics/data.xml\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${APIKEY}\" -i \\ -d 'names[]=HttpDispatcher&values[]=average_call_time&values[]=call_count&from=2014-03-01T20:59:00+00:00&to=2014-03-01T21:59:00+00:00&summarize=true' Copy Highlight important sections with <mark> Use the <mark> tag to highlight areas of a code block that are particularly important. Most commonly, <mark> is used to highlight New Relic API methods in sample code that contains a lot of \"other logic.\" When you use <mark>, you should usually follow the code block with a list of bullets that explain what each API call is doing and link to method syntax. For more context on when to use <mark> tags, see < mark> formatting guidelines. Examples: Example of using the <mark> tag private void storeItem(long id) { Segment segment = NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction(). startSegment(\"storeItem\") ; segment. reportAsExternal(DatastoreParameters .product(\"H2\") .collection(null) .operation(\"insert\") .instance(\"localhost\", 8080) .databaseName(\"test\") .build()) ; // fire and forget DB_POOL.submit(() -> { segment.end() ; insertData(id); }); } Copy The agent API calls in this sample are: startSegment(...): Begins the segment that will time the code. For method syntax, see the Javadoc. reportAsExternal(DatastoreParameters()): Associates the time with a datastore external call This will show up in APM with datastore data. For more information, see reportAsExternal API. For method syntax, see the Javadoc. segment.end(): Stops timing this segment. For method syntax, see the Javadoc. Add syntax highlighting To add syntax highlighting to a code block, add class=\"highlight\" to the <pre> tag. The syntax highlighter tries to auto-detect the language. If it's not working as expected, ensure the language is supported and specify the language by adding the a lang-LANG-NAME class (for example: lang-html). View a full list of supported languages for syntax highlighting. Element colors and themes are fully customizable. Link to other docs You can add <a href> tags inside a <pre> blocks, just as you would any other content. However, make sure to use them judiciously since they can be easy to miss. A good example is the Infrastructure config file template, where each config element links to the relevant section of the main config doc.",

Use sentence case in headings Use sentence case for headings. This includes category headings and document titles. With sentence case, capitalize only the first letter of: The first word Proper nouns Acronyms and abbreviations We have some exceptions: If the heading is a code term, such as a variable or function, then capitalize it exactly as it's used in the code; for example: noticeError. If the heading includes a colon, follow the Microsoft Style Guide for titles and headings, and capitalize the first word that appears after the colon; for example: APM Error profiles: Troubleshoot trends. Important Use sentence case for graphical illustrations such as diagrams and figures. Explore our Screenshots and images document for more information on our image guidelines. Products and features Item Example We use title case for products. Full Stack Observability We don't capitalize features (including features that used to be products). Use transaction traces to... not Use Transaction Traces to... Our infrastructure monitoring... not Our Infrastructure monitoring... UI elements and UI page paths Item Example We use sentence case and bold for UI elements, even if the UI element is in a different case in the UI. \"From the Transactions page, select Transaction traces and...\" We use sentence case and bold for each element in a path that references UI pages.

      "body": "We use this dictionary to ensure consistency across our docs site. Other than the terms listed here, we generally follow the Microsoft Style Guide, but we'll use Chicago Manual of Style in a pinch. We also follow American English conventions, rather than British English ones. For a glossary of terminology specific to New Relic, see the public glossary on the docs site. account ID A unique number that identifies a particular New Relic account. Don't use account number. agent Don't capitalize. Install the Ruby agent, not Install the Ruby Agent. Don't refer to a Synthetics private minion as an agent. am and pm Use the 12-hour clock followed by the (lowercased) time period am or pm. Don’t put a space after the last number in a timestamp (12:00am, not 12:00 am). Don't include a leading 0 when the hour is less than 10. 9:30am, 12:30pm, 8:30pm Copy Amazon Web Services (AWS) product names Refer to the specific product, not just AWS broadly. As a courtesy to your readers, on first mention always refer to Amazon products by their full names; for example Amazon Web Services (AWS). You can use the acronym after that, if there is one. Example: Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud. After that, use the short name according to the AWS Documentation site. Example: Amazon EC2. app name vs. app alias The \"machine name\" that the collector uses to uniquely identify an app is its app name. The server-side configuration setting that changes the visible \"name\" of an app without changing its unique identifier is its app alias. beta Use the beta callout. In the body text, use lowercase. For example: BETA FEATURE This feature is currently in beta. If the developer team prefers to use a term other than beta or private beta, clarify what is driving that use of the term (Legal requirement?), and add any relevant info here in the usage dictionary. bits and bytes Use standard prefixes and capitalization for International System of Units (SI), International Organization for Standardization (ISO), or Joint Electron Device Engineering Council (JEDEC memory) values when referring to multiples of bits (b) and bytes (B). 1 byte = 8 bits. Decimal value SI prefix Binary value ISO prefix JEDEC prefix 1000 k: kilo 1024 Ki: kibi K: kilo 1000^2 M: mega 1024^2 Mi: mebi M: mega 1000^3 G: giga 1024^3 Gi: gibi G: giga 1000^4 T: tera 1024^4 Ti: tebi - -- 1000^5 P: peta 1024^5 Pi: pebi - -- Tip For help with converting byte values (such as bytes to kilobytes), try this byte converter. blacklist and whitelist Don't use. Instead, use deny list and allow list; for example, \"Add a hostname to your deny list.\" capitalization This is more complex than can be covered in this usage dictionary. For detailed information, see: Heading capitalization Capitalization of features and UI elements Child account A parent account contains one or more child accounts. Child accounts were previously referred to as \"sub-accounts\". click In general, use click rather than the vaguer select. For example, you might click something in the UI, but then select something from a list. Be particularly careful to use click to describe actions that only make sense with a mouse; for example, with a right click or a click and drag. Also use click when the user must click on a non-selectable object (to save your changes, click anywhere outside the dialog box). See also [mouse over] #mouse-over). collector vs. connect to New Relic When referring to an agent talking to the New Relic servers, describe this as the New Relic collector. Although internally the collector refers only to specific parts of our architecture, we use it more broadly in our documentation to mean \"any endpoint a customer must connect to report data, for any product.\" Avoid \"connect to New Relic,\" and do not use \"connect to the New Relic UI.\" contractions When it makes sense for clarity, conciseness, and tone and voice, use contractions. Use them where they make the writing sound more like natural speech, and where they improve clarity and accessibility without sacrificing expertise and authority. There are no hard and fast rules for which contractions are or aren't acceptable, but simple and common is preferable to complicated and rare. For example, it's for it is is fine, but less common constructions like mustn't or wouldn't've are best avoided. Also: When using a negative contraction (don't, can't, won't) try to provide some additional info about what what to do and what can be done. (See the style guide intro for more on this.) There are places in our docs—for example, in notes and warnings—where spelling out do not, cannot, or will not is preferable to contractions to emphasize the action or blockage to be avoided. customer vs. user When possible, use the second person you to form a sense of connection with the reader. For times when you need a descriptive third-person noun, keep the following guidelines in mind: customer and user are both appropriate depending on context. customer makes more sense when talking about billing, or about a group of people or a business entity. For example, one customer may have one or more individual users who interact with New Relic through the customer's account(s). user makes more sense as a general term for an individual user, or when talking about users as an object in the account model. For example, when discussing account models, it's important to be specific about what constitutes a single person identity in our system. dashboard Don't use. Instead, use page. doc, document, documentation, docs site If you need to refer to the docs themselves—don't. Generally it's better to directly link to the doc you're referencing and use the doc title as your link text. For example, See [Install the .NET agent](URL) rather than See our [.NET agent install docs](URL). If there's not a good alternative, doc generally sounds more natural than document or documentation. If you're tempted to use a longer form, try reading it aloud to see which reads best. If you must refer to the site as a whole, call it the docs site rather than Docs site or documentation site. Internally, you can also refer to the whole URL docs.newrelic.com to avoid ambiguity with other sources of docs like internal platform docs or API explorer docs. To refer to our docs GitHub repo, use the repo name docs-website or the repo path newrelic/docs-website. dropdown Use dropdown instead of drop-down or drop down. Although it isn't common usage, you can use dropdown independently as a noun, without needing to say dropdown menu or dropdown list. For example, select a date from the <b>date</b> dropdown. e.g. and i.e. Don't use Latin abbreviations. Instead of e.g., use for example or such as. Instead of i.e. or its English equivalent in other words, rewrite so your description is clear. em dash (—) Em dashes are rarely needed in tech docs, sadly. You can usually accomplish what you need to by breaking the thought into multiple sentences or using parentheses. In some rare cases, though, an em dash can add drama and spice. If you think you've found such a case, make sure you use them right. An em dash should always use the real em dash character (not a hyphen), and no space before and after. For example: You can sign up for New Relic fast and free—we won't even ask for a credit card number. Copy You can insert an em dash with the COMMAND+OPTION+- shortcut or use the HTML entity. etc. Unlike the Latin abbreviations e.g. or i.e.), you're welcome to use etc. Please ensure that you have several meaningful examples, though, before using. For example, cities including Portland, Seattle, Dublin, etc. but not cities including Portland, etc.. hostname This is one word. Don't hyphenate. icons When using an inline icon from the UI, always describe it first, then embed the icon image, and then end with the word icon. For example, select the delete icon. Don't put icons in bold. When writing about icons, describe the icon for its purpose or action, not what the icon looks like. For example: Yes: Select the edit icon. No: Select the pencil icon. For technical information on embedding images, see Inserting inline images and Embedding Font Awesome icons. index A list of entities, such as the APM applications index, the Synthetics Monitors index, or the Alerts Incidents index. See also page. infrastructure Don't use, unless referring to the New Relic Infrastructure product. Instead, use an appropriate substitute such as architecture, environment, system, host, etc. introduction Always use Introduction to for overview docs for a particular product. For example, Introduction to New Relic Infrastructure or Introduction to the PHP agent or Introduction to transaction traces. Don't use welcome to, basics, intro, overview, etc. Also avoid the Thing: Tagline format, as in X-Ray sessions: Traces and thread profiles for key transactions, unless having a title with keywords will help with SEO. macOS The proper name for Apple's desktop operating system is macOS. Don't use the older product names Mac OS X or OS X. master account We previously used \"master account\" and \"sub-account\" but now we use parent account and child account. menu The list of pages and indexes on the top and left sides of the New Relic user interface. mouse over For mouse movements that involve placing the mouse pointer over an area, but not clicking it. For example, the APM Overview page includes functions that are only visible when the mouse pointer is over a particular chart. Do not use point to or hover over. See also click. .NET Always refer to the agent and language as .NET, never as .Net or .net or dotnet. New Relic One New Relic One isn't a product. It's a way to view New Relic data more easily, all in one place, and from multiple related accounts. This has several implications for how we should refer to it: Avoid phrasing that makes New Relic One sound like a separate product or a separate platform. There is a single New Relic platform through which our users interact with our products. Avoid mentioning New Relic One where it can be avoided. For example, instead of saying \"Use New Relic One workloads to...\", you could instead say, \"In New Relic, you can use workloads to...\" and then in the doc explain where to find the feature. Another example: instead of referring to \"The programmable New Relic One platform,\" we might say, \"The New Relic platform is programmable: To start building, go to one.newrelic.com and...\" Do not use NR1 or nr1 as an abbreviation of New Relic One. The only reason to use nr1 is when referring to the nr1 package or library (for example: a reference to the command nr1 nerdpack:serve). In general, we want to avoid overloading our docs with \"New Relic\". For more details, see the New Relic One messaging guidelines, the docs glossary entry, or the New Relic One docs. Node.js Always refer to the programming language as Node.js, not Node. NR ONLY Use NR ONLY for internal consumption only (such as this style guide). Don't use NR-ONLY or NRONLY or New Relic Only. Oxford comma See serial comma. open source Use lower case for open source. Some legal contracts may require upper case. page A specific place in the New Relic UI, located at a particular URL. Compare and contrast index, menu, and UI. Don't use dashboard, menu, tab, screen, or similar terms. parent account New Relic organizations can have a parent/child account structure. This is more important for our original user model but still plays a role for some behind-the-scenes features on our New Relic One user model. Learn more about account structure. Parent accounts were previously referred to as master accounts, and there are still some uses of this in the codebase. permissions See User-related language. For pricing tier/edition language, see Pricing language. pricing See Pricing language. real user monitoring (RUM) Don't use this outside of browser monitoring docs. Often abbreviated as RUM, this is a generic industry term for browser monitoring. New Relic refers to this as page load timing or browser monitoring. Use this term only for SEO or clarification, not to refer to the actual feature. record vs. report vs. collect Use report when discussing data sent to New Relic, such as, \"your host reports data to New Relic.\" Avoid using report as a noun. Instead use \"the reported metrics\" or \"the collected data.\" If \"report\" sounds too clunky, you can also use collect as long as whatever New Relic is collecting doesn't sound security sensitive. RPM Don't refer to the New Relic UI as RPM. Always refer to the specific product, such as the APM UI or the Browser UI. However, you may use rpm when required in the visible URL string in UI paths. serial comma Also referred to as an Oxford comma. Always use serial commas with inline lists. For example, Portland, Seattle, and Dublin rather than Portland, Seattle and Dublin. time zone Include a space (time zone). Don't hyphenate or run together as timezone. UI The graphical component of a New Relic product, encompassing all its pages, menus, and indexes. See also UI paths. UI paths If you need to tell a user how to path through the UI, see our style guide page on UI paths. update vs. upgrade Use update when users need to change the version of whatever they're using. No money or payment is needed for an update. Use upgrade whenever money or payment may be involved, such as upgrading to the Pro version of a product. The new pricing model makes it unlikely that you'll need to use this. users For styles and formats related to user roles and groups and more, see User-related style. username, not user name One word (username), not two. This is the most common usage and is recommended by Microsoft and Google style guides. version number references When referring to multiple version numbers, always use or higher. Don't use and higher, or the words greater or later. Also don't use punctuation, as in version 1.2+. For example: Foo requires Ruby agent version 1.2.3 or higher. Copy In addition: Tell users to use the latest version and not an up-to-date or current version. To abbreviate the word version, use a lowercase v with no space before the number; for example, v2 or v1.2.3. Use update not upgrade when talking about agent versions, as in \"To update to the latest version...\" For security reasons, do not use version numbers with licensing docs. The Tech Docs team doesn't have a set standard when referring to previous versions. Recommendation: Consider using version x.x or lower when identifying a specific version. Consider using In earlier agent versions when referring to versions more vaguely. we Say “we” and “our” when it works with the flow of your writing. Avoid overloading paragraphs with “New Relic” mentions, or reword so the focus is on the user, not New Relic. For example, avoid writing something like this: New Relic recommends setting a startup timeout. Copy Instead, write something like this: Recommendation: To help with troubleshooting, include a startup timeout in your configuration. Copy OR We recommend setting a startup timeout. Copy you We use “you” and “your” liberally in our docs. Addressing the reader directly makes for simpler, cleaner sentences. It also tends to expose lazy uses of passive construction and it helps users to understand procedures.",
