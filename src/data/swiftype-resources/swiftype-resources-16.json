      "body": "This list is current. Networks, IPs, domains, ports, and endpoints last updated September 28, 2021. This is a list of the networks, IP addresses, domains, ports, and endpoints used by API clients or agents to communicate with New Relic. TLS is required for all domains. For information on our FedRAMP endpoints, see our FedRAMP endpoints documentation. Tip This doc describes how to ensure our agents and integrations can access New Relic's domains. To monitor the performance of your network, see Get started with Network Performance Monitoring. TLS encryption To ensure data security for our customers and to be in compliance with FedRAMP and other standards for data encryption, Transport Layer Security (TLS) is required for all domains. Our preferred protocol for all domains is TLS 1.2. For more information, see New Relic's Explorers Hub post about TLS 1.2. In addition, TLS 1.2 is required for most domains, except: APM agent connections Browser agent connections Event API For future updates to required and supported protocol versions, follow the Security Notifications tag in New Relic's Explorers Hub. User-facing domains Your browser must be able to communicate with a number of domains for New Relic One to work properly. Update your allow list to ensure New Relic can communicate with a number of integral domains that are listed in this section. Blocking domains can cause issues with individual product features or prevent pages from loading altogether. This list doesn't cover domains that New Relic connects to that can be blocked without affecting your usage of the product. It also doesn't cover Nerdpacks or other features that communicate with external services that have additional domain requirements. If your organization uses a firewall that restricts outbound traffic, follow the specific procedures for the operating system and the firewall you use to add the following domains to the allow list. Domain Description *.newrelic.com New Relic One and supporting services *.nr-assets.net Static New Relic assets *.nr-ext.net New Relic One Nerdpacks and assets *.amazonaws.com New Relic One catalog assets behind AWS S3 *.cloudfront.net Static New Relic assets behind AWS CloudFront CDN secure.gravatar.com Support for Gravatar avatars fonts.googleapis.com Support for Google Fonts fonts.gstatic.com Support for Google Fonts www.google.com Support for reCAPTCHA www.gstatic.com Support for reCAPTCHA *.nr-data.net OpenTelemetry and Pixie APM agents To enhance network performance and data security, New Relic uses a CDN and DDoS prevention service with a large IP range. New Relic agents require your firewall to allow outgoing connections to the following networks and ports. To add the following IP connections to the allow list, follow the specific procedures for the operating system and the firewall you use. TLS is required for all domains. Use the IP connections for account data in the US or European Union region as appropriate: IP connections APM data Networks US region accounts: 162.247.240.0/22 EU region accounts: 185.221.84.0/22 Ports US region accounts: Default: TCP 443 (recommended) TCP 80 EU region accounts: Default: TCP 443 (recommended) TCP 80 Endpoints US region accounts: collector*.newrelic.com EU region accounts: collector*.eu01.nr-data.net:443 (recommended) Port 443 recommended Recommendation: Use port 443, a secured channel for encrypted HTTPS traffic. Some New Relic agents also offer port 80, an unsecured channel open to all HTTP traffic. While some agents can be configured to use both port 80 and port 443, we recommend that you choose the port 443 (default). If you have an existing configuration that uses port 80, you can update it to use port 443, the default New Relic connection. Agent downloads TLS is required for all domains. Service for download.newrelic.com is provided through Fastly and is subject to change without warning. For the most current list of public IP addresses for New Relic agent downloads, see api.fastly.com/public-ip-list. Infrastructure agents In order to report data to New Relic, our infrastructure monitoring needs outbound access to these domains, networks, and ports. TLS is required for all domains. Use the IP connections for account data in the US or European Union region as appropriate: IP connections Infrastructure data Domains infra-api.newrelic.com: Required to submit events, metrics, and inventory data. identity-api.newrelic.com: Required for entity registration (for example, a host entity). infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com: Required to determine feature flags. Also used for gradual rollout of new capabilities. log-api.newrelic.com: Required to submit logs to a US datacenter. log-api.eu.newrelic.com: Required to submit logs to an EU datacenter. metric-api.newrelic.com: Required to submit dimensional metrics. Networks For US region accounts: 162.247.240.0/22 For EU region accounts: 185.221.84.0/22 Port 443 Domains + Port For US region accounts: infra-api.newrelic.com:443 identity-api.newrelic.com:443 infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com:443 log-api.newrelic.com:443 metric-api.newrelic.com:443 For EU region accounts: infra-api.eu.newrelic.com:443 identity-api.eu.newrelic.com:443 infrastructure-command-api.eu.newrelic.com:443 log-api.eu.newrelic.com:443 metric-api.eu.newrelic.com:443 Proxy If your system needs a proxy to connect to this domain, use the Infrastructure proxy setting. Browser domains In addition to the IP addresses for APM agents, applications monitored by our browser agents use outgoing connections to the following domains. TLS is required for all domains. Use the IP connections for account data in the US or European Union region as appropriate: For US region accounts: bam.nr-data.net js-agent.newrelic.com For EU region accounts: eu01.nr-data.net bam.eu01.nr-data.net For more information about CDN access for the js-agent.newrelic.com file to the domain bam.nr-data.net or to one of the New Relic beacons, see Security for browser monitoring. Mobile domains In addition to the IP addresses for APM agents, applications monitored by our mobile agents use outgoing connections to the following domains. TLS is required for all domains. Use the IP connections for account data in the US or European Union region as appropriate: For US region accounts: mobile-collector.newrelic.com mobile-crash.newrelic.com mobile-symbol-upload.newrelic.com For EU region accounts: mobile-collector.eu01.nr-data.net mobile-crash.eu01.nr-data.net mobile-symbol-upload.eu01.nr-data.net Synthetic monitor public locations To configure your firewall to allow synthetic monitors to access your monitored URL, use Synthetic public minion IPs. TLS is required for all domains. Synthetic monitor private locations Synthetic private minions report to a specific endpoint based on region. To allow the private minion to access the endpoint or the static IP addresses associated with the endpoint, follow the specific procedures for the operating system and the firewall you use. These IP addresses may change in the future. TLS is required for all domains. Use the IP connections for account data in the US or European Union region as appropriate: IP connections Synthetics private location data Endpoint For US region accounts: https://synthetics-horde.nr-data.net/ For EU region accounts: https://synthetics-horde.eu01.nr-data.net/ IP addresses For US region accounts: 13.248.153.51 76.223.21.185 For EU region accounts: 185.221.86.57 185.221.86.25 Alerts webhooks, api.newrelic.com, cloud integrations, and ticketing integrations Endpoints that use api.newrelic.com (such as our GraphQL API for NerdGraph) and our New Relic-generated webhooks for alert policies use an IP address from designated network blocks for the US or European Union region. TLS is required for all addresses in these blocks. Network blocks for US region accounts: 162.247.240.0/22 Network blocks for EU region accounts: 158.177.65.64/29 159.122.103.184/29 161.156.125.32/28 These network blocks also apply to third-party ticketing integrations and New Relic cloud integrations. Pixie integration The Pixie integration runs in your Kubernetes cluster and pulls a set of curated observability data from Pixie to send it to New Relic using the OpenTelemetry line protocol. The Pixie integration requires outbound network access to the following: work.withpixie.ai:443 otlp.nr-data.net:4317 (US region accounts) otlp.eu01.nr-data.net:4317 (EU region accounts) OpenTelemetry New Relic supports the native OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) for exporting telemetry data. This allows you to use the vendor neutral components developed by the OpenTelemetry community to export your data to New Relic. To export OTLP data to New Relic, configure the OTLP exporter to add a header ( api-key ) whose value is your account license key. And, based on your region, configure the endpoint where the exporter sends data to New Relic. See the OpenTelemetry quick start for more information. otlp.nr-data.net:4317 (US region accounts) otlp.eu01.nr-data.net:4317 (EU region accounts) Network blocks for US region accounts: 162.247.240.0/22 Network blocks for EU region accounts: 185.221.84.0/22",

      "body": "At New Relic, we support our customers by continually improving our Software as a Service (SaaS) features and distributed software. Sometimes that means we introduce changes that can include moving away from existing software components and features, called end-of-life (EOL). As we make these decisions, we strive to balance the need to introduce improvements with our customer’s tolerance for change. We do our best to anticipate the impact of these changes for our customers. What we communicate We're committed to communicating about the changes that impact user experience, especially when these changes have a significant effect on workflow. In assessing impact we evaluate: Potential impact to customer workflow Feature usage information Customer feedback In communicating changes, we strive to: Give as much lead time as possible Minimize interruption Provide a documented alternative Lead time for notifications EOL changes are classified into the following categories: Transition impact Description Notification lead time Low Limited changes to customer processes or procedures are anticipated. None to 90 days Moderate Changes to functionality are limited in scope. Actions such as upgrading retired agents to supported versions may be required. Minimum of 90 days High Changes are highly impactful to customers and will require significant investment from customers to adapt. Minimum of 180 days Critical A third party dependency, security issue, or other critical risk causes an urgent need to change or remove functionality on an accelerated timeline. Notified as soon as reasonably practical EOL lead times: impact on distributed software Subject to EOL lead times: Our lead time notifications also apply to distributed software, which is software developed by New Relic that is installed on customer-owned systems. Distributed software is not cloud-based, and has a lifespan from the date of each released version. After that date, it may cease to function or stop reporting data to New Relic. We have fully open sourced many of our distributed software projects as community projects. We also participate in many community-led software development projects. If we have not open sourced our software projects, or if we have designated them as Community Plus projects, the following timeframes apply to them: Released on or after October 1, 2020: These projects will be compatible with our SaaS offering for at least two years after the date of publishing the release. Released prior to October 1, 2020: These projects will be compatible for at least three years after the date of publishing the release. All fixes and security updates are provided in the latest released version of distributed software, and we encourage our customers to keep installed software up to date. In the event a released version of software will cease normal function sooner than two (or three) years, New Relic will follow the EOL process. EOL lead times not applicable: Some of our distributed software have been open sourced, are designated as such, and are available at github.com/newrelic, including: Community projects New Relic One catalog Example code New Relic experimental Archived Our EOL policy does not apply to these projects, which is why we do not provide advance EOL notification for them. However, you can still find information and support for selected projects through: New Relic's documentation at docs.newrelic.com Project repos at github.com/newrelic Questions about EOL notifications?

      "body": "In the software industry, a tag typically refers to a piece of metadata added to a data set for the purpose of improving data organization and findability. At New Relic, our tags are key:value pairs (like team: operations) added to various sets of data, like monitored apps and hosts, agents, dashboards, and workloads. We make some important attributes available as tags (for example, app metadata like app name and language, and host metadata like host name and AWS region). You can also add your own custom tags. You can use tags in the UI to filter down to relevant data. Here is an example: Here you can see an accountId tag being used to filter workloads to a specific account. Tags help you to: Organize data coming from a large number of sources and/or to a large number of New Relic accounts. Identify teams, roles, environments, or regions to know who’s responsible for what (see example use cases). Better organize and search dashboards and workloads. Query and chart APM data. Tags are useful for organizing data at a high level. If you want to add more fine-grained detail, like capturing user names or other high-cardinality values, custom attributes or custom events are a better solution. Tip Tags were previously called labels in the New Relic UI. You may sometimes see labelin our code; for example, some of our APM agent config files use a label config option for tags. Tag format and limits Format requirements and limits for tags: The UI has limits on the total number of tags it can display per entity: Limit of 100 for tags reported by default or added via agent/integration configuration. Limit of 100 for custom tags added via UI or API. The following are maximum character length for tags: Key: 128 characters Value: 256 characters Allowed characters: Characters must be UTF-8. When using NerdGraph to add tags, a dash (-) in a tag key is interpreted as a minus symbol. If your tag key has a dash, use back ticks around it (like `key-name`). Best practices and tips Before adding tags, we recommend first seeing how our default tags work for you. When you're ready to add your own tags, review the following best practices tips to get the most out of them. Tips on keeping tags simple: Start by adding only tags you know you’ll definitely use. Unused tags create noise and may add confusion. Try to use short tags. Shorter tags are easier to parse, and also the UI may sometimes truncate longer tags. (See character limits.) When possible, use keys and values that are human-readable (for example, region: EMEA is better than Param8323 : 1229072). Avoid including several values like regions: EMEA | US | LATAM in a single tag. We recommend using three different tags for that, like region: emea, region: us, and region: latam. If you want to match multiple tags, you can do that using the advanced options in the filter UI. Tips on using tags consistently: Try to be consistent with tag language across your teams and entities. Be consistent with naming. For example, avoid using both region: emea and reg: emea. Be consistent with format. For example, avoid using both camelCase and kebab-case. Although tag searching is not case-sensitive in the UI and API, try to be consistent with capitalization. For example, avoid using both env: staging and env: Staging. Tips on cross-team implementation: Tags help improve observability and cost allocation. For this reason, responsibility for tag implementation is often assigned to an observability team, SREs, a group of architects, or a cross-team task force. We recommend the people responsible for implementing tags meet and create an internal policy to describe how the tags are defined and which conventions are to be used. Then: Keep this reference manual up to date. Automate the definition of tags when you deploy New Relic agents, at the cloud provider, or through New Relic automation tools, such as the API or Terraform. Create recurring reports that identify entities that are non-compliant with your tagging standards. Tag examples Here are some examples of common ways to use tags to organize data: Team-related tags Creating tags for team names can be helpful to understand which team, group, department, or region was responsible for a change that led to a performance issue. Team examples: team: backend team: frontend team: db Role examples: roles: architecture roles: devops roles: pm Region examples: region: emea region: america region: asia Environment-related tags You can create entities for the environment they belong to. Examples: env: production env: qa env: development env: staging Criticality-related tags You can create tags related to criticality levels, which lets you easier track the most critical issues. Examples: layer: level1 layer: level2 layer: level3 How tags are added Some important attributes, by default, are available for use as tags. For example, the account name, the account ID, and some basic host/server metadata are available as default tags. You can't remove these available-by-default tags. Here are some details about how tags are added for some specific data sources: Add tags via UI or API When you add tags via the UI or API, this occurs at the entity level. This means that, for example, if you have multiple APM agents monitoring a single entity and apply a tag via the UI, that tag is available for all data coming from that entity. To add or delete tags via the UI: Select a monitored entity, like a monitored app or host. Near the entity’s name at the top of the page, select the See metadata and manage tags menu. In the menu that pops up, add or delete a tag. For APM agents, restart your service. To manage tags via API: see our NerdGraph tagging docs. For a guide to using our CLI to automate tagging, see our developer site. APM agent tags You can add tags via the UI and API or you can add tags using APM agent configuration, both methods require you to restart your service. There are differences in how these apply tags: Via agent config: These tags are applied at the agent-level, not the entity/application level. This would be a good option if you have multiple agents monitoring different aspects of the same app (for example, a blue-green deployment model). Via the UI or API: These tags are applied at the entity/application level. Here are links to the agent configuration options: C SDK: not available Java Go .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby For information on querying APM tags, see Query APM tags. And check out this short video on querying APM tags (3:20 minutes). Infrastructure data tags There are several ways tags are added to infrastructure entities and services: Use the UI or API to add tags at the entity level. Infrastructure agent: some attributes are available by default as tags. You can also add custom attributes, which are also available as tags in the UI. On-host integrations: some attributes are available by default as tags. You can also add tags by using integration-specific labels config options (for an example, see the labels config for the Apache integration). Cloud service integrations: by default we report tags and labels that are defined in the cloud service. To add tags, you'd add them on the cloud-service-side. Automate tags with our CLI For a guide to automating tags using our CLI tool, see our developer site. Use tags to filter the UI Use the filter field at the top of the New Relic Explorer to filter down to the entities you care about. You can use multiple filter conditions. To filter down to certain entities using tags: From one.newrelic.com, click Explorer. Click the Filter by... field to see a dropdown of available attributes and tags. You can filter by multiple elements and use advanced search options. To find an entity’s metadata and tags from the UI, here are two options: From a list of entities in the UI, at the far right, select an entity's icon. OR Select an entity. Near the top of the page, select the icon. To use the API to view tags, see our NerdGraph docs. Learn about how to use tags with dashboards and how to use tags with workloads. Custom queries, charts, and alerts Different features handle tags differently. Here are some details about how you can use NRQL to query tag data, or create NRQL condition alerts. Query and alert on APM tags You can query APM tags using NRQL. Minimum agent versions: C: not available Go: 2.3.0 Java: 4.9.0 .NET: 8.17 Node: v4.13.0 PHP: not available Python: v4.10.0.112 Ruby: 6.1.0.352 Here are some query examples: Throughput across shards Given a service that is distributed across nine shards, each shard assigned as an environment, we can plot the transaction throughput on all shards using a wildcard query like: SELECT rate(count(apm.service.transaction.duration), 1 minute) FROM Metric WHERE appName LIKE 'MyApp (%' AND transactionType = 'Other' FACET tags.Environment TIMESERIES Copy Transactions per team To see the number of transactions per service for a specific team, we might use a query like: FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) WHERE tags.Team = 'team-a' FACET tags.Project TIMESERIES Copy Alert on error rate for teams You can use a query for your services’ error rate for setting an alert without having to create a rule for each service. Here is the error rate for all services on a team called team-b. And this alert will automatically monitor any new app names added with the team tag. FROM Metric SELECT count(apm.service.error.count) / count(apm.service.transaction.duration) WHERE tags.Team = 'team-b' FACET appName Copy Related to this, you might create a general rule for a specific service deployed across several environments, so that we have an alarm for a single service monitoring each environment individually: From Metric SELECT count(apm.service.error.count) / count(apm.service.transaction.duration) WHERE tags.Project = 'MyProject' FACET tags.Environment Copy Query and alert on attributes As explained in the tag sources information, some important attributes are used as tags. You can query all attributes and create custom charts using NRQL, and create NRQL alert conditions.",

      "body": "New Relic monitoring is built around the concept of entities. In this doc, you'll learn how we define entities, what you can do with them, and how you can create your own entities or groupings of entities. What's an entity? From a New Relic perspective, entity is purposefully a broad concept. An entity is anything that a) reports data to New Relic or that contains data that we have access to, and b) is something we've identified with a unique entity ID. For most entities, the ID is indicated by the attribute entityGuid. An entity can be any fundamental data-reporting component, like an application, a host, or a database service, but it can also refer to larger groupings of those components. For example, to monitor a data center, you could aggregate those hosts in New Relic to be a workload (a custom grouping of entities). That workload is, itself, also an entity. Also very important is the relationships between entities. Our behind-the-scenes relationship-mapping helps us understand how entities are connected, how they affect each other. And this allows us to give you the power to configure how any data you're bringing in is related to existing entities, or how it's related to other entities. Our focus on entities and their relationships is important because our goal is to give you practical information about your business-important entities, and not give you an unhelpfully huge stream of data from a huge list of monitored things. With more insight at the entity level, you can better monitor and troubleshoot complex, modern systems. Find and explore entities and entity data Tip You can create new entity types for monitoring any data source. Learn more about entity synthesis. Some tips for finding and understanding entity data: To find an entity's entityGuid and entityName and other metadata: from any list of monitored entities in the New Relic Explorer, click an entity's icon, and click See metadata and tags. For most entities, its GUID is reported as the attribute entityGuid. For workloads, it's workloadGuid. You can run NRQL queries to find entities by their GUID. To see connections between entities, you have several options: When viewing an entity in the UI, use the Related entities UI. Service maps. Distributed tracing. Our NerdGraph API. To group entities together, see Group entities. Customize entity definitions and relationships. To learn technical details about entity types, see our GitHub repo. In an entity type's definition file, you'll see information like: The domain: for example, APM, or Infra. Its type: for example, Application or AWSECSCONTAINERINSTANCE. Default tags. The entityExpirationTime: how long data from that entity lasts in the UI, which is different from database data retention. Group and organize entities You can place entities into groups that reflect business-important relationships in your organization. For example, you might group all entities related to a specific team or department, or related to a specific service. Or you might group multiple hosts together to reflect their grouping in a data center. To group your entities, see: Tag entities. Create workloads, which allow you to group business-important sets of entities. Create entities and customize entity data Customize entity data with entity synthesis If you have telemetry from any source that's not supported by New Relic out of the box, you can propose a mapping for it. Once approved, any telemetry received by New Relic that matches your definition file will be synthesized into an entity. To learn more: For reserved attributes and how entity relationships are defined, keep reading this doc. For how to do the work of modifying existing entity types or creating new ones, see our GitHub repo on entity synthesis. Reserved attributes for synthesized entities These attributes are meant to be synthesized from the telemetry we receive. Do not set them unless you're aware of the implications and consequences. Attribute Description entity.guid Generally, you should not set this attribute field on your telemetry data. New Relic may add this field to ingested data to store a unique identifier for the entity associated with the data point. If telemetry arrives with the entity.guid attribute already present, then New Relic will not change the value. However, it may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI, or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. One use case for passing this attribute is to associate ingested telemetry with an entity already created by New Relic. When the entity.guid attribute is sent, the value will override New Relic’s entity identification system (such as entity synthesis definitions) and instead will use the attribute as the data. entity.name This attribute shouldn't be put on ingested telemetry data unless you're trying to override the entity name that would have been selected by New Relic’s entity identification system. While New Relic won't change the value if it's already present on the data, New Relic may add the attribute to your data. Therefore invalid or unexpected values may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI, or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. If this field is present on ingested telemetry, its value will be used to name the entity associated with the data point. This name will be used instead of the name selected by New Relic’s entity identification system (for example, entity synthesis definitions). Note that many entities use the name as part of their identification, so changing this field may result in the generation of a new entity. entity.type This attribute shouldn't be put on ingested telemetry data except for certain legacy cases where it's required to distinguish entity types. Passing this field may interfere with entity detection, particularly if unrecognized values are sent in this field. While New Relic won't change the value if already present on the data, the field is not guaranteed to provide unambiguous filtering of telemetry at query-time. Existing entity definitions already have overlapping values, and we recommend avoiding entity.type in favor of other fields for filtering telemetry queries. This field is used by New Relic, meaning that invalid or unexpected values may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI, or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. To learn how to do the work of modifying existing entity types or creating new ones, see our GitHub repo on entity synthesis. Entity relationships Connections between entities are automatically created by New Relic based on what we can infer from your telemetry. For example, when two services that communicate using HTTP are instrumented with New Relic, we infer a \"calls/called-by\" relationship between them. When viewing a specific entity in either the New Relic Explorer, Navigator, or Lookout, you can see its Related entities in the entity's mini overview. This gives a visualization of the various entities connected directly to the current entity. You can quickly view important metrics for these related entities and navigate from one entity to another, through all the connected parts of your stack. Tip Learn more about how entities are related with our NerdGraph API. When relationships are not automatically detected, you can manually create them using the \"Add/edit related entities\" link in Related entities. Important Currently, you can only manually create calls/called-by relationships between service entities. Tip To manage manual relationships, you need to have modify and delete capabilities on entity relationships. If you don’t see the edit relationships button, contact your account admin. Which relationships are created? These are the relationships created between entities: Source: New Relic agent Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? Application instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS Application instrumented with a New Relic agent Relationships between applications monitored by New Relic agents are reported using the DurationByCaller metric. The callee reports the metric. For example, the metric DurationByCaller/Mobile/100/1234/HTTP/all indicates that the caller is APPLICATION 1234 for account 100. Application instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS Service instrumented with a New Relic agent An application (caller) that calls a service (callee) monitored by New Relic creates a relationship that's reported by the caller using the ExternalApp metric. For example, the metric ExternalApp/dirac.vips.net/100#1234/all indicates that the callee is APPLICATION 1234 for account 100. The metric is reported if the callee successfully responds to the caller. Service instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS Service instrumented with a New Relic agent When a New Relic agent detects that a service (caller) calls another service (callee) instrumented by New Relic, the callee reports the metric ClientApplication. For example, the metric ClientApplication/100#1234/all indicates that the caller is APPLICATION 1234 for account 100. Service instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS A datastore instance When an application calls a datastore instance it creates a relationship reported with the DatastoreInstance metric. For example, the metric Datastore/instance/MySQL/172.16.16.3/3306 indicates the datastore instance is vendor: MySQL, host: 172.16.16.3, port: 3306. This metric also supports the legacy datastore instance format Datastore/instance/MySQL/172.16.16.3:3306. Currently we cannot determine whether the datastore instance is instrumented by New Relic and has an entity associated to it. APM agent SERVES Browser agent This relationship is created when an APM agent injects the browser agent into a page. Workload entity CONTAINS Any entity When a workload is created or updated, relationships for each of the entities that belong to the workload are created. Because some workloads are “dynamic” (defined by tags), relationships are re-created every 5 minutes. This way entities can join or leave the workload. Source: Infrastructure Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? Infrastructure host HOSTS Application This relationship is created when an application is running in one or more hosts, and the infra agent is running in those hosts. Infrastructure host HOSTS Container This relationship is created when containers are running in one or more hosts, and the host is instrumented with the infra agent. Source: Synthetics monitor Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? Synthetics Monitor CALLS Browser agent This relationship is created when a synthetics monitor checks a page instrumented with the browser agent. Synthetics Monitor CALLS APM application Agent events that contain the attribute nr.syntheticsMonitorId have been described as synthetics monitors (the source) interacting with an APM application (the target). If the header exists and the APM application Id exists, a relationship is created between the monitor and the app. Source: Kubernetes Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? Cluster CONTAINS Pod This relationship is created when a pod is created in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Cluster CONTAINS Deployment This relationship is created when a deployment is created in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Cluster CONTAINS DaemonSet This relationship is created when a DaemonSet is created in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Cluster CONTAINS StatefulSet This relationship is created when a StatefulSet is created in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Cluster CONTAINS Host This relationship is created when a host that's part of a cluster is instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Deployment CONTAINS Pod This relationship is created when a deployment creates a pod in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. DaemonSet CONTAINS Pod This relationship is created when a DaemonSet is created a pod in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. StatefulSet CONTAINS Pod This relationship is created when a StatefulSet creates a pod in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Pod CONTAINS Container This relationship is created when a pod creates a container in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Host HOSTS Pod This relationship is created when a pod is running in a host that's part of a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Container HOSTS Application This relationship is created when an application is running in docker, and the hosts where docker is running are instrumented by the the infra agent. External services Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? External service CALLS External service When the relationship is created, the external service reports a span with its name on the service.name attribute and the name of the service that initiates the call in the parent.service.name attribute. Application IS External service A relationship between an application and an external service is created so that users can navigate between them using the related entities component. Browser application instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS External service A browser application reports an Ajax/HostTransaction metric when calling an external service (URL). Example metric: Ajax/HostTransaction/api.segment.io:443/CallbackTime' Cluster CONTAINS External service When the relationship is created, the external service reports a span with the attribute k8s.cluster.name, the name of the cluster. The cluster must be instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration and the cluster name set for the integration must match the one reported in the span. Pod HOSTS External service When the relationship is created, the external service reports a span with the following attributes: service.name: The name of the service. k8s.cluster.name: The name of the cluster. k8s.pod.name: The name of the pod that’s running the service. k8s.namespace.name: The namespace where the pod was created. The cluster must be instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration and the cluster name set for the integration must match the one reported in the span. Create relationships manually You can create additional relationships using NerdGraph, our GraphQL API. Relationships can be created or replaced using the mutation entityRelationshipUserDefinedCreateOrReplace. As its name suggests, it allows you to create a relationship between two entities with a given type. If the relationship already exists between the two entities, it will be added again with the updated given values: the creation time and the creator user id: mutation { entityRelationshipUserDefinedCreateOrReplace( sourceEntityGuid: \"{SourceEntityGuid}\" targetEntityGuid: \"{TargetEntityGuid}\" type: BUILT_FROM ) { errors { message type } } } Copy Delete relationships using the mutation entityRelationshipUserDefinedDelete. source and target are mandatory, whereas type isn't. If the mutation its executed without any type, all the relationships between the two entities will be removed. mutation { entityRelationshipUserDefinedDelete( sourceEntityGuid: \"{SourceEntityGuid}\" targetEntityGuid: \"{TargetEntityGuid}\" type: BUILT_FROM ) { errors { message type } } } Copy Find information about fetching relationships in the relationships API tutorial. Some considerations Two entities can have multiple relationships, one for each relationship type. Two entities can hold a relationship IF they belong to the same trusted account. For each entity, you can manually define up to 2000 relationships. When the limit is reached, the API will return a LIMIT_EXCEEDED error. Each mutation can fail if you don't have access to one of the two entities (source/target). Relationship types provide additional information about how two entities are related. The supported relationship types are: Relationship types Type Description CALLS The relationship between one service or application calling another. Used to display upstream and downstream services. CONTAINS The relationship and hierarchical use cases common to modern and cloud infrastructure. For example, this could indicate that the HOST contains a container. HOSTS The relationship between an application or process and the system it runs on. SERVES The relationship between a back-end application and the browser application it returns in the response. is The relationship between an entity captured as a separate entity by another telemetry data source and the one you're currently viewing. CONNECTS_TO The source entity has a connection to the target entity. BUILT_FROM The target entity contains the code for the source entity.",

For example, to get the state of the EC2 instance use: SELECT latest(ec2State) FROM ComputeSample where provider = 'Ec2Instance' and entityName in {{entitiesData.names}} Copy This query returns a single value (for example, stopped), as the query only uses a single field. The variable entitiesData.names is a list of identifiers for the entities. You can use any other entity properties in the same way. You can use custom variables to enrich your workflow data queries in different ways: Query for when application traffic drops There are times when you want to know when traffic to your application drops. You can use the { { entitiesData.names}} variable in place of your application's name. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction WHERE appName in {{entitiesData.names}} since 10 minutes ago Copy Non-web transactions time Average time the impacted entities spend processing requests/transactions, broken down by process type SELECT average(apm.service.overview.other) * 1000 FROM Metric WHERE appName IN {{entitiesData.names}} FACET `segmentName` TIMESERIES Copy Throughput Number of requests per minute the impacted enitities process SELECT rate(count(apm.service.transaction.duration), 1 minute) as 'Non-web throughput' FROM Metric WHERE (appName IN {{entitiesData.names}}) AND (transactionType = 'Other') TIMESERIES Copy Error rate Ratio of errors to the total number of requests processes by the impacted entities SELECT count(apm.service.error.count) / count(apm.service.transaction.duration) as 'Non-web errors' FROM Metric WHERE (appName IN {{entitiesData.names}}) AND (transactionType = 'Other') TIMESERIES Copy Query for transaction failures There are times when you want to know when your application transactions have failed. This query shows the latest HTTP status code responses filtered by the { { entitiesData.names}} variable that violated your alert policy threshold. From Transaction select latest(httpResponseCode), average(duration) where appName in {{entitiesData.names}} Copy Query for Kubernetes consumption overview Use a query like this to get the number of entities and their ingest times within a Kubernetes pod. By identifying what entities have large ingest times, you can begin to address that issue and find a potential remedy. SELECT uniqueCount(displayName), sum(nr.ingestTimeMs) from K8sServiceSample where entityName = {{entitiesData.names}} since 1 hour ago. Copy",

      "body": "In the software industry, a tag typically refers to a piece of metadata added to a data set for the purpose of improving data organization and findability. At New Relic, our tags are key:value pairs (like team: operations) added to various sets of data, like monitored apps and hosts, agents, dashboards, and workloads. We make some important attributes available as tags (for example, app metadata like app name and language, and host metadata like host name and AWS region). You can also add your own custom tags. You can use tags in the UI to filter down to relevant data. Here is an example: Here you can see an accountId tag being used to filter workloads to a specific account. Tags help you to: Organize data coming from a large number of sources and/or to a large number of New Relic accounts. Identify teams, roles, environments, or regions to know who’s responsible for what (see example use cases). Better organize and search dashboards and workloads. Query and chart APM data. Tags are useful for organizing data at a high level. If you want to add more fine-grained detail, like capturing user names or other high-cardinality values, custom attributes or custom events are a better solution. Tip Tags were previously called labels in the New Relic UI. You may sometimes see labelin our code; for example, some of our APM agent config files use a label config option for tags. Tag format and limits Format requirements and limits for tags: The UI has limits on the total number of tags it can display per entity: Limit of 100 for tags reported by default or added via agent/integration configuration. Limit of 100 for custom tags added via UI or API. The following are maximum character length for tags: Key: 128 characters Value: 256 characters Allowed characters: Characters must be UTF-8. When using NerdGraph to add tags, a dash (-) in a tag key is interpreted as a minus symbol. If your tag key has a dash, use back ticks around it (like `key-name`). Best practices and tips Before adding tags, we recommend first seeing how our default tags work for you. When you're ready to add your own tags, review the following best practices tips to get the most out of them. Tips on keeping tags simple: Start by adding only tags you know you’ll definitely use. Unused tags create noise and may add confusion. Try to use short tags. Shorter tags are easier to parse, and also the UI may sometimes truncate longer tags. (See character limits.) When possible, use keys and values that are human-readable (for example, region: EMEA is better than Param8323 : 1229072). Avoid including several values like regions: EMEA | US | LATAM in a single tag. We recommend using three different tags for that, like region: emea, region: us, and region: latam. If you want to match multiple tags, you can do that using the advanced options in the filter UI. Tips on using tags consistently: Try to be consistent with tag language across your teams and entities. Be consistent with naming. For example, avoid using both region: emea and reg: emea. Be consistent with format. For example, avoid using both camelCase and kebab-case. Although tag searching is not case-sensitive in the UI and API, try to be consistent with capitalization. For example, avoid using both env: staging and env: Staging. Tips on cross-team implementation: Tags help improve observability and cost allocation. For this reason, responsibility for tag implementation is often assigned to an observability team, SREs, a group of architects, or a cross-team task force. We recommend the people responsible for implementing tags meet and create an internal policy to describe how the tags are defined and which conventions are to be used. Then: Keep this reference manual up to date. Automate the definition of tags when you deploy New Relic agents, at the cloud provider, or through New Relic automation tools, such as the API or Terraform. Create recurring reports that identify entities that are non-compliant with your tagging standards. Tag examples Here are some examples of common ways to use tags to organize data: Team-related tags Creating tags for team names can be helpful to understand which team, group, department, or region was responsible for a change that led to a performance issue. Team examples: team: backend team: frontend team: db Role examples: roles: architecture roles: devops roles: pm Region examples: region: emea region: america region: asia Environment-related tags You can create entities for the environment they belong to. Examples: env: production env: qa env: development env: staging Criticality-related tags You can create tags related to criticality levels, which lets you easier track the most critical issues. Examples: layer: level1 layer: level2 layer: level3 How tags are added Some important attributes, by default, are available for use as tags. For example, the account name, the account ID, and some basic host/server metadata are available as default tags. You can't remove these available-by-default tags. Here are some details about how tags are added for some specific data sources: Add tags via UI or API When you add tags via the UI or API, this occurs at the entity level. This means that, for example, if you have multiple APM agents monitoring a single entity and apply a tag via the UI, that tag is available for all data coming from that entity. To add or delete tags via the UI: Select a monitored entity, like a monitored app or host. Near the entity’s name at the top of the page, select the See metadata and manage tags menu. In the menu that pops up, add or delete a tag. For APM agents, restart your service. To manage tags via API: see our NerdGraph tagging docs. For a guide to using our CLI to automate tagging, see our developer site. APM agent tags You can add tags via the UI and API or you can add tags using APM agent configuration, both methods require you to restart your service. There are differences in how these apply tags: Via agent config: These tags are applied at the agent-level, not the entity/application level. This would be a good option if you have multiple agents monitoring different aspects of the same app (for example, a blue-green deployment model). Via the UI or API: These tags are applied at the entity/application level. Here are links to the agent configuration options: C SDK: not available Java Go .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby For information on querying APM tags, see Query APM tags. And check out this short video on querying APM tags (3:20 minutes). Infrastructure data tags There are several ways tags are added to infrastructure entities and services: Use the UI or API to add tags at the entity level. Infrastructure agent: some attributes are available by default as tags. You can also add custom attributes, which are also available as tags in the UI. On-host integrations: some attributes are available by default as tags. You can also add tags by using integration-specific labels config options (for an example, see the labels config for the Apache integration). Cloud service integrations: by default we report tags and labels that are defined in the cloud service. To add tags, you'd add them on the cloud-service-side. Automate tags with our CLI For a guide to automating tags using our CLI tool, see our developer site. Use tags to filter the UI Use the filter field at the top of the New Relic Explorer to filter down to the entities you care about. You can use multiple filter conditions. To filter down to certain entities using tags: From one.newrelic.com, click Explorer. Click the Filter by... field to see a dropdown of available attributes and tags. You can filter by multiple elements and use advanced search options. To find an entity’s metadata and tags from the UI, here are two options: From a list of entities in the UI, at the far right, select an entity's icon. OR Select an entity. Near the top of the page, select the icon. To use the API to view tags, see our NerdGraph docs. Learn about how to use tags with dashboards and how to use tags with workloads. Custom queries, charts, and alerts Different features handle tags differently. Here are some details about how you can use NRQL to query tag data, or create NRQL condition alerts. Query and alert on APM tags You can query APM tags using NRQL. Minimum agent versions: C: not available Go: 2.3.0 Java: 4.9.0 .NET: 8.17 Node: v4.13.0 PHP: not available Python: v4.10.0.112 Ruby: 6.1.0.352 Here are some query examples: Throughput across shards Given a service that is distributed across nine shards, each shard assigned as an environment, we can plot the transaction throughput on all shards using a wildcard query like: SELECT rate(count(apm.service.transaction.duration), 1 minute) FROM Metric WHERE appName LIKE 'MyApp (%' AND transactionType = 'Other' FACET tags.Environment TIMESERIES Copy Transactions per team To see the number of transactions per service for a specific team, we might use a query like: FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) WHERE tags.Team = 'team-a' FACET tags.Project TIMESERIES Copy Alert on error rate for teams You can use a query for your services’ error rate for setting an alert without having to create a rule for each service. Here is the error rate for all services on a team called team-b. And this alert will automatically monitor any new app names added with the team tag. FROM Metric SELECT count(apm.service.error.count) / count(apm.service.transaction.duration) WHERE tags.Team = 'team-b' FACET appName Copy Related to this, you might create a general rule for a specific service deployed across several environments, so that we have an alarm for a single service monitoring each environment individually: From Metric SELECT count(apm.service.error.count) / count(apm.service.transaction.duration) WHERE tags.Project = 'MyProject' FACET tags.Environment Copy Query and alert on attributes As explained in the tag sources information, some important attributes are used as tags. You can query all attributes and create custom charts using NRQL, and create NRQL alert conditions.",

In some cases, when MGIs with a significant high number of metrics are detected, a rule is created automatically to protect the platform from performance degradation. Metric normalization rules management You can create and manage new rules that deal with the noise produced from high cardinality metrics by using the metric normalization tool, which is accessible from each service dashboard in the New Relic Explorer.

Matches: here you will see a preview of the metrics matched by the regular expression above. Action: the action you want to perform on the metrics. Replace: replace the matched metrics by the regular expression with the value described in the Replacement field. Ignore: ignore any metric that matches the regular expression. Deny new metrics: only write metrics that have already been reported, and ignore those that match the regular expression. Replacement: only active when Replace is enabled. Matched metrics are replaced with the field's value. If the regular expression is capturing groups, you can use placeholders for them with \\1 or \\2 for the groups 1 and 2 respectively.

      "body": "In the software industry, a tag typically refers to a piece of metadata added to a data set for the purpose of improving data organization and findability. At New Relic, our tags are key:value pairs (like team: operations) added to various sets of data, like monitored apps and hosts, agents, dashboards, and workloads. We make some important attributes available as tags (for example, app metadata like app name and language, and host metadata like host name and AWS region). You can also add your own custom tags. You can use tags in the UI to filter down to relevant data. Here is an example: Here you can see an accountId tag being used to filter workloads to a specific account. Tags help you to: Organize data coming from a large number of sources and/or to a large number of New Relic accounts. Identify teams, roles, environments, or regions to know who’s responsible for what (see example use cases). Better organize and search dashboards and workloads. Query and chart APM data. Tags are useful for organizing data at a high level. If you want to add more fine-grained detail, like capturing user names or other high-cardinality values, custom attributes or custom events are a better solution. Tip Tags were previously called labels in the New Relic UI. You may sometimes see labelin our code; for example, some of our APM agent config files use a label config option for tags. Tag format and limits Format requirements and limits for tags: The UI has limits on the total number of tags it can display per entity: Limit of 100 for tags reported by default or added via agent/integration configuration. Limit of 100 for custom tags added via UI or API. The following are maximum character length for tags: Key: 128 characters Value: 256 characters Allowed characters: Characters must be UTF-8. When using NerdGraph to add tags, a dash (-) in a tag key is interpreted as a minus symbol. If your tag key has a dash, use back ticks around it (like `key-name`). Best practices and tips Before adding tags, we recommend first seeing how our default tags work for you. When you're ready to add your own tags, review the following best practices tips to get the most out of them. Tips on keeping tags simple: Start by adding only tags you know you’ll definitely use. Unused tags create noise and may add confusion. Try to use short tags. Shorter tags are easier to parse, and also the UI may sometimes truncate longer tags. (See character limits.) When possible, use keys and values that are human-readable (for example, region: EMEA is better than Param8323 : 1229072). Avoid including several values like regions: EMEA | US | LATAM in a single tag. We recommend using three different tags for that, like region: emea, region: us, and region: latam. If you want to match multiple tags, you can do that using the advanced options in the filter UI. Tips on using tags consistently: Try to be consistent with tag language across your teams and entities. Be consistent with naming. For example, avoid using both region: emea and reg: emea. Be consistent with format. For example, avoid using both camelCase and kebab-case. Although tag searching is not case-sensitive in the UI and API, try to be consistent with capitalization. For example, avoid using both env: staging and env: Staging. Tips on cross-team implementation: Tags help improve observability and cost allocation. For this reason, responsibility for tag implementation is often assigned to an observability team, SREs, a group of architects, or a cross-team task force. We recommend the people responsible for implementing tags meet and create an internal policy to describe how the tags are defined and which conventions are to be used. Then: Keep this reference manual up to date. Automate the definition of tags when you deploy New Relic agents, at the cloud provider, or through New Relic automation tools, such as the API or Terraform. Create recurring reports that identify entities that are non-compliant with your tagging standards. Tag examples Here are some examples of common ways to use tags to organize data: Team-related tags Creating tags for team names can be helpful to understand which team, group, department, or region was responsible for a change that led to a performance issue. Team examples: team: backend team: frontend team: db Role examples: roles: architecture roles: devops roles: pm Region examples: region: emea region: america region: asia Environment-related tags You can create entities for the environment they belong to. Examples: env: production env: qa env: development env: staging Criticality-related tags You can create tags related to criticality levels, which lets you easier track the most critical issues. Examples: layer: level1 layer: level2 layer: level3 How tags are added Some important attributes, by default, are available for use as tags. For example, the account name, the account ID, and some basic host/server metadata are available as default tags. You can't remove these available-by-default tags. Here are some details about how tags are added for some specific data sources: Add tags via UI or API When you add tags via the UI or API, this occurs at the entity level. This means that, for example, if you have multiple APM agents monitoring a single entity and apply a tag via the UI, that tag is available for all data coming from that entity. To add or delete tags via the UI: Select a monitored entity, like a monitored app or host. Near the entity’s name at the top of the page, select the See metadata and manage tags menu. In the menu that pops up, add or delete a tag. For APM agents, restart your service. To manage tags via API: see our NerdGraph tagging docs. For a guide to using our CLI to automate tagging, see our developer site. APM agent tags You can add tags via the UI and API or you can add tags using APM agent configuration, both methods require you to restart your service. There are differences in how these apply tags: Via agent config: These tags are applied at the agent-level, not the entity/application level. This would be a good option if you have multiple agents monitoring different aspects of the same app (for example, a blue-green deployment model). Via the UI or API: These tags are applied at the entity/application level. Here are links to the agent configuration options: C SDK: not available Java Go .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby For information on querying APM tags, see Query APM tags. And check out this short video on querying APM tags (3:20 minutes). Infrastructure data tags There are several ways tags are added to infrastructure entities and services: Use the UI or API to add tags at the entity level. Infrastructure agent: some attributes are available by default as tags. You can also add custom attributes, which are also available as tags in the UI. On-host integrations: some attributes are available by default as tags. You can also add tags by using integration-specific labels config options (for an example, see the labels config for the Apache integration). Cloud service integrations: by default we report tags and labels that are defined in the cloud service. To add tags, you'd add them on the cloud-service-side. Automate tags with our CLI For a guide to automating tags using our CLI tool, see our developer site. Use tags to filter the UI Use the filter field at the top of the New Relic Explorer to filter down to the entities you care about. You can use multiple filter conditions. To filter down to certain entities using tags: From one.newrelic.com, click Explorer. Click the Filter by... field to see a dropdown of available attributes and tags. You can filter by multiple elements and use advanced search options. To find an entity’s metadata and tags from the UI, here are two options: From a list of entities in the UI, at the far right, select an entity's icon. OR Select an entity. Near the top of the page, select the icon. To use the API to view tags, see our NerdGraph docs. Learn about how to use tags with dashboards and how to use tags with workloads. Custom queries, charts, and alerts Different features handle tags differently. Here are some details about how you can use NRQL to query tag data, or create NRQL condition alerts. Query and alert on APM tags You can query APM tags using NRQL. Minimum agent versions: C: not available Go: 2.3.0 Java: 4.9.0 .NET: 8.17 Node: v4.13.0 PHP: not available Python: v4.10.0.112 Ruby: 6.1.0.352 Here are some query examples: Throughput across shards Given a service that is distributed across nine shards, each shard assigned as an environment, we can plot the transaction throughput on all shards using a wildcard query like: SELECT rate(count(apm.service.transaction.duration), 1 minute) FROM Metric WHERE appName LIKE 'MyApp (%' AND transactionType = 'Other' FACET tags.Environment TIMESERIES Copy Transactions per team To see the number of transactions per service for a specific team, we might use a query like: FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) WHERE tags.Team = 'team-a' FACET tags.Project TIMESERIES Copy Alert on error rate for teams You can use a query for your services’ error rate for setting an alert without having to create a rule for each service. Here is the error rate for all services on a team called team-b. And this alert will automatically monitor any new app names added with the team tag. FROM Metric SELECT count(apm.service.error.count) / count(apm.service.transaction.duration) WHERE tags.Team = 'team-b' FACET appName Copy Related to this, you might create a general rule for a specific service deployed across several environments, so that we have an alarm for a single service monitoring each environment individually: From Metric SELECT count(apm.service.error.count) / count(apm.service.transaction.duration) WHERE tags.Project = 'MyProject' FACET tags.Environment Copy Query and alert on attributes As explained in the tag sources information, some important attributes are used as tags. You can query all attributes and create custom charts using NRQL, and create NRQL alert conditions.",

In some cases, when MGIs with a significant high number of metrics are detected, a rule is created automatically to protect the platform from performance degradation. Metric normalization rules management You can create and manage new rules that deal with the noise produced from high cardinality metrics by using the metric normalization tool, which is accessible from each service dashboard in the New Relic Explorer.

Share charts If New Relic charts are built with NRQL queries, they have a menu that exposes various options, including sharing options like Get as image and Get chart link. Some notes about sharing: The person you share with may not have access to view the data from that account. To solve that, someone on your team with New Relic user management abilities must add that person to the account. If someone can't access a custom dashboard, it may be that it is set to private. Read more about dashboard permissions. Some sharing options have associated time ranges, which may impact later viewings of it. For example, if you use a chart's Get chart link option and that chart is set to 'Last 30 minutes', when viewed it will show the last 30 minutes, not the time range displayed when it was shared. To share a specific time range, you must select that time range in the UI.

      "body": "The New Relic automap feature displays entity-centric maps to help you troubleshoot incidents that cascade through interconnected services. With automap, you can pinpoint when and where an issue began by viewing the dependencies that affect your services. To use automap, you need a New Relic account. If you don't already have one, you can sign up here for a free account. Here's an example of where you could start troubleshooting with automap. How it works New Relic automap displays relationships between entities in your architecture. For version 1, the relationships displayed in automap are based on direct calls between services. For example, APM services are represented as vertices (hexagons) and direct calls are represented as edges (lines) on the graph. This shows you how these services depend on one another. Automap displays only the entities related to the source entity that have experienced a change in health status within three hours after the automap was launched. So, it may not show all entities related to the source entity. To understand entities and relationships, as well as how the entity platform synthesizes both from telemetry data, see entities and relationships. Important Automap auto-expand logic relies on the health status of an entity, which is largely determined by the alert status of that entity. For optimal troubleshooting with automap, ensure that your alerts are properly configured. Open automap Automap appears on any Related entities pane for supported entity types: In Explorer, insert a filter to find your entity/service (for example, alerts). Click on the entity/service. On the Summary page, go to Related entities in the right pane. Click Map view: The Map view button is only available for the following types of entities: Entity type Description Icon APM|APPLICATION Application service instrumented with a New Relic APM agent BROWSER|APPLICATION Browser application instrumented with New Relic Browser agent EXT|SERVICE Services instrumented with OpenTelemetry, including Pixie-instrumented services MOBILE|APPLICATION Mobile app instrumented with a New Relic agent NR1|WORKLOAD Workload SYNTH|MONITOR Synthetic monitor Explore the history Unlike simple navigation maps, such as New Relic maps in context, automap helps you understand how problems developed by allowing you to scroll backwards and forwards in time. You can also screen out entities you're not interested in. Timewarp cursor: go back in time To identify exactly when and where an incident originated, simply move the Timewarp cursor to see health status changes for the entities on the map. If you don't see the Timewarp cursor, click the clock icon in the upper-right of the automap. When you scroll through the history, you see when anomalous behavior was detected by New Relic Lookout. Here’s an example of scrolling that reveals that the issue occurred between FulfillmentService and BillingService: Controls: See only what you need to see With the controls menu available below the Timewarp cursor, you can de-emphasize certain entities on the map by unchecking those options. For example, you can hide the healthy service to focus only on those alerting as you browse the timeline: Here is an example of how the controls work: Map symbols Here's a table showing the various health status icons: Health status Icon Critical Warning Not alerting Not configured Anomaly",

To learn general information about entities, their relationships, and how to use them, see Entities. Relationship types Relationship types provide additional information about how two entities are related. The supported relationship types are: Type Description CALLS The relationship between one service or application calling another. Used to display upstream and downstream services. CONTAINS The relationship and hierarchical use cases common to modern and cloud infrastructure. For example, this could indicate that the HOST contains a container. HOSTS The relationship between an application or process and the system it runs on. SERVES The relationship between a back-end application and the browser application it returns in the response. is The relationship between an entity captured as a separate entity by another telemetry data source in addition to the one you are currently viewing. Read relationships of an entity You can use NerdGraph to return the relationships between your monitored entities.

      "body": "Here is information about how to use the current service maps feature. For help using the earlier service maps feature, see Legacy APM service maps. Service maps helps you visualize dependencies quickly and easily across your environment. They help you see how all your entities work together across your system. You can use service maps to troubleshoot problems, see how your environment works together, and ensure that issues don’t have downstream repercussions. Service maps also supports cross-account access so help you see relationships between entities for all your accounts. Requirements Service maps work with distributed tracing to connect relationships between entities. Service maps are still functional if you have not enabled distributed tracing, but we recommend having distributed tracing enabled for all agents. This ensures a more consistent experience while using service maps. For best results, update existing agents to the latest version. The required minimum agent versions for maps are: Minimum versions when distributed tracing is enabled The required minimum agent versions for maps using distributed tracing are: C SDK 1.1.0 or higher Go agent 2.1.0 or higher Java agent 4.3.0 or higher .NET agent 8.6.45.0 or higher Node.js agent 4.7.0 or higher PHP agent 8.4 or higher Python agent 4.2.0.100 or higher Ruby agent 5.3.0.346 or higher Minimum versions when distributed tracing is NOT enabled The minimum version requirements for maps not using distributed tracing are: C SDK: not available Go 1.11 or higher Java 3.9.0 or higher .NET 4.2 or higher Node.js 2.0.0 or higher PHP 4.19.0 or higher Python 2.38.0.31 or higher Ruby 4.3.0 or higher Add or remove connections to an entity To view service maps, from one.newrelic.com click Explorer. Once you select an entity to view, you can select service maps from the sidebar. The map shows your upstream and downstream services: entities toward the left are upstream, entities toward the right are downstream. To add or remove connections to an entity: Hover over the entity in the map that you want to alter. Click add or remove more connections. In the connection list, keep boxes checked for the entities that you want to appear in the map. Unchecked entities will be removed from the map. Color coded for alerts Each entity in a map displays a color dependent on its performance. Green: there are currently no violations for this entities performance. Yellow: there is an open warning violation for this entity. Red: there is an open critical violation for this entity. Gray: no alert conditions have been set for the entity White: agent not reporting. This means that the agent installed on the entity is not reporting any data. This is expected behavior for databases or externals. Understand dependencies using API You can discover the same relationship connections available in service maps with NerdGraph. For more information and examples, see the NerdGraph GraphiQL relationships API tutorial. Externals and databases in maps In the New Relic UI, your out-of-process services are referred to as web external or background external data. Externals and databases have slightly different features in service maps than other entity types: Unlike other entities that appear in service maps, externals are aggregates. Clicking on an external service in the map shows you the list of all the external services that are rolled up into the one external entity. This is to reduce map clutter, as some entities can have dozens of externals being reported. Databases are agentless. Because of this, alerts cannot be set for the database, as only see the service call is reported to New Relic. Missing nodes If you are unable to view certain entities in New Relic One service maps, see Troubleshooting: Missing or obfuscated data in New Relic One.",

      "body": "In the software industry, a tag typically refers to a piece of metadata added to a data set for the purpose of improving data organization and findability. At New Relic, our tags are key:value pairs (like team: operations) added to various sets of data, like monitored apps and hosts, agents, dashboards, and workloads. We make some important attributes available as tags (for example, app metadata like app name and language, and host metadata like host name and AWS region). You can also add your own custom tags. You can use tags in the UI to filter down to relevant data. Here is an example: Here you can see an accountId tag being used to filter workloads to a specific account. Tags help you to: Organize data coming from a large number of sources and/or to a large number of New Relic accounts. Identify teams, roles, environments, or regions to know who’s responsible for what (see example use cases). Better organize and search dashboards and workloads. Query and chart APM data. Tags are useful for organizing data at a high level. If you want to add more fine-grained detail, like capturing user names or other high-cardinality values, custom attributes or custom events are a better solution. Tip Tags were previously called labels in the New Relic UI. You may sometimes see labelin our code; for example, some of our APM agent config files use a label config option for tags. Tag format and limits Format requirements and limits for tags: The UI has limits on the total number of tags it can display per entity: Limit of 100 for tags reported by default or added via agent/integration configuration. Limit of 100 for custom tags added via UI or API. The following are maximum character length for tags: Key: 128 characters Value: 256 characters Allowed characters: Characters must be UTF-8. When using NerdGraph to add tags, a dash (-) in a tag key is interpreted as a minus symbol. If your tag key has a dash, use back ticks around it (like `key-name`). Best practices and tips Before adding tags, we recommend first seeing how our default tags work for you. When you're ready to add your own tags, review the following best practices tips to get the most out of them. Tips on keeping tags simple: Start by adding only tags you know you’ll definitely use. Unused tags create noise and may add confusion. Try to use short tags. Shorter tags are easier to parse, and also the UI may sometimes truncate longer tags. (See character limits.) When possible, use keys and values that are human-readable (for example, region: EMEA is better than Param8323 : 1229072). Avoid including several values like regions: EMEA | US | LATAM in a single tag. We recommend using three different tags for that, like region: emea, region: us, and region: latam. If you want to match multiple tags, you can do that using the advanced options in the filter UI. Tips on using tags consistently: Try to be consistent with tag language across your teams and entities. Be consistent with naming. For example, avoid using both region: emea and reg: emea. Be consistent with format. For example, avoid using both camelCase and kebab-case. Although tag searching is not case-sensitive in the UI and API, try to be consistent with capitalization. For example, avoid using both env: staging and env: Staging. Tips on cross-team implementation: Tags help improve observability and cost allocation. For this reason, responsibility for tag implementation is often assigned to an observability team, SREs, a group of architects, or a cross-team task force. We recommend the people responsible for implementing tags meet and create an internal policy to describe how the tags are defined and which conventions are to be used. Then: Keep this reference manual up to date. Automate the definition of tags when you deploy New Relic agents, at the cloud provider, or through New Relic automation tools, such as the API or Terraform. Create recurring reports that identify entities that are non-compliant with your tagging standards. Tag examples Here are some examples of common ways to use tags to organize data: Team-related tags Creating tags for team names can be helpful to understand which team, group, department, or region was responsible for a change that led to a performance issue. Team examples: team: backend team: frontend team: db Role examples: roles: architecture roles: devops roles: pm Region examples: region: emea region: america region: asia Environment-related tags You can create entities for the environment they belong to. Examples: env: production env: qa env: development env: staging Criticality-related tags You can create tags related to criticality levels, which lets you easier track the most critical issues. Examples: layer: level1 layer: level2 layer: level3 How tags are added Some important attributes, by default, are available for use as tags. For example, the account name, the account ID, and some basic host/server metadata are available as default tags. You can't remove these available-by-default tags. Here are some details about how tags are added for some specific data sources: Add tags via UI or API When you add tags via the UI or API, this occurs at the entity level. This means that, for example, if you have multiple APM agents monitoring a single entity and apply a tag via the UI, that tag is available for all data coming from that entity. To add or delete tags via the UI: Select a monitored entity, like a monitored app or host. Near the entity’s name at the top of the page, select the See metadata and manage tags menu. In the menu that pops up, add or delete a tag. For APM agents, restart your service. To manage tags via API: see our NerdGraph tagging docs. For a guide to using our CLI to automate tagging, see our developer site. APM agent tags You can add tags via the UI and API or you can add tags using APM agent configuration, both methods require you to restart your service. There are differences in how these apply tags: Via agent config: These tags are applied at the agent-level, not the entity/application level. This would be a good option if you have multiple agents monitoring different aspects of the same app (for example, a blue-green deployment model). Via the UI or API: These tags are applied at the entity/application level. Here are links to the agent configuration options: C SDK: not available Java Go .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby For information on querying APM tags, see Query APM tags. And check out this short video on querying APM tags (3:20 minutes). Infrastructure data tags There are several ways tags are added to infrastructure entities and services: Use the UI or API to add tags at the entity level. Infrastructure agent: some attributes are available by default as tags. You can also add custom attributes, which are also available as tags in the UI. On-host integrations: some attributes are available by default as tags. You can also add tags by using integration-specific labels config options (for an example, see the labels config for the Apache integration). Cloud service integrations: by default we report tags and labels that are defined in the cloud service. To add tags, you'd add them on the cloud-service-side. Automate tags with our CLI For a guide to automating tags using our CLI tool, see our developer site. Use tags to filter the UI Use the filter field at the top of the New Relic Explorer to filter down to the entities you care about. You can use multiple filter conditions. To filter down to certain entities using tags: From one.newrelic.com, click Explorer. Click the Filter by... field to see a dropdown of available attributes and tags. You can filter by multiple elements and use advanced search options. To find an entity’s metadata and tags from the UI, here are two options: From a list of entities in the UI, at the far right, select an entity's icon. OR Select an entity. Near the top of the page, select the icon. To use the API to view tags, see our NerdGraph docs. Learn about how to use tags with dashboards and how to use tags with workloads. Custom queries, charts, and alerts Different features handle tags differently. Here are some details about how you can use NRQL to query tag data, or create NRQL condition alerts. Query and alert on APM tags You can query APM tags using NRQL. Minimum agent versions: C: not available Go: 2.3.0 Java: 4.9.0 .NET: 8.17 Node: v4.13.0 PHP: not available Python: v4.10.0.112 Ruby: 6.1.0.352 Here are some query examples: Throughput across shards Given a service that is distributed across nine shards, each shard assigned as an environment, we can plot the transaction throughput on all shards using a wildcard query like: SELECT rate(count(apm.service.transaction.duration), 1 minute) FROM Metric WHERE appName LIKE 'MyApp (%' AND transactionType = 'Other' FACET tags.Environment TIMESERIES Copy Transactions per team To see the number of transactions per service for a specific team, we might use a query like: FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) WHERE tags.Team = 'team-a' FACET tags.Project TIMESERIES Copy Alert on error rate for teams You can use a query for your services’ error rate for setting an alert without having to create a rule for each service. Here is the error rate for all services on a team called team-b. And this alert will automatically monitor any new app names added with the team tag. FROM Metric SELECT count(apm.service.error.count) / count(apm.service.transaction.duration) WHERE tags.Team = 'team-b' FACET appName Copy Related to this, you might create a general rule for a specific service deployed across several environments, so that we have an alarm for a single service monitoring each environment individually: From Metric SELECT count(apm.service.error.count) / count(apm.service.transaction.duration) WHERE tags.Project = 'MyProject' FACET tags.Environment Copy Query and alert on attributes As explained in the tag sources information, some important attributes are used as tags. You can query all attributes and create custom charts using NRQL, and create NRQL alert conditions.",

If you want to... Do this... Share UI pages and dashboards To share an entire New Relic UI page, click Share near the top of the UI to copy the URL. Share charts If New Relic charts are built with NRQL queries, they have a menu that exposes various options, including sharing options like Get as image and Get chart link. Some notes about sharing: The person you share with may not have access to view the data from that account. To solve that, someone on your team with New Relic user management abilities must add that person to the account. If someone can't access a custom dashboard, it may be that it is set to private. Read more about dashboard permissions. Some sharing options have associated time ranges, which may impact later viewings of it. For example, if you use a chart's Get chart link option and that chart is set to 'Last 30 minutes', when viewed it will show the last 30 minutes, not the time range displayed when it was shared. To share a specific time range, you must select that time range in the UI. Account and user settings To find account settings and user preferences, use the account dropdown, located at the top right of the UI, beside your user name.

      "body": "In the software industry, a tag typically refers to a piece of metadata added to a data set for the purpose of improving data organization and findability. At New Relic, our tags are key:value pairs (like team: operations) added to various sets of data, like monitored apps and hosts, agents, dashboards, and workloads. We make some important attributes available as tags (for example, app metadata like app name and language, and host metadata like host name and AWS region). You can also add your own custom tags. You can use tags in the UI to filter down to relevant data. Here is an example: Here you can see an accountId tag being used to filter workloads to a specific account. Tags help you to: Organize data coming from a large number of sources and/or to a large number of New Relic accounts. Identify teams, roles, environments, or regions to know who’s responsible for what (see example use cases). Better organize and search dashboards and workloads. Query and chart APM data. Tags are useful for organizing data at a high level. If you want to add more fine-grained detail, like capturing user names or other high-cardinality values, custom attributes or custom events are a better solution. Tip Tags were previously called labels in the New Relic UI. You may sometimes see labelin our code; for example, some of our APM agent config files use a label config option for tags. Tag format and limits Format requirements and limits for tags: The UI has limits on the total number of tags it can display per entity: Limit of 100 for tags reported by default or added via agent/integration configuration. Limit of 100 for custom tags added via UI or API. The following are maximum character length for tags: Key: 128 characters Value: 256 characters Allowed characters: Characters must be UTF-8. When using NerdGraph to add tags, a dash (-) in a tag key is interpreted as a minus symbol. If your tag key has a dash, use back ticks around it (like `key-name`). Best practices and tips Before adding tags, we recommend first seeing how our default tags work for you. When you're ready to add your own tags, review the following best practices tips to get the most out of them. Tips on keeping tags simple: Start by adding only tags you know you’ll definitely use. Unused tags create noise and may add confusion. Try to use short tags. Shorter tags are easier to parse, and also the UI may sometimes truncate longer tags. (See character limits.) When possible, use keys and values that are human-readable (for example, region: EMEA is better than Param8323 : 1229072). Avoid including several values like regions: EMEA | US | LATAM in a single tag. We recommend using three different tags for that, like region: emea, region: us, and region: latam. If you want to match multiple tags, you can do that using the advanced options in the filter UI. Tips on using tags consistently: Try to be consistent with tag language across your teams and entities. Be consistent with naming. For example, avoid using both region: emea and reg: emea. Be consistent with format. For example, avoid using both camelCase and kebab-case. Although tag searching is not case-sensitive in the UI and API, try to be consistent with capitalization. For example, avoid using both env: staging and env: Staging. Tips on cross-team implementation: Tags help improve observability and cost allocation. For this reason, responsibility for tag implementation is often assigned to an observability team, SREs, a group of architects, or a cross-team task force. We recommend the people responsible for implementing tags meet and create an internal policy to describe how the tags are defined and which conventions are to be used. Then: Keep this reference manual up to date. Automate the definition of tags when you deploy New Relic agents, at the cloud provider, or through New Relic automation tools, such as the API or Terraform. Create recurring reports that identify entities that are non-compliant with your tagging standards. Tag examples Here are some examples of common ways to use tags to organize data: Team-related tags Creating tags for team names can be helpful to understand which team, group, department, or region was responsible for a change that led to a performance issue. Team examples: team: backend team: frontend team: db Role examples: roles: architecture roles: devops roles: pm Region examples: region: emea region: america region: asia Environment-related tags You can create entities for the environment they belong to. Examples: env: production env: qa env: development env: staging Criticality-related tags You can create tags related to criticality levels, which lets you easier track the most critical issues. Examples: layer: level1 layer: level2 layer: level3 How tags are added Some important attributes, by default, are available for use as tags. For example, the account name, the account ID, and some basic host/server metadata are available as default tags. You can't remove these available-by-default tags. Here are some details about how tags are added for some specific data sources: Add tags via UI or API When you add tags via the UI or API, this occurs at the entity level. This means that, for example, if you have multiple APM agents monitoring a single entity and apply a tag via the UI, that tag is available for all data coming from that entity. To add or delete tags via the UI: Select a monitored entity, like a monitored app or host. Near the entity’s name at the top of the page, select the See metadata and manage tags menu. In the menu that pops up, add or delete a tag. For APM agents, restart your service. To manage tags via API: see our NerdGraph tagging docs. For a guide to using our CLI to automate tagging, see our developer site. APM agent tags You can add tags via the UI and API or you can add tags using APM agent configuration, both methods require you to restart your service. There are differences in how these apply tags: Via agent config: These tags are applied at the agent-level, not the entity/application level. This would be a good option if you have multiple agents monitoring different aspects of the same app (for example, a blue-green deployment model). Via the UI or API: These tags are applied at the entity/application level. Here are links to the agent configuration options: C SDK: not available Java Go .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby For information on querying APM tags, see Query APM tags. And check out this short video on querying APM tags (3:20 minutes). Infrastructure data tags There are several ways tags are added to infrastructure entities and services: Use the UI or API to add tags at the entity level. Infrastructure agent: some attributes are available by default as tags. You can also add custom attributes, which are also available as tags in the UI. On-host integrations: some attributes are available by default as tags. You can also add tags by using integration-specific labels config options (for an example, see the labels config for the Apache integration). Cloud service integrations: by default we report tags and labels that are defined in the cloud service. To add tags, you'd add them on the cloud-service-side. Automate tags with our CLI For a guide to automating tags using our CLI tool, see our developer site. Use tags to filter the UI Use the filter field at the top of the New Relic Explorer to filter down to the entities you care about. You can use multiple filter conditions. To filter down to certain entities using tags: From one.newrelic.com, click Explorer. Click the Filter by... field to see a dropdown of available attributes and tags. You can filter by multiple elements and use advanced search options. To find an entity’s metadata and tags from the UI, here are two options: From a list of entities in the UI, at the far right, select an entity's icon. OR Select an entity. Near the top of the page, select the icon. To use the API to view tags, see our NerdGraph docs. Learn about how to use tags with dashboards and how to use tags with workloads. Custom queries, charts, and alerts Different features handle tags differently. Here are some details about how you can use NRQL to query tag data, or create NRQL condition alerts. Query and alert on APM tags You can query APM tags using NRQL. Minimum agent versions: C: not available Go: 2.3.0 Java: 4.9.0 .NET: 8.17 Node: v4.13.0 PHP: not available Python: v4.10.0.112 Ruby: 6.1.0.352 Here are some query examples: Throughput across shards Given a service that is distributed across nine shards, each shard assigned as an environment, we can plot the transaction throughput on all shards using a wildcard query like: SELECT rate(count(apm.service.transaction.duration), 1 minute) FROM Metric WHERE appName LIKE 'MyApp (%' AND transactionType = 'Other' FACET tags.Environment TIMESERIES Copy Transactions per team To see the number of transactions per service for a specific team, we might use a query like: FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) WHERE tags.Team = 'team-a' FACET tags.Project TIMESERIES Copy Alert on error rate for teams You can use a query for your services’ error rate for setting an alert without having to create a rule for each service. Here is the error rate for all services on a team called team-b. And this alert will automatically monitor any new app names added with the team tag. FROM Metric SELECT count(apm.service.error.count) / count(apm.service.transaction.duration) WHERE tags.Team = 'team-b' FACET appName Copy Related to this, you might create a general rule for a specific service deployed across several environments, so that we have an alarm for a single service monitoring each environment individually: From Metric SELECT count(apm.service.error.count) / count(apm.service.transaction.duration) WHERE tags.Project = 'MyProject' FACET tags.Environment Copy Query and alert on attributes As explained in the tag sources information, some important attributes are used as tags. You can query all attributes and create custom charts using NRQL, and create NRQL alert conditions.",

      "body": "There may be cases where an application sends many individual metrics that could be better managed in groups. Most of these occur with web transactions metrics named from URLs. For more information on this issue, see Metric grouping issues (MGIs). To reduce high cardinality and prevent metric grouping issues, New Relic supports rules for grouping or filtering out metrics (normalization). In some cases, when MGIs with a significant high number of metrics are detected, a rule is created automatically to protect the platform from performance degradation. Metric normalization rules management You can create and manage new rules that deal with the noise produced from high cardinality metrics by using the metric normalization tool, which is accessible from each service dashboard in the New Relic Explorer. Once there, select Metric Normalization in the left sidebar. There you can see the existing rules or create new ones. Click a rule to modify it, or click Create a new rule to create a new one.

Matches: here you will see a preview of the metrics matched by the regular expression above. Action: the action you want to perform on the metrics. Replace: replace the matched metrics by the regular expression with the value described in the Replacement field. Ignore: ignore any metric that matches the regular expression. Deny new metrics: only write metrics that have already been reported, and ignore those that match the regular expression. Replacement: only active when Replace is enabled.

Customize the navigation bar and shortcuts Select the edit icon at the right end of the navigation bar to customize your view. Home, Explorer, Browse data, Dashboards, and Alerts & AI are fixed, but you can favorite up to six more elements to display on the bar as well. The rest will go on the More group. Navigation shortcuts are a faster way to find entities and apps that are relevant to you. Mouse over any menu item for quick access to your favorite entities, those you recently visited, or just to search without having to navigate to a specific section. If you click on an entity, you can choose to open it in the same browser tab or in a new one. Light and dark mode See Light and dark mode. Search accounts and entities Access Quick find clicking the button, near the top right of the New Relic One UI. Some details about your search: You can search across all accounts that you have been granted access to in your organization. For more about account access, see Factors affecting access. Entities that cease to exist are available in search for eight days. If your organization has multiple accounts, use the account picker at the top left corner to select accounts. Chart and query features You can add most charts to a new or existing dashboard. Here are some query and chart features available across all or most of the platform: If you want to... Do this... Start querying your data Mouse over Browse data and select metrics, events, logs, or traces for a direct access to any of those types of data. Also, at the top of any UI page, select Query your data to access the data explorer and query builder. View a chart's query For some charts, you can view the NRQL query used to generate that chart. This can help you understand a chart better or use it as the basis for a new query. Choose time range Drag across a section of a chart to zoom in on that time range. Or, use the time picker in the top right corner of the UI to select pre-set time ranges or set a custom one. View chart details Mouse over a chart to see a pop-up with more detail. For some charts, selecting a point on the chart will take you to a UI page with more information about that metric. Hide or return chart elements To hide or unhide a displayed chart element, select that element's name below the chart. The chart display will adjust to reflect the absence or presence of that element. Share New Relic views with others Here are some options for sharing New Relic UI pages and visualizations. If you want to... Do this... Share UI pages and dashboards To share an entire New Relic UI page, click Share near the top of the UI to copy the URL. Share charts If New Relic charts are built with NRQL queries, they have a menu that exposes various options, including sharing options like Get as image and Get chart link. Some notes about sharing: The person you share with may not have access to view the data from that account. To solve that, someone on your team with New Relic user management abilities must add that person to the account. If someone can't access a custom dashboard, it may be that it is set to private. Read more about dashboard permissions. Some sharing options have associated time ranges, which may impact later viewings of it. For example, if you use a chart's Get chart link option and that chart is set to 'Last 30 minutes', when viewed it will show the last 30 minutes, not the time range displayed when it was shared. To share a specific time range, you must select that time range in the UI. Account and user settings To find account settings and user preferences, use the account dropdown, located at the top right of the UI, beside your user name.

      "body": "Here is information about using the legacy APM service maps feature to create, customize, and use service maps. For help using the current service maps feature, see How to use service maps. Requirements The legacy service map features in APM depend on your New Relic agent version: Feature Requirements App visibility For your app to appear in service maps, one of the following must be true: Your app must have the minimum agent version required for distributed tracing and have distributed tracing enabled. Note: Mobile monitoring doesn't support distributed tracing yet and will not show relationships to apps that have distributed tracing enabled. Your app must have the minimum APM agent version required for cross app tracing and have cross app tracing enabled. Host and instance visibility To view specific hosts, instances, and types of database information, your agent must meet the same minimum agent versions as the APM database and instance feature and use any of the compatible database drivers. Database-only visibility APM's service maps feature includes the ability to opt out of the deeper, host and instance level view. However, to view databases in service maps without the instance-level details, you must still meet the same minimum agent versions as the Database and slow queries features. Create maps The APM service maps feature helps you create your first map by providing default map or architecture suggestions that automatically build a default map (if you have more than ten reporting apps). To view these suggested maps, go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service Maps > Suggested maps. To create a new map: Do one of the following: Start from scratch: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > Map list > Create new map . Copy an existing map: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > (select a map) > Save as new. Name your map. Rearrange, group, or add nodes on the map as needed. Important Previously, you could have private service maps. Now, all users can view, edit, and delete all existing or new service maps in the account. Save and rename maps Here are some tips about saving and renaming maps: Save To save changes to a map, select Save. To create a copy of the current map, select Save as new. Rename To rename a map: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > (select a map). Select the pencil icon next to the map name. Change the name, then select Save. Add or remove nodes on maps After you create or save a map, build out your map by adding nodes to it. Nodes are added to the map differently based on the node type. To remove any node from the map, mouse over the node, then select the remove X icon. Applications and mobile apps Nodes for applications or mobile apps need to be added to the map in order to add any other nodes. Nodes are added and connected into the map as you select them. The check mark icon means that node is already on the map. To add apps to the map: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > (select a map) > App/Service. Select any applications from the App/Service list. Rearrange or group together as needed. Browser, databases, external services, connected apps In the New Relic UI, your out-of-process services are referred to as web external or background external data. To add browser apps, databases, external services, or other connected apps to the map: Select an incoming or outgoing connection widget. From the list of connections, mouse over an app or service, then select the plus icon. Rearrange as needed. Custom nodes To add a custom node to the map: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > (select a map) > App/Service. From the App/Service list, select Create custom node. Name the node. Add connections: Select the left (for incoming) or right (for outgoing) arrow icons. Then select the plus icon on your target node. Select Save. Rearrange as needed. To add or remove custom node connections: Mouse over the custom node and select the pencil icon. Select the left (for incoming) or right (for outgoing) arrow icons. To add a connection, select the plus icon. To remove a connection, select the minus icon. Select Save. Move around the map Move around the map by panning or zooming in and out. If you want to... Do this... Pan the map In pan mode, click and drag. In drag-select mode, hold the Alt key, then click and drag. Zoom in and out In either mode, zoom in and out by scrolling the mouse wheel. View your entire map in traffic light mode Zoom out until node details fade out and are replaced by health status colors. Toggle the traffic light view on and off Select Views, then select Traffic light mode. View all the nodes and their dependencies Select Discover your environment. Drill down into more detail from a node Use standard UI functions. Select, arrange, group nodes Click on a node to select it and view its performance summary. You can also select multiple nodes at once, to group and ungroup them: Select nodes To select one node, click on the node. To select multiple nodes: Click the drag-select icon to switch to drag-select mode. Click and drag the mouse to draw a square around the nodes you want to select. OR Hold the Shift key and click on each node you want to select. Arrange nodes Caution Auto-arrange cannot be undone. Consider saving a copy of your map first. To arrange nodes on the map, select one or more node, then drag to a snap point on the map. To automatically organize all your nodes and connections, select Auto-arrange map. Group and ungroup nodes If you want to... Do this... Group nodes together on the map Select two or more nodes, then select Create group. Name your new group Mouse over the group, then select the pencil icon. Rename an existing group Select the pencil icon. Remove nodes from a group Select the group, then select the minus icon for each item you want to remove. Add maps and charts to dashboards one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: adding a service map to a dashboard provides context for the data being reported and where it's coming from. You can add legacy service maps to a dashboard. For example, if you have a dashboard showcasing performance metrics for several entities, adding a service map to the dashboard shows how all the entities are related and provides additional context about your system. To add a service map to a dashboard: Go to one.newrelic.com and select the Explorer. Select an entity from the index. Click on Service map. Click Add to dashboard. Search for the dashboard you want to add the map to. Delete maps To delete a map: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > (select a map). Select the map name's pencil icon. Select Delete map. Identify issues with external services If your app connects to an external service that New Relic does not monitor (for example, a third-party API), New Relic watches the service for a week in order to baseline its response time. If New Relic can collect a statistically significant number of data points (more than 100), New Relic compares the current response time to this baseline and uses this to set the health status indicator: Green: Response time from the service is less than 1.75 times the baseline. Yellow: Response time from the service is longer than 1.75 times the baseline. Red: Response time from the service is longer than 2.5 times the baseline. Gray: Alerts concluded it does not have enough data to determine the health status. Purple: Alerts cannot yet conclude if it has enough data to determine the health status. Visualize and monitor complex architectures Use service maps to visualize and monitor complex architectures. For a tutorial introducing the latest features, select the service map's question icon. Nodes Nodes are the basic building blocks for your map. You can add a variety of node types including: Node type Description New Relic APM-monitored app Add your app to the map to view their connections to databases, browser apps, out-of-process services, and other instrumented apps. (In the New Relic UI, your out-of-process services are also referred to as web external or background external data.) Browser apps Automatically detected for each app and added via the incoming connections widget. Only displays browser apps linked to an APM app (standalone browser apps are not supported). New Relic mobile monitoring apps Automatically detected and added via the app/service list panel. External services Service maps automatically detects external services (visible in the connections widget), to track your app's external dependencies and monitor the health of those connections. Custom nodes Add custom nodes via the app/service list panel to include apps and services not automatically instrumented by New Relic (for example, load balancers, implementation planning, and so on). Group nodes A group node contains multiple other nodes. For apps, group nodes include a summarized health status indicator for all nodes in the group. Node arrangement and grouping Click and drag a node to move it around the map, for a customizable view of your architecture. App nodes can also be grouped together into a single node to better organize related apps and services. Grouped nodes include summarized health status indicator for all nodes in the group. To remove items from a group, mouse over the group and select the pencil pencil icon, then select the minus minus-circle icon to remove the item from the group. Incoming and outgoing connections Service maps automatically detects incoming and outgoing connections based on HTTP calls between entities. Mouse over a node to highlight the node's connections. Widgets at the end of each node display a count of that node's connections, and you can click on those widgets to add related entities to the map: View performance summary Click on an app to view its performance over the last 30 minutes. The chart defaults to Response time, but you can view other metrics by selecting any of the available Apdex, Throughput, or Error rate links. While charts use the last 30 minutes of performance data, the service map as a whole is based on the last five minutes. View the app in APM or browser and view its labels by selecting the overflow ellipsis-v icon. Click the app name again to hide the summary charts, and select the overflow ellipsis-h icon again to hide other details. Map list and app/service list panels Select the Map list panel to: Search for and view your maps, and access other users' shared maps. Create a new map. Select the App/Service List panel to: Add new apps and mobile apps to your map. Create custom nodes and add them to the map. Health status and performance metrics You can see health status indicators for most nodes. Except for out-of-process services (external services or background services), entities use the health status indicators used by New Relic Alerts. For out-of-process (external) services, the health status indicator measures the health of the connection to the external service. View all connected apps and services The Discover your environment feature allows you to view all of your apps, services, and dependencies together with a single click. This feature detects all connected applications and services (including externals and databases) to give you a comprehensive view of your overall software architecture environment. To view all connected apps and services: In APM, select Service maps. From your Map list, select Discover your environment to display all of your nodes. Hover over any node to view its dependencies and how it connects to other parts of your service map. Click on individual nodes to zoom in and view their details. The Discover your environment feature may not be available if you are using an older New Relic agent version. See Troubleshooting cross application tracing for version information. This feature may also not be available for highly complex service maps with many elements. Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > Map list > Discover your environment: Use this option to view all of your nodes and their dependencies in one place. Traffic light mode Traffic light mode lets you view the health status of your entire architecture at a glance. This feature helps you quickly find service and app problems, even within a complex environment with many nodes. To toggle this mode, select the Views tab, then select Traffic light mode. When traffic lights mode is On, zooming out far enough on a service map eventually causes the nodes to switch from displaying textual information, to only health status colors. Click on individual nodes to zoom in and view more details. Traffic light mode is on by default. When traffic lights mode is Off, service map nodes retain their textual information and do not switch to health status colors, No matter how far you zoom out. one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > Views > Traffic light mode: When traffic light mode is enabled, zooming out of your service map displays nodes in health status colors. Midnight mode Midnight mode inverts the screen's colors, going from a white background to a dark background. Midnight mode reduces eye strain, especially in low light environments. To toggle this mode, select the Views tab, then select Midnight mode.",

Maps automatically show your app's connections and dependencies, including applications, databases, hosts, servers, and out-of-process services. Tip In the New Relic UI, your out-of-process services are referred to as web external or background external data. Health indicators and performance metrics show you the current operational status for every part of your architecture. Service maps help you: Understand how apps and services in your architecture connect and communicate. Quickly see the current health and operational state of your entire environment. Troubleshoot operational issues and understand the impact of problems down to the host and instance level. Collaborate and drive shared understanding of an architecture. Access service maps Two options are available in New Relic One: the current service maps and the legacy APM service maps. To access the different service maps: Type To view maps Purpose Current service maps Go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select an entity) > Monitor > Service map Service maps give you increased access to all the entities across your accounts, and help you understand how your entire environment is connected. Legacy APM service maps Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps Legacy APM service maps let you create, customize, and share maps related to an individual app. Identify operational issues Service maps are color-coded to provide a quick look at the current status of your environment. Select nodes on a map to view additional performance metrics, and a full list and health check of each node's connections. The map automatically connects nodes into the map, so you can see which apps on the map connect to others. This helps you troubleshoot and assess the impact of a performance problem between a calling application and a specific database. With service maps, you can view your service and its status in the context of its up and downstream dependencies.

      "body": "Problem When using service maps, you can't view the full set of entities or the relationships between entities that you expect to see. Solution Make sure that the entities are being monitored with an agent. If you have a mix of agents with some having distributed tracing turned on and some having it turned off, you will not see the relations between those agents. The solution for this scenario is to run all agents either with distributed tracing turned on (preferred) or turn it off for all agents. If this does not remedy the issue, the service you're trying to view may require manual instrumentation. When you view applications and services that we automatically instrument in service maps, you'll usually see complete and detailed data for those nodes in the distributed tracing UI. However, you may notice that some of these services or applications are missing from service maps. Tip Some browser apps are exceptions to this, and may be missing because: Relationships for copy and paste browser agents are not detected. Only the relationships for injected browser agents is shown (the app the agent is injected into). Call relationships (for example, AJAX calling to other apps) are not displayed. If services or apps are missing, you may want to implement custom instrumentation of applications or specific transactions to see more detail in traces. Some examples of when you may need to do this: Transactions not automatically instrumented. To ensure your application is automatically instrumented, read the compatibility and requirements documentation for the agent you're using. If an application isn't automatically instrumented, or if you'd like to add instrumentation of specific activity, see Custom instrumentation. All Go applications. The Go agent, unlike other agents, requires manual instrumentation of your code. For instructions, see Instrument a Go application. A service doesn't use HTTP. If a service doesn't communicate via HTTP, the agent won't send distributed tracing headers. This may be the case for some non-web applications or message queues. To remedy this, use the distributed tracing APIs to instrument either the calling or called application.",

Remove nodes from a group Select the group, then select the minus icon for each item you want to remove. Add maps and charts to dashboards one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: adding a service map to a dashboard provides context for the data being reported and where it's coming from. You can add legacy service maps to a dashboard. For example, if you have a dashboard showcasing performance metrics for several entities, adding a service map to the dashboard shows how all the entities are related and provides additional context about your system. To add a service map to a dashboard: Go to one.newrelic.com and select the Explorer. Select an entity from the index. Click on Service map. Click Add to dashboard. Search for the dashboard you want to add the map to. Delete maps To delete a map: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > (select a map). Select the map name's pencil icon. Select Delete map. Identify issues with external services If your app connects to an external service that New Relic does not monitor (for example, a third-party API), New Relic watches the service for a week in order to baseline its response time. If New Relic can collect a statistically significant number of data points (more than 100), New Relic compares the current response time to this baseline and uses this to set the health status indicator: Green: Response time from the service is less than 1.75 times the baseline. Yellow: Response time from the service is longer than 1.75 times the baseline. Red: Response time from the service is longer than 2.5 times the baseline. Gray: Alerts concluded it does not have enough data to determine the health status. Purple: Alerts cannot yet conclude if it has enough data to determine the health status. Visualize and monitor complex architectures Use service maps to visualize and monitor complex architectures. For a tutorial introducing the latest features, select the service map's question icon. Nodes Nodes are the basic building blocks for your map. You can add a variety of node types including: Node type Description New Relic APM-monitored app Add your app to the map to view their connections to databases, browser apps, out-of-process services, and other instrumented apps. (In the New Relic UI, your out-of-process services are also referred to as web external or background external data.) Browser apps Automatically detected for each app and added via the incoming connections widget. Only displays browser apps linked to an APM app (standalone browser apps are not supported). New Relic mobile monitoring apps Automatically detected and added via the app/service list panel. External services Service maps automatically detects external services (visible in the connections widget), to track your app's external dependencies and monitor the health of those connections. Custom nodes Add custom nodes via the app/service list panel to include apps and services not automatically instrumented by New Relic (for example, load balancers, implementation planning, and so on). Group nodes A group node contains multiple other nodes. For apps, group nodes include a summarized health status indicator for all nodes in the group. Node arrangement and grouping Click and drag a node to move it around the map, for a customizable view of your architecture. App nodes can also be grouped together into a single node to better organize related apps and services. Grouped nodes include summarized health status indicator for all nodes in the group. To remove items from a group, mouse over the group and select the pencil pencil icon, then select the minus minus-circle icon to remove the item from the group. Incoming and outgoing connections Service maps automatically detects incoming and outgoing connections based on HTTP calls between entities. Mouse over a node to highlight the node's connections. Widgets at the end of each node display a count of that node's connections, and you can click on those widgets to add related entities to the map: View performance summary Click on an app to view its performance over the last 30 minutes. The chart defaults to Response time, but you can view other metrics by selecting any of the available Apdex, Throughput, or Error rate links. While charts use the last 30 minutes of performance data, the service map as a whole is based on the last five minutes. View the app in APM or browser and view its labels by selecting the overflow ellipsis-v icon. Click the app name again to hide the summary charts, and select the overflow ellipsis-h icon again to hide other details. Map list and app/service list panels Select the Map list panel to: Search for and view your maps, and access other users' shared maps. Create a new map. Select the App/Service List panel to: Add new apps and mobile apps to your map. Create custom nodes and add them to the map. Health status and performance metrics You can see health status indicators for most nodes. Except for out-of-process services (external services or background services), entities use the health status indicators used by New Relic Alerts. For out-of-process (external) services, the health status indicator measures the health of the connection to the external service. View all connected apps and services The Discover your environment feature allows you to view all of your apps, services, and dependencies together with a single click. This feature detects all connected applications and services (including externals and databases) to give you a comprehensive view of your overall software architecture environment. To view all connected apps and services: In APM, select Service maps. From your Map list, select Discover your environment to display all of your nodes. Hover over any node to view its dependencies and how it connects to other parts of your service map. Click on individual nodes to zoom in and view their details. The Discover your environment feature may not be available if you are using an older New Relic agent version. See Troubleshooting cross application tracing for version information. This feature may also not be available for highly complex service maps with many elements. Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > Map list > Discover your environment: Use this option to view all of your nodes and their dependencies in one place. Traffic light mode Traffic light mode lets you view the health status of your entire architecture at a glance. This feature helps you quickly find service and app problems, even within a complex environment with many nodes. To toggle this mode, select the Views tab, then select Traffic light mode. When traffic lights mode is On, zooming out far enough on a service map eventually causes the nodes to switch from displaying textual information, to only health status colors. Click on individual nodes to zoom in and view more details. Traffic light mode is on by default. When traffic lights mode is Off, service map nodes retain their textual information and do not switch to health status colors, No matter how far you zoom out. one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > Views > Traffic light mode: When traffic light mode is enabled, zooming out of your service map displays nodes in health status colors. Midnight mode Midnight mode inverts the screen's colors, going from a white background to a dark background. Midnight mode reduces eye strain, especially in low light environments. To toggle this mode, select the Views tab, then select Midnight mode.",

Service maps helps you visualize dependencies quickly and easily across your environment. They help you see how all your entities work together across your system. You can use service maps to troubleshoot problems, see how your environment works together, and ensure that issues don’t have downstream repercussions. Service maps also supports cross-account access so help you see relationships between entities for all your accounts. Requirements Service maps work with distributed tracing to connect relationships between entities. Service maps are still functional if you have not enabled distributed tracing, but we recommend having distributed tracing enabled for all agents. This ensures a more consistent experience while using service maps. For best results, update existing agents to the latest version. The required minimum agent versions for maps are: Minimum versions when distributed tracing is enabled The required minimum agent versions for maps using distributed tracing are: C SDK 1.1.0 or higher Go agent 2.1.0 or higher Java agent 4.3.0 or higher .NET agent 8.6.45.0 or higher Node.js agent 4.7.0 or higher PHP agent 8.4 or higher Python agent 4.2.0.100 or higher Ruby agent 5.3.0.346 or higher Minimum versions when distributed tracing is NOT enabled The minimum version requirements for maps not using distributed tracing are: C SDK: not available Go 1.11 or higher Java 3.9.0 or higher .NET 4.2 or higher Node.js 2.0.0 or higher PHP 4.19.0 or higher Python 2.38.0.31 or higher Ruby 4.3.0 or higher Add or remove connections to an entity To view service maps, from one.newrelic.com click Explorer. Once you select an entity to view, you can select service maps from the sidebar. The map shows your upstream and downstream services: entities toward the left are upstream, entities toward the right are downstream. To add or remove connections to an entity: Hover over the entity in the map that you want to alter. Click add or remove more connections. In the connection list, keep boxes checked for the entities that you want to appear in the map. Unchecked entities will be removed from the map. Color coded for alerts Each entity in a map displays a color dependent on its performance. Green: there are currently no violations for this entities performance. Yellow: there is an open warning violation for this entity. Red: there is an open critical violation for this entity. Gray: no alert conditions have been set for the entity White: agent not reporting. This means that the agent installed on the entity is not reporting any data. This is expected behavior for databases or externals. Understand dependencies using API You can discover the same relationship connections available in service maps with NerdGraph. For more information and examples, see the NerdGraph GraphiQL relationships API tutorial. Externals and databases in maps In the New Relic UI, your out-of-process services are referred to as web external or background external data. Externals and databases have slightly different features in service maps than other entity types: Unlike other entities that appear in service maps, externals are aggregates. Clicking on an external service in the map shows you the list of all the external services that are rolled up into the one external entity. This is to reduce map clutter, as some entities can have dozens of externals being reported. Databases are agentless. Because of this, alerts cannot be set for the database, as only see the service call is reported to New Relic.

      "body": "Problem When using service maps, you can't view the full set of entities or the relationships between entities that you expect to see. Solution Make sure that the entities are being monitored with an agent. If you have a mix of agents with some having distributed tracing turned on and some having it turned off, you will not see the relations between those agents. The solution for this scenario is to run all agents either with distributed tracing turned on (preferred) or turn it off for all agents. If this does not remedy the issue, the service you're trying to view may require manual instrumentation. When you view applications and services that we automatically instrument in service maps, you'll usually see complete and detailed data for those nodes in the distributed tracing UI. However, you may notice that some of these services or applications are missing from service maps. Tip Some browser apps are exceptions to this, and may be missing because: Relationships for copy and paste browser agents are not detected. Only the relationships for injected browser agents is shown (the app the agent is injected into). Call relationships (for example, AJAX calling to other apps) are not displayed. If services or apps are missing, you may want to implement custom instrumentation of applications or specific transactions to see more detail in traces. Some examples of when you may need to do this: Transactions not automatically instrumented. To ensure your application is automatically instrumented, read the compatibility and requirements documentation for the agent you're using. If an application isn't automatically instrumented, or if you'd like to add instrumentation of specific activity, see Custom instrumentation. All Go applications. The Go agent, unlike other agents, requires manual instrumentation of your code. For instructions, see Instrument a Go application. A service doesn't use HTTP. If a service doesn't communicate via HTTP, the agent won't send distributed tracing headers. This may be the case for some non-web applications or message queues. To remedy this, use the distributed tracing APIs to instrument either the calling or called application.",

Maps automatically show your app's connections and dependencies, including applications, databases, hosts, servers, and out-of-process services. Tip In the New Relic UI, your out-of-process services are referred to as web external or background external data. Health indicators and performance metrics show you the current operational status for every part of your architecture. Service maps help you: Understand how apps and services in your architecture connect and communicate. Quickly see the current health and operational state of your entire environment. Troubleshoot operational issues and understand the impact of problems down to the host and instance level. Collaborate and drive shared understanding of an architecture. Access service maps Two options are available in New Relic One: the current service maps and the legacy APM service maps. To access the different service maps: Type To view maps Purpose Current service maps Go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select an entity) > Monitor > Service map Service maps give you increased access to all the entities across your accounts, and help you understand how your entire environment is connected. Legacy APM service maps Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps Legacy APM service maps let you create, customize, and share maps related to an individual app. Identify operational issues Service maps are color-coded to provide a quick look at the current status of your environment. Select nodes on a map to view additional performance metrics, and a full list and health check of each node's connections. The map automatically connects nodes into the map, so you can see which apps on the map connect to others. This helps you troubleshoot and assess the impact of a performance problem between a calling application and a specific database. With service maps, you can view your service and its status in the context of its up and downstream dependencies. Use maps in New Relic One to identify the root cause when troubleshooting an incident.

      "body": "Problem When using service maps, you can't view the full set of entities or the relationships between entities that you expect to see. Solution Make sure that the entities are being monitored with an agent. If you have a mix of agents with some having distributed tracing turned on and some having it turned off, you will not see the relations between those agents. The solution for this scenario is to run all agents either with distributed tracing turned on (preferred) or turn it off for all agents. If this does not remedy the issue, the service you're trying to view may require manual instrumentation. When you view applications and services that we automatically instrument in service maps, you'll usually see complete and detailed data for those nodes in the distributed tracing UI. However, you may notice that some of these services or applications are missing from service maps. Tip Some browser apps are exceptions to this, and may be missing because: Relationships for copy and paste browser agents are not detected. Only the relationships for injected browser agents is shown (the app the agent is injected into). Call relationships (for example, AJAX calling to other apps) are not displayed. If services or apps are missing, you may want to implement custom instrumentation of applications or specific transactions to see more detail in traces. Some examples of when you may need to do this: Transactions not automatically instrumented. To ensure your application is automatically instrumented, read the compatibility and requirements documentation for the agent you're using. If an application isn't automatically instrumented, or if you'd like to add instrumentation of specific activity, see Custom instrumentation. All Go applications. The Go agent, unlike other agents, requires manual instrumentation of your code. For instructions, see Instrument a Go application. A service doesn't use HTTP. If a service doesn't communicate via HTTP, the agent won't send distributed tracing headers. This may be the case for some non-web applications or message queues. To remedy this, use the distributed tracing APIs to instrument either the calling or called application.",

      "body": "Here is information about using the legacy APM service maps feature to create, customize, and use service maps. For help using the current service maps feature, see How to use service maps. Requirements The legacy service map features in APM depend on your New Relic agent version: Feature Requirements App visibility For your app to appear in service maps, one of the following must be true: Your app must have the minimum agent version required for distributed tracing and have distributed tracing enabled. Note: Mobile monitoring doesn't support distributed tracing yet and will not show relationships to apps that have distributed tracing enabled. Your app must have the minimum APM agent version required for cross app tracing and have cross app tracing enabled. Host and instance visibility To view specific hosts, instances, and types of database information, your agent must meet the same minimum agent versions as the APM database and instance feature and use any of the compatible database drivers. Database-only visibility APM's service maps feature includes the ability to opt out of the deeper, host and instance level view. However, to view databases in service maps without the instance-level details, you must still meet the same minimum agent versions as the Database and slow queries features. Create maps The APM service maps feature helps you create your first map by providing default map or architecture suggestions that automatically build a default map (if you have more than ten reporting apps). To view these suggested maps, go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service Maps > Suggested maps. To create a new map: Do one of the following: Start from scratch: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > Map list > Create new map . Copy an existing map: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > (select a map) > Save as new. Name your map. Rearrange, group, or add nodes on the map as needed. Important Previously, you could have private service maps. Now, all users can view, edit, and delete all existing or new service maps in the account. Save and rename maps Here are some tips about saving and renaming maps: Save To save changes to a map, select Save. To create a copy of the current map, select Save as new. Rename To rename a map: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > (select a map). Select the pencil icon next to the map name. Change the name, then select Save. Add or remove nodes on maps After you create or save a map, build out your map by adding nodes to it. Nodes are added to the map differently based on the node type. To remove any node from the map, mouse over the node, then select the remove X icon. Applications and mobile apps Nodes for applications or mobile apps need to be added to the map in order to add any other nodes. Nodes are added and connected into the map as you select them. The check mark icon means that node is already on the map. To add apps to the map: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > (select a map) > App/Service. Select any applications from the App/Service list. Rearrange or group together as needed. Browser, databases, external services, connected apps In the New Relic UI, your out-of-process services are referred to as web external or background external data. To add browser apps, databases, external services, or other connected apps to the map: Select an incoming or outgoing connection widget. From the list of connections, mouse over an app or service, then select the plus icon. Rearrange as needed. Custom nodes To add a custom node to the map: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > (select a map) > App/Service. From the App/Service list, select Create custom node. Name the node. Add connections: Select the left (for incoming) or right (for outgoing) arrow icons. Then select the plus icon on your target node. Select Save. Rearrange as needed. To add or remove custom node connections: Mouse over the custom node and select the pencil icon. Select the left (for incoming) or right (for outgoing) arrow icons. To add a connection, select the plus icon. To remove a connection, select the minus icon. Select Save. Move around the map Move around the map by panning or zooming in and out. If you want to... Do this... Pan the map In pan mode, click and drag. In drag-select mode, hold the Alt key, then click and drag. Zoom in and out In either mode, zoom in and out by scrolling the mouse wheel. View your entire map in traffic light mode Zoom out until node details fade out and are replaced by health status colors. Toggle the traffic light view on and off Select Views, then select Traffic light mode. View all the nodes and their dependencies Select Discover your environment. Drill down into more detail from a node Use standard UI functions. Select, arrange, group nodes Click on a node to select it and view its performance summary. You can also select multiple nodes at once, to group and ungroup them: Select nodes To select one node, click on the node. To select multiple nodes: Click the drag-select icon to switch to drag-select mode. Click and drag the mouse to draw a square around the nodes you want to select. OR Hold the Shift key and click on each node you want to select. Arrange nodes Caution Auto-arrange cannot be undone. Consider saving a copy of your map first. To arrange nodes on the map, select one or more node, then drag to a snap point on the map. To automatically organize all your nodes and connections, select Auto-arrange map. Group and ungroup nodes If you want to... Do this... Group nodes together on the map Select two or more nodes, then select Create group. Name your new group Mouse over the group, then select the pencil icon. Rename an existing group Select the pencil icon. Remove nodes from a group Select the group, then select the minus icon for each item you want to remove. Add maps and charts to dashboards one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: adding a service map to a dashboard provides context for the data being reported and where it's coming from. You can add legacy service maps to a dashboard. For example, if you have a dashboard showcasing performance metrics for several entities, adding a service map to the dashboard shows how all the entities are related and provides additional context about your system. To add a service map to a dashboard: Go to one.newrelic.com and select the Explorer. Select an entity from the index. Click on Service map. Click Add to dashboard. Search for the dashboard you want to add the map to. Delete maps To delete a map: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > (select a map). Select the map name's pencil icon. Select Delete map. Identify issues with external services If your app connects to an external service that New Relic does not monitor (for example, a third-party API), New Relic watches the service for a week in order to baseline its response time. If New Relic can collect a statistically significant number of data points (more than 100), New Relic compares the current response time to this baseline and uses this to set the health status indicator: Green: Response time from the service is less than 1.75 times the baseline. Yellow: Response time from the service is longer than 1.75 times the baseline. Red: Response time from the service is longer than 2.5 times the baseline. Gray: Alerts concluded it does not have enough data to determine the health status. Purple: Alerts cannot yet conclude if it has enough data to determine the health status. Visualize and monitor complex architectures Use service maps to visualize and monitor complex architectures. For a tutorial introducing the latest features, select the service map's question icon. Nodes Nodes are the basic building blocks for your map. You can add a variety of node types including: Node type Description New Relic APM-monitored app Add your app to the map to view their connections to databases, browser apps, out-of-process services, and other instrumented apps. (In the New Relic UI, your out-of-process services are also referred to as web external or background external data.) Browser apps Automatically detected for each app and added via the incoming connections widget. Only displays browser apps linked to an APM app (standalone browser apps are not supported). New Relic mobile monitoring apps Automatically detected and added via the app/service list panel. External services Service maps automatically detects external services (visible in the connections widget), to track your app's external dependencies and monitor the health of those connections. Custom nodes Add custom nodes via the app/service list panel to include apps and services not automatically instrumented by New Relic (for example, load balancers, implementation planning, and so on). Group nodes A group node contains multiple other nodes. For apps, group nodes include a summarized health status indicator for all nodes in the group. Node arrangement and grouping Click and drag a node to move it around the map, for a customizable view of your architecture. App nodes can also be grouped together into a single node to better organize related apps and services. Grouped nodes include summarized health status indicator for all nodes in the group. To remove items from a group, mouse over the group and select the pencil pencil icon, then select the minus minus-circle icon to remove the item from the group. Incoming and outgoing connections Service maps automatically detects incoming and outgoing connections based on HTTP calls between entities. Mouse over a node to highlight the node's connections. Widgets at the end of each node display a count of that node's connections, and you can click on those widgets to add related entities to the map: View performance summary Click on an app to view its performance over the last 30 minutes. The chart defaults to Response time, but you can view other metrics by selecting any of the available Apdex, Throughput, or Error rate links. While charts use the last 30 minutes of performance data, the service map as a whole is based on the last five minutes. View the app in APM or browser and view its labels by selecting the overflow ellipsis-v icon. Click the app name again to hide the summary charts, and select the overflow ellipsis-h icon again to hide other details. Map list and app/service list panels Select the Map list panel to: Search for and view your maps, and access other users' shared maps. Create a new map. Select the App/Service List panel to: Add new apps and mobile apps to your map. Create custom nodes and add them to the map. Health status and performance metrics You can see health status indicators for most nodes. Except for out-of-process services (external services or background services), entities use the health status indicators used by New Relic Alerts. For out-of-process (external) services, the health status indicator measures the health of the connection to the external service. View all connected apps and services The Discover your environment feature allows you to view all of your apps, services, and dependencies together with a single click. This feature detects all connected applications and services (including externals and databases) to give you a comprehensive view of your overall software architecture environment. To view all connected apps and services: In APM, select Service maps. From your Map list, select Discover your environment to display all of your nodes. Hover over any node to view its dependencies and how it connects to other parts of your service map. Click on individual nodes to zoom in and view their details. The Discover your environment feature may not be available if you are using an older New Relic agent version. See Troubleshooting cross application tracing for version information. This feature may also not be available for highly complex service maps with many elements. Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > Map list > Discover your environment: Use this option to view all of your nodes and their dependencies in one place. Traffic light mode Traffic light mode lets you view the health status of your entire architecture at a glance. This feature helps you quickly find service and app problems, even within a complex environment with many nodes. To toggle this mode, select the Views tab, then select Traffic light mode. When traffic lights mode is On, zooming out far enough on a service map eventually causes the nodes to switch from displaying textual information, to only health status colors. Click on individual nodes to zoom in and view more details. Traffic light mode is on by default. When traffic lights mode is Off, service map nodes retain their textual information and do not switch to health status colors, No matter how far you zoom out. one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > Views > Traffic light mode: When traffic light mode is enabled, zooming out of your service map displays nodes in health status colors. Midnight mode Midnight mode inverts the screen's colors, going from a white background to a dark background. Midnight mode reduces eye strain, especially in low light environments. To toggle this mode, select the Views tab, then select Midnight mode.",

      "body": "Here is information about how to use the current service maps feature. For help using the earlier service maps feature, see Legacy APM service maps. Service maps helps you visualize dependencies quickly and easily across your environment. They help you see how all your entities work together across your system. You can use service maps to troubleshoot problems, see how your environment works together, and ensure that issues don’t have downstream repercussions. Service maps also supports cross-account access so help you see relationships between entities for all your accounts. Requirements Service maps work with distributed tracing to connect relationships between entities. Service maps are still functional if you have not enabled distributed tracing, but we recommend having distributed tracing enabled for all agents. This ensures a more consistent experience while using service maps. For best results, update existing agents to the latest version. The required minimum agent versions for maps are: Minimum versions when distributed tracing is enabled The required minimum agent versions for maps using distributed tracing are: C SDK 1.1.0 or higher Go agent 2.1.0 or higher Java agent 4.3.0 or higher .NET agent 8.6.45.0 or higher Node.js agent 4.7.0 or higher PHP agent 8.4 or higher Python agent 4.2.0.100 or higher Ruby agent 5.3.0.346 or higher Minimum versions when distributed tracing is NOT enabled The minimum version requirements for maps not using distributed tracing are: C SDK: not available Go 1.11 or higher Java 3.9.0 or higher .NET 4.2 or higher Node.js 2.0.0 or higher PHP 4.19.0 or higher Python 2.38.0.31 or higher Ruby 4.3.0 or higher Add or remove connections to an entity To view service maps, from one.newrelic.com click Explorer. Once you select an entity to view, you can select service maps from the sidebar. The map shows your upstream and downstream services: entities toward the left are upstream, entities toward the right are downstream. To add or remove connections to an entity: Hover over the entity in the map that you want to alter. Click add or remove more connections. In the connection list, keep boxes checked for the entities that you want to appear in the map. Unchecked entities will be removed from the map. Color coded for alerts Each entity in a map displays a color dependent on its performance. Green: there are currently no violations for this entities performance. Yellow: there is an open warning violation for this entity. Red: there is an open critical violation for this entity. Gray: no alert conditions have been set for the entity White: agent not reporting. This means that the agent installed on the entity is not reporting any data. This is expected behavior for databases or externals. Understand dependencies using API You can discover the same relationship connections available in service maps with NerdGraph. For more information and examples, see the NerdGraph GraphiQL relationships API tutorial. Externals and databases in maps In the New Relic UI, your out-of-process services are referred to as web external or background external data. Externals and databases have slightly different features in service maps than other entity types: Unlike other entities that appear in service maps, externals are aggregates. Clicking on an external service in the map shows you the list of all the external services that are rolled up into the one external entity. This is to reduce map clutter, as some entities can have dozens of externals being reported. Databases are agentless. Because of this, alerts cannot be set for the database, as only see the service call is reported to New Relic. Missing nodes If you are unable to view certain entities in New Relic One service maps, see Troubleshooting: Missing or obfuscated data in New Relic One.",

Maps automatically show your app's connections and dependencies, including applications, databases, hosts, servers, and out-of-process services. Tip In the New Relic UI, your out-of-process services are referred to as web external or background external data. Health indicators and performance metrics show you the current operational status for every part of your architecture. Service maps help you: Understand how apps and services in your architecture connect and communicate. Quickly see the current health and operational state of your entire environment.

Access service maps Two options are available in New Relic One: the current service maps and the legacy APM service maps. To access the different service maps: Type To view maps Purpose Current service maps Go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select an entity) > Monitor > Service map Service maps give you increased access to all the entities across your accounts, and help you understand how your entire environment is connected. Legacy APM service maps Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps Legacy APM service maps let you create, customize, and share maps related to an individual app. Identify operational issues Service maps are color-coded to provide a quick look at the current status of your environment. Select nodes on a map to view additional performance metrics, and a full list and health check of each node's connections. The map automatically connects nodes into the map, so you can see which apps on the map connect to others. This helps you troubleshoot and assess the impact of a performance problem between a calling application and a specific database. With service maps, you can view your service and its status in the context of its up and downstream dependencies. Use maps in New Relic One to identify the root cause when troubleshooting an incident.

If you're trying to switch between accounts, use the account switcher. account switcher If you have access to more than one account in a multi-account organization, you can use the account switcher to switch between accounts. This is located in the top right of most New Relic UI pages. For more on factors that affect access to accounts, see Factors affecting access. To find account settings, use the account dropdown. administrator A type of user role on a New Relic account. For more information, see Users. agent At New Relic, an agent is a piece of monitoring software that provides integrations with various technologies (for example, web frameworks, host operating systems, or database types). The agents send that data to New Relic, usually on a specific cadence. For more information, see: New Relic Instant Observability Install agents agent API Some New Relic agents have agent APIs that allow you to extend the functionality of an agent. You can use the API to control, customize and extend the functionality of the agent. Here are some agent API docs: APM agents: C SDK API Go agent API Java agent API .NET agent API Node.js agent API PHP agent API Ruby agent API Python agent API Browser agent: Browser agent API Mobile agents: iOS SDK API Android SDK API aggregated metrics Aggregated metric data summarizes calls to specific methods in your application, including how many times each one was called and response times. In the New Relic UI, you see the class and method names along with their aggregate numbers. Metric data aggregation depends on the New Relic tool and your subscription level. For more information, see the documentation about data retention. aggregation delay The length of time in seconds to wait for the aggregation window to fill with data. Required when using CADENCE or EVENT_FLOW aggreation_method types. aggregation function You can use NRQL query functions, such as sum(), average(), or latest() to choose how the data points in an aggregation window should be processed into a single data point. The single aggregated data point is what's passed through the alert evaluation process. aggregation method New Relic aggregates data into windows, and needs to determine when the current window ends and the next one begins. The aggregation_method is the logic that tells us when we have all the data for a given aggregation window. Once the window is closed, the data is aggregated into a single point and evaluated against the threshold. This field is optional. One of the following three values can be specified: EVENT_FLOW: (Default) Each aggregation window will wait until it starts to see timestamps arrive that are past its own delay setting. Once this occurs, the data is published. Relies on the timestamps of arriving data, so wall-clock time is no longer relevant. Works best for sources that come in frequently and with low event spread (high througput metrics) CADENCE: Classic New Relic logic where each evaluation window waits exactly as long as the aggregation_delay setting, using the wall-clock time as a timer. aggregation_delay is required when using this option. Data arriving too late will be dropped, which can cause false alerts. EVENT_TIMER: Each aggregation window has a timer on it, set to the aggregation_timer setting. The Timer starts running as soon as the first data point appears for that aggregation window (based on the data point’s timestamp). The aggregation_timer is reset for each new data point that arrives for that window. Once the aggregation_timer reaches 0, the aggregation window is published. Ideal for sparse and batched data, such as cloud integrations and infrequent error logs. aggregation timer The length of time in seconds to wait after each data point received, to ensure the entire batch is processed. Required when using EVENT_TIMER aggregation_method type. aggregation window Streaming alerts gathers data together into specific amounts of time. These windows of time are customizable. Data points are collected together based their timestamps and reported as a batch. The customizable aggregation window provides greater flexibility and fewer false violations when alerting on irregular or less frequent data points. alert An alert communicates an event or incident that designated personnel can track through Alerts. For an explanation of how basic alerts concepts are related, see Concepts and workflow. alert condition An alert condition (or condition), identified by its unique numeric condition_id, contains the criteria for creating a violation. The condition includes the threshold that is set for a metric timeslice or a custom metric over time on a chosen target. For an explanation of how a condition relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. alert evaluation Streaming data is assessed on a set of aggregation windows to determine if an alert condition is violating or recovering. The aggregation window time is how long we'll collect data before running the NRQL query condition. The offset evaluation time is how long you want us to wait for late data before assessing it. If a window doesn't have any data points, it's treated as a gap for loss of signal. alert policy A collection of one or more conditions, one or more notification channels, and an Incident preference setting. If a condition contained within the policy opens a violation, an incident may be opened depending on the Incident preference setting. Notifications will then be sent to all channels attached to the policy. For an explanation of how a policy relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. apdex Apdex is an industry-standard way to measure users' satisfaction with the response time of an application or service. New Relic rates each response as Satisfied, Tolerated, or Frustrated, and uses these ratings to calculate an overall user satisfaction score. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. apdex_f The response time above which a transaction are rated frustrating. Defaults to four times apdex_t. Requests that complete in less than apdex_t are rated satisfied. Requests that take longer than apdex_t, but less than four times apdex_t (apdex_f), are tolerated. Any requests that take longer than apdex_f are rated frustrating. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. apdex_t The response time above which a transaction is considered tolerable. The default value is 0.5 seconds, but you can change this in your Apdex settings. Requests that complete in less than apdex_t are rated satisfied. Requests that take more than apdex_t, but less than apdex_f, are tolerated. Any requests that take longer than apdex_f are rated frustrating. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. API (application programming interface) New Relic offers a variety of APIs and SDKs. For more information, see the introduction to New Relic's APIs. APM New Relic's APM (application performance monitoring) provides monitoring of your web or non-web application's performance. APM supports apps using several programming languages. application For New Relic purposes, any program instrumented by New Relic. application ID Some New Relic solutions assign a monitored application a unique application ID, often shortened to app ID. When present, this ID is available in the UI. It is also reported as an attribute and can be queried. For how to determine this, see Find app ID. application name The name that New Relic combines with your license key to uniquely identify a particular app. For more information, see Name your application. Applied Intelligence (AI) Applied Intelligence (AI) helps you find, troubleshoot, and resolve problems more quickly. Specifically, it’s a hybrid machine learning engine that reduces alert noise, correlates incidents, and automatically detects anomalies. Applied Intelligence includes Alerts, Incident Intelligence, and Proactive Detection. attribute Attributes are key-value pairs attached to data objects reported to New Relic. Attributes add detail, and they're similar to tags or labels in other SaaS software. You can explore this data by querying or searching via the UI or by using the data dictionary. Examples: APM reports a Transaction event. This includes timing data for the transaction in a duration attribute, which might have a value of .002. Our Infrastructure Monitoring reports a ProcessSample event. This includes a variety of CPU usage attributes, including a cpuSystemPercent attribute, which might have a value of .01. Our Telemetry SDK reports a Metric data type for storing metrics, with attached attributes like metricName and newrelic.source. Some New Relic tools allow you to report custom attributes to enhance your monitoring. For more information about attributes in APM, see Agent attributes. availability monitoring See Types of Synthetics monitors. browser The New Relic UI supports most browsers. For more information, see Supported browsers. For our end-user browser monitoring tool, see Browser Monitoring. Browser monitoring A Real User Monitoring (RUM) solution that measures the speed and performance of your end users as they navigate to your site from different web browsers, devices, operating systems, and networks. background external See web external. child account See parent account. cloud-based integration New Relic offers cloud-based integrations with providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform. collector The component that collects data from New Relic agents running on an app server, mobile device, or end-user browser. While the agent is installed on a user's app server, the collectors are centrally located in New Relic's data center. In order to contact the collector, the agent must be able to reach New Relic's domains and IP addresses. (The exact domain or IP depends on the New Relic monitoring tool.) The collector receives and interprets this data, and stores it in a database. The data is then retrieved and presented in the New Relic UI and by our various REST APIs. Command line interface (CLI) Our command line interface (CLI) is a tool you can use to build a New Relic application. This is the same tool our own engineers use. Go here for quick start instructions. Go to our Developer site for sample apps and guides. compute unit (CU) A unit of measurement that determines your pricing for some New Relic products governed by our original product-based pricing model. For more information, see Compute unit pricing. condition_id See alert condition. CPM (calls per minute) The number of calls your application receives each minute. This usually corresponds to the number of page views or external connections, and is usually the same as RPM (requests per minute). CPU burn The time consumed by code minus the wait time for a transaction. This is the time actually spent processing the transaction. It appears in the New Relic UI at the top of the transaction view for the agents that provide it (Ruby and PHP only). custom attribute A key-value pair added to a transaction or event in order to gain additional information about it. For more information, see custom attributes. custom dashboard A customizable dashboard with charts and tables that includes data from multiple New Relic data sources. For more information, see dashboards. custom event An event, in New Relic terms, is a data object with attached attributes. New Relic reports default event types, like Transaction and TransactionError. You can also create your own events. Events can be queried, and are used in some other features. You can generate custom events with APM agents, the browser monitoring agent, the mobile monitoring agents, and via the Event API. Alternatively, you can add custom attributes to some existing default New Relic events. custom instrumentation Custom instrumentation allows you to extend New Relic's monitoring to instrument code elements New Relic doesn't automatically instrument. Custom instrumentation is useful when your framework is not supported by New Relic, or when New Relic fails to pick up some element of your program. You can also use custom instrumentation to block a transaction from being reported entirely. For more information, see Custom instrumentation. custom metric Metric timeslice data that is manually recorded via an API call. Custom metrics allow you to record arbitrary metrics; for example, timing or computer resource data. All custom metric names must be prefixed with Custom/. For more information, see Custom metrics. Not to be confused with custom instrumentation data. data collector See collector. data explorer Use the data explorer to access, query and customize your data, create visualizations, and make connections between your services in a consistent and curated experience. For more on using the data explorer, see Introduction to the data explorer. degradation period When a data source enters a violating state, a degradation period of time begins. The degradation period is set in the condition's threshold. A violation will open if the source stays in a violating state for the entire degradation period. In addition: If the data source enters a non-violating state before the entire time has elapsed, the degradation period countdown is reset, and a violation does not open. If your alert condition threshold is configured as at least once in, the degradation period always lasts a single minute. dimensional metric A dimensional metric is a metric that has multiple attributes, also known as dimensions. At New Relic, we report dimensional metrics using the Metric data type. For more on other metric data types, see Metric data. Docker An open platform for distributed applications, which allows you to assemble multi-container portable apps. Infrastructure Monitoring includes integrated Docker monitoring. For more information about Docker, see the Docker website. downtime The period of time when customers cannot access your site and your app is not reporting to New Relic. For more information, see Synthetic Monitoring and Types of synthetic monitors. entity In New Relic, an entity is anything we can identify that has data you can monitor. An entity can be something you monitor directly, like applications and microservices, or indirectly, like data centers. You can identify one or more entities to be targets for alert conditions. In the Alerts API, the entity being monitored is identified with an entity_id. For more on this, see What are entities? event The word event is a general term that can have many meanings. At New Relic, event can have several meanings: At New Relic, event data is one of our core data types. Event data represents a record of a single event at a particular moment in time. Events can vary by type (for example, Transaction or Mobile, and will have associated attributes (for example, timestamp or transactionName). For more details, see Event data. For our infrastructure monitoring, the word event can be used to refer to important system and host activity. For example, a configuration change for a monitored host would be registered on Infrastructure's Events UI page. For alerts, the Events UI page displays a list of alerts-related incidents for your monitored entities. Events are reported for a violation opening and for closing. In some contexts, event can refer to any NRQL-queryable data type. For example, when you run a NRQL query, you will see a count of inspected events: this refers to a count of all data types queried. expected error An expected error is a common error that you don't want to affect your Apdex score or error rate. For more information, see Manage errors in APM. exporter At New Relic, an exporter is a type of integration that reports telemetry data to New Relic from a third-party (non-New Relic) telemetry tool. For examples, see Exporters, or search our integration quickstarts in New Relic I/O. Flex New Relic Flex is an application-agnostic, all-in-one infrastructure integration. With it, you can build your own integration that collects metric data from a wide variety of services, and that can instrument any app that exposes metrics over a standard protocol (HTTP, file, shell) in a standard format (for example, JSON or plain text) to the terminal. It's a recommended way to create a custom integration, because it doesn't require coding skills. framework A framework is a structured collection of pre-defined functions, into which an application builder inserts their own code to build their application. A framework is not the same as a library. While a library is a collection of functions you can call as needed, a framework is a skeleton for your application. The functions in that framework then call your functions. For more about the distinction between a framework and a library, see What is the difference between a framework and a library?. New Relic automatically instruments many common frameworks. For more about the frameworks New Relic supports, see the agent-specific documentation: C SDK supported frameworks Go supported frameworks Java supported frameworks .NET supported frameworks Node.js supported frameworks PHP supported frameworks Python supported frameworks Ruby supported frameworks harvest cycle The period of time between each connection from a New Relic agent to the collector. Between harvest cycles, an agent collects and caches data. At the end of the cycle an agent reports those data to the collector, then begins a new harvest cycle. health status indicator Some New Relic UI pages have a health status indicator appearing next to an index of monitored entities. This is a colored bar (generally green, yellow, red, or gray) indicating the status of your app or other entity monitored by New Relic. It also indicates whether the entity has any alert policies assigned to it and whether there are any policy violations. In general, the colored bar will be green, yellow, red, or gray to indicate the health status. Exceptions: Our REST API (v2) uses orange instead of yellow for the application's health and reporting status. Service maps use different criteria for reporting the health of a connection between an app and an external service not monitored by New Relic (for example, a third party API). host At New Relic, a host means one of the following: A physical machine is a hardware-based device with dedicated physical resources, including memory, processing, and storage. Each machine has its own OS which applications run on. A virtual machine (VM) is the software implementation of a physical machine that executes programs like a physical machine. One or more virtual machines can run on a physical machine. Each virtual machine has its own OS and allocated virtual machine resources such as RAM and CPU. A cloud instance is a type of virtual machine that is run in the public cloud. In this context, virtual machines and cloud instances are different from Java Virtual Machines (JVMs) and containers. host ID Each host identified by APM is assigned a host ID. This ID is used to uniquely identify it, and to retrieve data about that host via the REST API. For more information, see List host ID. ignored error An error that you have told the APM agent not to report to the collector. For more information, see Manage errors in APM. incident An incident is a collection of one or more violations of the conditions defined in an alert policy. An incident record includes all of the open and close time stamps for each violation, as well as chart snapshots of the data being evaluated around the time of each violation. You can view detailed information from the Incidents pages in the user interface. You can also select your preference for how we roll up violations into the incident. For an explanation of how an incident relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. Infrastructure monitoring By connecting changes in host performance to changes in your configuration, infrastructure monitoring provides real-time metrics and powerful analytics that reduce your mean-time-to-resolution (MTTR). Infrastructure is specifically designed for complex environments that need flexible, dynamic server monitoring, from a physical datacenter to thousands of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances and other types of integrations. Insights Insights was the name for the New Relic product that previously governed the reporting of custom events, as well as the ability to query and chart your New Relic data. These features are now a fundamental part of the New Relic One platform and are no longer governed by the Insights product or name. To learn more about these features: Event API for reporting custom events Query and chart data For historical reasons, the word \"Insights\" is still used in some places. For example: Some APM agents still have Insights language in their codebase. For example, the Java agent custom_insights_events configuration. For New Relic organizations on our original pricing model, Insights Pro is still the product name governing custom event data ingest and retention. There is an API key called the Insights insert key. instance ID Each instance identified by New Relic is assigned a unique instance ID. Instance IDs are most commonly found for JVMs (Java Virtual Machines), but can exist for each agent. This ID is used to uniquely identify it, and to retrieve data about that instance via the REST API. For more information, see List instance IDs. instrumentation The collection of data from an application or host. When New Relic instruments a framework, it detects the methods and calls used by that framework, and intelligently groups them together. integration At New Relic, an integration refers to a solution that integrates with a specific technology (like a web framework or a type of database). All our integrations can be found as quickstarts in New Relic Instant Observability. interaction In our mobile monitoring, an interaction is a specific code path initiated by a user interaction (usually a button press). An interaction is the mobile equivalent of a transaction, and like a transaction an interaction can be traced and monitored. You can see much of the data included in an interaction in the BrowserInteraction event. interaction trace An interaction trace is a complete picture of a single interaction. With interaction traces, New Relic gives you much deeper visibility into a single slow interaction, which can help you understand a broader problem. Interaction traces are the mobile equivalent of a transaction trace. For more information, see Creating interactions (iOS) and Creating interactions (Android). inventory data Inventory data is information about the status or configuration of a service or host. Examples of inventory data include: Configuration settings Name of the host the service is on Amazon AWS region Port being used For more information, see Understand and use data. key transaction A web transaction that the user has marked as particularly important; for example, key business events (such as signups or purchase confirmations), or transactions with a high performance impact (such as searches). Key transactions have their own pages in the UI and other customized values. For more information, see Key transactions. launcher A launcher is a specific piece of code you can include when you create a New Relic One app. It creates the tile on the homepage that you click to launch the app. For more information, see the documentation about core UI components. log A log is a message about a system used to understand the activity of the system and to diagnose problems. For more information on how we use log data, see Log management. Log monitoring Our log management and monitoring features give you the tools to collect, process, explore, visualize, and alert on your log data using your existing log forwarder. With all of your log data in one place, you'll be able to make better decisions, detect and resolve problems more quickly, and see your logs in context to troubleshoot faster. Logs Our Logs feature is a scalable log management platform that allows you to connect your log data with the rest of your telemetry data. Pre-built plugins with some of the most common open-source logging tools make it simple to send your data from anywhere to New Relic. Logs in context Logs in context makes it easy to link to your log data with related data across the rest of our platform. Bringing all of this data together in a single tool allows you to quickly get to the root cause of an issue and find the log lines that you need to identify and resolve a problem. master account See parent account. metric A metric is a numeric measurement. Metric data is a broad category because there are several ways to make and report measurements. For more about how metrics are reported at New Relic, see New Relic data types. metric timeslice New Relic reports metrics in several ways. One variety of metric data is called metric timeslice data; this is the type of data used to generate many of the charts in APM, mobile monitoring, and browser monitoring (for more details, see metric timeslice data). Over time, metric timeslice data is aggregated into longer timeslice data records for more efficient storage. For more about how we aggregate this type of data, see Data aggregation. For how to query this type of data, see Query metric timeslice data. metric grouping issue A metric grouping issue occurs when an account sends too many differently named metric timeslice data points to New Relic, and those individual web transactions are not properly aggregated. For example, rather than a single /user/controlpanel/ metric name, you might see /user/controlpanel/alice, /user/controlpanel/bob, and /user/controlpanel/carol. For more information, see Metric grouping issues. minion The software that accepts monitor jobs from a private location. A minion is a packaged virtual appliance that runs in your hypervisor. For more information, see Private locations overview and install and configure private minions. Mobile monitoring Mobile monitoring allows you to monitor and manage the performance of your mobile apps on Android, iOS, tvOS, and other systems. Mobile monitoring provides end-to-end details, including crashes, throughput, HTTP requests, error traces, and more. Not to be confused with New Relic's own mobile apps for Android, iPhone, and iPad. monitor For our Synthetic Monitoring, a monitor ensures your website or API endpoint is available. For more information, see Adding and editing monitors. NerdGraph NerdGraph is our GraphQL API, an efficient and flexible query language that lets you request exactly the data you need, without over-fetching or under-fetching. NerdGraph calls get all the data you need in a single request. NerdGraph also makes it easier to evolve APIs over time and enables powerful developer tools. You can use our NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer to explore the schema and find definitions. With valid New Relic API key, you can try it out yourself at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Nerdlet A Nerdlet is a component of a New Relic One application. It's a specific UI view, represented by a React JavaScript package. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. Nerdpack A Nerdpack is a component of a New Relic One application. It's the package containing all the files needed by that application. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. New Relic Edge with Infinite Tracing New Relic Edge with Infinite Tracing is a fully managed, distributed tracing service that observes 100% of your application traces, then provides actionable data so you can solve issues faster. For more information, see /docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/get-started/how-new-relic-distributed-tracing-works. New Relic One For more information, see Introduction to New Relic One. New Relic One catalog Our catalog is a collection of applications built on the New Relic One platform. The catalog includes custom apps we've built, public open source apps, and any apps that you buid. You can browse the catalog on New Relic One. NRQL (New Relic query language) NRQL is a query language, similar in form to SQL, that allows you to query the data stored in your New Relic account. non-web transaction APM identifies transactions as either web or non-web. When New Relic does not detect a transaction was initiated by a web request, this is called a non-web transaction. For more information, see Background processes and other non-web transactions. notification The message sent when an incident opens, is acknowledged, or closes. The type of notification is defined by the alert policy's notification channel. For an explanation of how notifications relate to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. notification channel Where we send a notification when an incident opens, is acknowledged, or closes. Available channels include email, mobile push notifications, webhooks, and more. on-host integration On-host integrations refer to integrations that reside on your own servers or hosts and that communicate with our infrastructure agent. For more information, see Introduction to on-host integrations. owner For accounts on our original pricing model, this is a type of user role: the user who initially created the account. For more information, see Users. page load timing With page load timing, New Relic monitors the full load time for end-user browsers. New Relic's application agents dynamically inject JavaScript into the page, then capture the following key load points: Navigation start: The user initiates the transaction. First byte: The browser receives the requested page. DOM ready: The browser has finished parsing DOM. Page ready: Page loading is complete. Page load timing is sometimes referred to as RUM, or real user monitoring. Unlike standard RUM, page load timing also captures JavaScript errors and AJAX requests. For more information, see Page load timing process. parameter Deprecated term; see attribute. parent account New Relic organizations can have a parent/child account structure. This structure was much more important for organizations on our original user model, but is still used for some features for organizations on the New Relic One user model. Learn more about account structure. Parent accounts were previously referred to as \"master accounts\", and child accounts were previously referred to as \"sub-accounts\". permalink A unique URL that links to a view of your application at a specific point in time. Permalinks are useful for troubleshooting and for sharing interesting time windows with colleagues. pinger The component of New Relic that connects to your website to verify your website is accessible. New Relic has pingers in Europe, Asia, and the United States. Each pinger attempts to contact your website at least once every two minutes. If enough pingers are unable to reach your website, your application will be considered down. For in-depth scriptable testing, including real browser tests and tests of API endpoints, see Synthetic Monitoring. Synthetic Monitoring includes free ping monitoring, which allows you to monitor your website from locations around the world. For more information, see Types of Synthetic monitors. polling interval (AWS) Our Amazon integrations query your AWS services according to a polling interval, which varies depending on the integration. Each polling interval occurs for every AWS entity. For example, if you have thirteen Elastic Load Balancers (ELB), each one will be polled every five minutes. Depending on the AWS integration, there may be delays in the timing between the API request and the metric data returned. If you notice unusual delays, follow the integration troubleshooting procedures. PPM (pages per minute) The number of pages per minute your application serves. private location A Synthetic monitor feature that allows you to run Synthetic monitors from within your own systems by creating private minions. Private locations allow you to extend your Synthetic coverage to new geographical locations, and to monitor websites behind your firewall such as an intranet site. For more information, see Private locations overview. recovery period A recovery period of time begins when a data source enters a non-violating state after being in a violating state. The recovery period is set in the condition's threshold. A violation will close when a source remains in a non-violating state and the recovery period time has elapsed. If the data source enters a violating state before the time has elapsed, the recovery period clock will reset and the violation won't close. response time The duration of time between a request for service and a response. For more information, see Response time. restricted user A type of user role on a New Relic account. For more information, see Users. rollup Using the same application name for multiple applications. This allows you to combine data in APM, either from multiple applications, or from multiple instances of an application. For more information, see Rolling up app data. root span For distributed tracing, the root span is the first span in a trace. In many cases, the root span duration will represent the duration of the entire trace, or be very close to it. However, for more complex, modern systems that use a lot of asynchronous, non-blocking processes, this will not be true. For those systems, the root span’s duration may be significantly less than the duration of the trace. RPM The term RPM usually refers to the number of requests per minute your application receives from users. This is usually the same as CPM (calls per minute). Historically, some New Relic monitoring solutions, like APM and Browser Monitoring, used to contain RPM in the URL; for example, https://rpm.newrelic.com. This language use originally referred to Rails performance management because the first iteration of our product monitored Ruby on Rails applications. We monitor many more languages and systems than Ruby now. RUM (real user monitoring) See page load timing. runbook A runbook contains standard procedures and operations typically used by system administrators, network operations staff, and other personnel to handle outages, alert incidents, and other situations. If your organization stores runbook instructions as URLs, you can link this information to an alerts policy so your personnel has easy access to this information when an incident violates the defined policy thresholds. SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) SAML is an XML-based data format for sharing authentication data between two parties. New Relic accounts must obtain a SAML certificate in order to enable Single Sign On for their users. For more information, see SAML service providers. Selenium Selenium is an open-source browser testing suite. Synthetics uses Selenium to test monitored websites with real browsers. For more information, see monitor types. service A service is a cluster of runtime server processes that accomplish a particular task, usually service requests. Unlike an application, a service is not usually invoked by a human. New Relic offers a variety of integrations that allow you to report data from your services. signal The stream of telemetry data that's watched and alerted on. You use NRQL queries to define a signal. signal filter When we receive data and it's routed to the streaming alerts platform, your NRQL WHERE clause will filter the data coming in. The filtered streaming data is what's evaluated for loss of signal violations, for example. span In a distributed trace, a span is a \"named, timed operation representing a contiguous segment of work in that trace\" (from OpenTracing.io definition). For distributed tracing, spans are displayed in the distributed tracing UI, and the data type Span is available to be queried. See also root span. SSL certificate SSL certificates encrypt data that is being transmitted. While New Relic refers to security certificates as SSL because it is a more commonly used term, all certificates adhere to industry standards for secure encryption in transit. SSO (single sign on) SSO (single sign on) allows you to manage user authentication in New Relic using an external SSO provider. For more information, see Setting up SSO. streaming algorithm This is what determines when the data in an aggregation window is processed. The streaming algorithm uses your server's clock time and the aggregation window size to trigger the alert evaluation process. sub-accounts See master account. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic monitoring allows you to monitor your website or API endpoint via automated, scriptable tools. Use free ping monitor to ensure your website is accessible, or expand your monitoring with browser monitors, which test your website with real browsers. Go further with scripting, to script browsers or API monitors for sophisticated testing. target A target is a resource or component monitored by a New Relic monitoring tool that has been identified in an alert condition. When the data source for that target crosses the defined critical threshold, we will open a violation. Depending on your policy's Incident preference setting, Alerts may create an incident record and send notifications through the defined channels. See also entity. tag Tags are key:value metadata added to monitored apps, hosts, dashboards, and other entities to help you organize your data at a high level. For details, see Tags. thresholds Thresholds are alert condition settings that define a violation. Threshold values include the value a data source must pass to trigger a violation and the time-related settings that define a violation; for example: Passing a certain value for at least x minutes Passing a certain value only once in x minutes While the data source passes a certain value, a degradation period starts. Likewise, when that data source stops passing a certain value, a recovery period starts. The durations of these two time periods are defined in the alert condition threshold settings. Thresholds have a required critical (red) threshold and an optional warning (yellow) threshold. In the UI, the entity's health status indicator will change to yellow or red when a threshold has been crossed and a violation will open. For more information, see Define thresholds. For an explanation of how thresholds relate to other basic Alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. throughput Throughput is a measurement of user activity for a monitored application. APM throughput and Browser Monitoring throughput are measured in different ways: APM: requests per minute (RPM) Browser: page views per minute (PPM) tier A tier can refer to how New Relic categorizes or visualizes the various agent language ecosystems that we support. For example: In APM, the color-coded categories that appear on your app's main Overview chart show response time spent in various functions, processes, or agents as tiers; for example, request queuing, garbage collection, Middleware, JVMs, etc. In New Relic labels, TIER can be used to define or classify the client-server architecture; for example, front-end and back-end tiers. \"Tier\" may sometimes be used to refer to our pricing editions. time picker By default the New Relic UI shows data for the past 30 minutes, ending now. To change the time window, use the time picker. time range A time range can refer to a length of time selected in the New Relic UI. New Relic displays a time range depending on the range you select using the time picker. timeslice data See metric timeslice data. trace A trace is a description of how a request travels through a system. Trace data helps you understand the performance of your system and diagnose problems. For more information on how we use trace data, see New Relic data types. traffic light See health status. transaction A transaction is defined as one logical unit of work in an application. This term primarily refers to server-side transactions monitored by APM. For more information, see documentation about web transactions and non-web transactions. The term transaction is also sometimes used in Browser Monitoring. In that case, it primarily refers to activity beginning with a browser-side web request and ending with a complete page load. transaction trace A transaction trace is a complete picture of a single transaction, down to the database queries and exact invocation patterns. With transaction traces, New Relic gives you much deeper visibility into a single slow transaction, which can help you understand a broader problem. For more information, see Transaction traces. UI The New Relic user interface. For more information, see Standard page functions. user A user can refer to a specific user role in a New Relic account. For more information, see Users. UTC Universal Time Coordinated (UTC), or Coordinated Universal Time, is a standard timestamp for synchronizing time around the world. value function (metrics) The numeric value obtained from metric timeslice data; for example, an average, minimum, maximum, total, sample size, etc. violation A violation occurs when the entity monitored by an alert condition reports a value that crosses the thresholds defined in that condition. For an explanation of how violations relate to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. You can view a summary of the violations for a selected incident's page. You can also view the violations for a specific entity from the product's UI. web external Web external is the term applied to the portion of time spent in transactions to external applications from within the code of the application you are monitoring. That time can be a call to a third party company (a payment provider, for example) or it could be a call to another microservice within your own company. Web external demonstrates how performance is impacted by your code executing outside the application you are measuring. web transaction A transaction is defined as one logical unit of work in an application. This term primarily refers to server-side transactions monitored by APM. Web transactions are initiated with an HTTP request. For most organizations, these represent customer-centric interactions and thus are the most important transactions to monitor. For more information, see Web transactions and Non-web transactions. WebDriverJS WebDriver is a Selenium component, used to control Synthetics scripted browsers. Specifically, Synthetics uses WebDriverJS, a Node.js-based flavor of Selenium. For more information, see Writing scripted browsers and Scripted browser examples. workload A workload represents a group of entities that work together to provide a digital service. For more information, see Workloads.",

      "body": "New Relic's global data hosting structure consists of two regions: the European Union (EU) region and the United States (US) region. Selecting your preferred region during the account setup process allows you to specify the region where your performance monitoring data will be hosted. You can also create accounts in each region. Requirements Access to the New Relic EU region requires the latest agent version. For new customers: Install the most recent agent version. For existing customers: Update to the most recent agent version. Minimum agent version required: C SDK 1.0.0 or higher Go 2.0.0 or higher Java 4.0.0 or higher .NET 8.0.0 or higher Node.js 3.0.0 or higher PHP 8.0.0.204 or higher Python 3.0.0.89 or higher Ruby 5.0.0.342 or higher Regions and availability Your choice of data center is not limited by your geographic location. You can choose to create an account with data hosted in either the EU or US region, regardless of where you or your systems reside. You can also create accounts in each region. New Relic offers almost all the same active products, features, support offerings, and performance levels in the EU region as what is offered in the US region. Exceptions: The following are not supported with an EU region account: Infinite Tracing is not available. APM's weekly performance reports are not available. Errors inbox is not available. Log patterns Deprecated products and features are not available. New Relic's Incident Intelligence service operates solely in the US whether you store your data in New Relic’s US region data center or New Relic’s EU region data center, by using New Relic Incident Intelligence, you consent that New Relic may move and store your data in the US region. New Relic CodeStream operates solely in the US. Whether you have selected New Relic's US or EU region data center during setup of your New Relic account, when using New Relic CodeStream, you consent that your New Relic CodeStream data will get stored in the US. Regions and account hierarchy You can create accounts in each region. If your data is currently being hosted in the US region, you must create a new account to store data in the EU region. You cannot view EU data from a US account, or US data from an EU account. The data collected remains separate. The data cannot be aggregated or migrated between accounts. For organizations that have a parent/child account structure, you can only have one parent account. For more, see Manage apps or users with child accounts. For partnership accounts, no changes to the partnership owner account are required. However, data cannot be shared across regions, so a partnership requires a parent account for each region. Hierarchy example for partnership accounts With partnership accounts, a new parent account must be created for any data to be host in the EU region. This hierarchy illustrates how global accounts are structured with partnership owner accounts. Data is not aggregated beyond the parent account. Example hierarchy for partnership organizations. Because data cannot be shared across regions, a partnership will require a parent account for each region. Create an EU region account To create a New Relic account in the EU region: Go to the New Relic signup page. OR If you have a specific offer from a New Relic partner, follow that link directly. Follow the online steps to create your account. From the Select your region dropdown, select European Union. Agree to the Terms of Service. When you receive an email confirmation message, select the link to confirm your account and sign in to New Relic. Then install or update to the most recent agent version. API endpoints for EU region accounts If you have an EU region account, use the appropriate endpoints to access the following New Relic APIs: API EU endpoint Browser source maps API sourcemaps.service. eu .newrelic.com Copy Infrastructure Alert API infra-api. eu .newrelic.com Copy Dashboard API rpm. eu .newrelic.com/api/explore/dashboards/list Copy Insert API insights-collector. eu01 .nr-data.net Copy Insights Query API insights-api. eu .newrelic.com Copy Mobile apps rpm. eu .newrelic.com/mobile Copy NerdGraph GraphiQL API api. eu .newrelic.com/graphiql Copy Partner API The partner API is a global API with no regional data differences. Use this endpoint for both EU and US accounts: rpm.newrelic.com/api/v2/partners/ Copy REST API api. eu .newrelic.com Copy Synthetics API synthetics. eu .newrelic.com/synthetics/api Copy Trace API trace-api. eu .newrelic.com/trace/v1 Copy Metric API metric-api. eu .newrelic.com/metric/v1 Copy Log API log-api. eu .newrelic.com/log/v1 Copy Access New Relic One If your accounts report data to the EU data center, use the following link to go to New Relic One: one.eu.newrelic.com. Billing and pricing New Relic's account billing process and pricing options are the same for both the EU and US regions. Operational access and processing Customer Data is hosted in the region selected during account creation. Systems Operations Data is stored in the US region. All other information, including account information (such as license subscription information, billing, and internal monitoring) is hosted in the US region and replicated in the EU region. New Relic may access and process Customer Data in the United States and such other jurisdictions where New Relic has affiliates and subsidiaries, including as may be necessary to maintain, secure, or perform the services, to provide technical support, or as necessary to comply with law or a binding order of a government body. Customer Data from existing New Relic accounts cannot be transferred or shared across regions, and new data generated cannot be shared with existing accounts, even in partnership accounts. Verify your account is based in EU region Use either of these options to verify whether your account data is hosted in the EU region's data center: In APM, mouse over the application name to view the URL. If it begins with rpm.eu.newrelic.com/, it is an EU-based account. Check your New Relic license key. If it begins with EU, it is an EU-based account.",

      "body": "In the software industry, a tag typically refers to a piece of metadata added to a data set for the purpose of improving data organization and findability. At New Relic, our tags are key:value pairs (like team: operations) added to various sets of data, like monitored apps and hosts, agents, dashboards, and workloads. We make some important attributes available as tags (for example, app metadata like app name and language, and host metadata like host name and AWS region). You can also add your own custom tags. You can use tags in the UI to filter down to relevant data. Here is an example: Here you can see an accountId tag being used to filter workloads to a specific account. Tags help you to: Organize data coming from a large number of sources and/or to a large number of New Relic accounts. Identify teams, roles, environments, or regions to know who’s responsible for what (see example use cases). Better organize and search dashboards and workloads. Query and chart APM data. Tags are useful for organizing data at a high level. If you want to add more fine-grained detail, like capturing user names or other high-cardinality values, custom attributes or custom events are a better solution. Tip Tags were previously called labels in the New Relic UI. You may sometimes see labelin our code; for example, some of our APM agent config files use a label config option for tags. Tag format and limits Format requirements and limits for tags: The UI has limits on the total number of tags it can display per entity: Limit of 100 for tags reported by default or added via agent/integration configuration. Limit of 100 for custom tags added via UI or API. The following are maximum character length for tags: Key: 128 characters Value: 256 characters Allowed characters: Characters must be UTF-8. When using NerdGraph to add tags, a dash (-) in a tag key is interpreted as a minus symbol. If your tag key has a dash, use back ticks around it (like `key-name`). Best practices and tips Before adding tags, we recommend first seeing how our default tags work for you. When you're ready to add your own tags, review the following best practices tips to get the most out of them. Tips on keeping tags simple: Start by adding only tags you know you’ll definitely use. Unused tags create noise and may add confusion. Try to use short tags. Shorter tags are easier to parse, and also the UI may sometimes truncate longer tags. (See character limits.) When possible, use keys and values that are human-readable (for example, region: EMEA is better than Param8323 : 1229072). Avoid including several values like regions: EMEA | US | LATAM in a single tag. We recommend using three different tags for that, like region: emea, region: us, and region: latam. If you want to match multiple tags, you can do that using the advanced options in the filter UI. Tips on using tags consistently: Try to be consistent with tag language across your teams and entities. Be consistent with naming. For example, avoid using both region: emea and reg: emea. Be consistent with format. For example, avoid using both camelCase and kebab-case. Although tag searching is not case-sensitive in the UI and API, try to be consistent with capitalization. For example, avoid using both env: staging and env: Staging. Tips on cross-team implementation: Tags help improve observability and cost allocation. For this reason, responsibility for tag implementation is often assigned to an observability team, SREs, a group of architects, or a cross-team task force. We recommend the people responsible for implementing tags meet and create an internal policy to describe how the tags are defined and which conventions are to be used. Then: Keep this reference manual up to date. Automate the definition of tags when you deploy New Relic agents, at the cloud provider, or through New Relic automation tools, such as the API or Terraform. Create recurring reports that identify entities that are non-compliant with your tagging standards. Tag examples Here are some examples of common ways to use tags to organize data: Team-related tags Creating tags for team names can be helpful to understand which team, group, department, or region was responsible for a change that led to a performance issue. Team examples: team: backend team: frontend team: db Role examples: roles: architecture roles: devops roles: pm Region examples: region: emea region: america region: asia Environment-related tags You can create entities for the environment they belong to. Examples: env: production env: qa env: development env: staging Criticality-related tags You can create tags related to criticality levels, which lets you easier track the most critical issues. Examples: layer: level1 layer: level2 layer: level3 How tags are added Some important attributes, by default, are available for use as tags. For example, the account name, the account ID, and some basic host/server metadata are available as default tags. You can't remove these available-by-default tags. Here are some details about how tags are added for some specific data sources: Add tags via UI or API When you add tags via the UI or API, this occurs at the entity level. This means that, for example, if you have multiple APM agents monitoring a single entity and apply a tag via the UI, that tag is available for all data coming from that entity. To add or delete tags via the UI: Select a monitored entity, like a monitored app or host. Near the entity’s name at the top of the page, select the See metadata and manage tags menu. In the menu that pops up, add or delete a tag. For APM agents, restart your service. To manage tags via API: see our NerdGraph tagging docs. For a guide to using our CLI to automate tagging, see our developer site. APM agent tags You can add tags via the UI and API or you can add tags using APM agent configuration, both methods require you to restart your service. There are differences in how these apply tags: Via agent config: These tags are applied at the agent-level, not the entity/application level. This would be a good option if you have multiple agents monitoring different aspects of the same app (for example, a blue-green deployment model). Via the UI or API: These tags are applied at the entity/application level. Here are links to the agent configuration options: C SDK: not available Java Go .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby For information on querying APM tags, see Query APM tags. And check out this short video on querying APM tags (3:20 minutes). Infrastructure data tags There are several ways tags are added to infrastructure entities and services: Use the UI or API to add tags at the entity level. Infrastructure agent: some attributes are available by default as tags. You can also add custom attributes, which are also available as tags in the UI. On-host integrations: some attributes are available by default as tags. You can also add tags by using integration-specific labels config options (for an example, see the labels config for the Apache integration). Cloud service integrations: by default we report tags and labels that are defined in the cloud service. To add tags, you'd add them on the cloud-service-side. Automate tags with our CLI For a guide to automating tags using our CLI tool, see our developer site. Use tags to filter the UI Use the filter field at the top of the New Relic Explorer to filter down to the entities you care about. You can use multiple filter conditions. To filter down to certain entities using tags: From one.newrelic.com, click Explorer. Click the Filter by... field to see a dropdown of available attributes and tags. You can filter by multiple elements and use advanced search options. To find an entity’s metadata and tags from the UI, here are two options: From a list of entities in the UI, at the far right, select an entity's icon. OR Select an entity. Near the top of the page, select the icon. To use the API to view tags, see our NerdGraph docs. Learn about how to use tags with dashboards and how to use tags with workloads. Custom queries, charts, and alerts Different features handle tags differently. Here are some details about how you can use NRQL to query tag data, or create NRQL condition alerts. Query and alert on APM tags You can query APM tags using NRQL. Minimum agent versions: C: not available Go: 2.3.0 Java: 4.9.0 .NET: 8.17 Node: v4.13.0 PHP: not available Python: v4.10.0.112 Ruby: 6.1.0.352 Here are some query examples: Throughput across shards Given a service that is distributed across nine shards, each shard assigned as an environment, we can plot the transaction throughput on all shards using a wildcard query like: SELECT rate(count(apm.service.transaction.duration), 1 minute) FROM Metric WHERE appName LIKE 'MyApp (%' AND transactionType = 'Other' FACET tags.Environment TIMESERIES Copy Transactions per team To see the number of transactions per service for a specific team, we might use a query like: FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) WHERE tags.Team = 'team-a' FACET tags.Project TIMESERIES Copy Alert on error rate for teams You can use a query for your services’ error rate for setting an alert without having to create a rule for each service. Here is the error rate for all services on a team called team-b. And this alert will automatically monitor any new app names added with the team tag. FROM Metric SELECT count(apm.service.error.count) / count(apm.service.transaction.duration) WHERE tags.Team = 'team-b' FACET appName Copy Related to this, you might create a general rule for a specific service deployed across several environments, so that we have an alarm for a single service monitoring each environment individually: From Metric SELECT count(apm.service.error.count) / count(apm.service.transaction.duration) WHERE tags.Project = 'MyProject' FACET tags.Environment Copy Query and alert on attributes As explained in the tag sources information, some important attributes are used as tags. You can query all attributes and create custom charts using NRQL, and create NRQL alert conditions.",

      "body": "Our workloads feature gives you the ability to group and monitor entities based on a team or a set of responsibilities, providing aggregated health and activity data from frontend to backend services across your entire stack. Workloads help you understand the status of complex systems, detect issues, understand the cause and impact of an incident, and resolve those issues quickly. Want to try it? Create a New Relic account for free! No credit card required. What is a workload in New Relic? New Relic monitors a wide range of entities and data, from client-side applications and backend APIs, to the underlying infrastructure. To make sense of this large data set, we give you the ability to create and monitor workloads. Workloads give you the ability to group and monitor entities based on a team or a set of responsibilities, and provide an aggregated view of the health and activity of the entities in the workload. Thus, you can understand better how your business logic is working, from frontend to backend services, across your entire stack. Here are some workload examples: A serverless application that includes an API gateway, a few serverless functions, and a managed database and storage. A browser application and the backend APIs that support it. A collection of Java microservices and the infrastructure they run on. Here's a workload: one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Workloads > (selected workload): The workloads UI provides a curated view of how the entities in your workload are performing. The charts you see will depend on the types of entities you've included to the workload. Tip Learn how to use workloads. Why it matters Workloads give you visibility into the end-to-end availability and consumption of resources across an entire service, and provide you a way to define what’s relevant to you. You can use workloads to group together entities that are important to a specific team or project, so you can better browse and isolate the most relevant data for that service. Because our UI gives you cross-account access, you can add entities to your workload from any of the accounts you have access to. A workload can include: Any New Relic-monitored entity, including services, browser apps, mobile apps, databases, and hosts. Dashboards. Other workloads: this is useful for complex teams who need to divide and overlap workloads. Requirements Requirements for creating and managing workloads: All users for an account can view that account's workloads. To create, edit, and delete workloads, you must have a user role with that permission. Impact of accounts on the workload permissions and content Workloads can group and display entities from multiple accounts to provide complete observability of complex systems. When creating a workload, you must set: The workload account Scope accounts Learn how to find a New Relic account ID. Workload account The workload account is where any workload-specific data is stored. For example, a workload might generate NrAuditEvent data, and you would find that data by querying the workload account. The workload account determines the user permissions that govern which users can see and manage the workload, through the account roles. Once created, the workload account can’t be changed. Scope accounts Scope accounts are the accounts from which a workload fetches entity data. In other words, the scope accounts provide the content for a workload. Users who don’t have access to all of a workload's scope accounts may not be able to see complete workload data. Scope accounts can be updated at any point in time by any user with workload management capabilities on the workload account. By default, all accounts that the workload creator has access to at the moment of the workload creation are set as scope accounts.",

      "body": "The workload status, which is derived from the alerting status of the entities in your workload, informs you about how your workload is behaving. Why it matters Workload status: Is a quick indicator of how your system is doing, and tells you if you need to take action on any of your workloads in just a glance. Adapts to your needs and to how important each entity is. Allows you to share the status of your workloads. Other teams that depend on your services or infrastructure can learn the status of the workload without them needing to understand your system’s architecture details, or look at custom dashboards. Get started with workload status New Relic One provides a status value for all entities, which is based on the results of New Relic alerts. You can check the color-coded alert status for each entity on the New Relic Explorer, or consume the alert status value through the API. For example, you may see a red alert status indicating that a critical violation is in progress. With Workloads you can group entities that are part of a complex system and obtain a single, global value that summarizes the status of all the entities in your workload. Thus, you can quickly detect when the workload stops being operational, or anticipate any potential incident or loss of quality of service. Obtain your workload status A workload can have one of the following status values: Operational: The workload is working fine. Degraded: The workload is showing some degradation in performance or errors, but it’s still providing an acceptable level of service, and you don’t need to take any urgent action. Critical or Disrupted: The workload is not providing an acceptable level of service, and you need to take urgent action. Unknown: You haven’t configured how to calculate workload status, or there aren’t any alert conditions set up that can determine the status of the workload entities. To learn how to define or edit the workload status, refer to Workload status configuration. Save views with sets of workloads If you usually need to see the status of a certain group of workloads, you can save views that contain only those workloads. The tile view mode helps you quickly find your workloads and see their status at a glance. To create a view, follow these steps: Go to one.newrelic.com and click on More > Workload views. Click on Add view. Give the view a meaningful name (such as the name of a team or business unit), and select an account to associate the view with. Select the workloads you want to include in the view, by their name or tags. Save the new view. Status views are most useful for teams that are accountable for more than one workload, support roles, and business unit managers. Get notified when the workload status changes You may need to follow the status of a workload, either because it represents the services your team is accountable for, or because your own services depend on that workload, which is managed by another team. The status of all workloads is calculated regularly and the result is stored in NRDB through a WorkloadStatus event. This allows you to set up an alert condition to notify you whenever the Workload goes into a Disrupted or Degraded status. To set up the alert condition follow these steps: Go to one.newrelic.com and select Alerts & AI. Select the policy where you want to add the new alert condition, or create a new policy with the appropriate notification channel. Then click on Create a condition. Where prompted to Select a product, click NRQL. Add the following NRQL query: SELECT latest(statusValueCode) FROM WorkloadStatus WHERE workloadGuid = '<GUID>' FACET workloadGuid as 'entity.guid', entity.name Copy You can obtain the workload GUID by clicking on the See metadata and manage tags on the workload UI. Write the WHERE clause so the alert condition applies to just one workload (as in the example) or more than one. Or remove the WHERE clause if you want the alert condition to apply to all the workloads on the account. By adding the FACET you can use these fields on the alert description, as explained below. Set one of the following static thresholds: (Recommended) Critical when the query returns a value equal to 3 for at least 1 minute, if you want to be notified when the workload status is disrupted. Critical when the query returns a value equal to 2 for at least 1 minute, if you want to be notified when the workload status is degraded. Remember that a warning threshold doesn't generate an incident or send a notification. As a result, you need to create two alert conditions with a critical threshold (as explained above) if you want to be notified of any status change. Complete the alert condition: Set a violation time limit, to automatically force-close a long-lasting violation after the selected amount of time you select. Choose to fill data gaps with last known value. Optionally, you can also add a custom violation description that includes the workload name and permanent link to the UI in the alert notification: Workload: {{tag.entity.name}} Direct link: https://one.newrelic.com/redirect/entity/{{tag.entity.guid}} Copy",

When you're ready to add your own tags, review the following best practices tips to get the most out of them. Tips on keeping tags simple: Start by adding only tags you know you’ll definitely use. Unused tags create noise and may add confusion. Try to use short tags. Shorter tags are easier to parse, and also the UI may sometimes truncate longer tags. (See character limits.) When possible, use keys and values that are human-readable (for example, region: EMEA is better than Param8323 : 1229072). Avoid including several values like regions: EMEA | US | LATAM in a single tag. We recommend using three different tags for that, like region: emea, region: us, and region: latam. If you want to match multiple tags, you can do that using the advanced options in the filter UI. Tips on using tags consistently: Try to be consistent with tag language across your teams and entities. Be consistent with naming. For example, avoid using both region: emea and reg: emea. Be consistent with format. For example, avoid using both camelCase and kebab-case. Although tag searching is not case-sensitive in the UI and API, try to be consistent with capitalization. For example, avoid using both env: staging and env: Staging. Tips on cross-team implementation: Tags help improve observability and cost allocation. For this reason, responsibility for tag implementation is often assigned to an observability team, SREs, a group of architects, or a cross-team task force. We recommend the people responsible for implementing tags meet and create an internal policy to describe how the tags are defined and which conventions are to be used. Then: Keep this reference manual up to date. Automate the definition of tags when you deploy New Relic agents, at the cloud provider, or through New Relic automation tools, such as the API or Terraform. Create recurring reports that identify entities that are non-compliant with your tagging standards. Tag examples Here are some examples of common ways to use tags to organize data: Team-related tags Creating tags for team names can be helpful to understand which team, group, department, or region was responsible for a change that led to a performance issue. Team examples: team: backend team: frontend team: db Role examples: roles: architecture roles: devops roles: pm Region examples: region: emea region: america region: asia Environment-related tags You can create entities for the environment they belong to. Examples: env: production env: qa env: development env: staging Criticality-related tags You can create tags related to criticality levels, which lets you easier track the most critical issues. Examples: layer: level1 layer: level2 layer: level3 How tags are added Some important attributes, by default, are available for use as tags. For example, the account name, the account ID, and some basic host/server metadata are available as default tags. You can't remove these available-by-default tags. Here are some details about how tags are added for some specific data sources: Add tags via UI or API When you add tags via the UI or API, this occurs at the entity level. This means that, for example, if you have multiple APM agents monitoring a single entity and apply a tag via the UI, that tag is available for all data coming from that entity. To add or delete tags via the UI: Select a monitored entity, like a monitored app or host. Near the entity’s name at the top of the page, select the See metadata and manage tags menu. In the menu that pops up, add or delete a tag. For APM agents, restart your service. To manage tags via API: see our NerdGraph tagging docs. For a guide to using our CLI to automate tagging, see our developer site. APM agent tags You can add tags via the UI and API or you can add tags using APM agent configuration, both methods require you to restart your service. There are differences in how these apply tags: Via agent config: These tags are applied at the agent-level, not the entity/application level. This would be a good option if you have multiple agents monitoring different aspects of the same app (for example, a blue-green deployment model). Via the UI or API: These tags are applied at the entity/application level. Here are links to the agent configuration options: C SDK: not available Java Go .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby For information on querying APM tags, see Query APM tags. And check out this short video on querying APM tags (3:20 minutes). Infrastructure data tags There are several ways tags are added to infrastructure entities and services: Use the UI or API to add tags at the entity level. Infrastructure agent: some attributes are available by default as tags. You can also add custom attributes, which are also available as tags in the UI. On-host integrations: some attributes are available by default as tags. You can also add tags by using integration-specific labels config options (for an example, see the labels config for the Apache integration). Cloud service integrations: by default we report tags and labels that are defined in the cloud service. To add tags, you'd add them on the cloud-service-side. Automate tags with our CLI For a guide to automating tags using our CLI tool, see our developer site. Use tags to filter the UI Use the filter field at the top of the New Relic Explorer to filter down to the entities you care about. You can use multiple filter conditions. To filter down to certain entities using tags: From one.newrelic.com, click Explorer. Click the Filter by... field to see a dropdown of available attributes and tags. You can filter by multiple elements and use advanced search options. To find an entity’s metadata and tags from the UI, here are two options: From a list of entities in the UI, at the far right, select an entity's icon. OR Select an entity. Near the top of the page, select the icon. To use the API to view tags, see our NerdGraph docs. Learn about how to use tags with dashboards and how to use tags with workloads. Custom queries, charts, and alerts Different features handle tags differently. Here are some details about how you can use NRQL to query tag data, or create NRQL condition alerts. Query and alert on APM tags You can query APM tags using NRQL. Minimum agent versions: C: not available Go: 2.3.0 Java: 4.9.0 .NET: 8.17 Node: v4.13.0 PHP: not available Python: v4.10.0.112 Ruby: 6.1.0.352 Here are some query examples: Throughput across shards Given a service that is distributed across nine shards, each shard assigned as an environment, we can plot the transaction throughput on all shards using a wildcard query like: SELECT rate(count(apm.service.transaction.duration), 1 minute) FROM Metric WHERE appName LIKE 'MyApp (%' AND transactionType = 'Other' FACET tags.Environment TIMESERIES Copy Transactions per team To see the number of transactions per service for a specific team, we might use a query like: FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) WHERE tags.Team = 'team-a' FACET tags.Project TIMESERIES Copy Alert on error rate for teams You can use a query for your services’ error rate for setting an alert without having to create a rule for each service. Here is the error rate for all services on a team called team-b. And this alert will automatically monitor any new app names added with the team tag. FROM Metric SELECT count(apm.service.error.count) / count(apm.service.transaction.duration) WHERE tags.Team = 'team-b' FACET appName Copy Related to this, you might create a general rule for a specific service deployed across several environments, so that we have an alarm for a single service monitoring each environment individually: From Metric SELECT count(apm.service.error.count) / count(apm.service.transaction.duration) WHERE tags.Project = 'MyProject' FACET tags.Environment Copy Query and alert on attributes As explained in the tag sources information, some important attributes are used as tags. You can query all attributes and create custom charts using NRQL, and create NRQL alert conditions.",

      "body": "Our workloads feature gives you the ability to group and monitor entities based on a team or a set of responsibilities, providing aggregated health and activity data from frontend to backend services across your entire stack. Workloads help you understand the status of complex systems, detect issues, understand the cause and impact of an incident, and resolve those issues quickly. Want to try it? Create a New Relic account for free! No credit card required. What is a workload in New Relic? New Relic monitors a wide range of entities and data, from client-side applications and backend APIs, to the underlying infrastructure. To make sense of this large data set, we give you the ability to create and monitor workloads. Workloads give you the ability to group and monitor entities based on a team or a set of responsibilities, and provide an aggregated view of the health and activity of the entities in the workload. Thus, you can understand better how your business logic is working, from frontend to backend services, across your entire stack. Here are some workload examples: A serverless application that includes an API gateway, a few serverless functions, and a managed database and storage. A browser application and the backend APIs that support it. A collection of Java microservices and the infrastructure they run on. Here's a workload: one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Workloads > (selected workload): The workloads UI provides a curated view of how the entities in your workload are performing. The charts you see will depend on the types of entities you've included to the workload. Tip Learn how to use workloads. Why it matters Workloads give you visibility into the end-to-end availability and consumption of resources across an entire service, and provide you a way to define what’s relevant to you. You can use workloads to group together entities that are important to a specific team or project, so you can better browse and isolate the most relevant data for that service. Because our UI gives you cross-account access, you can add entities to your workload from any of the accounts you have access to. A workload can include: Any New Relic-monitored entity, including services, browser apps, mobile apps, databases, and hosts. Dashboards. Other workloads: this is useful for complex teams who need to divide and overlap workloads. Requirements Requirements for creating and managing workloads: All users for an account can view that account's workloads. To create, edit, and delete workloads, you must have a user role with that permission. Impact of accounts on the workload permissions and content Workloads can group and display entities from multiple accounts to provide complete observability of complex systems. When creating a workload, you must set: The workload account Scope accounts Learn how to find a New Relic account ID. Workload account The workload account is where any workload-specific data is stored. For example, a workload might generate NrAuditEvent data, and you would find that data by querying the workload account. The workload account determines the user permissions that govern which users can see and manage the workload, through the account roles. Once created, the workload account can’t be changed. Scope accounts Scope accounts are the accounts from which a workload fetches entity data. In other words, the scope accounts provide the content for a workload. Users who don’t have access to all of a workload's scope accounts may not be able to see complete workload data. Scope accounts can be updated at any point in time by any user with workload management capabilities on the workload account. By default, all accounts that the workload creator has access to at the moment of the workload creation are set as scope accounts.",

      "body": "The workload status, which is derived from the alerting status of the entities in your workload, informs you about how your workload is behaving. Why it matters Workload status: Is a quick indicator of how your system is doing, and tells you if you need to take action on any of your workloads in just a glance. Adapts to your needs and to how important each entity is. Allows you to share the status of your workloads. Other teams that depend on your services or infrastructure can learn the status of the workload without them needing to understand your system’s architecture details, or look at custom dashboards. Get started with workload status New Relic One provides a status value for all entities, which is based on the results of New Relic alerts. You can check the color-coded alert status for each entity on the New Relic Explorer, or consume the alert status value through the API. For example, you may see a red alert status indicating that a critical violation is in progress. With Workloads you can group entities that are part of a complex system and obtain a single, global value that summarizes the status of all the entities in your workload. Thus, you can quickly detect when the workload stops being operational, or anticipate any potential incident or loss of quality of service. Obtain your workload status A workload can have one of the following status values: Operational: The workload is working fine. Degraded: The workload is showing some degradation in performance or errors, but it’s still providing an acceptable level of service, and you don’t need to take any urgent action. Critical or Disrupted: The workload is not providing an acceptable level of service, and you need to take urgent action. Unknown: You haven’t configured how to calculate workload status, or there aren’t any alert conditions set up that can determine the status of the workload entities. To learn how to define or edit the workload status, refer to Workload status configuration. Save views with sets of workloads If you usually need to see the status of a certain group of workloads, you can save views that contain only those workloads. The tile view mode helps you quickly find your workloads and see their status at a glance. To create a view, follow these steps: Go to one.newrelic.com and click on More > Workload views. Click on Add view. Give the view a meaningful name (such as the name of a team or business unit), and select an account to associate the view with. Select the workloads you want to include in the view, by their name or tags. Save the new view. Status views are most useful for teams that are accountable for more than one workload, support roles, and business unit managers. Get notified when the workload status changes You may need to follow the status of a workload, either because it represents the services your team is accountable for, or because your own services depend on that workload, which is managed by another team. The status of all workloads is calculated regularly and the result is stored in NRDB through a WorkloadStatus event. This allows you to set up an alert condition to notify you whenever the Workload goes into a Disrupted or Degraded status. To set up the alert condition follow these steps: Go to one.newrelic.com and select Alerts & AI. Select the policy where you want to add the new alert condition, or create a new policy with the appropriate notification channel. Then click on Create a condition. Where prompted to Select a product, click NRQL. Add the following NRQL query: SELECT latest(statusValueCode) FROM WorkloadStatus WHERE workloadGuid = '<GUID>' FACET workloadGuid as 'entity.guid', entity.name Copy You can obtain the workload GUID by clicking on the See metadata and manage tags on the workload UI. Write the WHERE clause so the alert condition applies to just one workload (as in the example) or more than one. Or remove the WHERE clause if you want the alert condition to apply to all the workloads on the account. By adding the FACET you can use these fields on the alert description, as explained below. Set one of the following static thresholds: (Recommended) Critical when the query returns a value equal to 3 for at least 1 minute, if you want to be notified when the workload status is disrupted. Critical when the query returns a value equal to 2 for at least 1 minute, if you want to be notified when the workload status is degraded. Remember that a warning threshold doesn't generate an incident or send a notification. As a result, you need to create two alert conditions with a critical threshold (as explained above) if you want to be notified of any status change. Complete the alert condition: Set a violation time limit, to automatically force-close a long-lasting violation after the selected amount of time you select. Choose to fill data gaps with last known value. Optionally, you can also add a custom violation description that includes the workload name and permanent link to the UI in the alert notification: Workload: {{tag.entity.name}} Direct link: https://one.newrelic.com/redirect/entity/{{tag.entity.guid}} Copy",

      "body": "In the software industry, a tag typically refers to a piece of metadata added to a data set for the purpose of improving data organization and findability. At New Relic, our tags are key:value pairs (like team: operations) added to various sets of data, like monitored apps and hosts, agents, dashboards, and workloads. We make some important attributes available as tags (for example, app metadata like app name and language, and host metadata like host name and AWS region). You can also add your own custom tags. You can use tags in the UI to filter down to relevant data. Here is an example: Here you can see an accountId tag being used to filter workloads to a specific account. Tags help you to: Organize data coming from a large number of sources and/or to a large number of New Relic accounts. Identify teams, roles, environments, or regions to know who’s responsible for what (see example use cases). Better organize and search dashboards and workloads. Query and chart APM data. Tags are useful for organizing data at a high level. If you want to add more fine-grained detail, like capturing user names or other high-cardinality values, custom attributes or custom events are a better solution. Tip Tags were previously called labels in the New Relic UI. You may sometimes see labelin our code; for example, some of our APM agent config files use a label config option for tags. Tag format and limits Format requirements and limits for tags: The UI has limits on the total number of tags it can display per entity: Limit of 100 for tags reported by default or added via agent/integration configuration. Limit of 100 for custom tags added via UI or API. The following are maximum character length for tags: Key: 128 characters Value: 256 characters Allowed characters: Characters must be UTF-8. When using NerdGraph to add tags, a dash (-) in a tag key is interpreted as a minus symbol. If your tag key has a dash, use back ticks around it (like `key-name`). Best practices and tips Before adding tags, we recommend first seeing how our default tags work for you.

When possible, use keys and values that are human-readable (for example, region: EMEA is better than Param8323 : 1229072). Avoid including several values like regions: EMEA | US | LATAM in a single tag. We recommend using three different tags for that, like region: emea, region: us, and region: latam. If you want to match multiple tags, you can do that using the advanced options in the filter UI. Tips on using tags consistently: Try to be consistent with tag language across your teams and entities. Be consistent with naming. For example, avoid using both region: emea and reg: emea. Be consistent with format. For example, avoid using both camelCase and kebab-case. Although tag searching is not case-sensitive in the UI and API, try to be consistent with capitalization. For example, avoid using both env: staging and env: Staging. Tips on cross-team implementation: Tags help improve observability and cost allocation. For this reason, responsibility for tag implementation is often assigned to an observability team, SREs, a group of architects, or a cross-team task force. We recommend the people responsible for implementing tags meet and create an internal policy to describe how the tags are defined and which conventions are to be used. Then: Keep this reference manual up to date. Automate the definition of tags when you deploy New Relic agents, at the cloud provider, or through New Relic automation tools, such as the API or Terraform. Create recurring reports that identify entities that are non-compliant with your tagging standards. Tag examples Here are some examples of common ways to use tags to organize data: Team-related tags Creating tags for team names can be helpful to understand which team, group, department, or region was responsible for a change that led to a performance issue. Team examples: team: backend team: frontend team: db Role examples: roles: architecture roles: devops roles: pm Region examples: region: emea region: america region: asia Environment-related tags You can create entities for the environment they belong to. Examples: env: production env: qa env: development env: staging Criticality-related tags You can create tags related to criticality levels, which lets you easier track the most critical issues. Examples: layer: level1 layer: level2 layer: level3 How tags are added Some important attributes, by default, are available for use as tags. For example, the account name, the account ID, and some basic host/server metadata are available as default tags. You can't remove these available-by-default tags. Here are some details about how tags are added for some specific data sources: Add tags via UI or API When you add tags via the UI or API, this occurs at the entity level. This means that, for example, if you have multiple APM agents monitoring a single entity and apply a tag via the UI, that tag is available for all data coming from that entity. To add or delete tags via the UI: Select a monitored entity, like a monitored app or host. Near the entity’s name at the top of the page, select the See metadata and manage tags menu. In the menu that pops up, add or delete a tag. For APM agents, restart your service. To manage tags via API: see our NerdGraph tagging docs. For a guide to using our CLI to automate tagging, see our developer site. APM agent tags You can add tags via the UI and API or you can add tags using APM agent configuration, both methods require you to restart your service. There are differences in how these apply tags: Via agent config: These tags are applied at the agent-level, not the entity/application level. This would be a good option if you have multiple agents monitoring different aspects of the same app (for example, a blue-green deployment model). Via the UI or API: These tags are applied at the entity/application level. Here are links to the agent configuration options: C SDK: not available Java Go .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby For information on querying APM tags, see Query APM tags. And check out this short video on querying APM tags (3:20 minutes). Infrastructure data tags There are several ways tags are added to infrastructure entities and services: Use the UI or API to add tags at the entity level. Infrastructure agent: some attributes are available by default as tags. You can also add custom attributes, which are also available as tags in the UI. On-host integrations: some attributes are available by default as tags. You can also add tags by using integration-specific labels config options (for an example, see the labels config for the Apache integration). Cloud service integrations: by default we report tags and labels that are defined in the cloud service. To add tags, you'd add them on the cloud-service-side. Automate tags with our CLI For a guide to automating tags using our CLI tool, see our developer site. Use tags to filter the UI Use the filter field at the top of the New Relic Explorer to filter down to the entities you care about. You can use multiple filter conditions. To filter down to certain entities using tags: From one.newrelic.com, click Explorer. Click the Filter by... field to see a dropdown of available attributes and tags. You can filter by multiple elements and use advanced search options. To find an entity’s metadata and tags from the UI, here are two options: From a list of entities in the UI, at the far right, select an entity's icon. OR Select an entity. Near the top of the page, select the icon. To use the API to view tags, see our NerdGraph docs. Learn about how to use tags with dashboards and how to use tags with workloads. Custom queries, charts, and alerts Different features handle tags differently. Here are some details about how you can use NRQL to query tag data, or create NRQL condition alerts. Query and alert on APM tags You can query APM tags using NRQL. Minimum agent versions: C: not available Go: 2.3.0 Java: 4.9.0 .NET: 8.17 Node: v4.13.0 PHP: not available Python: v4.10.0.112 Ruby: 6.1.0.352 Here are some query examples: Throughput across shards Given a service that is distributed across nine shards, each shard assigned as an environment, we can plot the transaction throughput on all shards using a wildcard query like: SELECT rate(count(apm.service.transaction.duration), 1 minute) FROM Metric WHERE appName LIKE 'MyApp (%' AND transactionType = 'Other' FACET tags.Environment TIMESERIES Copy Transactions per team To see the number of transactions per service for a specific team, we might use a query like: FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) WHERE tags.Team = 'team-a' FACET tags.Project TIMESERIES Copy Alert on error rate for teams You can use a query for your services’ error rate for setting an alert without having to create a rule for each service. Here is the error rate for all services on a team called team-b. And this alert will automatically monitor any new app names added with the team tag. FROM Metric SELECT count(apm.service.error.count) / count(apm.service.transaction.duration) WHERE tags.Team = 'team-b' FACET appName Copy Related to this, you might create a general rule for a specific service deployed across several environments, so that we have an alarm for a single service monitoring each environment individually: From Metric SELECT count(apm.service.error.count) / count(apm.service.transaction.duration) WHERE tags.Project = 'MyProject' FACET tags.Environment Copy Query and alert on attributes As explained in the tag sources information, some important attributes are used as tags. You can query all attributes and create custom charts using NRQL, and create NRQL alert conditions.",

      "body": "Our workloads feature gives you the ability to group and monitor entities based on a team or a set of responsibilities, providing aggregated health and activity data from frontend to backend services across your entire stack. Workloads help you understand the status of complex systems, detect issues, understand the cause and impact of an incident, and resolve those issues quickly. Want to try it? Create a New Relic account for free! No credit card required. What is a workload in New Relic? New Relic monitors a wide range of entities and data, from client-side applications and backend APIs, to the underlying infrastructure. To make sense of this large data set, we give you the ability to create and monitor workloads. Workloads give you the ability to group and monitor entities based on a team or a set of responsibilities, and provide an aggregated view of the health and activity of the entities in the workload. Thus, you can understand better how your business logic is working, from frontend to backend services, across your entire stack. Here are some workload examples: A serverless application that includes an API gateway, a few serverless functions, and a managed database and storage. A browser application and the backend APIs that support it. A collection of Java microservices and the infrastructure they run on. Here's a workload: one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Workloads > (selected workload): The workloads UI provides a curated view of how the entities in your workload are performing. The charts you see will depend on the types of entities you've included to the workload. Tip Learn how to use workloads. Why it matters Workloads give you visibility into the end-to-end availability and consumption of resources across an entire service, and provide you a way to define what’s relevant to you. You can use workloads to group together entities that are important to a specific team or project, so you can better browse and isolate the most relevant data for that service. Because our UI gives you cross-account access, you can add entities to your workload from any of the accounts you have access to. A workload can include: Any New Relic-monitored entity, including services, browser apps, mobile apps, databases, and hosts. Dashboards. Other workloads: this is useful for complex teams who need to divide and overlap workloads. Requirements Requirements for creating and managing workloads: All users for an account can view that account's workloads. To create, edit, and delete workloads, you must have a user role with that permission. Impact of accounts on the workload permissions and content Workloads can group and display entities from multiple accounts to provide complete observability of complex systems. When creating a workload, you must set: The workload account Scope accounts Learn how to find a New Relic account ID. Workload account The workload account is where any workload-specific data is stored. For example, a workload might generate NrAuditEvent data, and you would find that data by querying the workload account. The workload account determines the user permissions that govern which users can see and manage the workload, through the account roles. Once created, the workload account can’t be changed. Scope accounts Scope accounts are the accounts from which a workload fetches entity data. In other words, the scope accounts provide the content for a workload. Users who don’t have access to all of a workload's scope accounts may not be able to see complete workload data. Scope accounts can be updated at any point in time by any user with workload management capabilities on the workload account. By default, all accounts that the workload creator has access to at the moment of the workload creation are set as scope accounts.",

      "body": "To view workloads, go to one.newrelic.com and find them on the Explorer. There are three main tabs (Health, Activity, and Owner) plus the header. The Health tab in a workload provides relevant status data that helps you operate the workload: It shows the global status of the workload, as well as the individual status of all the entities that make up the workload at each point in time. It looks like this: It comprises the following: The navigator view shows the entities that make up the workload, and provides controls to group and sort them. If you’ve used queries to dynamically select entities, the workload entities will change over time. The workload status informs about how your workload is performing, based on the individual alerting status of the entities in your workload. With health over time you’ll see whether and how the workload status has changed in the past three hours. If one or more entities are alerting, you’ll get a count of criticals and warnings and a summary of the open conditions, which will make it easier to identify and troubleshoot the most important issues. The Activity tab shows performance data related to the entities in the workload, along with the events that could explain any changes in those time series. It looks like this: Here's the most important sections: Linked dashboards. You can add links to dashboards from your workload, and create pre-filtered, workload-relevant links to dashboards. Golden metrics. These are charts with the most relevant metrics for each entity type, such as number of requests, response time, and error rate for an application. Explore the charts to detect correlations among different entities (for example, two applications) and different stack layers (for example, applications and hosts). The golden metrics that you see for each entity type on a workload can be customized either at the account or the workload level through the NerdGraph API. Events timeline. This includes the start and end time of incidents and anomalies that refer to the workload entities. It also shows other event types that can explain a change in the status or performance of the workload, such as deployments and configuration changes. The Owner tab gives you information about the team responsible for the workload. It looks like this: It contains: The team responsible for the workload. You can include more than one team. The workload description. Share the mission of the workload, and the business logic it represents: Is it a web application? An API? A backend process? Fill in any details that are relevant to your team, or to other teams in your organization. Contact information. From the drop-down menu, choose how your team prefers to be contacted. Links to the most relevant resources to operate the workload. Here you can add links to runbooks, code repositories, productivity tools, or anything else related to the workload that you need at hand. Finally, the header contains the filter bar and the edition controls: Filter bar. Use the advanced filtering options when you need to focus only on certain entities within the workload. Edit workload. Define the entities that are part of the workload, and the accounts they’ll be fetched from. Setup status. Configure how the global workload status will be determined, based on the workload entities health. Summary page. See all the tags that have been added to the workload, as well as metadata such as the workload's identifier (GUID) and account. Create a workload A workload should contain the entities you and your team want to see. Your choice of entities depends on your organization structure and goals. one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Workloads > Create a workload: When you create a workload, you choose the associated accounts and monitored entities. You can use New Relic One or the NerdGraph API to create a workload. Follow these steps to create a workload using the UI: Go to one.newrelic.com and click on the Explorer, and then click + Create a workload. Give the workload a name that will be meaningful for you and your team later. From the Select an account dropdown, select the workload account you'd like to use. Click Choose the scope accounts to check all of the accounts related to this workload. Find and choose the entities that make up the workload. When you have the results you're looking for, you can add specific entities or add the query to dynamically update the entities in the workload. You can search by entity type, tags, or attributes (like entity name, account ID, and AWS region). Click + Add this query to create a list of dynamically updated entities for your workload. We recommend this if you want your workload to update its entities as your system changes. Click + Add next to an entity to add it to your workload. This is a good choice if you know that the entities will stay useful even as your system changes. You can add a combination of queries and specific entities to the workload, which combine according to the query logic. Click Create a workload to save the workload. Once you've created the workload, you can edit it at any time If your workload contains one or more dashboards, you can set filters on those dashboard links. Below are more details about some aspects of how to define workloads: Use tags to define the workload content You can query and select workload entities using both tags and attributes. Therefore, to optimize your use of workloads, it helps to have a good entity-tagging strategy. We recommend reading the tagging documentation. How the dynamic query logic works You can add several individual entities and queries to define a workload. Queries can include multiple search terms. These are combined with an AND operator. Separate queries within a workload are combined with an OR operator. You can wrap strings between percent signs (%) to match exact substrings within a query. If you use substrings in entity names to categorize those entities (for example, <team>-<env>-<appName>), consider using tags complementarily, which are more powerful for filtering and grouping (for example, team:awesome, env:production). We recommend not to use percent signs (%) in dynamic queries that might return over 500 entities. This way, you get a more consistent experience in the user interface. Add dashboards to workloads If you have custom dashboards and you already know which data is relevant to your team for observing and operating their workloads, you can link those dashboards from your workload. You can also set filters on dashboards to scope them to a workload-specific context. When a user selects that dashboard from the workload, it opens with the filter already applied. one.newrelic.com > Apps > Workloads: You can add dashboards to a workload. To add dashboards to a workload: When creating or editing a workload, type Dashboard in the workload search bar to filter to dashboard entities. Add other search terms to filter to specific dashboards. Click Add. one.newrelic.com > Apps > Workloads: You can set filters on the dashboards you've linked to a workload. To filter a workload’s dashboard: From a workload’s Overview page, select a dashboard. Add search terms to filter the dashboard to a view that’s relevant for that workload. Select Save filter for this workload. Use the API You can query, create, and update workloads with our NerdGraph API.",

      "body": "In the software industry, a tag typically refers to a piece of metadata added to a data set for the purpose of improving data organization and findability. At New Relic, our tags are key:value pairs (like team: operations) added to various sets of data, like monitored apps and hosts, agents, dashboards, and workloads. We make some important attributes available as tags (for example, app metadata like app name and language, and host metadata like host name and AWS region). You can also add your own custom tags. You can use tags in the UI to filter down to relevant data. Here is an example: Here you can see an accountId tag being used to filter workloads to a specific account. Tags help you to: Organize data coming from a large number of sources and/or to a large number of New Relic accounts. Identify teams, roles, environments, or regions to know who’s responsible for what (see example use cases). Better organize and search dashboards and workloads. Query and chart APM data. Tags are useful for organizing data at a high level. If you want to add more fine-grained detail, like capturing user names or other high-cardinality values, custom attributes or custom events are a better solution. Tip Tags were previously called labels in the New Relic UI. You may sometimes see labelin our code; for example, some of our APM agent config files use a label config option for tags. Tag format and limits Format requirements and limits for tags: The UI has limits on the total number of tags it can display per entity: Limit of 100 for tags reported by default or added via agent/integration configuration. Limit of 100 for custom tags added via UI or API. The following are maximum character length for tags: Key: 128 characters Value: 256 characters Allowed characters: Characters must be UTF-8. When using NerdGraph to add tags, a dash (-) in a tag key is interpreted as a minus symbol. If your tag key has a dash, use back ticks around it (like `key-name`). Best practices and tips Before adding tags, we recommend first seeing how our default tags work for you. When you're ready to add your own tags, review the following best practices tips to get the most out of them. Tips on keeping tags simple: Start by adding only tags you know you’ll definitely use. Unused tags create noise and may add confusion. Try to use short tags. Shorter tags are easier to parse, and also the UI may sometimes truncate longer tags. (See character limits.) When possible, use keys and values that are human-readable (for example, region: EMEA is better than Param8323 : 1229072). Avoid including several values like regions: EMEA | US | LATAM in a single tag. We recommend using three different tags for that, like region: emea, region: us, and region: latam. If you want to match multiple tags, you can do that using the advanced options in the filter UI. Tips on using tags consistently: Try to be consistent with tag language across your teams and entities. Be consistent with naming. For example, avoid using both region: emea and reg: emea. Be consistent with format. For example, avoid using both camelCase and kebab-case. Although tag searching is not case-sensitive in the UI and API, try to be consistent with capitalization. For example, avoid using both env: staging and env: Staging. Tips on cross-team implementation: Tags help improve observability and cost allocation. For this reason, responsibility for tag implementation is often assigned to an observability team, SREs, a group of architects, or a cross-team task force. We recommend the people responsible for implementing tags meet and create an internal policy to describe how the tags are defined and which conventions are to be used. Then: Keep this reference manual up to date. Automate the definition of tags when you deploy New Relic agents, at the cloud provider, or through New Relic automation tools, such as the API or Terraform. Create recurring reports that identify entities that are non-compliant with your tagging standards. Tag examples Here are some examples of common ways to use tags to organize data: Team-related tags Creating tags for team names can be helpful to understand which team, group, department, or region was responsible for a change that led to a performance issue. Team examples: team: backend team: frontend team: db Role examples: roles: architecture roles: devops roles: pm Region examples: region: emea region: america region: asia Environment-related tags You can create entities for the environment they belong to. Examples: env: production env: qa env: development env: staging Criticality-related tags You can create tags related to criticality levels, which lets you easier track the most critical issues. Examples: layer: level1 layer: level2 layer: level3 How tags are added Some important attributes, by default, are available for use as tags. For example, the account name, the account ID, and some basic host/server metadata are available as default tags. You can't remove these available-by-default tags. Here are some details about how tags are added for some specific data sources: Add tags via UI or API When you add tags via the UI or API, this occurs at the entity level. This means that, for example, if you have multiple APM agents monitoring a single entity and apply a tag via the UI, that tag is available for all data coming from that entity. To add or delete tags via the UI: Select a monitored entity, like a monitored app or host. Near the entity’s name at the top of the page, select the See metadata and manage tags menu. In the menu that pops up, add or delete a tag. For APM agents, restart your service. To manage tags via API: see our NerdGraph tagging docs. For a guide to using our CLI to automate tagging, see our developer site. APM agent tags You can add tags via the UI and API or you can add tags using APM agent configuration, both methods require you to restart your service. There are differences in how these apply tags: Via agent config: These tags are applied at the agent-level, not the entity/application level. This would be a good option if you have multiple agents monitoring different aspects of the same app (for example, a blue-green deployment model). Via the UI or API: These tags are applied at the entity/application level. Here are links to the agent configuration options: C SDK: not available Java Go .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby For information on querying APM tags, see Query APM tags. And check out this short video on querying APM tags (3:20 minutes). Infrastructure data tags There are several ways tags are added to infrastructure entities and services: Use the UI or API to add tags at the entity level. Infrastructure agent: some attributes are available by default as tags. You can also add custom attributes, which are also available as tags in the UI. On-host integrations: some attributes are available by default as tags. You can also add tags by using integration-specific labels config options (for an example, see the labels config for the Apache integration). Cloud service integrations: by default we report tags and labels that are defined in the cloud service. To add tags, you'd add them on the cloud-service-side. Automate tags with our CLI For a guide to automating tags using our CLI tool, see our developer site. Use tags to filter the UI Use the filter field at the top of the New Relic Explorer to filter down to the entities you care about. You can use multiple filter conditions. To filter down to certain entities using tags: From one.newrelic.com, click Explorer. Click the Filter by... field to see a dropdown of available attributes and tags. You can filter by multiple elements and use advanced search options. To find an entity’s metadata and tags from the UI, here are two options: From a list of entities in the UI, at the far right, select an entity's icon. OR Select an entity. Near the top of the page, select the icon. To use the API to view tags, see our NerdGraph docs. Learn about how to use tags with dashboards and how to use tags with workloads. Custom queries, charts, and alerts Different features handle tags differently. Here are some details about how you can use NRQL to query tag data, or create NRQL condition alerts. Query and alert on APM tags You can query APM tags using NRQL. Minimum agent versions: C: not available Go: 2.3.0 Java: 4.9.0 .NET: 8.17 Node: v4.13.0 PHP: not available Python: v4.10.0.112 Ruby: 6.1.0.352 Here are some query examples: Throughput across shards Given a service that is distributed across nine shards, each shard assigned as an environment, we can plot the transaction throughput on all shards using a wildcard query like: SELECT rate(count(apm.service.transaction.duration), 1 minute) FROM Metric WHERE appName LIKE 'MyApp (%' AND transactionType = 'Other' FACET tags.Environment TIMESERIES Copy Transactions per team To see the number of transactions per service for a specific team, we might use a query like: FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) WHERE tags.Team = 'team-a' FACET tags.Project TIMESERIES Copy Alert on error rate for teams You can use a query for your services’ error rate for setting an alert without having to create a rule for each service. Here is the error rate for all services on a team called team-b. And this alert will automatically monitor any new app names added with the team tag. FROM Metric SELECT count(apm.service.error.count) / count(apm.service.transaction.duration) WHERE tags.Team = 'team-b' FACET appName Copy Related to this, you might create a general rule for a specific service deployed across several environments, so that we have an alarm for a single service monitoring each environment individually: From Metric SELECT count(apm.service.error.count) / count(apm.service.transaction.duration) WHERE tags.Project = 'MyProject' FACET tags.Environment Copy Query and alert on attributes As explained in the tag sources information, some important attributes are used as tags. You can query all attributes and create custom charts using NRQL, and create NRQL alert conditions.",

      "body": "The workload status, which is derived from the alerting status of the entities in your workload, informs you about how your workload is behaving. Why it matters Workload status: Is a quick indicator of how your system is doing, and tells you if you need to take action on any of your workloads in just a glance. Adapts to your needs and to how important each entity is. Allows you to share the status of your workloads. Other teams that depend on your services or infrastructure can learn the status of the workload without them needing to understand your system’s architecture details, or look at custom dashboards. Get started with workload status New Relic One provides a status value for all entities, which is based on the results of New Relic alerts. You can check the color-coded alert status for each entity on the New Relic Explorer, or consume the alert status value through the API. For example, you may see a red alert status indicating that a critical violation is in progress. With Workloads you can group entities that are part of a complex system and obtain a single, global value that summarizes the status of all the entities in your workload. Thus, you can quickly detect when the workload stops being operational, or anticipate any potential incident or loss of quality of service. Obtain your workload status A workload can have one of the following status values: Operational: The workload is working fine. Degraded: The workload is showing some degradation in performance or errors, but it’s still providing an acceptable level of service, and you don’t need to take any urgent action. Critical or Disrupted: The workload is not providing an acceptable level of service, and you need to take urgent action. Unknown: You haven’t configured how to calculate workload status, or there aren’t any alert conditions set up that can determine the status of the workload entities. To learn how to define or edit the workload status, refer to Workload status configuration. Save views with sets of workloads If you usually need to see the status of a certain group of workloads, you can save views that contain only those workloads. The tile view mode helps you quickly find your workloads and see their status at a glance. To create a view, follow these steps: Go to one.newrelic.com and click on More > Workload views. Click on Add view. Give the view a meaningful name (such as the name of a team or business unit), and select an account to associate the view with. Select the workloads you want to include in the view, by their name or tags. Save the new view. Status views are most useful for teams that are accountable for more than one workload, support roles, and business unit managers. Get notified when the workload status changes You may need to follow the status of a workload, either because it represents the services your team is accountable for, or because your own services depend on that workload, which is managed by another team. The status of all workloads is calculated regularly and the result is stored in NRDB through a WorkloadStatus event. This allows you to set up an alert condition to notify you whenever the Workload goes into a Disrupted or Degraded status. To set up the alert condition follow these steps: Go to one.newrelic.com and select Alerts & AI. Select the policy where you want to add the new alert condition, or create a new policy with the appropriate notification channel. Then click on Create a condition. Where prompted to Select a product, click NRQL. Add the following NRQL query: SELECT latest(statusValueCode) FROM WorkloadStatus WHERE workloadGuid = '<GUID>' FACET workloadGuid as 'entity.guid', entity.name Copy You can obtain the workload GUID by clicking on the See metadata and manage tags on the workload UI. Write the WHERE clause so the alert condition applies to just one workload (as in the example) or more than one. Or remove the WHERE clause if you want the alert condition to apply to all the workloads on the account. By adding the FACET you can use these fields on the alert description, as explained below. Set one of the following static thresholds: (Recommended) Critical when the query returns a value equal to 3 for at least 1 minute, if you want to be notified when the workload status is disrupted. Critical when the query returns a value equal to 2 for at least 1 minute, if you want to be notified when the workload status is degraded. Remember that a warning threshold doesn't generate an incident or send a notification. As a result, you need to create two alert conditions with a critical threshold (as explained above) if you want to be notified of any status change. Complete the alert condition: Set a violation time limit, to automatically force-close a long-lasting violation after the selected amount of time you select. Choose to fill data gaps with last known value. Optionally, you can also add a custom violation description that includes the workload name and permanent link to the UI in the alert notification: Workload: {{tag.entity.name}} Direct link: https://one.newrelic.com/redirect/entity/{{tag.entity.guid}} Copy",

      "body": "To view workloads, go to one.newrelic.com and find them on the Explorer. There are three main tabs (Health, Activity, and Owner) plus the header. The Health tab in a workload provides relevant status data that helps you operate the workload: It shows the global status of the workload, as well as the individual status of all the entities that make up the workload at each point in time. It looks like this: It comprises the following: The navigator view shows the entities that make up the workload, and provides controls to group and sort them. If you’ve used queries to dynamically select entities, the workload entities will change over time. The workload status informs about how your workload is performing, based on the individual alerting status of the entities in your workload. With health over time you’ll see whether and how the workload status has changed in the past three hours. If one or more entities are alerting, you’ll get a count of criticals and warnings and a summary of the open conditions, which will make it easier to identify and troubleshoot the most important issues. The Activity tab shows performance data related to the entities in the workload, along with the events that could explain any changes in those time series. It looks like this: Here's the most important sections: Linked dashboards. You can add links to dashboards from your workload, and create pre-filtered, workload-relevant links to dashboards. Golden metrics. These are charts with the most relevant metrics for each entity type, such as number of requests, response time, and error rate for an application. Explore the charts to detect correlations among different entities (for example, two applications) and different stack layers (for example, applications and hosts). The golden metrics that you see for each entity type on a workload can be customized either at the account or the workload level through the NerdGraph API. Events timeline. This includes the start and end time of incidents and anomalies that refer to the workload entities. It also shows other event types that can explain a change in the status or performance of the workload, such as deployments and configuration changes. The Owner tab gives you information about the team responsible for the workload. It looks like this: It contains: The team responsible for the workload. You can include more than one team. The workload description. Share the mission of the workload, and the business logic it represents: Is it a web application? An API? A backend process? Fill in any details that are relevant to your team, or to other teams in your organization. Contact information. From the drop-down menu, choose how your team prefers to be contacted. Links to the most relevant resources to operate the workload. Here you can add links to runbooks, code repositories, productivity tools, or anything else related to the workload that you need at hand. Finally, the header contains the filter bar and the edition controls: Filter bar. Use the advanced filtering options when you need to focus only on certain entities within the workload. Edit workload. Define the entities that are part of the workload, and the accounts they’ll be fetched from. Setup status. Configure how the global workload status will be determined, based on the workload entities health. Summary page. See all the tags that have been added to the workload, as well as metadata such as the workload's identifier (GUID) and account. Create a workload A workload should contain the entities you and your team want to see. Your choice of entities depends on your organization structure and goals. one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Workloads > Create a workload: When you create a workload, you choose the associated accounts and monitored entities. You can use New Relic One or the NerdGraph API to create a workload. Follow these steps to create a workload using the UI: Go to one.newrelic.com and click on the Explorer, and then click + Create a workload. Give the workload a name that will be meaningful for you and your team later. From the Select an account dropdown, select the workload account you'd like to use. Click Choose the scope accounts to check all of the accounts related to this workload. Find and choose the entities that make up the workload. When you have the results you're looking for, you can add specific entities or add the query to dynamically update the entities in the workload. You can search by entity type, tags, or attributes (like entity name, account ID, and AWS region). Click + Add this query to create a list of dynamically updated entities for your workload. We recommend this if you want your workload to update its entities as your system changes. Click + Add next to an entity to add it to your workload. This is a good choice if you know that the entities will stay useful even as your system changes. You can add a combination of queries and specific entities to the workload, which combine according to the query logic. Click Create a workload to save the workload. Once you've created the workload, you can edit it at any time If your workload contains one or more dashboards, you can set filters on those dashboard links. Below are more details about some aspects of how to define workloads: Use tags to define the workload content You can query and select workload entities using both tags and attributes. Therefore, to optimize your use of workloads, it helps to have a good entity-tagging strategy. We recommend reading the tagging documentation. How the dynamic query logic works You can add several individual entities and queries to define a workload. Queries can include multiple search terms. These are combined with an AND operator. Separate queries within a workload are combined with an OR operator. You can wrap strings between percent signs (%) to match exact substrings within a query. If you use substrings in entity names to categorize those entities (for example, <team>-<env>-<appName>), consider using tags complementarily, which are more powerful for filtering and grouping (for example, team:awesome, env:production). We recommend not to use percent signs (%) in dynamic queries that might return over 500 entities. This way, you get a more consistent experience in the user interface. Add dashboards to workloads If you have custom dashboards and you already know which data is relevant to your team for observing and operating their workloads, you can link those dashboards from your workload. You can also set filters on dashboards to scope them to a workload-specific context. When a user selects that dashboard from the workload, it opens with the filter already applied. one.newrelic.com > Apps > Workloads: You can add dashboards to a workload. To add dashboards to a workload: When creating or editing a workload, type Dashboard in the workload search bar to filter to dashboard entities. Add other search terms to filter to specific dashboards. Click Add. one.newrelic.com > Apps > Workloads: You can set filters on the dashboards you've linked to a workload. To filter a workload’s dashboard: From a workload’s Overview page, select a dashboard. Add search terms to filter the dashboard to a view that’s relevant for that workload. Select Save filter for this workload. Use the API You can query, create, and update workloads with our NerdGraph API.",

Requirements The Partnership API can be used by two types of New Relic accounts: partners (managed service providers, resellers) and customer partnerships (larger customers who have been given access to our partnership account structure). These docs are for version 2 of the Partner API. Earlier versions have been deprecated. If you have problems with an older integration, upgrade to version 2. Access to the partnership account structure and the Partnership API requires prior setup and approval by New Relic. Partnership API calls require authentication with both your partnership owner account's REST API key and your Partner ID. Accounts that are genuine New Relic partners (managed service providers, resellers) have no restrictions on using the API. Accounts set up as customer partnerships have restrictions that follow. Customer partnership restrictions If your New Relic organization is set up as a customer partnership, there are some restrictions in place if your organization is on our newer pricing model or our newer user model. Details: Pricing plan. If you’re on New Relic One pricing, you can't use API calls that govern our original pricing model. The API impacts are: You can't use the subscription object You can't use the NerdGraph Provisioning API. User model. If your New Relic account has been converted to be entirely on the New Relic One user model, you can no longer use API calls that create or govern users on our original user model.

From the left menu bar, select Partnerships. one.newrelic.com > (account dropdown) > Account settings > Partnerships: Partnership owners can access the Partnership Admin Console from their account settings in the New Relic UI. Console components The Partnership Admin Console has two main components: Partnership configuration settings Customer activity monitoring If multiple partnerships are associated with the New Relic parent account, the menu also includes an option to switch partnership accounts. Partnership configuration settings In developing your integration with New Relic, you must specify a number of settings. For your convenience these settings are grouped together in the partnership console, including URLs for header/footer and various redirects, SSO configuration, and keys and the ability to manipulate them. Customer activity monitoring New Relic provides you with two tools for managing your customers: State-of-the-Partnership reports and live monitoring of all deployed New Relic agents in your partnership. Both of these tools provide insight into your customers who are using New Relic. They can be used to identify up-sale opportunities or to assist your support group in proactive support. State-of-the-Partnership report The State-of-the-Partnership report provides a summary of your customers with New Relic accounts and their activities. The report is broken down by language of the agents deployed, the agent version and the language version for each account. This report is run weekly for each partner. It is available on request from your New Relic Business Development contact. This report is an excellent way to see which of your customers with New Relic accounts are in fact using the service. Partner customer monitoring The Partner customer monitoring facility provides application performance data on the New Relic enabled applications that are running on your service. This facility allows you to easily identify customers experiencing performance problems. Where the performance problems are caused by under capacity, these customers are excellent sales opportunities. Alternatively your support or services organization will find this information useful in pre-emptively identifying customer issues or as good prospects for consulting services. View an arbitrary customer To view activity of a customer that does not appear in any of the filtered views: Go to one.newrelic.com > (account dropdown) > Switch accounts > Other accounts. New Relic will list all of the reporting accounts in the partnership. You can filter or search the list. Viewing detailed customer data Under normal circumstances a partner will be able to see only the summary level data in a customer's New Relic account. Through the Partnership Admin Console, partners will be permitted to drill down to the more detailed presentation. If you want to drill down from the Partnership Admin Console, add your user (typically support@partner.com or something similar) to the account. Typically this will be done at account creation. Avoid provisioning this user as the account Owner.",

From the left menu bar, select Partnerships. one.newrelic.com > (account dropdown) > Account settings > Partnerships: Partnership owners can access the Partnership Admin Console from their account settings in the New Relic UI. Console components The Partnership Admin Console has two main components: Partnership configuration settings Customer activity monitoring If multiple partnerships are associated with the New Relic parent account, the menu also includes an option to switch partnership accounts. Partnership configuration settings In developing your integration with New Relic, you must specify a number of settings. For your convenience these settings are grouped together in the partnership console, including URLs for header/footer and various redirects, SSO configuration, and keys and the ability to manipulate them. Customer activity monitoring New Relic provides you with two tools for managing your customers: State-of-the-Partnership reports and live monitoring of all deployed New Relic agents in your partnership. Both of these tools provide insight into your customers who are using New Relic. They can be used to identify up-sale opportunities or to assist your support group in proactive support. State-of-the-Partnership report The State-of-the-Partnership report provides a summary of your customers with New Relic accounts and their activities. The report is broken down by language of the agents deployed, the agent version and the language version for each account. This report is run weekly for each partner. It is available on request from your New Relic Business Development contact. This report is an excellent way to see which of your customers with New Relic accounts are in fact using the service. Partner customer monitoring The Partner customer monitoring facility provides application performance data on the New Relic enabled applications that are running on your service. This facility allows you to easily identify customers experiencing performance problems. Where the performance problems are caused by under capacity, these customers are excellent sales opportunities. Alternatively your support or services organization will find this information useful in pre-emptively identifying customer issues or as good prospects for consulting services. View an arbitrary customer To view activity of a customer that does not appear in any of the filtered views: Go to one.newrelic.com > (account dropdown) > Switch accounts > Other accounts. New Relic will list all of the reporting accounts in the partnership. You can filter or search the list. Viewing detailed customer data Under normal circumstances a partner will be able to see only the summary level data in a customer's New Relic account. Through the Partnership Admin Console, partners will be permitted to drill down to the more detailed presentation. If you want to drill down from the Partnership Admin Console, add your user (typically support@partner.com or something similar) to the account. Typically this will be done at account creation. Avoid provisioning this user as the account Owner.",

      "body": "Important This information is for New Relic partners. If you are not a New Relic partner, refer to the information about pricing and billing for New Relic accounts. Partners: For account setup procedures, see New Relic's Partner API documentation. For specific product pricing details (such as New Relic APM), visit New Relic's website, or contact your Alliance & Channels representative at New Relic. Commitment levels When customers choose a product, they also choose a monthly or annual commitment level. Existing partnerships have the option of limiting available product offerings for their customers. Reseller partners may be able to modify these subscription terms based on the contractual terms in the partner agreement with New Relic. Customized partnership pricing Partnership accounts may offer customized pricing. Customized pricing models, rates, minimums, discounts, and options vary by partnership--the actual pricing model used is subject to the contractual terms of the partner's agreement with New Relic. Contact your Alliance & Channels representative at New Relic to learn more. Partnership billing options New Relic supports the following billing options for partnerships. All subscriptions commence and expire at midnight GMT. For host-based subscriptions, fees are charged in advance for the month. Upgrade requests are honored immediately without any billing for partial use during the month. Downgrades take effect at the next payment date. To view New Relic account billing details and history from the user interface: From one.newrelic.com, select (account dropdown) > Account settings > Account > Billing. Billing option Description Credit card When partners choose credit card billing, your customers are directly charged using the credit card information provided during their New Relic subscription signup. This does not include any license fees paid directly by the partner for their customers' accounts. Invoice When partners choose invoice billing, your customers are billed directly by New Relic via invoice for their subscriptions. This option is normally provided on special request to customers with large monthly costs for which credit card billing would be impractical. Reseller For resellers, partners are billed directly for all customer accounts based on the calendar month. Partners may be responsible for accounting for customer usage, pricing, and subscriptions. Resellers have the option to implement an integration between our respective accounting systems. New Relic will invoice the partner monthly, using the Billing integration API for each of the paying accounts under the partnership. Cancellations Once a New Relic account cancellation takes effect, you must uninstall and/or delete all agents or other data-reporting integrations. For uninstallation details, see the documentation for the relevant agents and integrations. Customers may continue to access their data on New Relic until it is purged in accordance with the data retention policy corresponding to the product level. For existing accounts with paid, fixed host subscriptions, cancellations take effect at the next payment date. New Relic will continue to accept data for cancelled accounts until this date. Cancellations for accounts with free or paid based subscriptions take effect immediately. Promotions New Relic allows promotions for accounts offered through partnerships. Promotions associated with a specific partnership may only be redeemed on accounts associated with the partnership. Each promotion has a unique code. This promotion code may be applied only once per account. New Relic may impose further limits on the number of promotions that a customer may apply to an account. Promotion Description Free trials New Relic may include a free trial period for features normally available only through a paid subscription level. This option is provided for a specified number of days. The customer's subscription automatically reverts to its prior level at the conclusion of the trial. Payments for paid subscriptions are not interrupted by the redemption of a free trial promotion on the account. Single use Single use trials expire after they are used once. Discount (deprecated) A one-time percentage discount is applied to a paid subscription. This discount is applied in addition to any volume discounts and customized partner prices. The discount remains in effect until the subscription is modified or cancelled. Legacy products and commitment levels If you have questions about older New Relic products that have been converted to new pricing models, contact your Alliance & Channels representative at New Relic.",

      "body": "New Relic supports Single Sign On (SSO) as a convenience for partner customers. Partners implementing SSO also have the option to restrict access by requiring customers to access New Relic via the partner's management site or product login. Single Sign On is a convenience for your customers, eliminating the requirement of entering sign on credentials multiple times, and it creates a more unified experience for the user. In situations where this distinction is desired, SSO is recommended. Where it is desirable to maintain a distinction between the services or where technical considerations preclude implementing SSO, a fully functioning integration is still achievable. Implement Single Sign On Two methods for SSO are supported by New Relic. New Relic upgraded its single sign on system during 2011. If you implemented single sign on with New Relic prior to September 2011, you will have used the old system. That method of implementing SSO has been deprecated. All new integrations must use the new system. Existing implementations using the old system will continue to work indefinitely. However, we encourage all partners using the old system to upgrade to the new model. Use shared secret method The upgraded shared secret version of New Relic's SSO implementation offers several improvements over the old handshake version. Most important, the system is more secure. Security is enhanced by the use of passing a SHA1 digest of a shared secret, a timestamp, and request specific data in the authentication SSO request. The shared secret can be any string. Whatever shared secret is chosen, enter it in the appropriate field in the New Relic Partner console. To edit the SSO settings: Log in to the partnership owner account. From the account dropdown in the New Relic UI, select Account settings > Partnerships > Edit settings. For SSO type, select signature. For SSO data, type the shared secret. Select Save. In addition to enhanced security, the new SSO method supports a session cookie. Nav data may be stored in the session cookie to support enhanced functionality of headers and footers. The name of the cookie is specified through the Partner console. If unspecified the cookie name defaults to nav_data. To successfully use this SSO method, the SSO URI must be invoked from the user's browser. On success the browser will be automatically logged into New Relic and the redirect URL to that account returned. The SSO URI however should not be generated on the browser, as this would expose the shared secret and allow the login to be spoofed. The URI should be generated on a host and passed to the user's browser. SSO API Description SSO authentication request Method POST or GET URI https://rpm.newrelic.com/accounts/sso_access Copy Parameters Name Required Description id Yes ID of the New Relic account. email No Email address of user logging in (optional). If given, the user must already have been added to the account. By default, the account Owner role is used. Account Owners have full privileges on accounts. If some lesser degree of account privileges or a different user is desired, the email must be provided. timestamp Yes Timestamp used to generate token, in seconds since the epoch. Only timestamps within five minutes (300 seconds) of the New Relic system clock are accepted. nav-data OR nav_data No Partner navigation data. This data will be set in the session cookie using the name as specified in the partnership configuration, or nav_data by default. token Yes Signed token.

      "body": "New Relic supports Single Sign On (SSO) as a convenience for partner customers. Partners implementing SSO also have the option to restrict access by requiring customers to access New Relic via the partner's management site or product login. Single Sign On is a convenience for your customers, eliminating the requirement of entering sign on credentials multiple times, and it creates a more unified experience for the user. In situations where this distinction is desired, SSO is recommended. Where it is desirable to maintain a distinction between the services or where technical considerations preclude implementing SSO, a fully functioning integration is still achievable. Implement Single Sign On Two methods for SSO are supported by New Relic. New Relic upgraded its single sign on system during 2011. If you implemented single sign on with New Relic prior to September 2011, you will have used the old system. That method of implementing SSO has been deprecated. All new integrations must use the new system. Existing implementations using the old system will continue to work indefinitely. However, we encourage all partners using the old system to upgrade to the new model. Use shared secret method The upgraded shared secret version of New Relic's SSO implementation offers several improvements over the old handshake version. Most important, the system is more secure. Security is enhanced by the use of passing a SHA1 digest of a shared secret, a timestamp, and request specific data in the authentication SSO request. The shared secret can be any string. Whatever shared secret is chosen, enter it in the appropriate field in the New Relic Partner console. To edit the SSO settings: Log in to the partnership owner account. From the account dropdown in the New Relic UI, select Account settings > Partnerships > Edit settings. For SSO type, select signature. For SSO data, type the shared secret. Select Save. In addition to enhanced security, the new SSO method supports a session cookie. Nav data may be stored in the session cookie to support enhanced functionality of headers and footers. The name of the cookie is specified through the Partner console. If unspecified the cookie name defaults to nav_data. To successfully use this SSO method, the SSO URI must be invoked from the user's browser. On success the browser will be automatically logged into New Relic and the redirect URL to that account returned. The SSO URI however should not be generated on the browser, as this would expose the shared secret and allow the login to be spoofed. The URI should be generated on a host and passed to the user's browser. SSO API Description SSO authentication request Method POST or GET URI https://rpm.newrelic.com/accounts/sso_access Copy Parameters Name Required Description id Yes ID of the New Relic account. email No Email address of user logging in (optional). If given, the user must already have been added to the account. By default, the account Owner role is used. Account Owners have full privileges on accounts. If some lesser degree of account privileges or a different user is desired, the email must be provided. timestamp Yes Timestamp used to generate token, in seconds since the epoch. Only timestamps within five minutes (300 seconds) of the New Relic system clock are accepted. nav-data OR nav_data No Partner navigation data. This data will be set in the session cookie using the name as specified in the partnership configuration, or nav_data by default. token Yes Signed token. The signature token is generated by applying a SHA1 hex digest on a seed string, which is composed as Account_id:secret:timestamp or Account_id:secret:timestamp:email. Each component is separated by a colon (:). Example without email: \"12345:MySecret:0987654321\" Using Ruby syntax: \"#{account_id}:#{secret}:#{timestamp}\" Example with email: \"12345:MySecret:0987654321:user@host.com\" Using Ruby syntax: \"#{account_id}:#{secret}:#{timestamp}:#{email}\" remote_url No Relative path of a New Relic page to which the users will be directed. ** cURL examples * * curl -X POST -d \"id=63790\" -d \"timestamp=1319659982\" -d \"token=a4d30d6f1f1a5b6c2872ab\" https://rpm.newrelic.com/accounts/sso_access Copy curl -X POST -d \"id=63790\" -d \"timestamp=1319659982\" -d \"token=a4d30d6f1f1a5b6c2872ab\" -d \"remote_url=/account/63790/servers\" https://rpm.newrelic.com/accounts/sso_access Copy On success returns: <html><body>You are being redirected.</body></html> Copy",

      "body": "Important This information is for New Relic partners. If you are not a New Relic partner, refer to the information about pricing and billing for New Relic accounts. Partners: For account setup procedures, see New Relic's Partner API documentation. For specific product pricing details (such as New Relic APM), visit New Relic's website, or contact your Alliance & Channels representative at New Relic. Commitment levels When customers choose a product, they also choose a monthly or annual commitment level. Existing partnerships have the option of limiting available product offerings for their customers. Reseller partners may be able to modify these subscription terms based on the contractual terms in the partner agreement with New Relic. Customized partnership pricing Partnership accounts may offer customized pricing. Customized pricing models, rates, minimums, discounts, and options vary by partnership--the actual pricing model used is subject to the contractual terms of the partner's agreement with New Relic. Contact your Alliance & Channels representative at New Relic to learn more. Partnership billing options New Relic supports the following billing options for partnerships. All subscriptions commence and expire at midnight GMT. For host-based subscriptions, fees are charged in advance for the month. Upgrade requests are honored immediately without any billing for partial use during the month. Downgrades take effect at the next payment date. To view New Relic account billing details and history from the user interface: From one.newrelic.com, select (account dropdown) > Account settings > Account > Billing. Billing option Description Credit card When partners choose credit card billing, your customers are directly charged using the credit card information provided during their New Relic subscription signup. This does not include any license fees paid directly by the partner for their customers' accounts. Invoice When partners choose invoice billing, your customers are billed directly by New Relic via invoice for their subscriptions. This option is normally provided on special request to customers with large monthly costs for which credit card billing would be impractical. Reseller For resellers, partners are billed directly for all customer accounts based on the calendar month. Partners may be responsible for accounting for customer usage, pricing, and subscriptions. Resellers have the option to implement an integration between our respective accounting systems. New Relic will invoice the partner monthly, using the Billing integration API for each of the paying accounts under the partnership. Cancellations Once a New Relic account cancellation takes effect, you must uninstall and/or delete all agents or other data-reporting integrations. For uninstallation details, see the documentation for the relevant agents and integrations. Customers may continue to access their data on New Relic until it is purged in accordance with the data retention policy corresponding to the product level. For existing accounts with paid, fixed host subscriptions, cancellations take effect at the next payment date. New Relic will continue to accept data for cancelled accounts until this date. Cancellations for accounts with free or paid based subscriptions take effect immediately. Promotions New Relic allows promotions for accounts offered through partnerships. Promotions associated with a specific partnership may only be redeemed on accounts associated with the partnership. Each promotion has a unique code. This promotion code may be applied only once per account. New Relic may impose further limits on the number of promotions that a customer may apply to an account. Promotion Description Free trials New Relic may include a free trial period for features normally available only through a paid subscription level. This option is provided for a specified number of days. The customer's subscription automatically reverts to its prior level at the conclusion of the trial. Payments for paid subscriptions are not interrupted by the redemption of a free trial promotion on the account. Single use Single use trials expire after they are used once. Discount (deprecated) A one-time percentage discount is applied to a paid subscription. This discount is applied in addition to any volume discounts and customized partner prices. The discount remains in effect until the subscription is modified or cancelled. Legacy products and commitment levels If you have questions about older New Relic products that have been converted to new pricing models, contact your Alliance & Channels representative at New Relic.",

      "body": "Our Partnership API allows New Relic partners, and New Relic accounts set up as customer partnerships, to manage accounts, users, and subscription-related settings. Requirements The Partnership API can be used by two types of New Relic accounts: partners (managed service providers, resellers) and customer partnerships (larger customers who have been given access to our partnership account structure). These docs are for version 2 of the Partner API. Earlier versions have been deprecated. If you have problems with an older integration, upgrade to version 2. Access to the partnership account structure and the Partnership API requires prior setup and approval by New Relic. Partnership API calls require authentication with both your partnership owner account's REST API key and your Partner ID. Accounts that are genuine New Relic partners (managed service providers, resellers) have no restrictions on using the API. Accounts set up as customer partnerships have restrictions that follow. Customer partnership restrictions If your New Relic organization is set up as a customer partnership, there are some restrictions in place if your organization is on our newer pricing model or our newer user model. Details: Pricing plan. If you’re on New Relic One pricing, you can't use API calls that govern our original pricing model. The API impacts are: You can't use the subscription object You can't use the NerdGraph Provisioning API. User model. If your New Relic account has been converted to be entirely on the New Relic One user model, you can no longer use API calls that create or govern users on our original user model. The API impacts are: You can't use the user object. Instead, you'd manage users with these user management docs. For the account object: you can't add users via the users field. Instead, you'd manage users with these user management docs. To determine your pricing model or user model, see Overview of pricing and user model changes. Password requirements Passwords passed for account creation have these requirements: 8 to 50 characters in length Only contain letters, numbers, or special characters Cannot contain spaces Must contain at least 1 letter Must contain at least 1 number or special character Things you can do Here is an overview of the API's functionality. Account: The account object is what you use to create and update accounts. You can do the following with it: Create new Show Update Cancel Show usage Set primary admin (some accounts) Set subscription (some accounts) There is also a child account object for creating child accounts. Users: Some organizations that meet the requirements can use the user object to: Add user access to account Remove user access from account Subscription: Organizations that meet the requirements and are on our original product pricing model can use the subscription object to configure various subscription-related traits. Get started To start using the Partnership API, see the Partner API reference docs.",

Limitations Partners who implement restricted access are responsible for providing customers with a means for upgrading, administrating, adding and removing users, etc., through the partner's product or interface. Customers who purchase New Relic subscriptions directly from New Relic are not subject to these restrictions. When a partnership enables restricted access, its accounts are subject to the following limitations: Account settings License key Direct login Account settings Customers are not allowed to access any pages in New Relic's Account settings.

      "body": "New Relic organizations set up as partnership accounts have access to an enhanced hierarchical way of organizing their account structure. Partnerships with New Relic There are two types of New Relic organizations that are able to use our partnership account structure and the Partnership API: An actual partnership: A partnership refers to managed service providers or resellers, who offer New Relic products to their customers. Heroku is one example of such a New Relic partner. A customer partnership: some of our larger organizations also make use of our partnership account structure. We call these customers \"customer partnerships.\" Use of our partnership account structure requires prior approval and set up by New Relic representatives. For customer partnerships, New Relic contacts organizations that would benefit from such a structure. Partnerships are identified by a numeric PARTNER_ID. In some cases, a New Relic customer may have more than one partnership; for example, when one section of New Relic users must be managed differently from another. Partnerships are administered by a partnership owner account. The account that owns a partnership functions differently from a regular account. If multiple partnerships have been set up, each has a unique PARTNER_ID. Account hierarchy New Relic partnership organizations consist of the partnership owning account, partnerships, parent accounts, and child accounts. A partnership can have multiple parent and child accounts. To understand how child accounts and parent accounts scale with EU region accounts, see EU region account hierarchy. Tip If you don't have a partnership organization, you can only have one parent account. For more information, see Manage apps or users with child accounts. All parent and child accounts roll up to your partnership account. Partnership owner accounts (POA) The partnership owner account (POA) is the entity that is used to administer a partnership. It controls which users manage accounts under partnerships, have access to the partner API, and manage other aspects of the partnership. Do not monitor your own applications from the partnership owner account. Instead, create an account within the partnership and monitor apps from that account. Users on the partnership owner account can access accounts under their partnerships and enjoy User level privileges. Admins on the POA can access accounts under their partnerships and enjoy Admin level privileges, including permission to manage users. The Owner of the partnership owner account will still only have Admin level access on accounts under the partnership. That means that the owner cannot enable SAML SSO, change the account owner, cancel the account via the UI, etc. The partnership owner account enjoys special privileges, and it lets you exercise the capabilities defined in your partnership agreement with New Relic. For example, you may use your partnership owner account with the New Relic Partnership API to set up and manage users on your accounts or to view your customers' performance data in the New Relic UI. Tip Many of the Partnership API calls return an account status as part of the XML. Child accounts with partnerships Child accounts behave differently than other New Relic accounts provisioned through your partnership: Child accounts Comments Account creation Child accounts can be created through the Partnership API or New Relic user interface. In order to group accounts through the New Relic user interface, your partnership must have Admin privileges, and the account must have the appropriate subscription level. If you have any questions about partnership privileges or subscription levels, contact your New Relic account representative. Child accounts do not have a New Relic subscription of their own. They inherit the parent account's subscription. Billing Billing is applied at the parent account level. Exception: Reseller partnerships receive consolidated billing for all accounts under the partnership. Permissions Admin-level users on a parent account have the ability to create, modify, and delete children accounts for the parent account. Users that have been granted access permissions on a parent account automatically inherit the same level of access for all children accounts. This is also true for add-on roles. Exception: Child account users won't receive alert emails or weekly report emails unless they are explicitly granted permission on these child accounts. Account users You can use the Partnership user API to add and maintain your customer users. An account must always have at least one person (the Owner) associated with it. For security purposes, you cannot change an account Owner with the Partnership user API. Instead, you must change the account Owner from the Users page in the New Relic UI. In addition, a specific user may be associated with multiple accounts. For example, many New Relic users have accounts through a partnership, and they also have accounts they created directly with New Relic. Partnership pricing Accounts within a partnership organization may have different levels of access to New Relic products. Tip Many of the Partnership API calls return a subscription status as part of the XML. For accounts set up through a partnership: An account can have multiple New Relic products associated with it. However, only one subscription per product may be active at any time. For example, a user may have both an Essentials subscription and a higher service level Pro Trial subscription. When the Pro Trial subscription expires, the service level returns to the Essentials subscription. Promotions may appear as a subscription change. Several factors affect starting and stopping subscriptions, including how New Relic handles pricing and billing.",

A partnership can have multiple parent and child accounts. To understand how child accounts and parent accounts scale with EU region accounts, see EU region account hierarchy. Tip If you don't have a partnership organization, you can only have one parent account. For more information, see Manage apps or users with child accounts. All parent and child accounts roll up to your partnership account. Partnership owner accounts (POA) The partnership owner account (POA) is the entity that is used to administer a partnership. It controls which users manage accounts under partnerships, have access to the partner API, and manage other aspects of the partnership. Do not monitor your own applications from the partnership owner account. Instead, create an account within the partnership and monitor apps from that account. Users on the partnership owner account can access accounts under their partnerships and enjoy User level privileges. Admins on the POA can access accounts under their partnerships and enjoy Admin level privileges, including permission to manage users. The Owner of the partnership owner account will still only have Admin level access on accounts under the partnership. That means that the owner cannot enable SAML SSO, change the account owner, cancel the account via the UI, etc. The partnership owner account enjoys special privileges, and it lets you exercise the capabilities defined in your partnership agreement with New Relic. For example, you may use your partnership owner account with the New Relic Partnership API to set up and manage users on your accounts or to view your customers' performance data in the New Relic UI. Tip Many of the Partnership API calls return an account status as part of the XML. Child accounts with partnerships Child accounts behave differently than other New Relic accounts provisioned through your partnership: Child accounts Comments Account creation Child accounts can be created through the Partnership API or New Relic user interface. In order to group accounts through the New Relic user interface, your partnership must have Admin privileges, and the account must have the appropriate subscription level. If you have any questions about partnership privileges or subscription levels, contact your New Relic account representative. Child accounts do not have a New Relic subscription of their own. They inherit the parent account's subscription. Billing Billing is applied at the parent account level. Exception: Reseller partnerships receive consolidated billing for all accounts under the partnership. Permissions Admin-level users on a parent account have the ability to create, modify, and delete children accounts for the parent account. Users that have been granted access permissions on a parent account automatically inherit the same level of access for all children accounts. This is also true for add-on roles. Exception: Child account users won't receive alert emails or weekly report emails unless they are explicitly granted permission on these child accounts. Account users You can use the Partnership user API to add and maintain your customer users. An account must always have at least one person (the Owner) associated with it. For security purposes, you cannot change an account Owner with the Partnership user API. Instead, you must change the account Owner from the Users page in the New Relic UI. In addition, a specific user may be associated with multiple accounts. For example, many New Relic users have accounts through a partnership, and they also have accounts they created directly with New Relic. Partnership pricing Accounts within a partnership organization may have different levels of access to New Relic products. Tip Many of the Partnership API calls return a subscription status as part of the XML. For accounts set up through a partnership: An account can have multiple New Relic products associated with it. However, only one subscription per product may be active at any time. For example, a user may have both an Essentials subscription and a higher service level Pro Trial subscription. When the Pro Trial subscription expires, the service level returns to the Essentials subscription. Promotions may appear as a subscription change. Several factors affect starting and stopping subscriptions, including how New Relic handles pricing and billing.",

      "body": "Partners who implement Single Sign On have the option to enable restricted account access by requiring their customers to access New Relic via their own management application. New Relic recommends that partners who want to manage their customers' accounts directly enable this option. This option is also recommended for partners with reseller agreements. Limitations Partners who implement restricted access are responsible for providing customers with a means for upgrading, administrating, adding and removing users, etc., through the partner's product or interface. Customers who purchase New Relic subscriptions directly from New Relic are not subject to these restrictions. When a partnership enables restricted access, its accounts are subject to the following limitations: Account settings License key Direct login Account settings Customers are not allowed to access any pages in New Relic's Account settings. This prevents customers from modifying the account, changing the subscription level, viewing billing information, and adding or removing users from within New Relic. License key Customers will not be able to access their license key or download their customized newrelic.yml file on the New Relic site. If customers have applications deployed elsewhere, this helps to prevent them from reporting to their partnership accounts in New Relic. Direct login Customers may not directly log in to New Relic to access their associated partner's accounts. Account access is provided solely using SSO and controlled via the partner's website. Restricted access URLs If you elect to enable restricted partnership access, specify the following URLs in the Partnership Console: URL Description Redirect URL Enter your login page for this field. If your customers try to directly log in to the New Relic site, they will be redirected to your login page. Change subscription URL When your customers select the New Relic Subscription option, they will be redirected to the URL that you specify here. Feature unavailable URL When your customers select premium New Relic features, they will be redirected to the URL that you specify here. Logout URL When your customers log out of a New Relic session, they are redirected to this page rather than the New Relic logout page. This option works with restricted access partnerships only.

Partnerships with New Relic There are two types of New Relic organizations that are able to use our partnership account structure and the Partnership API: An actual partnership: A partnership refers to managed service providers or resellers, who offer New Relic products to their customers. Heroku is one example of such a New Relic partner. A customer partnership: some of our larger organizations also make use of our partnership account structure. We call these customers \"customer partnerships.\" Use of our partnership account structure requires prior approval and set up by New Relic representatives. For customer partnerships, New Relic contacts organizations that would benefit from such a structure. Partnerships are identified by a numeric PARTNER_ID. In some cases, a New Relic customer may have more than one partnership; for example, when one section of New Relic users must be managed differently from another. Partnerships are administered by a partnership owner account. The account that owns a partnership functions differently from a regular account. If multiple partnerships have been set up, each has a unique PARTNER_ID. Account hierarchy New Relic partnership organizations consist of the partnership owning account, partnerships, parent accounts, and child accounts. A partnership can have multiple parent and child accounts. To understand how child accounts and parent accounts scale with EU region accounts, see EU region account hierarchy.

Child accounts with partnerships Child accounts behave differently than other New Relic accounts provisioned through your partnership: Child accounts Comments Account creation Child accounts can be created through the Partnership API or New Relic user interface. In order to group accounts through the New Relic user interface, your partnership must have Admin privileges, and the account must have the appropriate subscription level. If you have any questions about partnership privileges or subscription levels, contact your New Relic account representative. Child accounts do not have a New Relic subscription of their own. They inherit the parent account's subscription. Billing Billing is applied at the parent account level. Exception: Reseller partnerships receive consolidated billing for all accounts under the partnership. Permissions Admin-level users on a parent account have the ability to create, modify, and delete children accounts for the parent account. Users that have been granted access permissions on a parent account automatically inherit the same level of access for all children accounts. This is also true for add-on roles. Exception: Child account users won't receive alert emails or weekly report emails unless they are explicitly granted permission on these child accounts. Account users You can use the Partnership user API to add and maintain your customer users. An account must always have at least one person (the Owner) associated with it. For security purposes, you cannot change an account Owner with the Partnership user API. Instead, you must change the account Owner from the Users page in the New Relic UI. In addition, a specific user may be associated with multiple accounts. For example, many New Relic users have accounts through a partnership, and they also have accounts they created directly with New Relic. Partnership pricing Accounts within a partnership organization may have different levels of access to New Relic products. Tip Many of the Partnership API calls return a subscription status as part of the XML. For accounts set up through a partnership: An account can have multiple New Relic products associated with it. However, only one subscription per product may be active at any time. For example, a user may have both an Essentials subscription and a higher service level Pro Trial subscription. When the Pro Trial subscription expires, the service level returns to the Essentials subscription. Promotions may appear as a subscription change. Several factors affect starting and stopping subscriptions, including how New Relic handles pricing and billing.",

      "body": "Partners who implement Single Sign On have the option to enable restricted account access by requiring their customers to access New Relic via their own management application. New Relic recommends that partners who want to manage their customers' accounts directly enable this option. This option is also recommended for partners with reseller agreements. Limitations Partners who implement restricted access are responsible for providing customers with a means for upgrading, administrating, adding and removing users, etc., through the partner's product or interface. Customers who purchase New Relic subscriptions directly from New Relic are not subject to these restrictions. When a partnership enables restricted access, its accounts are subject to the following limitations: Account settings License key Direct login Account settings Customers are not allowed to access any pages in New Relic's Account settings. This prevents customers from modifying the account, changing the subscription level, viewing billing information, and adding or removing users from within New Relic. License key Customers will not be able to access their license key or download their customized newrelic.yml file on the New Relic site. If customers have applications deployed elsewhere, this helps to prevent them from reporting to their partnership accounts in New Relic. Direct login Customers may not directly log in to New Relic to access their associated partner's accounts. Account access is provided solely using SSO and controlled via the partner's website. Restricted access URLs If you elect to enable restricted partnership access, specify the following URLs in the Partnership Console: URL Description Redirect URL Enter your login page for this field. If your customers try to directly log in to the New Relic site, they will be redirected to your login page. Change subscription URL When your customers select the New Relic Subscription option, they will be redirected to the URL that you specify here. Feature unavailable URL When your customers select premium New Relic features, they will be redirected to the URL that you specify here. Logout URL When your customers log out of a New Relic session, they are redirected to this page rather than the New Relic logout page. This option works with restricted access partnerships only. Enabling restricted access Restricted access settings are controlled by New Relic. To arrange changes to your partnership's restricted access settings, contact New Relic.",

      "body": "New Relic organizations set up as partnership accounts have access to an enhanced hierarchical way of organizing their account structure. Partnerships with New Relic There are two types of New Relic organizations that are able to use our partnership account structure and the Partnership API: An actual partnership: A partnership refers to managed service providers or resellers, who offer New Relic products to their customers. Heroku is one example of such a New Relic partner. A customer partnership: some of our larger organizations also make use of our partnership account structure. We call these customers \"customer partnerships.\" Use of our partnership account structure requires prior approval and set up by New Relic representatives. For customer partnerships, New Relic contacts organizations that would benefit from such a structure. Partnerships are identified by a numeric PARTNER_ID. In some cases, a New Relic customer may have more than one partnership; for example, when one section of New Relic users must be managed differently from another. Partnerships are administered by a partnership owner account. The account that owns a partnership functions differently from a regular account. If multiple partnerships have been set up, each has a unique PARTNER_ID. Account hierarchy New Relic partnership organizations consist of the partnership owning account, partnerships, parent accounts, and child accounts. A partnership can have multiple parent and child accounts. To understand how child accounts and parent accounts scale with EU region accounts, see EU region account hierarchy. Tip If you don't have a partnership organization, you can only have one parent account. For more information, see Manage apps or users with child accounts. All parent and child accounts roll up to your partnership account. Partnership owner accounts (POA) The partnership owner account (POA) is the entity that is used to administer a partnership. It controls which users manage accounts under partnerships, have access to the partner API, and manage other aspects of the partnership. Do not monitor your own applications from the partnership owner account. Instead, create an account within the partnership and monitor apps from that account. Users on the partnership owner account can access accounts under their partnerships and enjoy User level privileges. Admins on the POA can access accounts under their partnerships and enjoy Admin level privileges, including permission to manage users. The Owner of the partnership owner account will still only have Admin level access on accounts under the partnership. That means that the owner cannot enable SAML SSO, change the account owner, cancel the account via the UI, etc. The partnership owner account enjoys special privileges, and it lets you exercise the capabilities defined in your partnership agreement with New Relic. For example, you may use your partnership owner account with the New Relic Partnership API to set up and manage users on your accounts or to view your customers' performance data in the New Relic UI. Tip Many of the Partnership API calls return an account status as part of the XML. Child accounts with partnerships Child accounts behave differently than other New Relic accounts provisioned through your partnership: Child accounts Comments Account creation Child accounts can be created through the Partnership API or New Relic user interface. In order to group accounts through the New Relic user interface, your partnership must have Admin privileges, and the account must have the appropriate subscription level.

New Relic recommends that partners who want to manage their customers' accounts directly enable this option. This option is also recommended for partners with reseller agreements. Limitations Partners who implement restricted access are responsible for providing customers with a means for upgrading, administrating, adding and removing users, etc., through the partner's product or interface. Customers who purchase New Relic subscriptions directly from New Relic are not subject to these restrictions. When a partnership enables restricted access, its accounts are subject to the following limitations: Account settings License key Direct login Account settings Customers are not allowed to access any pages in New Relic's Account settings. This prevents customers from modifying the account, changing the subscription level, viewing billing information, and adding or removing users from within New Relic. License key Customers will not be able to access their license key or download their customized newrelic.yml file on the New Relic site. If customers have applications deployed elsewhere, this helps to prevent them from reporting to their partnership accounts in New Relic. Direct login Customers may not directly log in to New Relic to access their associated partner's accounts. Account access is provided solely using SSO and controlled via the partner's website.

      "body": "New Relic organizations set up as partnership accounts have access to an enhanced hierarchical way of organizing their account structure. Partnerships with New Relic There are two types of New Relic organizations that are able to use our partnership account structure and the Partnership API: An actual partnership: A partnership refers to managed service providers or resellers, who offer New Relic products to their customers. Heroku is one example of such a New Relic partner. A customer partnership: some of our larger organizations also make use of our partnership account structure. We call these customers \"customer partnerships.\" Use of our partnership account structure requires prior approval and set up by New Relic representatives. For customer partnerships, New Relic contacts organizations that would benefit from such a structure. Partnerships are identified by a numeric PARTNER_ID. In some cases, a New Relic customer may have more than one partnership; for example, when one section of New Relic users must be managed differently from another. Partnerships are administered by a partnership owner account. The account that owns a partnership functions differently from a regular account. If multiple partnerships have been set up, each has a unique PARTNER_ID. Account hierarchy New Relic partnership organizations consist of the partnership owning account, partnerships, parent accounts, and child accounts. A partnership can have multiple parent and child accounts. To understand how child accounts and parent accounts scale with EU region accounts, see EU region account hierarchy. Tip If you don't have a partnership organization, you can only have one parent account. For more information, see Manage apps or users with child accounts. All parent and child accounts roll up to your partnership account. Partnership owner accounts (POA) The partnership owner account (POA) is the entity that is used to administer a partnership. It controls which users manage accounts under partnerships, have access to the partner API, and manage other aspects of the partnership. Do not monitor your own applications from the partnership owner account. Instead, create an account within the partnership and monitor apps from that account. Users on the partnership owner account can access accounts under their partnerships and enjoy User level privileges. Admins on the POA can access accounts under their partnerships and enjoy Admin level privileges, including permission to manage users. The Owner of the partnership owner account will still only have Admin level access on accounts under the partnership. That means that the owner cannot enable SAML SSO, change the account owner, cancel the account via the UI, etc. The partnership owner account enjoys special privileges, and it lets you exercise the capabilities defined in your partnership agreement with New Relic. For example, you may use your partnership owner account with the New Relic Partnership API to set up and manage users on your accounts or to view your customers' performance data in the New Relic UI. Tip Many of the Partnership API calls return an account status as part of the XML. Child accounts with partnerships Child accounts behave differently than other New Relic accounts provisioned through your partnership: Child accounts Comments Account creation Child accounts can be created through the Partnership API or New Relic user interface. In order to group accounts through the New Relic user interface, your partnership must have Admin privileges, and the account must have the appropriate subscription level. If you have any questions about partnership privileges or subscription levels, contact your New Relic account representative. Child accounts do not have a New Relic subscription of their own. They inherit the parent account's subscription. Billing Billing is applied at the parent account level. Exception: Reseller partnerships receive consolidated billing for all accounts under the partnership. Permissions Admin-level users on a parent account have the ability to create, modify, and delete children accounts for the parent account. Users that have been granted access permissions on a parent account automatically inherit the same level of access for all children accounts. This is also true for add-on roles. Exception: Child account users won't receive alert emails or weekly report emails unless they are explicitly granted permission on these child accounts. Account users You can use the Partnership user API to add and maintain your customer users. An account must always have at least one person (the Owner) associated with it. For security purposes, you cannot change an account Owner with the Partnership user API. Instead, you must change the account Owner from the Users page in the New Relic UI. In addition, a specific user may be associated with multiple accounts. For example, many New Relic users have accounts through a partnership, and they also have accounts they created directly with New Relic. Partnership pricing Accounts within a partnership organization may have different levels of access to New Relic products. Tip Many of the Partnership API calls return a subscription status as part of the XML. For accounts set up through a partnership: An account can have multiple New Relic products associated with it. However, only one subscription per product may be active at any time. For example, a user may have both an Essentials subscription and a higher service level Pro Trial subscription. When the Pro Trial subscription expires, the service level returns to the Essentials subscription. Promotions may appear as a subscription change. Several factors affect starting and stopping subscriptions, including how New Relic handles pricing and billing.",

      "body": "Our Partnership API allows New Relic partners, and New Relic accounts set up as customer partnerships, to manage accounts, users, and subscription-related settings. Requirements The Partnership API can be used by two types of New Relic accounts: partners (managed service providers, resellers) and customer partnerships (larger customers who have been given access to our partnership account structure). These docs are for version 2 of the Partner API. Earlier versions have been deprecated. If you have problems with an older integration, upgrade to version 2. Access to the partnership account structure and the Partnership API requires prior setup and approval by New Relic. Partnership API calls require authentication with both your partnership owner account's REST API key and your Partner ID. Accounts that are genuine New Relic partners (managed service providers, resellers) have no restrictions on using the API. Accounts set up as customer partnerships have restrictions that follow. Customer partnership restrictions If your New Relic organization is set up as a customer partnership, there are some restrictions in place if your organization is on our newer pricing model or our newer user model. Details: Pricing plan. If you’re on New Relic One pricing, you can't use API calls that govern our original pricing model. The API impacts are: You can't use the subscription object You can't use the NerdGraph Provisioning API. User model. If your New Relic account has been converted to be entirely on the New Relic One user model, you can no longer use API calls that create or govern users on our original user model. The API impacts are: You can't use the user object. Instead, you'd manage users with these user management docs. For the account object: you can't add users via the users field. Instead, you'd manage users with these user management docs. To determine your pricing model or user model, see Overview of pricing and user model changes. Password requirements Passwords passed for account creation have these requirements: 8 to 50 characters in length Only contain letters, numbers, or special characters Cannot contain spaces Must contain at least 1 letter Must contain at least 1 number or special character Things you can do Here is an overview of the API's functionality. Account: The account object is what you use to create and update accounts. You can do the following with it: Create new Show Update Cancel Show usage Set primary admin (some accounts) Set subscription (some accounts) There is also a child account object for creating child accounts. Users: Some organizations that meet the requirements can use the user object to: Add user access to account Remove user access from account Subscription: Organizations that meet the requirements and are on our original product pricing model can use the subscription object to configure various subscription-related traits.

      "body": "This doc explains how to use the Partnership API to manage subscriptions for accounts on our original pricing model. Requirements You can use the subscription object only if you're on our original pricing model. It doesn't support accounts on our New Relic One pricing model. For more on this, read the Partnership API requirements. The Partnership API doesn't allow you to upgrade or downgrade individual product subscriptions for an account. Instead, the API requires you to replace (add) the configuration for all product subscriptions for the account. If any product configurations are not included, the New Relic Partnership API provisions the account with the best free product type available. The API automatically selects the product level based on the configuration and custom pricing for the account's partnership. Subscription object attributes Before using this, first read Requirements. Here are the subscription object's attributes: product_id (REQUIRED for new subscriptions) Type: Integer Default: (none) The product ID attribute identifies the New Relic product being defined for this subscription. It is required for Create calls. quantity (REQUIRED for new subscriptions) Type: Integer Default: (none) The quantity attribute is required for Create calls, even if a product level is unlimited. The API will ignore the quantity value entered for unlimited product subscriptions, such as New Relic APM Lite. New Relic Insights, Browser, and Synthetics require you to identify a predefined usage level (product bucket). This allows the API to apply a pricing discount based on the specific quantity you select. The quantity you identify must be an exact match for the product and subscription level. For a list of available product buckets, see: Browser PageViews Insights Events Synthetics Checks promo_code Type: String Default: (none) Any related promotional code for this subscription. Not yet supported through the Partnership API's subscription endpoint. However, you can pass the promo_code as part of the subscription with the account API's Create call. data_retention (required only for Insights subscriptions) Type: Integer Default: (none) Number of weeks the Insights event information will be retained. Mapping for products (product_id) With each account creation call, you must supply at least one New Relic product type. The API only accepts the numeric product_id for the type. Important Reminder that the subscription object only applies for accounts using our original pricing model. Also, creating subscriptions for Serverless, Logs, and Traces is not supported by the Partnership API. If your account has these subscriptions, any attempt to make changes will return an error. Please contact your account executive to modify subscriptions. Important New Startup and Small Business service plans no longer are available through the New Relic Partnership API. APM The number of allowable hosts per account and the data retention period vary by subscription level within New Relic APM's pricing structure. For example, New Relic APM allows an unlimited number of allowable hosts for Lite accounts but only a 24-hour data retention period. In addition, pricing and data retention depend on whether you select pricing models based on hosts or compute units (CU). Use the product ID's integer format to identify the subscription level and type of plan. APM subscription level Product ID Lite 1 Standard 2 Standard Annual 3 Pro (Host) 4 Pro Annual (Host) 5 Enterprise 6 Enterprise Annual 7 APM Essentials (Host) 8 APM Essentials Annual (Host) 9 If you select pricing plans based on compute units (CU), use these product ID integer formats to identify the subscription level and type of plan. APM Compute Units (CU) subscription level Product ID Pro CU 26 Pro Annual CU 27 APM Essentials CU 28 APM Essentials Annual CU 29 Mobile New Relic Mobile's pricing structure allows 100,000 monthly active users per account at the Enterprise subscription level. Data retention varies by subscription level. Use the product ID's integer format to identify the subscription level. Mobile subscription level Product ID Lite 10 Enterprise 13 Enterprise Annual 14 Insights New Relic Insights bases the pricing structure on the number of allowable events stored and the associated data retention policy (for example, data retention for Insights Free is one day). Note that the data_retention attribute is required. Insights subscription level Product ID Free 15 None 16 Pro 18 Pro Annual 19 Browser New Relic Browser's pricing structure allows an unlimited number of app users, regardless of subscription level. However, the number of allowable page views per month and the data retention period vary by subscription level. For example: Lite accounts include an unlimited number of page views per month and 24-hour data retention. Pro account pricing starts at 500,000 page views per month and three months data retention. Use the product ID's integer format to identify the subscription level. Browser subscription level Product ID Lite 20 Pro 21 Pro Annual 22 Synthetics With New Relic Synthetics' pricing structure, the default number of allowable monitoring checks and the data retention period vary by subscription level. Use the product ID's integer format to identify the subscription level. Synthetics subscription level Product ID Lite 23 Pro 24 Pro Annual 25 Tip If you previously used the deprecated Partnership availability monitoring API, you can use the Synthetics API to provision a check and the REST API for New Relic Alerts to create an alert notification for your customers. Infrastructure With New Relic's Infrastructure pricing structure, the default number of instances and the data retention period vary by subscription level. Infrastructure events do not count against your New Relic Insights quota, even though you can query them in Insights. New Relic Infrastructure offers pricing plans based on Compute Units (CU) only. Use the product ID's integer format to identify the subscription level. Infrastructure subscription level Product ID Infrastructure None 31 Infrastructure Pro (CU) 32 Infrastructure Pro Annual (CU) 33 Infrastructure Essentials (CU) 34 Infrastructure Essentials Annual (CU) 35 Subscription API calls Before using this, first read Requirements. Here are the URL patterns for subscription-related API functions. If used, send them along with the JSON object and an HTTP header containing the Partner API key. For example: GET .../api/v2/partners/PARTNER_ID/accounts/ACCOUNT_ID/subscriptions x-api-key:PARTNER_ACCOUNT_KEY Content-Type: application/json { JSON data } Copy Call Resource URL pattern List (index) all subscriptions of an account. GET /api/v2/partners/PARTNER_ID/accounts/ACCOUNT_ID/subscriptions Copy Show a subscription for an account.

POST /api/v2/partners/PARTNER_ID/accounts/ACCOUNT_ID/subscriptions Copy Subscription API examples Here are examples of an API call to create an original pricing model subscription and the JSON response listing subscriptions for the account. Example subscription object { \"subscriptions\": [ { \"product_id\": 4, \"quantity\": 2 }, { \"product_id\": 13, \"quantity\": 2 } ] } Copy Example JSON response { \"id\": 1069012, \"starts_on\": \"2016-05-16\", \"expires_on\": null, \"annual_renewal_on\": null, \"products\": [ { \"product_id\": 4, \"name\": \"Pro\", \"units\": 2, \"price\": 218.0 }, { \"product_id\": 13, \"name\": \"Mobile Enterprise\", \"units\": 2, \"price\": 1500.0 }, { \"product_id\": 20, \"name\": \"Browser Lite\", \"units\": 0, \"price\": 0.0 }, { \"product_id\": 15, \"name\": \"Insights Free\", \"units\": 0, \"price\": 0.0 }, { \"product_id\": 23, \"name\": \"Synthetics Lite\", \"units\": 0, \"price\": 0.0 }, { \"product_id\": 31, \"name\": \"Infrastructure None\", \"units\": 0, \"price\": 0.0 } ] } Copy Subscription status Here are some original pricing model subscription status values that the API call may return. Subscription status Description pending The customer has signed up for a New Relic product, but payment still needs to be processed. authorized A credit card has been authorized and the vault key stored, but payment has not been captured. free This subscription is for a free New Relic product. No further processing is required. paid A payment has been captured and the next payment date has been set. payment_declined The last attempt to authorize payment failed. canceled The New Relic account has no active subscription and is not active. No payments should be authorized or captured. replaced This subscription has been superseded by another New Relic subscription.

Recommendation: Start new projects by referring to Getting started with API and the New Relic REST API v2 examples. Also, begin migrating any of your API v1 scripts to their v2 equivalent. Account creation and value storage Using the accounts/create endpoint, create an account, subscription and user. From the payload, extract and store the account values. Typically you will create a new table in your accounts database and associate the record containing this information with your user record. The values used in this scenario include data-access-key, id, and license-key. You may want to store additional values. Deploying the agent New Relic highly recommends automatically deploying the agents for your customers if your architecture and choice of languages permit. Our experience is that even the best documented and easiest user deployment of the agent results in only a 75% success rate. Auto-deploying the agent for your customers eliminates this dropout. Whether your intention is to auto-deploy or allow the user to do so, the license key from the account creation payload is required for this operation. If you are planning a manual deploy, it is helpful to make the license key easily available to your users. This is a convenience for your users. The key is available by logging into the account. Deploying the page widget with SSO Using the data access key from the newly created account and the user's email, along with the partnership shared secret and timestamp, create a digest that can be transformed into an SHA-2 hash. The elements are assembled into the widget URL. Note: As a standard security measure for data collection, New Relic requires that your application server supports SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported.",

Webinar Co-host a webinar; for example, see: Three Powerful Tools for Improving the Performance of Your Drupal Site Guest blog posts New Relic loves great blog content, and partners are often an essential source. You're encouraged to write a guest blog post for http://blog.newrelic.com. What's in it for you? It's a great opportunity for you to promote your company and the integration you've built. Our blog is popular reading for the New Relic community, and our customers are frequently among the fastest growing innovators. How does it work? You draft the post and supply screenshots and/or video as applicable. New Relic will edit, format, publish, and promote the post. You'll get credit as the author, and you can include a paragraph at the end mentioning your product. How do you create a great blog post? The goal is to be insightful, useful, thought provoking, smart, surprising, and entertaining—or at least some combination of those elements. Blog post guidelines Comments Writing style Recommendation: Write your blog post in the first person. New Relic's target audience includes developers, DevOps, IT ops, execs, marketers, and data scientists working with big data, but we have no problem attracting a wider readership than that. We want to intrigue them and help them do their jobs better and more passionately. Passion and connection are essential. If you do not care about the topic you are blogging about or, more importantly, you do not appear to care about it, neither will the reader. Length A typical blog post runs approximately 500 words, but it may be longer or shorter if there is a good reason. Technical blog posts may run much longer, while posts with video may not need much text at all. Content Each post should focus on a single main idea. If you have a mashup of multiple ideas, consider breaking them up into a series of multiple, related posts. Posts do not have to be based on the latest news, but they shouldn't pretend that old news is new. If you're writing about something that's not brand new, you need to acknowledge that and come up with a fresh take or new angle. Posts should be fact based, and not mere opinion without a grounding in reality. The magic is in the details. Posts should be grounded in specifics, not just general pronouncements. If you say something is bad, you need to describe why; for example, what can or did happen because of it. Similarly, if you suggest best practices, the more specific examples you provide, the better. Links Links to outside content are encouraged, but just pointing to something on the web is not enough for a post, no matter how interesting the link is. You need to bring something unique to the post.",

For a list of available product buckets, see: Browser PageViews Insights Events Synthetics Checks promo_code Type: String Default: (none) Any related promotional code for this subscription. Not yet supported through the Partnership API's subscription endpoint. However, you can pass the promo_code as part of the subscription with the account API's Create call. data_retention (required only for Insights subscriptions) Type: Integer Default: (none) Number of weeks the Insights event information will be retained. Mapping for products (product_id) With each account creation call, you must supply at least one New Relic product type. The API only accepts the numeric product_id for the type. Important Reminder that the subscription object only applies for accounts using our original pricing model. Also, creating subscriptions for Serverless, Logs, and Traces is not supported by the Partnership API. If your account has these subscriptions, any attempt to make changes will return an error. Please contact your account executive to modify subscriptions. Important New Startup and Small Business service plans no longer are available through the New Relic Partnership API. APM The number of allowable hosts per account and the data retention period vary by subscription level within New Relic APM's pricing structure. For example, New Relic APM allows an unlimited number of allowable hosts for Lite accounts but only a 24-hour data retention period. In addition, pricing and data retention depend on whether you select pricing models based on hosts or compute units (CU). Use the product ID's integer format to identify the subscription level and type of plan. APM subscription level Product ID Lite 1 Standard 2 Standard Annual 3 Pro (Host) 4 Pro Annual (Host) 5 Enterprise 6 Enterprise Annual 7 APM Essentials (Host) 8 APM Essentials Annual (Host) 9 If you select pricing plans based on compute units (CU), use these product ID integer formats to identify the subscription level and type of plan. APM Compute Units (CU) subscription level Product ID Pro CU 26 Pro Annual CU 27 APM Essentials CU 28 APM Essentials Annual CU 29 Mobile New Relic Mobile's pricing structure allows 100,000 monthly active users per account at the Enterprise subscription level. Data retention varies by subscription level. Use the product ID's integer format to identify the subscription level. Mobile subscription level Product ID Lite 10 Enterprise 13 Enterprise Annual 14 Insights New Relic Insights bases the pricing structure on the number of allowable events stored and the associated data retention policy (for example, data retention for Insights Free is one day). Note that the data_retention attribute is required. Insights subscription level Product ID Free 15 None 16 Pro 18 Pro Annual 19 Browser New Relic Browser's pricing structure allows an unlimited number of app users, regardless of subscription level. However, the number of allowable page views per month and the data retention period vary by subscription level. For example: Lite accounts include an unlimited number of page views per month and 24-hour data retention. Pro account pricing starts at 500,000 page views per month and three months data retention. Use the product ID's integer format to identify the subscription level. Browser subscription level Product ID Lite 20 Pro 21 Pro Annual 22 Synthetics With New Relic Synthetics' pricing structure, the default number of allowable monitoring checks and the data retention period vary by subscription level.

Synthetics subscription level Product ID Lite 23 Pro 24 Pro Annual 25 Tip If you previously used the deprecated Partnership availability monitoring API, you can use the Synthetics API to provision a check and the REST API for New Relic Alerts to create an alert notification for your customers. Infrastructure With New Relic's Infrastructure pricing structure, the default number of instances and the data retention period vary by subscription level. Infrastructure events do not count against your New Relic Insights quota, even though you can query them in Insights. New Relic Infrastructure offers pricing plans based on Compute Units (CU) only.

Recommendation: Start new projects by referring to Getting started with API and the New Relic REST API v2 examples. Also, begin migrating any of your API v1 scripts to their v2 equivalent. Account creation and value storage Using the accounts/create endpoint, create an account, subscription and user. From the payload, extract and store the account values. Typically you will create a new table in your accounts database and associate the record containing this information with your user record. The values used in this scenario include data-access-key, id, and license-key. You may want to store additional values. Deploying the agent New Relic highly recommends automatically deploying the agents for your customers if your architecture and choice of languages permit. Our experience is that even the best documented and easiest user deployment of the agent results in only a 75% success rate. Auto-deploying the agent for your customers eliminates this dropout. Whether your intention is to auto-deploy or allow the user to do so, the license key from the account creation payload is required for this operation. If you are planning a manual deploy, it is helpful to make the license key easily available to your users. This is a convenience for your users. The key is available by logging into the account. Deploying the page widget with SSO Using the data access key from the newly created account and the user's email, along with the partnership shared secret and timestamp, create a digest that can be transformed into an SHA-2 hash. The elements are assembled into the widget URL. Note: As a standard security measure for data collection, New Relic requires that your application server supports SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported.",

      "body": "This doc explains how to use the Partnership API to manage accounts. For child accounts, you'd use the child account object. Requirements You may not be able to use some aspects of this object. Before using, first read the requirements. Account object attributes Here are the Partnership API account object's attributes. name (REQUIRED to create an account) Type: String Default: (none) The account name attribute is required for new accounts. This name must be unique in New Relic's database. If the specified name is not unique, it will be auto-incremented with a numeric suffix as follows: conflicting_name_1 conflicting_name_2 etc. Copy phone_number Type: String Default: (none) Primary contact phone number for the account. allow_api_access Type: Boolean Default: False This flag allows API access to application data. This must be set to true for partnerships remotely administering accounts. testing Type: Boolean Default: False Use this flag to indicate a test account. Test accounts are assumed to contain garbage data and are ignored by internal systems. The data they generate may be deleted at any time. users (REQUIRED for some accounts) Type: Array Default: (none) An array defining a list of users. There are some restrictions in place dependent on the status of your account: For customer partnerships who have switched to the New Relic One user model: do not define users. If you add users with this field, they will be ignored. Instead, to add users, you'd use these user management procedures. For all other accounts, which have users on our original user model: When you first create an account, this field is required, and only one user can be defined: the account Owner. To add additional users, use the Partnership API user object. For more on restrictions, read the Requirements. subscriptions (REQUIRED for some accounts) Type: Array Default: (none) An array defining a list of subscriptions. There are some restrictions in place dependent on the status of your account: For customer partnerships on our New Relic One pricing model: ignore this field because it applies to the original pricing model, not yours. If you use this, it will be ignored. For all other accounts: You are on our original product-based pricing model. The subscriptions attribute is required for new accounts. If it is empty, default product tiers will be used. To update subscription information, use the Partnership API subscription object. Important When creating an account with this object, it can take some time for the account settings to populate. This means that the returned response may initially show aspects that are not true (for example, it may return a response showing default Lite subscriptions). To specify an empty JSON array, don't use subscriptions: [ {} ]. Instead, use this format: subscriptions: [ ] Copy The account API does not include an attribute to create a child account. Instead, to create child accounts, use the parent account's Account settings page in the New Relic UI. Account API calls Here are the URL patterns for account API functions. If using this URL pattern, send an HTTP header containing the Partner API key along with the JSON request body. For example: GET .../api/v2/partners/:PARTNER_ID/accounts/:ID x-api-key: :PARTNER_ACCOUNT_KEY Content-Type: application/json { JSON data } Copy Call Resource URL pattern List (index) all accounts of a partner. GET /api/v2/partners/PARTNER_ID/accounts Copy Show the attributes of an account. GET /api/v2/partners/PARTNER_ID/accounts/:ID Copy Update the attributes of an account. PUT /api/v2/partners/PARTNER_ID/accounts/:ID Copy Create an account with the given parameters. POST /api/v2/partners/PARTNER_ID/accounts Copy Cancel an account. DELETE /api/v2/partners/PARTNER_ID/accounts/:ID Copy Status definitions When an account is created or listed with an API call, the account status is included automatically. Some of these statuses don't apply to all pricing models. Account status Definition pending Free account created, but primary admin is not yet activated. paid_pending Account created with a paid subscription, but the primary admin is not yet activated. new Free account, active primary admin, no application data has been collected. paid_new Paid subscription, active primary admin, no application data has been collected. active Free subscription, receiving application data. paid_active Paid subscription, receiving application data. upgraded Account's subscription was upgraded. downgraded Account's subscription was downgraded. cancelled The New Relic account subscription has been cancelled. suspended The New Relic account has been suspended because the primary admin has not validated their email address. JSON example Here is an example of a JSON request and response using the Partnership API account object. Note that this is just an example, and that for some accounts, the users and subscriptions attributes are unnecessary and are ignored.

      "body": "This doc explains how to use the Partnership API to manage subscriptions for accounts on our original pricing model. Requirements You can use the subscription object only if you're on our original pricing model. It doesn't support accounts on our New Relic One pricing model. For more on this, read the Partnership API requirements. The Partnership API doesn't allow you to upgrade or downgrade individual product subscriptions for an account. Instead, the API requires you to replace (add) the configuration for all product subscriptions for the account. If any product configurations are not included, the New Relic Partnership API provisions the account with the best free product type available. The API automatically selects the product level based on the configuration and custom pricing for the account's partnership. Subscription object attributes Before using this, first read Requirements. Here are the subscription object's attributes: product_id (REQUIRED for new subscriptions) Type: Integer Default: (none) The product ID attribute identifies the New Relic product being defined for this subscription. It is required for Create calls. quantity (REQUIRED for new subscriptions) Type: Integer Default: (none) The quantity attribute is required for Create calls, even if a product level is unlimited. The API will ignore the quantity value entered for unlimited product subscriptions, such as New Relic APM Lite. New Relic Insights, Browser, and Synthetics require you to identify a predefined usage level (product bucket). This allows the API to apply a pricing discount based on the specific quantity you select. The quantity you identify must be an exact match for the product and subscription level. For a list of available product buckets, see: Browser PageViews Insights Events Synthetics Checks promo_code Type: String Default: (none) Any related promotional code for this subscription. Not yet supported through the Partnership API's subscription endpoint. However, you can pass the promo_code as part of the subscription with the account API's Create call. data_retention (required only for Insights subscriptions) Type: Integer Default: (none) Number of weeks the Insights event information will be retained. Mapping for products (product_id) With each account creation call, you must supply at least one New Relic product type. The API only accepts the numeric product_id for the type. Important Reminder that the subscription object only applies for accounts using our original pricing model. Also, creating subscriptions for Serverless, Logs, and Traces is not supported by the Partnership API. If your account has these subscriptions, any attempt to make changes will return an error. Please contact your account executive to modify subscriptions. Important New Startup and Small Business service plans no longer are available through the New Relic Partnership API. APM The number of allowable hosts per account and the data retention period vary by subscription level within New Relic APM's pricing structure. For example, New Relic APM allows an unlimited number of allowable hosts for Lite accounts but only a 24-hour data retention period. In addition, pricing and data retention depend on whether you select pricing models based on hosts or compute units (CU). Use the product ID's integer format to identify the subscription level and type of plan. APM subscription level Product ID Lite 1 Standard 2 Standard Annual 3 Pro (Host) 4 Pro Annual (Host) 5 Enterprise 6 Enterprise Annual 7 APM Essentials (Host) 8 APM Essentials Annual (Host) 9 If you select pricing plans based on compute units (CU), use these product ID integer formats to identify the subscription level and type of plan. APM Compute Units (CU) subscription level Product ID Pro CU 26 Pro Annual CU 27 APM Essentials CU 28 APM Essentials Annual CU 29 Mobile New Relic Mobile's pricing structure allows 100,000 monthly active users per account at the Enterprise subscription level. Data retention varies by subscription level. Use the product ID's integer format to identify the subscription level. Mobile subscription level Product ID Lite 10 Enterprise 13 Enterprise Annual 14 Insights New Relic Insights bases the pricing structure on the number of allowable events stored and the associated data retention policy (for example, data retention for Insights Free is one day). Note that the data_retention attribute is required. Insights subscription level Product ID Free 15 None 16 Pro 18 Pro Annual 19 Browser New Relic Browser's pricing structure allows an unlimited number of app users, regardless of subscription level. However, the number of allowable page views per month and the data retention period vary by subscription level. For example: Lite accounts include an unlimited number of page views per month and 24-hour data retention. Pro account pricing starts at 500,000 page views per month and three months data retention. Use the product ID's integer format to identify the subscription level. Browser subscription level Product ID Lite 20 Pro 21 Pro Annual 22 Synthetics With New Relic Synthetics' pricing structure, the default number of allowable monitoring checks and the data retention period vary by subscription level. Use the product ID's integer format to identify the subscription level. Synthetics subscription level Product ID Lite 23 Pro 24 Pro Annual 25 Tip If you previously used the deprecated Partnership availability monitoring API, you can use the Synthetics API to provision a check and the REST API for New Relic Alerts to create an alert notification for your customers. Infrastructure With New Relic's Infrastructure pricing structure, the default number of instances and the data retention period vary by subscription level. Infrastructure events do not count against your New Relic Insights quota, even though you can query them in Insights. New Relic Infrastructure offers pricing plans based on Compute Units (CU) only. Use the product ID's integer format to identify the subscription level. Infrastructure subscription level Product ID Infrastructure None 31 Infrastructure Pro (CU) 32 Infrastructure Pro Annual (CU) 33 Infrastructure Essentials (CU) 34 Infrastructure Essentials Annual (CU) 35 Subscription API calls Before using this, first read Requirements. Here are the URL patterns for subscription-related API functions. If used, send them along with the JSON object and an HTTP header containing the Partner API key. For example: GET .../api/v2/partners/PARTNER_ID/accounts/ACCOUNT_ID/subscriptions x-api-key:PARTNER_ACCOUNT_KEY Content-Type: application/json { JSON data } Copy Call Resource URL pattern List (index) all subscriptions of an account. GET /api/v2/partners/PARTNER_ID/accounts/ACCOUNT_ID/subscriptions Copy Show a subscription for an account. GET /api/v2/partners/PARTNER_ID/accounts/ACCOUNT_ID/subscriptions/ID Copy Replace the current subscription level with a new subscription. POST /api/v2/partners/PARTNER_ID/accounts/ACCOUNT_ID/subscriptions Copy Subscription API examples Here are examples of an API call to create an original pricing model subscription and the JSON response listing subscriptions for the account. Example subscription object { \"subscriptions\": [ { \"product_id\": 4, \"quantity\": 2 }, { \"product_id\": 13, \"quantity\": 2 } ] } Copy Example JSON response { \"id\": 1069012, \"starts_on\": \"2016-05-16\", \"expires_on\": null, \"annual_renewal_on\": null, \"products\": [ { \"product_id\": 4, \"name\": \"Pro\", \"units\": 2, \"price\": 218.0 }, { \"product_id\": 13, \"name\": \"Mobile Enterprise\", \"units\": 2, \"price\": 1500.0 }, { \"product_id\": 20, \"name\": \"Browser Lite\", \"units\": 0, \"price\": 0.0 }, { \"product_id\": 15, \"name\": \"Insights Free\", \"units\": 0, \"price\": 0.0 }, { \"product_id\": 23, \"name\": \"Synthetics Lite\", \"units\": 0, \"price\": 0.0 }, { \"product_id\": 31, \"name\": \"Infrastructure None\", \"units\": 0, \"price\": 0.0 } ] } Copy Subscription status Here are some original pricing model subscription status values that the API call may return. Subscription status Description pending The customer has signed up for a New Relic product, but payment still needs to be processed. authorized A credit card has been authorized and the vault key stored, but payment has not been captured. free This subscription is for a free New Relic product. No further processing is required. paid A payment has been captured and the next payment date has been set. payment_declined The last attempt to authorize payment failed. canceled The New Relic account has no active subscription and is not active. No payments should be authorized or captured. replaced This subscription has been superseded by another New Relic subscription.

      "body": "This doc explains how to use the Partnership API to manage child accounts. For accounts, you'd use the child account object. Requirements You may not have access to using this object. Before using the Partnership API, first read the requirements. Introduction to using child accounts Some notes about using the child account object: To manage existing parent accounts or child accounts, use the Partnership API account object. A parent account may have more than one associated child account, but every chld account must correspond to one and only one parent account. Every child account must have at least a primary_admin user. You cannot create a child account without connecting it to an existing parent account and adding at least one user. Child account object attributes Before using the Partnership API, first read the requirements. Here are the Partnership API child account object's attributes: name (REQUIRED) Type: String Default: (none) This name must be unique in New Relic's database. If the specified name is not unique, it will be auto-incremented with a numeric suffix as follows: conflicting_name_1 conflicting_name_2 etc. Copy allow_api_access Type: Boolean Default: False This flag allows API access to application data. This must be set to true for partnerships remotely administering accounts. testing Type: Boolean Default: False Use this flag to indicate a test account. Test accounts are assumed to contain garbage data and are ignored by internal systems. The data they generate may be deleted at any time. users (REQUIRED for some accounts) Type: Array Default: (none) An array defining a list of users. There are some restrictions in place dependent on the status of your account: For customer partnerships who have switched to the New Relic One user model: do not define users. If you add users with this field, they will be ignored. Instead, to add users, you'd use these user management procedures. For all other accounts, which have users on our original user model: When you create the child account, you can define only one user: the account Owner. To add additional users, use the Partnership API user object. For more about restrictions, read the Requirements. password (REQUIRED) Type: String Default: (none) If you are creating a child account with an existing user as the account Owner, the password must match the user's current password. For some New Relic organizations, child accounts can also be created via the parent account's Account settings page in the New Relic UI. Child account API calls Here is the URL pattern to create child accounts. Notice that the Parent Account ID must be specified. If using this URL pattern, send the JSON object along with an HTTP header containing the Partner API key. For example: POST .../api/v2/partners/PARTNER_ID/accounts/PARENT_ACCOUNT_ID/sub_accounts​ x-api-key:PARTNER_ACCOUNT_KEY Content-Type: application/json { JSON data } Copy Call Resource URL pattern Create a child account with the given parameters. POST /api/v2/partners/PARTNER_ID/accounts/PARENT_ACCOUNT_ID/sub_accounts Copy JSON example Here is an example of a JSON request and response using the Partnership API child account object. Note that this is just an example, and that for some accounts, the users attribute is unnecessary and will be ignored.

      "body": "This doc explains how to use the Partnership API to manage subscriptions for accounts on our original pricing model. Requirements You can use the subscription object only if you're on our original pricing model. It doesn't support accounts on our New Relic One pricing model. For more on this, read the Partnership API requirements. The Partnership API doesn't allow you to upgrade or downgrade individual product subscriptions for an account. Instead, the API requires you to replace (add) the configuration for all product subscriptions for the account. If any product configurations are not included, the New Relic Partnership API provisions the account with the best free product type available. The API automatically selects the product level based on the configuration and custom pricing for the account's partnership. Subscription object attributes Before using this, first read Requirements. Here are the subscription object's attributes: product_id (REQUIRED for new subscriptions) Type: Integer Default: (none) The product ID attribute identifies the New Relic product being defined for this subscription. It is required for Create calls. quantity (REQUIRED for new subscriptions) Type: Integer Default: (none) The quantity attribute is required for Create calls, even if a product level is unlimited. The API will ignore the quantity value entered for unlimited product subscriptions, such as New Relic APM Lite. New Relic Insights, Browser, and Synthetics require you to identify a predefined usage level (product bucket). This allows the API to apply a pricing discount based on the specific quantity you select. The quantity you identify must be an exact match for the product and subscription level. For a list of available product buckets, see: Browser PageViews Insights Events Synthetics Checks promo_code Type: String Default: (none) Any related promotional code for this subscription. Not yet supported through the Partnership API's subscription endpoint. However, you can pass the promo_code as part of the subscription with the account API's Create call. data_retention (required only for Insights subscriptions) Type: Integer Default: (none) Number of weeks the Insights event information will be retained. Mapping for products (product_id) With each account creation call, you must supply at least one New Relic product type. The API only accepts the numeric product_id for the type. Important Reminder that the subscription object only applies for accounts using our original pricing model. Also, creating subscriptions for Serverless, Logs, and Traces is not supported by the Partnership API. If your account has these subscriptions, any attempt to make changes will return an error. Please contact your account executive to modify subscriptions. Important New Startup and Small Business service plans no longer are available through the New Relic Partnership API. APM The number of allowable hosts per account and the data retention period vary by subscription level within New Relic APM's pricing structure. For example, New Relic APM allows an unlimited number of allowable hosts for Lite accounts but only a 24-hour data retention period. In addition, pricing and data retention depend on whether you select pricing models based on hosts or compute units (CU). Use the product ID's integer format to identify the subscription level and type of plan. APM subscription level Product ID Lite 1 Standard 2 Standard Annual 3 Pro (Host) 4 Pro Annual (Host) 5 Enterprise 6 Enterprise Annual 7 APM Essentials (Host) 8 APM Essentials Annual (Host) 9 If you select pricing plans based on compute units (CU), use these product ID integer formats to identify the subscription level and type of plan. APM Compute Units (CU) subscription level Product ID Pro CU 26 Pro Annual CU 27 APM Essentials CU 28 APM Essentials Annual CU 29 Mobile New Relic Mobile's pricing structure allows 100,000 monthly active users per account at the Enterprise subscription level. Data retention varies by subscription level. Use the product ID's integer format to identify the subscription level. Mobile subscription level Product ID Lite 10 Enterprise 13 Enterprise Annual 14 Insights New Relic Insights bases the pricing structure on the number of allowable events stored and the associated data retention policy (for example, data retention for Insights Free is one day). Note that the data_retention attribute is required. Insights subscription level Product ID Free 15 None 16 Pro 18 Pro Annual 19 Browser New Relic Browser's pricing structure allows an unlimited number of app users, regardless of subscription level. However, the number of allowable page views per month and the data retention period vary by subscription level. For example: Lite accounts include an unlimited number of page views per month and 24-hour data retention. Pro account pricing starts at 500,000 page views per month and three months data retention. Use the product ID's integer format to identify the subscription level. Browser subscription level Product ID Lite 20 Pro 21 Pro Annual 22 Synthetics With New Relic Synthetics' pricing structure, the default number of allowable monitoring checks and the data retention period vary by subscription level. Use the product ID's integer format to identify the subscription level. Synthetics subscription level Product ID Lite 23 Pro 24 Pro Annual 25 Tip If you previously used the deprecated Partnership availability monitoring API, you can use the Synthetics API to provision a check and the REST API for New Relic Alerts to create an alert notification for your customers. Infrastructure With New Relic's Infrastructure pricing structure, the default number of instances and the data retention period vary by subscription level. Infrastructure events do not count against your New Relic Insights quota, even though you can query them in Insights. New Relic Infrastructure offers pricing plans based on Compute Units (CU) only. Use the product ID's integer format to identify the subscription level. Infrastructure subscription level Product ID Infrastructure None 31 Infrastructure Pro (CU) 32 Infrastructure Pro Annual (CU) 33 Infrastructure Essentials (CU) 34 Infrastructure Essentials Annual (CU) 35 Subscription API calls Before using this, first read Requirements. Here are the URL patterns for subscription-related API functions. If used, send them along with the JSON object and an HTTP header containing the Partner API key. For example: GET .../api/v2/partners/PARTNER_ID/accounts/ACCOUNT_ID/subscriptions x-api-key:PARTNER_ACCOUNT_KEY Content-Type: application/json { JSON data } Copy Call Resource URL pattern List (index) all subscriptions of an account. GET /api/v2/partners/PARTNER_ID/accounts/ACCOUNT_ID/subscriptions Copy Show a subscription for an account.

POST /api/v2/partners/PARTNER_ID/accounts/ACCOUNT_ID/subscriptions Copy Subscription API examples Here are examples of an API call to create an original pricing model subscription and the JSON response listing subscriptions for the account. Example subscription object { \"subscriptions\": [ { \"product_id\": 4, \"quantity\": 2 }, { \"product_id\": 13, \"quantity\": 2 } ] } Copy Example JSON response { \"id\": 1069012, \"starts_on\": \"2016-05-16\", \"expires_on\": null, \"annual_renewal_on\": null, \"products\": [ { \"product_id\": 4, \"name\": \"Pro\", \"units\": 2, \"price\": 218.0 }, { \"product_id\": 13, \"name\": \"Mobile Enterprise\", \"units\": 2, \"price\": 1500.0 }, { \"product_id\": 20, \"name\": \"Browser Lite\", \"units\": 0, \"price\": 0.0 }, { \"product_id\": 15, \"name\": \"Insights Free\", \"units\": 0, \"price\": 0.0 }, { \"product_id\": 23, \"name\": \"Synthetics Lite\", \"units\": 0, \"price\": 0.0 }, { \"product_id\": 31, \"name\": \"Infrastructure None\", \"units\": 0, \"price\": 0.0 } ] } Copy Subscription status Here are some original pricing model subscription status values that the API call may return. Subscription status Description pending The customer has signed up for a New Relic product, but payment still needs to be processed. authorized A credit card has been authorized and the vault key stored, but payment has not been captured. free This subscription is for a free New Relic product. No further processing is required. paid A payment has been captured and the next payment date has been set. payment_declined The last attempt to authorize payment failed. canceled The New Relic account has no active subscription and is not active. No payments should be authorized or captured. replaced This subscription has been superseded by another New Relic subscription.

      "body": "This doc explains how to use the Partnership API to manage accounts. For child accounts, you'd use the child account object. Requirements You may not be able to use some aspects of this object. Before using, first read the requirements. Account object attributes Here are the Partnership API account object's attributes. name (REQUIRED to create an account) Type: String Default: (none) The account name attribute is required for new accounts. This name must be unique in New Relic's database. If the specified name is not unique, it will be auto-incremented with a numeric suffix as follows: conflicting_name_1 conflicting_name_2 etc. Copy phone_number Type: String Default: (none) Primary contact phone number for the account. allow_api_access Type: Boolean Default: False This flag allows API access to application data. This must be set to true for partnerships remotely administering accounts. testing Type: Boolean Default: False Use this flag to indicate a test account. Test accounts are assumed to contain garbage data and are ignored by internal systems. The data they generate may be deleted at any time. users (REQUIRED for some accounts) Type: Array Default: (none) An array defining a list of users. There are some restrictions in place dependent on the status of your account: For customer partnerships who have switched to the New Relic One user model: do not define users. If you add users with this field, they will be ignored. Instead, to add users, you'd use these user management procedures. For all other accounts, which have users on our original user model: When you first create an account, this field is required, and only one user can be defined: the account Owner. To add additional users, use the Partnership API user object. For more on restrictions, read the Requirements. subscriptions (REQUIRED for some accounts) Type: Array Default: (none) An array defining a list of subscriptions. There are some restrictions in place dependent on the status of your account: For customer partnerships on our New Relic One pricing model: ignore this field because it applies to the original pricing model, not yours. If you use this, it will be ignored. For all other accounts: You are on our original product-based pricing model. The subscriptions attribute is required for new accounts. If it is empty, default product tiers will be used. To update subscription information, use the Partnership API subscription object. Important When creating an account with this object, it can take some time for the account settings to populate. This means that the returned response may initially show aspects that are not true (for example, it may return a response showing default Lite subscriptions). To specify an empty JSON array, don't use subscriptions: [ {} ]. Instead, use this format: subscriptions: [ ] Copy The account API does not include an attribute to create a child account. Instead, to create child accounts, use the parent account's Account settings page in the New Relic UI. Account API calls Here are the URL patterns for account API functions. If using this URL pattern, send an HTTP header containing the Partner API key along with the JSON request body. For example: GET .../api/v2/partners/:PARTNER_ID/accounts/:ID x-api-key: :PARTNER_ACCOUNT_KEY Content-Type: application/json { JSON data } Copy Call Resource URL pattern List (index) all accounts of a partner. GET /api/v2/partners/PARTNER_ID/accounts Copy Show the attributes of an account. GET /api/v2/partners/PARTNER_ID/accounts/:ID Copy Update the attributes of an account.

      "body": "This doc explains how to use the Partnership API to manage subscriptions for accounts on our original pricing model. Requirements You can use the subscription object only if you're on our original pricing model. It doesn't support accounts on our New Relic One pricing model. For more on this, read the Partnership API requirements. The Partnership API doesn't allow you to upgrade or downgrade individual product subscriptions for an account. Instead, the API requires you to replace (add) the configuration for all product subscriptions for the account. If any product configurations are not included, the New Relic Partnership API provisions the account with the best free product type available. The API automatically selects the product level based on the configuration and custom pricing for the account's partnership. Subscription object attributes Before using this, first read Requirements. Here are the subscription object's attributes: product_id (REQUIRED for new subscriptions) Type: Integer Default: (none) The product ID attribute identifies the New Relic product being defined for this subscription. It is required for Create calls. quantity (REQUIRED for new subscriptions) Type: Integer Default: (none) The quantity attribute is required for Create calls, even if a product level is unlimited. The API will ignore the quantity value entered for unlimited product subscriptions, such as New Relic APM Lite. New Relic Insights, Browser, and Synthetics require you to identify a predefined usage level (product bucket). This allows the API to apply a pricing discount based on the specific quantity you select. The quantity you identify must be an exact match for the product and subscription level. For a list of available product buckets, see: Browser PageViews Insights Events Synthetics Checks promo_code Type: String Default: (none) Any related promotional code for this subscription. Not yet supported through the Partnership API's subscription endpoint. However, you can pass the promo_code as part of the subscription with the account API's Create call. data_retention (required only for Insights subscriptions) Type: Integer Default: (none) Number of weeks the Insights event information will be retained. Mapping for products (product_id) With each account creation call, you must supply at least one New Relic product type. The API only accepts the numeric product_id for the type. Important Reminder that the subscription object only applies for accounts using our original pricing model. Also, creating subscriptions for Serverless, Logs, and Traces is not supported by the Partnership API. If your account has these subscriptions, any attempt to make changes will return an error. Please contact your account executive to modify subscriptions. Important New Startup and Small Business service plans no longer are available through the New Relic Partnership API. APM The number of allowable hosts per account and the data retention period vary by subscription level within New Relic APM's pricing structure. For example, New Relic APM allows an unlimited number of allowable hosts for Lite accounts but only a 24-hour data retention period. In addition, pricing and data retention depend on whether you select pricing models based on hosts or compute units (CU). Use the product ID's integer format to identify the subscription level and type of plan. APM subscription level Product ID Lite 1 Standard 2 Standard Annual 3 Pro (Host) 4 Pro Annual (Host) 5 Enterprise 6 Enterprise Annual 7 APM Essentials (Host) 8 APM Essentials Annual (Host) 9 If you select pricing plans based on compute units (CU), use these product ID integer formats to identify the subscription level and type of plan. APM Compute Units (CU) subscription level Product ID Pro CU 26 Pro Annual CU 27 APM Essentials CU 28 APM Essentials Annual CU 29 Mobile New Relic Mobile's pricing structure allows 100,000 monthly active users per account at the Enterprise subscription level. Data retention varies by subscription level. Use the product ID's integer format to identify the subscription level. Mobile subscription level Product ID Lite 10 Enterprise 13 Enterprise Annual 14 Insights New Relic Insights bases the pricing structure on the number of allowable events stored and the associated data retention policy (for example, data retention for Insights Free is one day). Note that the data_retention attribute is required. Insights subscription level Product ID Free 15 None 16 Pro 18 Pro Annual 19 Browser New Relic Browser's pricing structure allows an unlimited number of app users, regardless of subscription level. However, the number of allowable page views per month and the data retention period vary by subscription level. For example: Lite accounts include an unlimited number of page views per month and 24-hour data retention. Pro account pricing starts at 500,000 page views per month and three months data retention. Use the product ID's integer format to identify the subscription level. Browser subscription level Product ID Lite 20 Pro 21 Pro Annual 22 Synthetics With New Relic Synthetics' pricing structure, the default number of allowable monitoring checks and the data retention period vary by subscription level. Use the product ID's integer format to identify the subscription level. Synthetics subscription level Product ID Lite 23 Pro 24 Pro Annual 25 Tip If you previously used the deprecated Partnership availability monitoring API, you can use the Synthetics API to provision a check and the REST API for New Relic Alerts to create an alert notification for your customers. Infrastructure With New Relic's Infrastructure pricing structure, the default number of instances and the data retention period vary by subscription level. Infrastructure events do not count against your New Relic Insights quota, even though you can query them in Insights. New Relic Infrastructure offers pricing plans based on Compute Units (CU) only. Use the product ID's integer format to identify the subscription level. Infrastructure subscription level Product ID Infrastructure None 31 Infrastructure Pro (CU) 32 Infrastructure Pro Annual (CU) 33 Infrastructure Essentials (CU) 34 Infrastructure Essentials Annual (CU) 35 Subscription API calls Before using this, first read Requirements. Here are the URL patterns for subscription-related API functions. If used, send them along with the JSON object and an HTTP header containing the Partner API key. For example: GET .../api/v2/partners/PARTNER_ID/accounts/ACCOUNT_ID/subscriptions x-api-key:PARTNER_ACCOUNT_KEY Content-Type: application/json { JSON data } Copy Call Resource URL pattern List (index) all subscriptions of an account. GET /api/v2/partners/PARTNER_ID/accounts/ACCOUNT_ID/subscriptions Copy Show a subscription for an account. GET /api/v2/partners/PARTNER_ID/accounts/ACCOUNT_ID/subscriptions/ID Copy Replace the current subscription level with a new subscription. POST /api/v2/partners/PARTNER_ID/accounts/ACCOUNT_ID/subscriptions Copy Subscription API examples Here are examples of an API call to create an original pricing model subscription and the JSON response listing subscriptions for the account. Example subscription object { \"subscriptions\": [ { \"product_id\": 4, \"quantity\": 2 }, { \"product_id\": 13, \"quantity\": 2 } ] } Copy Example JSON response { \"id\": 1069012, \"starts_on\": \"2016-05-16\", \"expires_on\": null, \"annual_renewal_on\": null, \"products\": [ { \"product_id\": 4, \"name\": \"Pro\", \"units\": 2, \"price\": 218.0 }, { \"product_id\": 13, \"name\": \"Mobile Enterprise\", \"units\": 2, \"price\": 1500.0 }, { \"product_id\": 20, \"name\": \"Browser Lite\", \"units\": 0, \"price\": 0.0 }, { \"product_id\": 15, \"name\": \"Insights Free\", \"units\": 0, \"price\": 0.0 }, { \"product_id\": 23, \"name\": \"Synthetics Lite\", \"units\": 0, \"price\": 0.0 }, { \"product_id\": 31, \"name\": \"Infrastructure None\", \"units\": 0, \"price\": 0.0 } ] } Copy Subscription status Here are some original pricing model subscription status values that the API call may return. Subscription status Description pending The customer has signed up for a New Relic product, but payment still needs to be processed. authorized A credit card has been authorized and the vault key stored, but payment has not been captured. free This subscription is for a free New Relic product. No further processing is required. paid A payment has been captured and the next payment date has been set. payment_declined The last attempt to authorize payment failed. canceled The New Relic account has no active subscription and is not active. No payments should be authorized or captured. replaced This subscription has been superseded by another New Relic subscription. API examples (v2) Here are API example requests and responses to list, show, create, and update original pricing model subscriptions. Line breaks in responses are for readability. The actual responses appear as a continuous line.

      "body": "This doc explains how to use the Partnership API to manage accounts. For child accounts, you'd use the child account object. Requirements You may not be able to use some aspects of this object. Before using, first read the requirements. Account object attributes Here are the Partnership API account object's attributes. name (REQUIRED to create an account) Type: String Default: (none) The account name attribute is required for new accounts. This name must be unique in New Relic's database. If the specified name is not unique, it will be auto-incremented with a numeric suffix as follows: conflicting_name_1 conflicting_name_2 etc. Copy phone_number Type: String Default: (none) Primary contact phone number for the account. allow_api_access Type: Boolean Default: False This flag allows API access to application data. This must be set to true for partnerships remotely administering accounts. testing Type: Boolean Default: False Use this flag to indicate a test account. Test accounts are assumed to contain garbage data and are ignored by internal systems. The data they generate may be deleted at any time. users (REQUIRED for some accounts) Type: Array Default: (none) An array defining a list of users. There are some restrictions in place dependent on the status of your account: For customer partnerships who have switched to the New Relic One user model: do not define users. If you add users with this field, they will be ignored. Instead, to add users, you'd use these user management procedures. For all other accounts, which have users on our original user model: When you first create an account, this field is required, and only one user can be defined: the account Owner. To add additional users, use the Partnership API user object. For more on restrictions, read the Requirements. subscriptions (REQUIRED for some accounts) Type: Array Default: (none) An array defining a list of subscriptions. There are some restrictions in place dependent on the status of your account: For customer partnerships on our New Relic One pricing model: ignore this field because it applies to the original pricing model, not yours. If you use this, it will be ignored. For all other accounts: You are on our original product-based pricing model. The subscriptions attribute is required for new accounts. If it is empty, default product tiers will be used. To update subscription information, use the Partnership API subscription object. Important When creating an account with this object, it can take some time for the account settings to populate. This means that the returned response may initially show aspects that are not true (for example, it may return a response showing default Lite subscriptions). To specify an empty JSON array, don't use subscriptions: [ {} ]. Instead, use this format: subscriptions: [ ] Copy The account API does not include an attribute to create a child account. Instead, to create child accounts, use the parent account's Account settings page in the New Relic UI. Account API calls Here are the URL patterns for account API functions. If using this URL pattern, send an HTTP header containing the Partner API key along with the JSON request body. For example: GET .../api/v2/partners/:PARTNER_ID/accounts/:ID x-api-key: :PARTNER_ACCOUNT_KEY Content-Type: application/json { JSON data } Copy Call Resource URL pattern List (index) all accounts of a partner. GET /api/v2/partners/PARTNER_ID/accounts Copy Show the attributes of an account. GET /api/v2/partners/PARTNER_ID/accounts/:ID Copy Update the attributes of an account. PUT /api/v2/partners/PARTNER_ID/accounts/:ID Copy Create an account with the given parameters. POST /api/v2/partners/PARTNER_ID/accounts Copy Cancel an account. DELETE /api/v2/partners/PARTNER_ID/accounts/:ID Copy Status definitions When an account is created or listed with an API call, the account status is included automatically. Some of these statuses don't apply to all pricing models. Account status Definition pending Free account created, but primary admin is not yet activated. paid_pending Account created with a paid subscription, but the primary admin is not yet activated. new Free account, active primary admin, no application data has been collected. paid_new Paid subscription, active primary admin, no application data has been collected. active Free subscription, receiving application data. paid_active Paid subscription, receiving application data. upgraded Account's subscription was upgraded. downgraded Account's subscription was downgraded. cancelled The New Relic account subscription has been cancelled. suspended The New Relic account has been suspended because the primary admin has not validated their email address. JSON example Here is an example of a JSON request and response using the Partnership API account object. Note that this is just an example, and that for some accounts, the users and subscriptions attributes are unnecessary and are ignored.

This doc explains some details for using the Browser, Synthetics, and Insights products. Requirements This doc applies only for partnership accounts on our original pricing model. Before using this API, please read the Partnership API requirements. Overview (#overview) When using the Partnership API for Insights, Browser, and Synthetics products, you must provide a valid quantity value. This indicates the number of Insights Events, Browser PageViews, and Synthetics Checks provisioned to that account.

      "body": "This doc explains how to use the Partnership API to manage accounts. For child accounts, you'd use the child account object. Requirements You may not be able to use some aspects of this object. Before using, first read the requirements. Account object attributes Here are the Partnership API account object's attributes. name (REQUIRED to create an account) Type: String Default: (none) The account name attribute is required for new accounts. This name must be unique in New Relic's database. If the specified name is not unique, it will be auto-incremented with a numeric suffix as follows: conflicting_name_1 conflicting_name_2 etc. Copy phone_number Type: String Default: (none) Primary contact phone number for the account. allow_api_access Type: Boolean Default: False This flag allows API access to application data. This must be set to true for partnerships remotely administering accounts. testing Type: Boolean Default: False Use this flag to indicate a test account. Test accounts are assumed to contain garbage data and are ignored by internal systems. The data they generate may be deleted at any time. users (REQUIRED for some accounts) Type: Array Default: (none) An array defining a list of users. There are some restrictions in place dependent on the status of your account: For customer partnerships who have switched to the New Relic One user model: do not define users. If you add users with this field, they will be ignored. Instead, to add users, you'd use these user management procedures. For all other accounts, which have users on our original user model: When you first create an account, this field is required, and only one user can be defined: the account Owner. To add additional users, use the Partnership API user object. For more on restrictions, read the Requirements. subscriptions (REQUIRED for some accounts) Type: Array Default: (none) An array defining a list of subscriptions. There are some restrictions in place dependent on the status of your account: For customer partnerships on our New Relic One pricing model: ignore this field because it applies to the original pricing model, not yours. If you use this, it will be ignored. For all other accounts: You are on our original product-based pricing model. The subscriptions attribute is required for new accounts. If it is empty, default product tiers will be used. To update subscription information, use the Partnership API subscription object. Important When creating an account with this object, it can take some time for the account settings to populate. This means that the returned response may initially show aspects that are not true (for example, it may return a response showing default Lite subscriptions). To specify an empty JSON array, don't use subscriptions: [ {} ]. Instead, use this format: subscriptions: [ ] Copy The account API does not include an attribute to create a child account. Instead, to create child accounts, use the parent account's Account settings page in the New Relic UI. Account API calls Here are the URL patterns for account API functions. If using this URL pattern, send an HTTP header containing the Partner API key along with the JSON request body. For example: GET .../api/v2/partners/:PARTNER_ID/accounts/:ID x-api-key: :PARTNER_ACCOUNT_KEY Content-Type: application/json { JSON data } Copy Call Resource URL pattern List (index) all accounts of a partner. GET /api/v2/partners/PARTNER_ID/accounts Copy Show the attributes of an account. GET /api/v2/partners/PARTNER_ID/accounts/:ID Copy Update the attributes of an account. PUT /api/v2/partners/PARTNER_ID/accounts/:ID Copy Create an account with the given parameters. POST /api/v2/partners/PARTNER_ID/accounts Copy Cancel an account. DELETE /api/v2/partners/PARTNER_ID/accounts/:ID Copy Status definitions When an account is created or listed with an API call, the account status is included automatically. Some of these statuses don't apply to all pricing models. Account status Definition pending Free account created, but primary admin is not yet activated. paid_pending Account created with a paid subscription, but the primary admin is not yet activated. new Free account, active primary admin, no application data has been collected. paid_new Paid subscription, active primary admin, no application data has been collected. active Free subscription, receiving application data. paid_active Paid subscription, receiving application data. upgraded Account's subscription was upgraded. downgraded Account's subscription was downgraded. cancelled The New Relic account subscription has been cancelled. suspended The New Relic account has been suspended because the primary admin has not validated their email address. JSON example Here is an example of a JSON request and response using the Partnership API account object. Note that this is just an example, and that for some accounts, the users and subscriptions attributes are unnecessary and are ignored.

      "body": "This doc explains how to use the Partnership API to manage child accounts. For accounts, you'd use the child account object. Requirements You may not have access to using this object. Before using the Partnership API, first read the requirements. Introduction to using child accounts Some notes about using the child account object: To manage existing parent accounts or child accounts, use the Partnership API account object. A parent account may have more than one associated child account, but every chld account must correspond to one and only one parent account. Every child account must have at least a primary_admin user. You cannot create a child account without connecting it to an existing parent account and adding at least one user. Child account object attributes Before using the Partnership API, first read the requirements. Here are the Partnership API child account object's attributes: name (REQUIRED) Type: String Default: (none) This name must be unique in New Relic's database. If the specified name is not unique, it will be auto-incremented with a numeric suffix as follows: conflicting_name_1 conflicting_name_2 etc. Copy allow_api_access Type: Boolean Default: False This flag allows API access to application data. This must be set to true for partnerships remotely administering accounts. testing Type: Boolean Default: False Use this flag to indicate a test account. Test accounts are assumed to contain garbage data and are ignored by internal systems. The data they generate may be deleted at any time. users (REQUIRED for some accounts) Type: Array Default: (none) An array defining a list of users. There are some restrictions in place dependent on the status of your account: For customer partnerships who have switched to the New Relic One user model: do not define users. If you add users with this field, they will be ignored. Instead, to add users, you'd use these user management procedures. For all other accounts, which have users on our original user model: When you create the child account, you can define only one user: the account Owner. To add additional users, use the Partnership API user object. For more about restrictions, read the Requirements. password (REQUIRED) Type: String Default: (none) If you are creating a child account with an existing user as the account Owner, the password must match the user's current password. For some New Relic organizations, child accounts can also be created via the parent account's Account settings page in the New Relic UI. Child account API calls Here is the URL pattern to create child accounts. Notice that the Parent Account ID must be specified. If using this URL pattern, send the JSON object along with an HTTP header containing the Partner API key. For example: POST .../api/v2/partners/PARTNER_ID/accounts/PARENT_ACCOUNT_ID/sub_accounts​ x-api-key:PARTNER_ACCOUNT_KEY Content-Type: application/json { JSON data } Copy Call Resource URL pattern Create a child account with the given parameters. POST /api/v2/partners/PARTNER_ID/accounts/PARENT_ACCOUNT_ID/sub_accounts Copy JSON example Here is an example of a JSON request and response using the Partnership API child account object. Note that this is just an example, and that for some accounts, the users attribute is unnecessary and will be ignored.

      "body": "This doc explains how to use the Partnership API to manage subscriptions for accounts on our original pricing model. Requirements You can use the subscription object only if you're on our original pricing model. It doesn't support accounts on our New Relic One pricing model. For more on this, read the Partnership API requirements. The Partnership API doesn't allow you to upgrade or downgrade individual product subscriptions for an account. Instead, the API requires you to replace (add) the configuration for all product subscriptions for the account. If any product configurations are not included, the New Relic Partnership API provisions the account with the best free product type available. The API automatically selects the product level based on the configuration and custom pricing for the account's partnership. Subscription object attributes Before using this, first read Requirements. Here are the subscription object's attributes: product_id (REQUIRED for new subscriptions) Type: Integer Default: (none) The product ID attribute identifies the New Relic product being defined for this subscription. It is required for Create calls. quantity (REQUIRED for new subscriptions) Type: Integer Default: (none) The quantity attribute is required for Create calls, even if a product level is unlimited. The API will ignore the quantity value entered for unlimited product subscriptions, such as New Relic APM Lite. New Relic Insights, Browser, and Synthetics require you to identify a predefined usage level (product bucket). This allows the API to apply a pricing discount based on the specific quantity you select. The quantity you identify must be an exact match for the product and subscription level. For a list of available product buckets, see: Browser PageViews Insights Events Synthetics Checks promo_code Type: String Default: (none) Any related promotional code for this subscription. Not yet supported through the Partnership API's subscription endpoint. However, you can pass the promo_code as part of the subscription with the account API's Create call. data_retention (required only for Insights subscriptions) Type: Integer Default: (none) Number of weeks the Insights event information will be retained. Mapping for products (product_id) With each account creation call, you must supply at least one New Relic product type. The API only accepts the numeric product_id for the type. Important Reminder that the subscription object only applies for accounts using our original pricing model. Also, creating subscriptions for Serverless, Logs, and Traces is not supported by the Partnership API. If your account has these subscriptions, any attempt to make changes will return an error. Please contact your account executive to modify subscriptions. Important New Startup and Small Business service plans no longer are available through the New Relic Partnership API. APM The number of allowable hosts per account and the data retention period vary by subscription level within New Relic APM's pricing structure. For example, New Relic APM allows an unlimited number of allowable hosts for Lite accounts but only a 24-hour data retention period. In addition, pricing and data retention depend on whether you select pricing models based on hosts or compute units (CU). Use the product ID's integer format to identify the subscription level and type of plan. APM subscription level Product ID Lite 1 Standard 2 Standard Annual 3 Pro (Host) 4 Pro Annual (Host) 5 Enterprise 6 Enterprise Annual 7 APM Essentials (Host) 8 APM Essentials Annual (Host) 9 If you select pricing plans based on compute units (CU), use these product ID integer formats to identify the subscription level and type of plan. APM Compute Units (CU) subscription level Product ID Pro CU 26 Pro Annual CU 27 APM Essentials CU 28 APM Essentials Annual CU 29 Mobile New Relic Mobile's pricing structure allows 100,000 monthly active users per account at the Enterprise subscription level. Data retention varies by subscription level. Use the product ID's integer format to identify the subscription level. Mobile subscription level Product ID Lite 10 Enterprise 13 Enterprise Annual 14 Insights New Relic Insights bases the pricing structure on the number of allowable events stored and the associated data retention policy (for example, data retention for Insights Free is one day). Note that the data_retention attribute is required. Insights subscription level Product ID Free 15 None 16 Pro 18 Pro Annual 19 Browser New Relic Browser's pricing structure allows an unlimited number of app users, regardless of subscription level. However, the number of allowable page views per month and the data retention period vary by subscription level. For example: Lite accounts include an unlimited number of page views per month and 24-hour data retention. Pro account pricing starts at 500,000 page views per month and three months data retention. Use the product ID's integer format to identify the subscription level. Browser subscription level Product ID Lite 20 Pro 21 Pro Annual 22 Synthetics With New Relic Synthetics' pricing structure, the default number of allowable monitoring checks and the data retention period vary by subscription level. Use the product ID's integer format to identify the subscription level. Synthetics subscription level Product ID Lite 23 Pro 24 Pro Annual 25 Tip If you previously used the deprecated Partnership availability monitoring API, you can use the Synthetics API to provision a check and the REST API for New Relic Alerts to create an alert notification for your customers. Infrastructure With New Relic's Infrastructure pricing structure, the default number of instances and the data retention period vary by subscription level. Infrastructure events do not count against your New Relic Insights quota, even though you can query them in Insights. New Relic Infrastructure offers pricing plans based on Compute Units (CU) only. Use the product ID's integer format to identify the subscription level. Infrastructure subscription level Product ID Infrastructure None 31 Infrastructure Pro (CU) 32 Infrastructure Pro Annual (CU) 33 Infrastructure Essentials (CU) 34 Infrastructure Essentials Annual (CU) 35 Subscription API calls Before using this, first read Requirements. Here are the URL patterns for subscription-related API functions. If used, send them along with the JSON object and an HTTP header containing the Partner API key. For example: GET .../api/v2/partners/PARTNER_ID/accounts/ACCOUNT_ID/subscriptions x-api-key:PARTNER_ACCOUNT_KEY Content-Type: application/json { JSON data } Copy Call Resource URL pattern List (index) all subscriptions of an account. GET /api/v2/partners/PARTNER_ID/accounts/ACCOUNT_ID/subscriptions Copy Show a subscription for an account. GET /api/v2/partners/PARTNER_ID/accounts/ACCOUNT_ID/subscriptions/ID Copy Replace the current subscription level with a new subscription. POST /api/v2/partners/PARTNER_ID/accounts/ACCOUNT_ID/subscriptions Copy Subscription API examples Here are examples of an API call to create an original pricing model subscription and the JSON response listing subscriptions for the account. Example subscription object { \"subscriptions\": [ { \"product_id\": 4, \"quantity\": 2 }, { \"product_id\": 13, \"quantity\": 2 } ] } Copy Example JSON response { \"id\": 1069012, \"starts_on\": \"2016-05-16\", \"expires_on\": null, \"annual_renewal_on\": null, \"products\": [ { \"product_id\": 4, \"name\": \"Pro\", \"units\": 2, \"price\": 218.0 }, { \"product_id\": 13, \"name\": \"Mobile Enterprise\", \"units\": 2, \"price\": 1500.0 }, { \"product_id\": 20, \"name\": \"Browser Lite\", \"units\": 0, \"price\": 0.0 }, { \"product_id\": 15, \"name\": \"Insights Free\", \"units\": 0, \"price\": 0.0 }, { \"product_id\": 23, \"name\": \"Synthetics Lite\", \"units\": 0, \"price\": 0.0 }, { \"product_id\": 31, \"name\": \"Infrastructure None\", \"units\": 0, \"price\": 0.0 } ] } Copy Subscription status Here are some original pricing model subscription status values that the API call may return. Subscription status Description pending The customer has signed up for a New Relic product, but payment still needs to be processed. authorized A credit card has been authorized and the vault key stored, but payment has not been captured. free This subscription is for a free New Relic product. No further processing is required. paid A payment has been captured and the next payment date has been set. payment_declined The last attempt to authorize payment failed. canceled The New Relic account has no active subscription and is not active. No payments should be authorized or captured. replaced This subscription has been superseded by another New Relic subscription.

      "body": "This doc explains how to use the Partnership API to manage accounts. For child accounts, you'd use the child account object. Requirements You may not be able to use some aspects of this object. Before using, first read the requirements. Account object attributes Here are the Partnership API account object's attributes. name (REQUIRED to create an account) Type: String Default: (none) The account name attribute is required for new accounts. This name must be unique in New Relic's database. If the specified name is not unique, it will be auto-incremented with a numeric suffix as follows: conflicting_name_1 conflicting_name_2 etc. Copy phone_number Type: String Default: (none) Primary contact phone number for the account. allow_api_access Type: Boolean Default: False This flag allows API access to application data. This must be set to true for partnerships remotely administering accounts. testing Type: Boolean Default: False Use this flag to indicate a test account. Test accounts are assumed to contain garbage data and are ignored by internal systems. The data they generate may be deleted at any time. users (REQUIRED for some accounts) Type: Array Default: (none) An array defining a list of users. There are some restrictions in place dependent on the status of your account: For customer partnerships who have switched to the New Relic One user model: do not define users. If you add users with this field, they will be ignored. Instead, to add users, you'd use these user management procedures. For all other accounts, which have users on our original user model: When you first create an account, this field is required, and only one user can be defined: the account Owner. To add additional users, use the Partnership API user object. For more on restrictions, read the Requirements. subscriptions (REQUIRED for some accounts) Type: Array Default: (none) An array defining a list of subscriptions. There are some restrictions in place dependent on the status of your account: For customer partnerships on our New Relic One pricing model: ignore this field because it applies to the original pricing model, not yours. If you use this, it will be ignored. For all other accounts: You are on our original product-based pricing model. The subscriptions attribute is required for new accounts. If it is empty, default product tiers will be used. To update subscription information, use the Partnership API subscription object. Important When creating an account with this object, it can take some time for the account settings to populate. This means that the returned response may initially show aspects that are not true (for example, it may return a response showing default Lite subscriptions). To specify an empty JSON array, don't use subscriptions: [ {} ]. Instead, use this format: subscriptions: [ ] Copy The account API does not include an attribute to create a child account. Instead, to create child accounts, use the parent account's Account settings page in the New Relic UI. Account API calls Here are the URL patterns for account API functions. If using this URL pattern, send an HTTP header containing the Partner API key along with the JSON request body. For example: GET .../api/v2/partners/:PARTNER_ID/accounts/:ID x-api-key: :PARTNER_ACCOUNT_KEY Content-Type: application/json { JSON data } Copy Call Resource URL pattern List (index) all accounts of a partner. GET /api/v2/partners/PARTNER_ID/accounts Copy Show the attributes of an account. GET /api/v2/partners/PARTNER_ID/accounts/:ID Copy Update the attributes of an account. PUT /api/v2/partners/PARTNER_ID/accounts/:ID Copy Create an account with the given parameters. POST /api/v2/partners/PARTNER_ID/accounts Copy Cancel an account. DELETE /api/v2/partners/PARTNER_ID/accounts/:ID Copy Status definitions When an account is created or listed with an API call, the account status is included automatically. Some of these statuses don't apply to all pricing models. Account status Definition pending Free account created, but primary admin is not yet activated. paid_pending Account created with a paid subscription, but the primary admin is not yet activated. new Free account, active primary admin, no application data has been collected. paid_new Paid subscription, active primary admin, no application data has been collected. active Free subscription, receiving application data. paid_active Paid subscription, receiving application data. upgraded Account's subscription was upgraded. downgraded Account's subscription was downgraded. cancelled The New Relic account subscription has been cancelled. suspended The New Relic account has been suspended because the primary admin has not validated their email address. JSON example Here is an example of a JSON request and response using the Partnership API account object. Note that this is just an example, and that for some accounts, the users and subscriptions attributes are unnecessary and are ignored.

This doc explains some details for using the Browser, Synthetics, and Insights products. Requirements This doc applies only for partnership accounts on our original pricing model. Before using this API, please read the Partnership API requirements. Overview (#overview) When using the Partnership API for Insights, Browser, and Synthetics products, you must provide a valid quantity value. This indicates the number of Insights Events, Browser PageViews, and Synthetics Checks provisioned to that account. New Relic uses this \"bucket\" pricing structure based on the quantity value in order to offer discounts on large volume purchases. Be sure to select an available bucket value.

      "body": "This doc explains how to use the Partnership API to manage subscriptions for accounts on our original pricing model. Requirements You can use the subscription object only if you're on our original pricing model. It doesn't support accounts on our New Relic One pricing model. For more on this, read the Partnership API requirements. The Partnership API doesn't allow you to upgrade or downgrade individual product subscriptions for an account. Instead, the API requires you to replace (add) the configuration for all product subscriptions for the account. If any product configurations are not included, the New Relic Partnership API provisions the account with the best free product type available. The API automatically selects the product level based on the configuration and custom pricing for the account's partnership. Subscription object attributes Before using this, first read Requirements. Here are the subscription object's attributes: product_id (REQUIRED for new subscriptions) Type: Integer Default: (none) The product ID attribute identifies the New Relic product being defined for this subscription. It is required for Create calls. quantity (REQUIRED for new subscriptions) Type: Integer Default: (none) The quantity attribute is required for Create calls, even if a product level is unlimited. The API will ignore the quantity value entered for unlimited product subscriptions, such as New Relic APM Lite. New Relic Insights, Browser, and Synthetics require you to identify a predefined usage level (product bucket). This allows the API to apply a pricing discount based on the specific quantity you select. The quantity you identify must be an exact match for the product and subscription level. For a list of available product buckets, see: Browser PageViews Insights Events Synthetics Checks promo_code Type: String Default: (none) Any related promotional code for this subscription. Not yet supported through the Partnership API's subscription endpoint. However, you can pass the promo_code as part of the subscription with the account API's Create call. data_retention (required only for Insights subscriptions) Type: Integer Default: (none) Number of weeks the Insights event information will be retained. Mapping for products (product_id) With each account creation call, you must supply at least one New Relic product type. The API only accepts the numeric product_id for the type. Important Reminder that the subscription object only applies for accounts using our original pricing model. Also, creating subscriptions for Serverless, Logs, and Traces is not supported by the Partnership API. If your account has these subscriptions, any attempt to make changes will return an error. Please contact your account executive to modify subscriptions. Important New Startup and Small Business service plans no longer are available through the New Relic Partnership API. APM The number of allowable hosts per account and the data retention period vary by subscription level within New Relic APM's pricing structure. For example, New Relic APM allows an unlimited number of allowable hosts for Lite accounts but only a 24-hour data retention period. In addition, pricing and data retention depend on whether you select pricing models based on hosts or compute units (CU). Use the product ID's integer format to identify the subscription level and type of plan. APM subscription level Product ID Lite 1 Standard 2 Standard Annual 3 Pro (Host) 4 Pro Annual (Host) 5 Enterprise 6 Enterprise Annual 7 APM Essentials (Host) 8 APM Essentials Annual (Host) 9 If you select pricing plans based on compute units (CU), use these product ID integer formats to identify the subscription level and type of plan. APM Compute Units (CU) subscription level Product ID Pro CU 26 Pro Annual CU 27 APM Essentials CU 28 APM Essentials Annual CU 29 Mobile New Relic Mobile's pricing structure allows 100,000 monthly active users per account at the Enterprise subscription level. Data retention varies by subscription level. Use the product ID's integer format to identify the subscription level. Mobile subscription level Product ID Lite 10 Enterprise 13 Enterprise Annual 14 Insights New Relic Insights bases the pricing structure on the number of allowable events stored and the associated data retention policy (for example, data retention for Insights Free is one day). Note that the data_retention attribute is required. Insights subscription level Product ID Free 15 None 16 Pro 18 Pro Annual 19 Browser New Relic Browser's pricing structure allows an unlimited number of app users, regardless of subscription level. However, the number of allowable page views per month and the data retention period vary by subscription level. For example: Lite accounts include an unlimited number of page views per month and 24-hour data retention. Pro account pricing starts at 500,000 page views per month and three months data retention. Use the product ID's integer format to identify the subscription level. Browser subscription level Product ID Lite 20 Pro 21 Pro Annual 22 Synthetics With New Relic Synthetics' pricing structure, the default number of allowable monitoring checks and the data retention period vary by subscription level. Use the product ID's integer format to identify the subscription level. Synthetics subscription level Product ID Lite 23 Pro 24 Pro Annual 25 Tip If you previously used the deprecated Partnership availability monitoring API, you can use the Synthetics API to provision a check and the REST API for New Relic Alerts to create an alert notification for your customers. Infrastructure With New Relic's Infrastructure pricing structure, the default number of instances and the data retention period vary by subscription level. Infrastructure events do not count against your New Relic Insights quota, even though you can query them in Insights. New Relic Infrastructure offers pricing plans based on Compute Units (CU) only. Use the product ID's integer format to identify the subscription level. Infrastructure subscription level Product ID Infrastructure None 31 Infrastructure Pro (CU) 32 Infrastructure Pro Annual (CU) 33 Infrastructure Essentials (CU) 34 Infrastructure Essentials Annual (CU) 35 Subscription API calls Before using this, first read Requirements. Here are the URL patterns for subscription-related API functions. If used, send them along with the JSON object and an HTTP header containing the Partner API key. For example: GET .../api/v2/partners/PARTNER_ID/accounts/ACCOUNT_ID/subscriptions x-api-key:PARTNER_ACCOUNT_KEY Content-Type: application/json { JSON data } Copy Call Resource URL pattern List (index) all subscriptions of an account. GET /api/v2/partners/PARTNER_ID/accounts/ACCOUNT_ID/subscriptions Copy Show a subscription for an account.

      "body": "This doc explains how to use the Partnership API to manage accounts. For child accounts, you'd use the child account object. Requirements You may not be able to use some aspects of this object. Before using, first read the requirements. Account object attributes Here are the Partnership API account object's attributes. name (REQUIRED to create an account) Type: String Default: (none) The account name attribute is required for new accounts. This name must be unique in New Relic's database. If the specified name is not unique, it will be auto-incremented with a numeric suffix as follows: conflicting_name_1 conflicting_name_2 etc. Copy phone_number Type: String Default: (none) Primary contact phone number for the account. allow_api_access Type: Boolean Default: False This flag allows API access to application data. This must be set to true for partnerships remotely administering accounts. testing Type: Boolean Default: False Use this flag to indicate a test account. Test accounts are assumed to contain garbage data and are ignored by internal systems. The data they generate may be deleted at any time. users (REQUIRED for some accounts) Type: Array Default: (none) An array defining a list of users. There are some restrictions in place dependent on the status of your account: For customer partnerships who have switched to the New Relic One user model: do not define users. If you add users with this field, they will be ignored. Instead, to add users, you'd use these user management procedures. For all other accounts, which have users on our original user model: When you first create an account, this field is required, and only one user can be defined: the account Owner. To add additional users, use the Partnership API user object. For more on restrictions, read the Requirements. subscriptions (REQUIRED for some accounts) Type: Array Default: (none) An array defining a list of subscriptions. There are some restrictions in place dependent on the status of your account: For customer partnerships on our New Relic One pricing model: ignore this field because it applies to the original pricing model, not yours. If you use this, it will be ignored. For all other accounts: You are on our original product-based pricing model. The subscriptions attribute is required for new accounts. If it is empty, default product tiers will be used. To update subscription information, use the Partnership API subscription object. Important When creating an account with this object, it can take some time for the account settings to populate. This means that the returned response may initially show aspects that are not true (for example, it may return a response showing default Lite subscriptions). To specify an empty JSON array, don't use subscriptions: [ {} ]. Instead, use this format: subscriptions: [ ] Copy The account API does not include an attribute to create a child account. Instead, to create child accounts, use the parent account's Account settings page in the New Relic UI. Account API calls Here are the URL patterns for account API functions. If using this URL pattern, send an HTTP header containing the Partner API key along with the JSON request body. For example: GET .../api/v2/partners/:PARTNER_ID/accounts/:ID x-api-key: :PARTNER_ACCOUNT_KEY Content-Type: application/json { JSON data } Copy Call Resource URL pattern List (index) all accounts of a partner. GET /api/v2/partners/PARTNER_ID/accounts Copy Show the attributes of an account. GET /api/v2/partners/PARTNER_ID/accounts/:ID Copy Update the attributes of an account. PUT /api/v2/partners/PARTNER_ID/accounts/:ID Copy Create an account with the given parameters. POST /api/v2/partners/PARTNER_ID/accounts Copy Cancel an account. DELETE /api/v2/partners/PARTNER_ID/accounts/:ID Copy Status definitions When an account is created or listed with an API call, the account status is included automatically. Some of these statuses don't apply to all pricing models. Account status Definition pending Free account created, but primary admin is not yet activated. paid_pending Account created with a paid subscription, but the primary admin is not yet activated. new Free account, active primary admin, no application data has been collected. paid_new Paid subscription, active primary admin, no application data has been collected. active Free subscription, receiving application data. paid_active Paid subscription, receiving application data. upgraded Account's subscription was upgraded. downgraded Account's subscription was downgraded. cancelled The New Relic account subscription has been cancelled. suspended The New Relic account has been suspended because the primary admin has not validated their email address.

      "body": "This doc explains how to use the Partnership API to manage subscriptions for accounts on our original pricing model. Requirements You can use the subscription object only if you're on our original pricing model. It doesn't support accounts on our New Relic One pricing model. For more on this, read the Partnership API requirements. The Partnership API doesn't allow you to upgrade or downgrade individual product subscriptions for an account. Instead, the API requires you to replace (add) the configuration for all product subscriptions for the account. If any product configurations are not included, the New Relic Partnership API provisions the account with the best free product type available. The API automatically selects the product level based on the configuration and custom pricing for the account's partnership. Subscription object attributes Before using this, first read Requirements. Here are the subscription object's attributes: product_id (REQUIRED for new subscriptions) Type: Integer Default: (none) The product ID attribute identifies the New Relic product being defined for this subscription. It is required for Create calls. quantity (REQUIRED for new subscriptions) Type: Integer Default: (none) The quantity attribute is required for Create calls, even if a product level is unlimited. The API will ignore the quantity value entered for unlimited product subscriptions, such as New Relic APM Lite. New Relic Insights, Browser, and Synthetics require you to identify a predefined usage level (product bucket). This allows the API to apply a pricing discount based on the specific quantity you select. The quantity you identify must be an exact match for the product and subscription level. For a list of available product buckets, see: Browser PageViews Insights Events Synthetics Checks promo_code Type: String Default: (none) Any related promotional code for this subscription. Not yet supported through the Partnership API's subscription endpoint. However, you can pass the promo_code as part of the subscription with the account API's Create call. data_retention (required only for Insights subscriptions) Type: Integer Default: (none) Number of weeks the Insights event information will be retained. Mapping for products (product_id) With each account creation call, you must supply at least one New Relic product type. The API only accepts the numeric product_id for the type. Important Reminder that the subscription object only applies for accounts using our original pricing model. Also, creating subscriptions for Serverless, Logs, and Traces is not supported by the Partnership API. If your account has these subscriptions, any attempt to make changes will return an error. Please contact your account executive to modify subscriptions. Important New Startup and Small Business service plans no longer are available through the New Relic Partnership API. APM The number of allowable hosts per account and the data retention period vary by subscription level within New Relic APM's pricing structure. For example, New Relic APM allows an unlimited number of allowable hosts for Lite accounts but only a 24-hour data retention period. In addition, pricing and data retention depend on whether you select pricing models based on hosts or compute units (CU). Use the product ID's integer format to identify the subscription level and type of plan. APM subscription level Product ID Lite 1 Standard 2 Standard Annual 3 Pro (Host) 4 Pro Annual (Host) 5 Enterprise 6 Enterprise Annual 7 APM Essentials (Host) 8 APM Essentials Annual (Host) 9 If you select pricing plans based on compute units (CU), use these product ID integer formats to identify the subscription level and type of plan. APM Compute Units (CU) subscription level Product ID Pro CU 26 Pro Annual CU 27 APM Essentials CU 28 APM Essentials Annual CU 29 Mobile New Relic Mobile's pricing structure allows 100,000 monthly active users per account at the Enterprise subscription level. Data retention varies by subscription level. Use the product ID's integer format to identify the subscription level. Mobile subscription level Product ID Lite 10 Enterprise 13 Enterprise Annual 14 Insights New Relic Insights bases the pricing structure on the number of allowable events stored and the associated data retention policy (for example, data retention for Insights Free is one day). Note that the data_retention attribute is required. Insights subscription level Product ID Free 15 None 16 Pro 18 Pro Annual 19 Browser New Relic Browser's pricing structure allows an unlimited number of app users, regardless of subscription level. However, the number of allowable page views per month and the data retention period vary by subscription level. For example: Lite accounts include an unlimited number of page views per month and 24-hour data retention. Pro account pricing starts at 500,000 page views per month and three months data retention. Use the product ID's integer format to identify the subscription level. Browser subscription level Product ID Lite 20 Pro 21 Pro Annual 22 Synthetics With New Relic Synthetics' pricing structure, the default number of allowable monitoring checks and the data retention period vary by subscription level. Use the product ID's integer format to identify the subscription level. Synthetics subscription level Product ID Lite 23 Pro 24 Pro Annual 25 Tip If you previously used the deprecated Partnership availability monitoring API, you can use the Synthetics API to provision a check and the REST API for New Relic Alerts to create an alert notification for your customers. Infrastructure With New Relic's Infrastructure pricing structure, the default number of instances and the data retention period vary by subscription level. Infrastructure events do not count against your New Relic Insights quota, even though you can query them in Insights. New Relic Infrastructure offers pricing plans based on Compute Units (CU) only. Use the product ID's integer format to identify the subscription level. Infrastructure subscription level Product ID Infrastructure None 31 Infrastructure Pro (CU) 32 Infrastructure Pro Annual (CU) 33 Infrastructure Essentials (CU) 34 Infrastructure Essentials Annual (CU) 35 Subscription API calls Before using this, first read Requirements. Here are the URL patterns for subscription-related API functions. If used, send them along with the JSON object and an HTTP header containing the Partner API key.

      "body": "This doc explains how to use the Partnership API to manage accounts. For child accounts, you'd use the child account object. Requirements You may not be able to use some aspects of this object. Before using, first read the requirements. Account object attributes Here are the Partnership API account object's attributes. name (REQUIRED to create an account) Type: String Default: (none) The account name attribute is required for new accounts. This name must be unique in New Relic's database. If the specified name is not unique, it will be auto-incremented with a numeric suffix as follows: conflicting_name_1 conflicting_name_2 etc. Copy phone_number Type: String Default: (none) Primary contact phone number for the account. allow_api_access Type: Boolean Default: False This flag allows API access to application data. This must be set to true for partnerships remotely administering accounts. testing Type: Boolean Default: False Use this flag to indicate a test account. Test accounts are assumed to contain garbage data and are ignored by internal systems. The data they generate may be deleted at any time. users (REQUIRED for some accounts) Type: Array Default: (none) An array defining a list of users. There are some restrictions in place dependent on the status of your account: For customer partnerships who have switched to the New Relic One user model: do not define users. If you add users with this field, they will be ignored. Instead, to add users, you'd use these user management procedures. For all other accounts, which have users on our original user model: When you first create an account, this field is required, and only one user can be defined: the account Owner. To add additional users, use the Partnership API user object. For more on restrictions, read the Requirements. subscriptions (REQUIRED for some accounts) Type: Array Default: (none) An array defining a list of subscriptions. There are some restrictions in place dependent on the status of your account: For customer partnerships on our New Relic One pricing model: ignore this field because it applies to the original pricing model, not yours. If you use this, it will be ignored. For all other accounts: You are on our original product-based pricing model. The subscriptions attribute is required for new accounts. If it is empty, default product tiers will be used. To update subscription information, use the Partnership API subscription object. Important When creating an account with this object, it can take some time for the account settings to populate. This means that the returned response may initially show aspects that are not true (for example, it may return a response showing default Lite subscriptions). To specify an empty JSON array, don't use subscriptions: [ {} ]. Instead, use this format: subscriptions: [ ] Copy The account API does not include an attribute to create a child account. Instead, to create child accounts, use the parent account's Account settings page in the New Relic UI. Account API calls Here are the URL patterns for account API functions. If using this URL pattern, send an HTTP header containing the Partner API key along with the JSON request body. For example: GET .../api/v2/partners/:PARTNER_ID/accounts/:ID x-api-key: :PARTNER_ACCOUNT_KEY Content-Type: application/json { JSON data } Copy Call Resource URL pattern List (index) all accounts of a partner. GET /api/v2/partners/PARTNER_ID/accounts Copy Show the attributes of an account. GET /api/v2/partners/PARTNER_ID/accounts/:ID Copy Update the attributes of an account. PUT /api/v2/partners/PARTNER_ID/accounts/:ID Copy Create an account with the given parameters. POST /api/v2/partners/PARTNER_ID/accounts Copy Cancel an account. DELETE /api/v2/partners/PARTNER_ID/accounts/:ID Copy Status definitions When an account is created or listed with an API call, the account status is included automatically. Some of these statuses don't apply to all pricing models. Account status Definition pending Free account created, but primary admin is not yet activated. paid_pending Account created with a paid subscription, but the primary admin is not yet activated. new Free account, active primary admin, no application data has been collected. paid_new Paid subscription, active primary admin, no application data has been collected. active Free subscription, receiving application data. paid_active Paid subscription, receiving application data. upgraded Account's subscription was upgraded. downgraded Account's subscription was downgraded. cancelled The New Relic account subscription has been cancelled. suspended The New Relic account has been suspended because the primary admin has not validated their email address. JSON example Here is an example of a JSON request and response using the Partnership API account object. Note that this is just an example, and that for some accounts, the users and subscriptions attributes are unnecessary and are ignored.

Before using the Partnership API, first read the requirements. Introduction to using child accounts Some notes about using the child account object: To manage existing parent accounts or child accounts, use the Partnership API account object. A parent account may have more than one associated child account, but every chld account must correspond to one and only one parent account. Every child account must have at least a primary_admin user. You cannot create a child account without connecting it to an existing parent account and adding at least one user. Child account object attributes Before using the Partnership API, first read the requirements. Here are the Partnership API child account object's attributes: name (REQUIRED) Type: String Default: (none) This name must be unique in New Relic's database. If the specified name is not unique, it will be auto-incremented with a numeric suffix as follows: conflicting_name_1 conflicting_name_2 etc. Copy allow_api_access Type: Boolean Default: False This flag allows API access to application data. This must be set to true for partnerships remotely administering accounts. testing Type: Boolean Default: False Use this flag to indicate a test account.

For more about restrictions, read the Requirements. password (REQUIRED) Type: String Default: (none) If you are creating a child account with an existing user as the account Owner, the password must match the user's current password. For some New Relic organizations, child accounts can also be created via the parent account's Account settings page in the New Relic UI. Child account API calls Here is the URL pattern to create child accounts. Notice that the Parent Account ID must be specified. If using this URL pattern, send the JSON object along with an HTTP header containing the Partner API key. For example: POST .../api/v2/partners/PARTNER_ID/accounts/PARENT_ACCOUNT_ID/sub_accounts​ x-api-key:PARTNER_ACCOUNT_KEY Content-Type: application/json { JSON data } Copy Call Resource URL pattern Create a child account with the given parameters.

      "body": "This doc explains how to use the Partnership API to manage subscriptions for accounts on our original pricing model. Requirements You can use the subscription object only if you're on our original pricing model. It doesn't support accounts on our New Relic One pricing model. For more on this, read the Partnership API requirements. The Partnership API doesn't allow you to upgrade or downgrade individual product subscriptions for an account. Instead, the API requires you to replace (add) the configuration for all product subscriptions for the account. If any product configurations are not included, the New Relic Partnership API provisions the account with the best free product type available. The API automatically selects the product level based on the configuration and custom pricing for the account's partnership. Subscription object attributes Before using this, first read Requirements. Here are the subscription object's attributes: product_id (REQUIRED for new subscriptions) Type: Integer Default: (none) The product ID attribute identifies the New Relic product being defined for this subscription. It is required for Create calls. quantity (REQUIRED for new subscriptions) Type: Integer Default: (none) The quantity attribute is required for Create calls, even if a product level is unlimited. The API will ignore the quantity value entered for unlimited product subscriptions, such as New Relic APM Lite. New Relic Insights, Browser, and Synthetics require you to identify a predefined usage level (product bucket). This allows the API to apply a pricing discount based on the specific quantity you select. The quantity you identify must be an exact match for the product and subscription level. For a list of available product buckets, see: Browser PageViews Insights Events Synthetics Checks promo_code Type: String Default: (none) Any related promotional code for this subscription. Not yet supported through the Partnership API's subscription endpoint. However, you can pass the promo_code as part of the subscription with the account API's Create call. data_retention (required only for Insights subscriptions) Type: Integer Default: (none) Number of weeks the Insights event information will be retained. Mapping for products (product_id) With each account creation call, you must supply at least one New Relic product type. The API only accepts the numeric product_id for the type. Important Reminder that the subscription object only applies for accounts using our original pricing model. Also, creating subscriptions for Serverless, Logs, and Traces is not supported by the Partnership API. If your account has these subscriptions, any attempt to make changes will return an error. Please contact your account executive to modify subscriptions. Important New Startup and Small Business service plans no longer are available through the New Relic Partnership API. APM The number of allowable hosts per account and the data retention period vary by subscription level within New Relic APM's pricing structure. For example, New Relic APM allows an unlimited number of allowable hosts for Lite accounts but only a 24-hour data retention period. In addition, pricing and data retention depend on whether you select pricing models based on hosts or compute units (CU). Use the product ID's integer format to identify the subscription level and type of plan. APM subscription level Product ID Lite 1 Standard 2 Standard Annual 3 Pro (Host) 4 Pro Annual (Host) 5 Enterprise 6 Enterprise Annual 7 APM Essentials (Host) 8 APM Essentials Annual (Host) 9 If you select pricing plans based on compute units (CU), use these product ID integer formats to identify the subscription level and type of plan. APM Compute Units (CU) subscription level Product ID Pro CU 26 Pro Annual CU 27 APM Essentials CU 28 APM Essentials Annual CU 29 Mobile New Relic Mobile's pricing structure allows 100,000 monthly active users per account at the Enterprise subscription level. Data retention varies by subscription level. Use the product ID's integer format to identify the subscription level. Mobile subscription level Product ID Lite 10 Enterprise 13 Enterprise Annual 14 Insights New Relic Insights bases the pricing structure on the number of allowable events stored and the associated data retention policy (for example, data retention for Insights Free is one day). Note that the data_retention attribute is required. Insights subscription level Product ID Free 15 None 16 Pro 18 Pro Annual 19 Browser New Relic Browser's pricing structure allows an unlimited number of app users, regardless of subscription level. However, the number of allowable page views per month and the data retention period vary by subscription level. For example: Lite accounts include an unlimited number of page views per month and 24-hour data retention. Pro account pricing starts at 500,000 page views per month and three months data retention. Use the product ID's integer format to identify the subscription level. Browser subscription level Product ID Lite 20 Pro 21 Pro Annual 22 Synthetics With New Relic Synthetics' pricing structure, the default number of allowable monitoring checks and the data retention period vary by subscription level. Use the product ID's integer format to identify the subscription level. Synthetics subscription level Product ID Lite 23 Pro 24 Pro Annual 25 Tip If you previously used the deprecated Partnership availability monitoring API, you can use the Synthetics API to provision a check and the REST API for New Relic Alerts to create an alert notification for your customers. Infrastructure With New Relic's Infrastructure pricing structure, the default number of instances and the data retention period vary by subscription level. Infrastructure events do not count against your New Relic Insights quota, even though you can query them in Insights. New Relic Infrastructure offers pricing plans based on Compute Units (CU) only. Use the product ID's integer format to identify the subscription level. Infrastructure subscription level Product ID Infrastructure None 31 Infrastructure Pro (CU) 32 Infrastructure Pro Annual (CU) 33 Infrastructure Essentials (CU) 34 Infrastructure Essentials Annual (CU) 35 Subscription API calls Before using this, first read Requirements. Here are the URL patterns for subscription-related API functions. If used, send them along with the JSON object and an HTTP header containing the Partner API key. For example: GET .../api/v2/partners/PARTNER_ID/accounts/ACCOUNT_ID/subscriptions x-api-key:PARTNER_ACCOUNT_KEY Content-Type: application/json { JSON data } Copy Call Resource URL pattern List (index) all subscriptions of an account. GET /api/v2/partners/PARTNER_ID/accounts/ACCOUNT_ID/subscriptions Copy Show a subscription for an account. GET /api/v2/partners/PARTNER_ID/accounts/ACCOUNT_ID/subscriptions/ID Copy Replace the current subscription level with a new subscription. POST /api/v2/partners/PARTNER_ID/accounts/ACCOUNT_ID/subscriptions Copy Subscription API examples Here are examples of an API call to create an original pricing model subscription and the JSON response listing subscriptions for the account. Example subscription object { \"subscriptions\": [ { \"product_id\": 4, \"quantity\": 2 }, { \"product_id\": 13, \"quantity\": 2 } ] } Copy Example JSON response { \"id\": 1069012, \"starts_on\": \"2016-05-16\", \"expires_on\": null, \"annual_renewal_on\": null, \"products\": [ { \"product_id\": 4, \"name\": \"Pro\", \"units\": 2, \"price\": 218.0 }, { \"product_id\": 13, \"name\": \"Mobile Enterprise\", \"units\": 2, \"price\": 1500.0 }, { \"product_id\": 20, \"name\": \"Browser Lite\", \"units\": 0, \"price\": 0.0 }, { \"product_id\": 15, \"name\": \"Insights Free\", \"units\": 0, \"price\": 0.0 }, { \"product_id\": 23, \"name\": \"Synthetics Lite\", \"units\": 0, \"price\": 0.0 }, { \"product_id\": 31, \"name\": \"Infrastructure None\", \"units\": 0, \"price\": 0.0 } ] } Copy Subscription status Here are some original pricing model subscription status values that the API call may return. Subscription status Description pending The customer has signed up for a New Relic product, but payment still needs to be processed. authorized A credit card has been authorized and the vault key stored, but payment has not been captured. free This subscription is for a free New Relic product. No further processing is required. paid A payment has been captured and the next payment date has been set. payment_declined The last attempt to authorize payment failed. canceled The New Relic account has no active subscription and is not active. No payments should be authorized or captured. replaced This subscription has been superseded by another New Relic subscription. API examples (v2) Here are API example requests and responses to list, show, create, and update original pricing model subscriptions. Line breaks in responses are for readability. The actual responses appear as a continuous line.

      "body": "This doc explains how to use the Partnership API to manage accounts. For child accounts, you'd use the child account object. Requirements You may not be able to use some aspects of this object. Before using, first read the requirements. Account object attributes Here are the Partnership API account object's attributes. name (REQUIRED to create an account) Type: String Default: (none) The account name attribute is required for new accounts. This name must be unique in New Relic's database. If the specified name is not unique, it will be auto-incremented with a numeric suffix as follows: conflicting_name_1 conflicting_name_2 etc. Copy phone_number Type: String Default: (none) Primary contact phone number for the account. allow_api_access Type: Boolean Default: False This flag allows API access to application data. This must be set to true for partnerships remotely administering accounts. testing Type: Boolean Default: False Use this flag to indicate a test account. Test accounts are assumed to contain garbage data and are ignored by internal systems. The data they generate may be deleted at any time. users (REQUIRED for some accounts) Type: Array Default: (none) An array defining a list of users. There are some restrictions in place dependent on the status of your account: For customer partnerships who have switched to the New Relic One user model: do not define users. If you add users with this field, they will be ignored. Instead, to add users, you'd use these user management procedures. For all other accounts, which have users on our original user model: When you first create an account, this field is required, and only one user can be defined: the account Owner. To add additional users, use the Partnership API user object. For more on restrictions, read the Requirements. subscriptions (REQUIRED for some accounts) Type: Array Default: (none) An array defining a list of subscriptions. There are some restrictions in place dependent on the status of your account: For customer partnerships on our New Relic One pricing model: ignore this field because it applies to the original pricing model, not yours. If you use this, it will be ignored. For all other accounts: You are on our original product-based pricing model. The subscriptions attribute is required for new accounts. If it is empty, default product tiers will be used. To update subscription information, use the Partnership API subscription object. Important When creating an account with this object, it can take some time for the account settings to populate. This means that the returned response may initially show aspects that are not true (for example, it may return a response showing default Lite subscriptions). To specify an empty JSON array, don't use subscriptions: [ {} ]. Instead, use this format: subscriptions: [ ] Copy The account API does not include an attribute to create a child account. Instead, to create child accounts, use the parent account's Account settings page in the New Relic UI. Account API calls Here are the URL patterns for account API functions. If using this URL pattern, send an HTTP header containing the Partner API key along with the JSON request body. For example: GET .../api/v2/partners/:PARTNER_ID/accounts/:ID x-api-key: :PARTNER_ACCOUNT_KEY Content-Type: application/json { JSON data } Copy Call Resource URL pattern List (index) all accounts of a partner.

      "body": "New Relic's synthetic monitoring—powered by a Selenium-driven Chrome browser—allows you to monitor and test your apps and address issues before they affect your end users. Here are five tips to help you take immediate advantage of its full power. 1. Match your monitor type to monitoring need Synthetic monitors are virtual browsers that measure the performance of your website, recording each check in detail. They also capture aggregate numbers for load time, uptime, and average download size, as well as an overview, detailed statistics for each page resource, and downtime incidents. There are four types of synthetic monitors; the ones you deploy will depend on the things you want to monitor: Ping monitors—to ensure that your site is accessible. Simple browser monitors—to ensure end-user performance. Scripted browsers—to ensure that particular resources are present. API monitors—to ensure that your app server works as well as your website. How to do it To add a monitor, go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics (or one.eu.newrelic.com if you have an EU-based account) and click Create monitor. Specify monitor type, name, and URL. Optional: Add a validation string (available for ping and simple browser) or advanced options, which enable substring monitoring for the following types of response validation: Verify SSL (for ping and simple browser). This option verifies the validity of the SSL certificate chain. It can be duplicated by running the following syntax: openssl s_client -servername {YOUR_HOSTNAME} -connect {YOUR_HOSTNAME}:443 -CApath /etc/ssl/certs > /dev/null Copy Bypass HEAD request (for ping). This option skips the default HEAD request and instead uses the GET verb with a ping check. Redirect is Failure (for ping). If a redirect result occurs when Redirect is Failure is enabled, Synthetics categorizes it as a failure (rather than following the redirect and checking the resulting URL). Select the locations where you want your monitor to run. Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Optional: Set up alert notifications. Select Create my monitor to confirm. Wait a few minutes; then from the Monitors index check your monitor. 2. View all monitors with the Monitors index page Continuous application performance monitoring is essential to ensure that web services are in place, working correctly, and error-free. Synthetic monitoring provides this type of assurance by performing automated tests on your web application for each selected location—noting downtime instances (“violations”) and collecting aggregate numbers, results, and detailed statistics for each page resource. Use the Monitors index page to get a high level view of this information, or select an individual monitor to view the Summary, for ping monitors, or Overview, for simple and scripted monitors, page and get a deeper insight into its performance over time. How to view your monitors in the New Relic One: New Relic Explorer To view a list of monitors using the New Relic One Monitors index page: Go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Synthetic monitors. For more information, see the documentation about navigating core UI components in New Relic One. Monitors index page To view a list of monitors using the Monitors index page: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics. 3. View individual monitor results It’s not enough to understand how your web apps are performing for your West Coast customers; you need to be able to view how they’re performing across the country and around the globe. By taking advantage of synthetic monitors and visiting your Results page, you can see how everything from development to production affects user experience. You can locate interesting results by sorting the list to identify slow, fast, or other unusual results. Or filter by location to understand how monitor performance varies with geography. (The “Network timings” graph below provides a snapshot of webpage performance over a given period.) How to do it: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics and, from the Monitors tab, select your monitor. Select Monitor > Results. Gain an up-to-the-minute view of the slowest page loads for every monitored location. 4. Understand the load-time impact of each resource Visit the synthetics Resources page to see how each resource on your website—including CSS, JavaScript, images, HTML and more—is affecting your overall load. You can drill into detailed metrics collected at run time, locate performance information for time spent by third-party resources, and identify HTTP response codes for each resource. How to do it: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics and, from the Monitors drop-down menu, select your monitor. Select Monitor > Resources. 5. Configure and develop a scripted browser test Using scripted browsers, you can build complex monitoring workflows using the Selenium JavaScript Webdriver bindings. For instance, you can log in to the application, navigate to a particular link, and wait for a page element to load and add an assertion. How to do it: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics. Choose your monitor type (for example, scripted browser). Enter the name and details of your monitor (for example, Sitename.com scripted browser) Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run (for example, Mumbai, Seoul, Columbus, and Montreal). Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor (for example, five minutes). Set a notification method to alert your team when performance violations occur. You are now ready to write your script. (Below is an example of a script used to test the performance of a main navigation page.) var assert = require('chai').assert; // script-wide timeout for all wait and waitandfind functions (in ms) var default_element_timeout = 190000; //3 mins var default_pageload_timeout = 240000; //4 mins var navlinks = [\"css-locator-1\", \"css-locator-2\"]; //sets element load timeout to 3 mins $browser.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(default_element_timeout); //sets page load timoeout to 4 mins $browser.manage().timeouts().pageloadTimeout(default_pageload_timeout); //test all the main nav page performances $browser.get(\"http://www.sitename.com\").then(function() { return $browser.findelement($driver.by.classname(\"site-theme-example\")); }).then(function() { //verifies the nav list has loaded return $browser.findelement($driver.by.classname(\"site-nav-list-example\")); }).then(function() { //loops through the navlinks array navlinks.foreach(function(val, i, arr) { //finds and navigates to each navlink page return $browser.findelement($driver.by.classname(navlinks[i])).click().then(function() { //verifies that the nav list loaded before moving on return $browser.findelement($driver.by.classname(\"site-nav-list-example\")).then(function() { //verifies that the page logo footer at bottom of page has loaded return $browser.findelement($driver.by.classname(\"site-footer-logo\")); }); }); }); }); Copy",

      "body": "Application monitoring tips you need to know It's one thing to know how to use APM, but it's another thing to know how to use New Relic's application performance monitoring software well. Here are some best practices designed to help you become an APM pro—and a key asset to your team! Tip To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic Explorer in New Relic One. 1. Standardize application names Most New Relic agents provide a default application name, such as \"My Application\" or \"PHP Application,\" if you don't specify one in your New Relic configuration file. You don't want to end up with 20 identically named applications, be sure to select a descriptive identifier for your apps as soon you deploy them. To keep things consistent and easy to navigate, New Relic recommends standardizing your application naming (for example, all apps in Staging append [ Staging] or the like at the end of their names). Ideally, you want your new Java applications to be named automatically to reduce the chances of typographical errors and misnaming. How to do it For Java applications, automatic application naming can come from the following sources: Request attribute Servlet init parameter Filter init parameter Web app context parameter Web app context name (display name) Web app context path Choose the method that fits best your needs and follow these steps. For non-Java applications, there are no automatic naming methods, so refer to the documentation for your APM agent. 2. Add tags to your applications When several different applications use the same account, and each application spans multiple environments (for example, development, test, pre-production, production), it can be hard to find a specific application in your overview dashboard. That's why we recommend adding tags to your apps so that you can segment them into logical groups. The two most common tags that mature APM customers use are application name and environment. So, for example, if you wanted to view the billing application in Test, you could simply filter by \"billing app\" (name tag) and \"test\" (environment tag). Caution In the APM agent configuration settings files, use the labels field to add tags to your data. For example, see this description of the Python labels setting. APM is designed so that apps can roll up into an unlimited number of meaningful tag categories. How to do it Learn about tags. Learn how to add tags. Learn how to query tags. 3. Create and evaluate alert policies When key performance indicators spike or drop, individuals and teams in your organization need to be notified. Alerting in New Relic provides a set of tools including dynamic baselines that allow you to detect problems before they impact your end users. Alert policies can be set up in two primary ways: Static threshold alerts are great when you already know the nature of an application and its normal behaviors aren't likely to change anytime soon. Apdex score, response time, error rate, throughput are some of the static thresholds you can create alert policies on. Dynamic baseline alerts make it easy to determine and set dynamic alert thresholds for applications with varying seasonal patterns and growth trends (which make it difficult to set thresholds that define normal behavior). These alerts use baselines modeled from your application’s historical metric data. Each alert policy can contain as many conditions as you need, and each alert condition includes three components: Type of condition (metric, external service, and so on) Entities that the policy targets (for example, APM apps, browser monitoring apps, or hosts) Thresholds that escalate into alerting situations with increasing severity Once you have your alerting set up, you then want to make sure you're taking advantage of all viable notification channels. After all, what good are alerts if no one knows about them? You can manage alerts by creating specific user groups and by leveraging New Relic's integrated alert channels, including Slack, PagerDuty, webhooks, and email. Be sure to evaluate alert policies on a regular basis to ensure that they are always valid. How to do it See the detailed documentation: To set up dynamic baseline alerts and choose an application, follow standard procedures. You will see a preview of the metric with the predicted baseline You can select a metric for that application and see the corresponding baseline. Then, using the threshold sliders, you can set how closely you want your threshold to follow the baseline prediction. To set up static threshold alerts for your Apdex settings, follow standard procedures. To set up your alert notification channels, follow standard procedures. 4. Identify and set up key transactions Depending on the nature of your application, some transactions may be more important to you than others. New Relic's key transactions feature is designed to help you closely monitor what you consider to be your app's most business-critical transactions, whether that's end-user or app response time, call counts, error rates, or something else. You can also set alert threshold levels for notifications when your key transactions are performing poorly. How to do it In the menu bar, select More > Key transactions, and then select Add more. Then select the app and web transaction or, from the selected transaction, select Track as key transaction. Type a name for the key transaction, and select Track key transaction. Optional: If the agent for the selected app supports custom alerting, use the default values that New Relic automatically fills, or select Edit key alert transaction policy to set the Apdex and alert threshold values. To view the key transactions dashboard details, select View new key transaction. 5. Track deployment history When development teams are pushing new code out as frequently as possible, it can be hard to measure the impact that each deployment is having on performance. One way to stay in tune with how these changes are affecting your application is with deployment reports. These reports list recent deployments and their impact on end-users and app servers' Apdex scores, along with response times, throughput, and errors. You can also view and drill down into the details to catch errors related to recent deployments, or file a ticket and share details with your team. How to do it From the New Relic menu bar, select APM > (selected app) > Events > Deployments. To view performance after a deployment, go to the selected app's Overview dashboard in the Recent events section. A blue vertical bar on a chart indicates a deployment. To view summary information about the deployment, point to the blue bar. 6. Review APM reports From SLA, deployment, and capacity to scalability, host usage reports, and more, APM offers a variety of downloadable reporting tools surfacing historical trends—all great ways to report to senior executive teams or customers. Take a look at the full list of reports and use them to your advantage. How to do it From the APM menu bar, select Applications > (selected app) > Reports. Select the report you'd like to see. If you want to save or export a report to share, select Download this report as .csv, which will create a report with comma-separated values. 7. Review your environment with service maps Use New Relic service maps, a feature included in APM, to understand how apps and services in your architecture connect and talk to each other. Service maps are visual, customizable representations of your application architecture. Maps automatically show you your app's connections and dependencies, including databases and external services. Health indicators and performance metrics show you the current operational status for every part of your architecture. How to do it Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps. To get started, see Introduction to service maps. 8. Keep current With New Relic’s SaaS platform, getting new features is as easy as updating your agent. Most likely your organization already has a set of scripts for deploying application upgrades into your environment. In a similar fashion, you can also automate your New Relic agent deployment to ensure that your systems are up to date. Both Puppet and Chef scripts are great examples of deployment frameworks that make life easier by allowing you to automate your entire deployment and management process. How to do it Regularly review which version of the agent you're using so that you know when an update is needed. If the latest agent release contains a needed fix or added functionality, download it. To deploy the agent automatically (preferred as a method to avoid errors): Use existing deployment scripts, provided they can be adapted to handle the deployment. OR Create and maintain a script that specifically deploys and configures the New Relic agent. Ideally, the script would pull the agent files from a repository where the files are versioned (for rollback purposes). Once the script has been created, shut down the application (unless script handles this). Run the deployment script. Start the application (unless script handles this). If problems arise, run the script to roll back to the previous version. To deploy the agent manually: Back up the current agent directory. Deploy the updated agent into the existing agent directory. Modify configuration files by comparing new files with existing files. In particular, make sure things like license key and custom extensions are copied over to the new configuration. Restart the application. If problems arise, restore the old agent using the backup and restart. 9. Manage user access How you manage your users depends on which user model your users are on: See original user management docs See New Relic One user management docs",

      "body": "Want even longer periods of uninterrupted sleep? Here are eight best practices to make dynamic infrastructure and server monitoring even easier with New Relic's infrastructure monitoring. 1. Install the infrastructure agent across your entire environment Our infrastructure monitoring solution was designed to help enterprise customers monitor their large and dynamically changing environments at scale. In order to facilitate this, the UI is completely driven by tags that let you visualize aggregated metrics, events, and inventory for a large number of servers. To really get the most out of infrastructure monitoring, we recommend installing it across your entire environment, preferably even across multiple regions and clusters. This will provide a more accurate picture of the health of your host ecosystem and the impact your infrastructure has on your applications. Want to achieve faster Mean Time To Resolution (MTTR)? Install the infrastructure agent on database servers, web servers, and any other host that supports your applications. When deploying the agent, leverage custom attributes to tag your hosts so that you can use those for filtering the data presented in the UI and for setting alerts. This is in addition to any Amazon EC2 tags you may be using which will auto-import when you enable the EC2 integration. You may also prefer to keep the agent logs separate from the system logs, which you can do through the configuration. How to do it Leverage our install modules for config management tools such as Chef, Puppet and Ansible to easily deploy your agent across all your infrastructure. Read the instructions in the github repo for your config management tool referenced in the link above and define the custom_attributes you want to use to tag your hosts. Set the log_file attribute to your preferred location for the infrastructure agent logs. Tip If you are installing the agent on a single host, the process should only take a few minutes and you can find detailed instructions in our documentation. 2. Configure the native EC2 integration If you have an AWS environment, in addition to installing the infrastructure agent on your EC2 instances to monitor them, we also recommend configuring the EC2 integration so that New Relic can automatically import all the tags and metadata associated with your AWS instances. This allows you to filter down to a part of your infrastructure using the same AWS tags (example, ECTag_Role='Kafka'), and slice-and-dice your data in multiple ways. Additionally, our ‘Alerts’ and ‘Saved Filter Sets’ are completely tag-driven and dynamic, so they automatically add/remove instances matching these tags to give our users the most real-time views that scale with your cloud infrastructure. 3. Activate the integrations Monitoring your infrastructure extends beyond just CPU, memory, and storage utilization. That’s why New Relic has out-of-the-box integrations that allow you to monitor all the services that support your hosts as well. Activate any of our integrations, including AWS Billing, AWS ELB, Amazon S3, MySQL, NGINX, and more, to extend monitoring to your AWS or on-host applications, and access the pre-configured dashboards that appear for each of them. 4. Create filter sets With New Relic, users can create filter sets to organize hosts, cluster roles, and other resources based on criteria that matter the most to users. This allows you to optimize your resources by using a focused view to monitor, detect, and resolve any problems proactively. The attributes for filtering are populated from the auto-imported EC2 tags or custom tags that may be applied to hosts. You can combine as many filters as you want in a filter set, and save them to share with other people in your account. You’ll also be able to see the color-coded health status of each host inside the filter set, so you can quickly identify problematic areas of your infrastructure. Additionally, filter sets can be used in the health map to get an overview of your infrastructure performance at a glance based on the filters that matter to your teams. 5. Create alert conditions With New Relic, you can create alert conditions directly within the context of what you are currently monitoring with New Relic. For example, if you are viewing a filter set comprised of a large number of hosts and notice a problem, you don’t need to create an individual alert condition for every host within. Instead, we recommend initiating the alert condition directly from the chart of the metric you are viewing and creating it based on the filter tags. This will create an alert condition for any hosts that match those tags, allowing our infrastructure monitoring to automatically remove hosts that go offline and add new hosts to the alert condition if they match those tags. Alerts configured once for the appropriate tags will scale correctly across all future hosts. And know that you can also leverage existing alert policies for infrastructure alert conditions. 6. View infrastructure data alongside APM data The integration between APM and infrastructure monitoring lets you see your APM data and infrastructure data side by side, so you can find the root cause of problems more quickly, no matter where they originate. This allows users to view the performance relationship of your hosts and the applications running on them, allowing for quicker diagnosis of the issue and impact on the business’ health. Use health maps to quickly spot any issues or alerts related to the health of your applications and how that connects to the supporting infrastructure. The first boxes starting from the top left are those that require your attention. 7. Access Infrastructure data using the Data explorer Teams that use multiple New Relic capabilities find it useful to create a single dashboard to visually correlate the infrastructure’s health with application, browser and synthetics metrics. That’s where New Relic data exploration features comes in. All the granular metrics and events collected by infrastructure monitoring are stored in New Relic and are accessible to you immediately. Having access to the raw metrics means you can run more custom queries using NRQL, and also create dashboards to share infrastructure metrics with your team. 8. Update your agents regularly New Relic’s software engineering team is constantly pushing out improvements and new features to improve our customers’ overall monitoring experience. In order to take advantage of all the awesomeness they’re delivering, we recommend regularly updating to the latest version of the infrastructure agent. Want more user tips?

      "body": "New Relic's synthetic monitoring—powered by a Selenium-driven Chrome browser—allows you to monitor and test your apps and address issues before they affect your end users. Here are five tips to help you take immediate advantage of its full power. 1. Match your monitor type to monitoring need Synthetic monitors are virtual browsers that measure the performance of your website, recording each check in detail. They also capture aggregate numbers for load time, uptime, and average download size, as well as an overview, detailed statistics for each page resource, and downtime incidents. There are four types of synthetic monitors; the ones you deploy will depend on the things you want to monitor: Ping monitors—to ensure that your site is accessible. Simple browser monitors—to ensure end-user performance. Scripted browsers—to ensure that particular resources are present. API monitors—to ensure that your app server works as well as your website. How to do it To add a monitor, go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics (or one.eu.newrelic.com if you have an EU-based account) and click Create monitor. Specify monitor type, name, and URL. Optional: Add a validation string (available for ping and simple browser) or advanced options, which enable substring monitoring for the following types of response validation: Verify SSL (for ping and simple browser). This option verifies the validity of the SSL certificate chain. It can be duplicated by running the following syntax: openssl s_client -servername {YOUR_HOSTNAME} -connect {YOUR_HOSTNAME}:443 -CApath /etc/ssl/certs > /dev/null Copy Bypass HEAD request (for ping). This option skips the default HEAD request and instead uses the GET verb with a ping check. Redirect is Failure (for ping). If a redirect result occurs when Redirect is Failure is enabled, Synthetics categorizes it as a failure (rather than following the redirect and checking the resulting URL). Select the locations where you want your monitor to run. Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Optional: Set up alert notifications. Select Create my monitor to confirm. Wait a few minutes; then from the Monitors index check your monitor. 2. View all monitors with the Monitors index page Continuous application performance monitoring is essential to ensure that web services are in place, working correctly, and error-free. Synthetic monitoring provides this type of assurance by performing automated tests on your web application for each selected location—noting downtime instances (“violations”) and collecting aggregate numbers, results, and detailed statistics for each page resource. Use the Monitors index page to get a high level view of this information, or select an individual monitor to view the Summary, for ping monitors, or Overview, for simple and scripted monitors, page and get a deeper insight into its performance over time. How to view your monitors in the New Relic One: New Relic Explorer To view a list of monitors using the New Relic One Monitors index page: Go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Synthetic monitors. For more information, see the documentation about navigating core UI components in New Relic One. Monitors index page To view a list of monitors using the Monitors index page: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics. 3. View individual monitor results It’s not enough to understand how your web apps are performing for your West Coast customers; you need to be able to view how they’re performing across the country and around the globe. By taking advantage of synthetic monitors and visiting your Results page, you can see how everything from development to production affects user experience. You can locate interesting results by sorting the list to identify slow, fast, or other unusual results. Or filter by location to understand how monitor performance varies with geography. (The “Network timings” graph below provides a snapshot of webpage performance over a given period.) How to do it: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics and, from the Monitors tab, select your monitor. Select Monitor > Results. Gain an up-to-the-minute view of the slowest page loads for every monitored location. 4. Understand the load-time impact of each resource Visit the synthetics Resources page to see how each resource on your website—including CSS, JavaScript, images, HTML and more—is affecting your overall load. You can drill into detailed metrics collected at run time, locate performance information for time spent by third-party resources, and identify HTTP response codes for each resource. How to do it: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics and, from the Monitors drop-down menu, select your monitor. Select Monitor > Resources. 5. Configure and develop a scripted browser test Using scripted browsers, you can build complex monitoring workflows using the Selenium JavaScript Webdriver bindings. For instance, you can log in to the application, navigate to a particular link, and wait for a page element to load and add an assertion. How to do it: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics. Choose your monitor type (for example, scripted browser). Enter the name and details of your monitor (for example, Sitename.com scripted browser) Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run (for example, Mumbai, Seoul, Columbus, and Montreal). Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor (for example, five minutes). Set a notification method to alert your team when performance violations occur. You are now ready to write your script. (Below is an example of a script used to test the performance of a main navigation page.) var assert = require('chai').assert; // script-wide timeout for all wait and waitandfind functions (in ms) var default_element_timeout = 190000; //3 mins var default_pageload_timeout = 240000; //4 mins var navlinks = [\"css-locator-1\", \"css-locator-2\"]; //sets element load timeout to 3 mins $browser.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(default_element_timeout); //sets page load timoeout to 4 mins $browser.manage().timeouts().pageloadTimeout(default_pageload_timeout); //test all the main nav page performances $browser.get(\"http://www.sitename.com\").then(function() { return $browser.findelement($driver.by.classname(\"site-theme-example\")); }).then(function() { //verifies the nav list has loaded return $browser.findelement($driver.by.classname(\"site-nav-list-example\")); }).then(function() { //loops through the navlinks array navlinks.foreach(function(val, i, arr) { //finds and navigates to each navlink page return $browser.findelement($driver.by.classname(navlinks[i])).click().then(function() { //verifies that the nav list loaded before moving on return $browser.findelement($driver.by.classname(\"site-nav-list-example\")).then(function() { //verifies that the page logo footer at bottom of page has loaded return $browser.findelement($driver.by.classname(\"site-footer-logo\")); }); }); }); }); Copy",

You may also prefer to keep the agent logs separate from the system logs, which you can do through the configuration. How to do it Leverage our install modules for config management tools such as Chef, Puppet and Ansible to easily deploy your agent across all your infrastructure. Read the instructions in the github repo for your config management tool referenced in the link above and define the custom_attributes you want to use to tag your hosts. Set the log_file attribute to your preferred location for the infrastructure agent logs. Tip If you are installing the agent on a single host, the process should only take a few minutes and you can find detailed instructions in our documentation. 2. Configure the native EC2 integration If you have an AWS environment, in addition to installing the infrastructure agent on your EC2 instances to monitor them, we also recommend configuring the EC2 integration so that New Relic can automatically import all the tags and metadata associated with your AWS instances. This allows you to filter down to a part of your infrastructure using the same AWS tags (example, ECTag_Role='Kafka'), and slice-and-dice your data in multiple ways. Additionally, our ‘Alerts’ and ‘Saved Filter Sets’ are completely tag-driven and dynamic, so they automatically add/remove instances matching these tags to give our users the most real-time views that scale with your cloud infrastructure. 3. Activate the integrations Monitoring your infrastructure extends beyond just CPU, memory, and storage utilization. That’s why New Relic has out-of-the-box integrations that allow you to monitor all the services that support your hosts as well. Activate any of our integrations, including AWS Billing, AWS ELB, Amazon S3, MySQL, NGINX, and more, to extend monitoring to your AWS or on-host applications, and access the pre-configured dashboards that appear for each of them. 4. Create filter sets With New Relic, users can create filter sets to organize hosts, cluster roles, and other resources based on criteria that matter the most to users. This allows you to optimize your resources by using a focused view to monitor, detect, and resolve any problems proactively. The attributes for filtering are populated from the auto-imported EC2 tags or custom tags that may be applied to hosts. You can combine as many filters as you want in a filter set, and save them to share with other people in your account. You’ll also be able to see the color-coded health status of each host inside the filter set, so you can quickly identify problematic areas of your infrastructure. Additionally, filter sets can be used in the health map to get an overview of your infrastructure performance at a glance based on the filters that matter to your teams. 5. Create alert conditions With New Relic, you can create alert conditions directly within the context of what you are currently monitoring with New Relic. For example, if you are viewing a filter set comprised of a large number of hosts and notice a problem, you don’t need to create an individual alert condition for every host within. Instead, we recommend initiating the alert condition directly from the chart of the metric you are viewing and creating it based on the filter tags. This will create an alert condition for any hosts that match those tags, allowing our infrastructure monitoring to automatically remove hosts that go offline and add new hosts to the alert condition if they match those tags. Alerts configured once for the appropriate tags will scale correctly across all future hosts. And know that you can also leverage existing alert policies for infrastructure alert conditions. 6. View infrastructure data alongside APM data The integration between APM and infrastructure monitoring lets you see your APM data and infrastructure data side by side, so you can find the root cause of problems more quickly, no matter where they originate. This allows users to view the performance relationship of your hosts and the applications running on them, allowing for quicker diagnosis of the issue and impact on the business’ health. Use health maps to quickly spot any issues or alerts related to the health of your applications and how that connects to the supporting infrastructure. The first boxes starting from the top left are those that require your attention. 7. Access Infrastructure data using the Data explorer Teams that use multiple New Relic capabilities find it useful to create a single dashboard to visually correlate the infrastructure’s health with application, browser and synthetics metrics. That’s where New Relic data exploration features comes in. All the granular metrics and events collected by infrastructure monitoring are stored in New Relic and are accessible to you immediately. Having access to the raw metrics means you can run more custom queries using NRQL, and also create dashboards to share infrastructure metrics with your team. 8. Update your agents regularly New Relic’s software engineering team is constantly pushing out improvements and new features to improve our customers’ overall monitoring experience. In order to take advantage of all the awesomeness they’re delivering, we recommend regularly updating to the latest version of the infrastructure agent. Want more user tips?

      "body": "By eliminating crashes and increasing speed across the stack, you can build better performance into every mobile app release. Here are some best practices to take full advantage of mobile monitoring with New Relic. 1. Start collecting data Start collecting data in production. You'll see immediate value by adding our mobile monitoring SDK to your app for its next release to the app store. We recommend installing the iOS or Android agent to your production release even if you're simply testing New Relic's capabilities. This will ensure you'll get an adequate amount of data to really understand all of our mobile monitoring capabilities and your end users' experience. How to do it Add your mobile app to New Relic First, add a new app in New Relic's user interface (full steps): Go to one.newrelic.com and click Mobile. From the list of monitored apps, select Add more. Select the relevant platform. Type a name for your mobile app, and select Continue. Use one app and the associated app token for the development releases of your iOS app, another app and its associated app token for the production releases of that iOS app, and another pair of app tokens for development and production releases of your Android app. You'll be able to compare data from across the four app tokens using our query builder. Install and configure our mobile SDK Next, install and configure the mobile agent: Download the latest version of New Relic's SDK for iOS or Android, and add it to your mobile app. (Full steps for iOS and Android) Configure your installation as needed. For example: Enable the feature flag to capture MobileRequest events to use our full network analysis capabilities for iOS or Android. Automate dSYM uploads for your production builds. To avoid surprises, follow the standard pattern of where you start our mobile agent. In addition, start our agent before you initiate any other SDKs. For more information, see our documentation for Android installation and configuration and for iOS installation and configuration. Deploy a new release of your application. 2. Explore your data Immediately be able to explore your data. As soon as New Relic starts reporting data, take the time to explore the wealth of information about your mobile apps. To get started, go to one.newrelic.com and select Mobile. How to do it Analyze, resolve, and prevent crashes Find the cause of crashes so you can fix them. Then, uncover trends behind crashes so you can prevent them: From the summary UI page for a monitored mobile app, click Crash analysis. Analyze crash data so you can see and fix the most impactful crashes. Follow the breadcrumbs in the crash event trail to fix crashes and resolve critical errors more easily: From your mobile app's Crash analysis page in the UI, select a Crash type. From the crash type's Summary page, select the Crash trail tab. Monitor your key workflows Create custom breadcrumbs to monitor key workflows (such as your app's login or checkout process), track user clicks, optimize timing, and identify crash locations for faster MTTR. Get actionable session data Borrow from our example queries to: See how much of your user base has upgraded to your latest app version. Track adoption over time. Get a count of new installs as compared to upgrades from an earlier version. See the distribution of usage across geographical locations, carriers, ASN owners (wi-fi providers), devices, connection types, and more. 3. Take preventive steps Use alert notifications to help uncover the causes behind crashes and errors. Once you are running our mobile monitoring capabilities in production and have explored some of the key features, you can use New Relic to uncover critical issues with your mobile application. In particular, focus on crashes and errors. Use metric-based alerts as a starting point to gain high-level visibility into problems. Then, as new services or functionalities are added, use New Relic’s more targeted, event-based (NRQL) alerts to make sure that the most critical issues are handled swiftly. Use these alerts to determine whether a crash is impacting a large number of users. If it is, the relevant people (for example, both the mobile app team’s on-call member and the owner of the related back-end service) will be alerted. Make sure that your team knows how to respond to changes in crash rate (crashes per sessions) and the percentage of users impacted by crashes of your mobile app. How to do it Metric-based alerts Use our metric-based alerts and mobile monitoring UI: Ensure that key members of your mobile team have opted in to receive emails for new crashes. These emails will take you to the crash type in the UI page for your mobile app. Create an alert for your crash rate threshold that key members of your team can view in Slack or any other Alerts notification channel you choose. Your alert notification will include a link to our UI, where you can examine a chart with the exceeded threshold. From there, a link will take you to the relevant mobile monitoring page, where you can get additional details. Event-based alerts Combine the metric-based workflow with event-based alerts and dashboards specific to your mobile app and system. Create your NRQL alert that focuses on crashes of your most recently released production version. Create an additional NRQL alert that focuses on the percentage of users impacted by crashes in your latest app version (to check the overall impact on your user base). 4. Dig deeper into crashes Take your crash reporting to the next level. Now it’s time to tackle some of those harder-to-reproduce crashes by: Applying additional instrumentation to your application. Leveraging crash event trails, NRQL queries, and dashboards to visualize your data. How to do it Crash analysis Crashes are an inevitable part of running mobile applications at scale. We provide tools to help you understand your highest-impact crashes. Use the Crash analysis UI to see which crashes are occurring most often, the percentage of crash-free users, which files and methods are associated with perhaps 80 percent of your crashes, which crashes a particular user just experienced, and more. Go after high-impact crashes with crash analysis: Add custom attributes to categorize the highest-value customers, and then use them to segment crashes according to your most valuable audiences. Add breadcrumbs and custom events to produce a detailed trail of events leading up to every crash occurrence (over the last 90 days). Then, view this crash event trail in our mobile monitoring UI. Use our mobile monitoring's Versions trends page to make sure you’re improving the crash rate over subsequent releases and avoiding regressions. Breadcrumbs Use breadcrumbs and custom attributes to better reproduce and debug crashes. For example, use our recordBreadrumb API for Android or iOS to track mid-session changes in state that can help debug crashes, such as: Change of connection type Change of orientation CPU and memory state at key points in the app code Custom attributes Add custom attributes to existing events, so you can ask even more precise questions of your mobile app. Add dimensions such as: User ID: Use to react to specific user concerns and to better understand which customers and segments are most impacted. Store ID: Use to address problems with out-of-date devices, bad wi-fi, and so on. User segments: Use to better understand which customers and segments are most impacted; for example, logged in vs. non-logged in. Money in the cart at session end Origin or attribution of entry into the app Standardize custom attribute names across your mobile apps, and align with your website (if you're using our browser monitoring), so that you can compare and contrast performance across end-user channels. The mobile agents track the last interaction of crashed and non-crashed sessions to provide visibility into what the user viewed before exiting your app (either intentionally or due to a crash). 5. Focus on KPIs Bring your key performance indicators to life. Create custom interactions and events to hone in on the most important signals, including user activity for the business-critical aspects of your app. Using these powerful APIs, you can add custom instrumentation to just about anything. The following are some example use cases. How to do it Track and query feature use Use custom events to track feature use. For example: Use custom events to track user flow between app and website. Use custom events or mobile breadcrumbs to optimize the performance of key user flows (log in, shopping cart, etc.). use custom events to provide faster, contextualized support experiences for your digital customers. Use the recordCustomEvent API. Then compare the use of different features using: SELECT count(*) FROM MyNewMobileEventType FACET name Copy Measure page load times Use custom events to measure page load time: Create an app-launch timer to measure the time that elapses between a user-tap to launch your app and the point in your app code where the first screen is available. Record the timer value in New Relic using something like the following: recordCustomEvent(<myMobileTimers>, <appLaunch>, {attributes}) Copy Define start and stop timers to measure spinner durations, and then record this time in New Relic using something like the following: recordCustomEvent(<myMobileTimers>, <spinnerOnScreenA>, {attributes}) Copy Track specific user actions or funnel steps in the app (like \"add to cart\"), and include the price as an attribute on that event. Measure flows through the application by viewing the related funnel steps with custom events in Insights. For example, create a timer to track the start and end times of a subflow or an entire flow across multiple funnel steps to understand how long it took users to get through the process. Examine data about webpage interactions Use custom interactions to see traces associated with the same webpages. Use the agent API to disable default interactions, and focus on custom interactions so that you can review the page loads that are most crucial to your primary funnel. Define the start and stop times of these custom interactions to trace activities associated with individual steps of that funnel (for example, a specific user action or a page load). Track the last interactions of crashed and non-crashed sessions so that you can see what the user viewed before exiting your app (either intentionally or from a crash). Example query for non-crashed sessions: SELECT count(*) FROM Mobile WHERE sessionCrashed is null FACET lastInteraction SINCE 90 days ago Copy Example query for crashed sessions: SELECT count(*) FROM Mobile WHERE sessionCrashed is true FACET lastInteraction SINCE 90 days ago Copy",

      "body": "New Relic's synthetic monitoring—powered by a Selenium-driven Chrome browser—allows you to monitor and test your apps and address issues before they affect your end users. Here are five tips to help you take immediate advantage of its full power. 1. Match your monitor type to monitoring need Synthetic monitors are virtual browsers that measure the performance of your website, recording each check in detail. They also capture aggregate numbers for load time, uptime, and average download size, as well as an overview, detailed statistics for each page resource, and downtime incidents. There are four types of synthetic monitors; the ones you deploy will depend on the things you want to monitor: Ping monitors—to ensure that your site is accessible. Simple browser monitors—to ensure end-user performance. Scripted browsers—to ensure that particular resources are present. API monitors—to ensure that your app server works as well as your website. How to do it To add a monitor, go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics (or one.eu.newrelic.com if you have an EU-based account) and click Create monitor. Specify monitor type, name, and URL. Optional: Add a validation string (available for ping and simple browser) or advanced options, which enable substring monitoring for the following types of response validation: Verify SSL (for ping and simple browser). This option verifies the validity of the SSL certificate chain. It can be duplicated by running the following syntax: openssl s_client -servername {YOUR_HOSTNAME} -connect {YOUR_HOSTNAME}:443 -CApath /etc/ssl/certs > /dev/null Copy Bypass HEAD request (for ping). This option skips the default HEAD request and instead uses the GET verb with a ping check. Redirect is Failure (for ping). If a redirect result occurs when Redirect is Failure is enabled, Synthetics categorizes it as a failure (rather than following the redirect and checking the resulting URL). Select the locations where you want your monitor to run. Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Optional: Set up alert notifications. Select Create my monitor to confirm. Wait a few minutes; then from the Monitors index check your monitor. 2. View all monitors with the Monitors index page Continuous application performance monitoring is essential to ensure that web services are in place, working correctly, and error-free. Synthetic monitoring provides this type of assurance by performing automated tests on your web application for each selected location—noting downtime instances (“violations”) and collecting aggregate numbers, results, and detailed statistics for each page resource. Use the Monitors index page to get a high level view of this information, or select an individual monitor to view the Summary, for ping monitors, or Overview, for simple and scripted monitors, page and get a deeper insight into its performance over time. How to view your monitors in the New Relic One: New Relic Explorer To view a list of monitors using the New Relic One Monitors index page: Go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Synthetic monitors. For more information, see the documentation about navigating core UI components in New Relic One. Monitors index page To view a list of monitors using the Monitors index page: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics. 3. View individual monitor results It’s not enough to understand how your web apps are performing for your West Coast customers; you need to be able to view how they’re performing across the country and around the globe. By taking advantage of synthetic monitors and visiting your Results page, you can see how everything from development to production affects user experience. You can locate interesting results by sorting the list to identify slow, fast, or other unusual results. Or filter by location to understand how monitor performance varies with geography. (The “Network timings” graph below provides a snapshot of webpage performance over a given period.) How to do it: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics and, from the Monitors tab, select your monitor. Select Monitor > Results. Gain an up-to-the-minute view of the slowest page loads for every monitored location. 4. Understand the load-time impact of each resource Visit the synthetics Resources page to see how each resource on your website—including CSS, JavaScript, images, HTML and more—is affecting your overall load. You can drill into detailed metrics collected at run time, locate performance information for time spent by third-party resources, and identify HTTP response codes for each resource. How to do it: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics and, from the Monitors drop-down menu, select your monitor. Select Monitor > Resources. 5. Configure and develop a scripted browser test Using scripted browsers, you can build complex monitoring workflows using the Selenium JavaScript Webdriver bindings. For instance, you can log in to the application, navigate to a particular link, and wait for a page element to load and add an assertion. How to do it: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics. Choose your monitor type (for example, scripted browser). Enter the name and details of your monitor (for example, Sitename.com scripted browser) Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run (for example, Mumbai, Seoul, Columbus, and Montreal). Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor (for example, five minutes). Set a notification method to alert your team when performance violations occur. You are now ready to write your script. (Below is an example of a script used to test the performance of a main navigation page.) var assert = require('chai').assert; // script-wide timeout for all wait and waitandfind functions (in ms) var default_element_timeout = 190000; //3 mins var default_pageload_timeout = 240000; //4 mins var navlinks = [\"css-locator-1\", \"css-locator-2\"]; //sets element load timeout to 3 mins $browser.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(default_element_timeout); //sets page load timoeout to 4 mins $browser.manage().timeouts().pageloadTimeout(default_pageload_timeout); //test all the main nav page performances $browser.get(\"http://www.sitename.com\").then(function() { return $browser.findelement($driver.by.classname(\"site-theme-example\")); }).then(function() { //verifies the nav list has loaded return $browser.findelement($driver.by.classname(\"site-nav-list-example\")); }).then(function() { //loops through the navlinks array navlinks.foreach(function(val, i, arr) { //finds and navigates to each navlink page return $browser.findelement($driver.by.classname(navlinks[i])).click().then(function() { //verifies that the nav list loaded before moving on return $browser.findelement($driver.by.classname(\"site-nav-list-example\")).then(function() { //verifies that the page logo footer at bottom of page has loaded return $browser.findelement($driver.by.classname(\"site-footer-logo\")); }); }); }); }); Copy",

      "body": "Application monitoring tips you need to know It's one thing to know how to use APM, but it's another thing to know how to use New Relic's application performance monitoring software well. Here are some best practices designed to help you become an APM pro—and a key asset to your team! Tip To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic Explorer in New Relic One. 1. Standardize application names Most New Relic agents provide a default application name, such as \"My Application\" or \"PHP Application,\" if you don't specify one in your New Relic configuration file. You don't want to end up with 20 identically named applications, be sure to select a descriptive identifier for your apps as soon you deploy them. To keep things consistent and easy to navigate, New Relic recommends standardizing your application naming (for example, all apps in Staging append [ Staging] or the like at the end of their names). Ideally, you want your new Java applications to be named automatically to reduce the chances of typographical errors and misnaming. How to do it For Java applications, automatic application naming can come from the following sources: Request attribute Servlet init parameter Filter init parameter Web app context parameter Web app context name (display name) Web app context path Choose the method that fits best your needs and follow these steps. For non-Java applications, there are no automatic naming methods, so refer to the documentation for your APM agent. 2. Add tags to your applications When several different applications use the same account, and each application spans multiple environments (for example, development, test, pre-production, production), it can be hard to find a specific application in your overview dashboard. That's why we recommend adding tags to your apps so that you can segment them into logical groups. The two most common tags that mature APM customers use are application name and environment. So, for example, if you wanted to view the billing application in Test, you could simply filter by \"billing app\" (name tag) and \"test\" (environment tag). Caution In the APM agent configuration settings files, use the labels field to add tags to your data. For example, see this description of the Python labels setting. APM is designed so that apps can roll up into an unlimited number of meaningful tag categories. How to do it Learn about tags. Learn how to add tags. Learn how to query tags. 3. Create and evaluate alert policies When key performance indicators spike or drop, individuals and teams in your organization need to be notified. Alerting in New Relic provides a set of tools including dynamic baselines that allow you to detect problems before they impact your end users. Alert policies can be set up in two primary ways: Static threshold alerts are great when you already know the nature of an application and its normal behaviors aren't likely to change anytime soon. Apdex score, response time, error rate, throughput are some of the static thresholds you can create alert policies on. Dynamic baseline alerts make it easy to determine and set dynamic alert thresholds for applications with varying seasonal patterns and growth trends (which make it difficult to set thresholds that define normal behavior). These alerts use baselines modeled from your application’s historical metric data. Each alert policy can contain as many conditions as you need, and each alert condition includes three components: Type of condition (metric, external service, and so on) Entities that the policy targets (for example, APM apps, browser monitoring apps, or hosts) Thresholds that escalate into alerting situations with increasing severity Once you have your alerting set up, you then want to make sure you're taking advantage of all viable notification channels. After all, what good are alerts if no one knows about them? You can manage alerts by creating specific user groups and by leveraging New Relic's integrated alert channels, including Slack, PagerDuty, webhooks, and email. Be sure to evaluate alert policies on a regular basis to ensure that they are always valid. How to do it See the detailed documentation: To set up dynamic baseline alerts and choose an application, follow standard procedures. You will see a preview of the metric with the predicted baseline You can select a metric for that application and see the corresponding baseline. Then, using the threshold sliders, you can set how closely you want your threshold to follow the baseline prediction. To set up static threshold alerts for your Apdex settings, follow standard procedures. To set up your alert notification channels, follow standard procedures. 4. Identify and set up key transactions Depending on the nature of your application, some transactions may be more important to you than others. New Relic's key transactions feature is designed to help you closely monitor what you consider to be your app's most business-critical transactions, whether that's end-user or app response time, call counts, error rates, or something else. You can also set alert threshold levels for notifications when your key transactions are performing poorly. How to do it In the menu bar, select More > Key transactions, and then select Add more. Then select the app and web transaction or, from the selected transaction, select Track as key transaction. Type a name for the key transaction, and select Track key transaction. Optional: If the agent for the selected app supports custom alerting, use the default values that New Relic automatically fills, or select Edit key alert transaction policy to set the Apdex and alert threshold values. To view the key transactions dashboard details, select View new key transaction. 5. Track deployment history When development teams are pushing new code out as frequently as possible, it can be hard to measure the impact that each deployment is having on performance. One way to stay in tune with how these changes are affecting your application is with deployment reports. These reports list recent deployments and their impact on end-users and app servers' Apdex scores, along with response times, throughput, and errors. You can also view and drill down into the details to catch errors related to recent deployments, or file a ticket and share details with your team. How to do it From the New Relic menu bar, select APM > (selected app) > Events > Deployments. To view performance after a deployment, go to the selected app's Overview dashboard in the Recent events section. A blue vertical bar on a chart indicates a deployment. To view summary information about the deployment, point to the blue bar. 6. Review APM reports From SLA, deployment, and capacity to scalability, host usage reports, and more, APM offers a variety of downloadable reporting tools surfacing historical trends—all great ways to report to senior executive teams or customers. Take a look at the full list of reports and use them to your advantage. How to do it From the APM menu bar, select Applications > (selected app) > Reports. Select the report you'd like to see. If you want to save or export a report to share, select Download this report as .csv, which will create a report with comma-separated values. 7. Review your environment with service maps Use New Relic service maps, a feature included in APM, to understand how apps and services in your architecture connect and talk to each other. Service maps are visual, customizable representations of your application architecture. Maps automatically show you your app's connections and dependencies, including databases and external services. Health indicators and performance metrics show you the current operational status for every part of your architecture. How to do it Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps. To get started, see Introduction to service maps. 8. Keep current With New Relic’s SaaS platform, getting new features is as easy as updating your agent. Most likely your organization already has a set of scripts for deploying application upgrades into your environment. In a similar fashion, you can also automate your New Relic agent deployment to ensure that your systems are up to date. Both Puppet and Chef scripts are great examples of deployment frameworks that make life easier by allowing you to automate your entire deployment and management process. How to do it Regularly review which version of the agent you're using so that you know when an update is needed. If the latest agent release contains a needed fix or added functionality, download it. To deploy the agent automatically (preferred as a method to avoid errors): Use existing deployment scripts, provided they can be adapted to handle the deployment. OR Create and maintain a script that specifically deploys and configures the New Relic agent. Ideally, the script would pull the agent files from a repository where the files are versioned (for rollback purposes). Once the script has been created, shut down the application (unless script handles this). Run the deployment script. Start the application (unless script handles this). If problems arise, run the script to roll back to the previous version. To deploy the agent manually: Back up the current agent directory. Deploy the updated agent into the existing agent directory. Modify configuration files by comparing new files with existing files. In particular, make sure things like license key and custom extensions are copied over to the new configuration. Restart the application. If problems arise, restore the old agent using the backup and restart. 9. Manage user access How you manage your users depends on which user model your users are on: See original user management docs See New Relic One user management docs",

      "body": "Want even longer periods of uninterrupted sleep? Here are eight best practices to make dynamic infrastructure and server monitoring even easier with New Relic's infrastructure monitoring. 1. Install the infrastructure agent across your entire environment Our infrastructure monitoring solution was designed to help enterprise customers monitor their large and dynamically changing environments at scale. In order to facilitate this, the UI is completely driven by tags that let you visualize aggregated metrics, events, and inventory for a large number of servers. To really get the most out of infrastructure monitoring, we recommend installing it across your entire environment, preferably even across multiple regions and clusters. This will provide a more accurate picture of the health of your host ecosystem and the impact your infrastructure has on your applications. Want to achieve faster Mean Time To Resolution (MTTR)? Install the infrastructure agent on database servers, web servers, and any other host that supports your applications. When deploying the agent, leverage custom attributes to tag your hosts so that you can use those for filtering the data presented in the UI and for setting alerts. This is in addition to any Amazon EC2 tags you may be using which will auto-import when you enable the EC2 integration. You may also prefer to keep the agent logs separate from the system logs, which you can do through the configuration. How to do it Leverage our install modules for config management tools such as Chef, Puppet and Ansible to easily deploy your agent across all your infrastructure. Read the instructions in the github repo for your config management tool referenced in the link above and define the custom_attributes you want to use to tag your hosts. Set the log_file attribute to your preferred location for the infrastructure agent logs. Tip If you are installing the agent on a single host, the process should only take a few minutes and you can find detailed instructions in our documentation. 2. Configure the native EC2 integration If you have an AWS environment, in addition to installing the infrastructure agent on your EC2 instances to monitor them, we also recommend configuring the EC2 integration so that New Relic can automatically import all the tags and metadata associated with your AWS instances. This allows you to filter down to a part of your infrastructure using the same AWS tags (example, ECTag_Role='Kafka'), and slice-and-dice your data in multiple ways. Additionally, our ‘Alerts’ and ‘Saved Filter Sets’ are completely tag-driven and dynamic, so they automatically add/remove instances matching these tags to give our users the most real-time views that scale with your cloud infrastructure. 3. Activate the integrations Monitoring your infrastructure extends beyond just CPU, memory, and storage utilization. That’s why New Relic has out-of-the-box integrations that allow you to monitor all the services that support your hosts as well. Activate any of our integrations, including AWS Billing, AWS ELB, Amazon S3, MySQL, NGINX, and more, to extend monitoring to your AWS or on-host applications, and access the pre-configured dashboards that appear for each of them. 4. Create filter sets With New Relic, users can create filter sets to organize hosts, cluster roles, and other resources based on criteria that matter the most to users. This allows you to optimize your resources by using a focused view to monitor, detect, and resolve any problems proactively. The attributes for filtering are populated from the auto-imported EC2 tags or custom tags that may be applied to hosts. You can combine as many filters as you want in a filter set, and save them to share with other people in your account. You’ll also be able to see the color-coded health status of each host inside the filter set, so you can quickly identify problematic areas of your infrastructure. Additionally, filter sets can be used in the health map to get an overview of your infrastructure performance at a glance based on the filters that matter to your teams. 5. Create alert conditions With New Relic, you can create alert conditions directly within the context of what you are currently monitoring with New Relic. For example, if you are viewing a filter set comprised of a large number of hosts and notice a problem, you don’t need to create an individual alert condition for every host within. Instead, we recommend initiating the alert condition directly from the chart of the metric you are viewing and creating it based on the filter tags. This will create an alert condition for any hosts that match those tags, allowing our infrastructure monitoring to automatically remove hosts that go offline and add new hosts to the alert condition if they match those tags. Alerts configured once for the appropriate tags will scale correctly across all future hosts. And know that you can also leverage existing alert policies for infrastructure alert conditions. 6. View infrastructure data alongside APM data The integration between APM and infrastructure monitoring lets you see your APM data and infrastructure data side by side, so you can find the root cause of problems more quickly, no matter where they originate. This allows users to view the performance relationship of your hosts and the applications running on them, allowing for quicker diagnosis of the issue and impact on the business’ health. Use health maps to quickly spot any issues or alerts related to the health of your applications and how that connects to the supporting infrastructure. The first boxes starting from the top left are those that require your attention. 7. Access Infrastructure data using the Data explorer Teams that use multiple New Relic capabilities find it useful to create a single dashboard to visually correlate the infrastructure’s health with application, browser and synthetics metrics. That’s where New Relic data exploration features comes in. All the granular metrics and events collected by infrastructure monitoring are stored in New Relic and are accessible to you immediately. Having access to the raw metrics means you can run more custom queries using NRQL, and also create dashboards to share infrastructure metrics with your team. 8. Update your agents regularly New Relic’s software engineering team is constantly pushing out improvements and new features to improve our customers’ overall monitoring experience. In order to take advantage of all the awesomeness they’re delivering, we recommend regularly updating to the latest version of the infrastructure agent. Want more user tips?

      "body": "New Relic's synthetic monitoring—powered by a Selenium-driven Chrome browser—allows you to monitor and test your apps and address issues before they affect your end users. Here are five tips to help you take immediate advantage of its full power. 1. Match your monitor type to monitoring need Synthetic monitors are virtual browsers that measure the performance of your website, recording each check in detail. They also capture aggregate numbers for load time, uptime, and average download size, as well as an overview, detailed statistics for each page resource, and downtime incidents. There are four types of synthetic monitors; the ones you deploy will depend on the things you want to monitor: Ping monitors—to ensure that your site is accessible. Simple browser monitors—to ensure end-user performance. Scripted browsers—to ensure that particular resources are present. API monitors—to ensure that your app server works as well as your website. How to do it To add a monitor, go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics (or one.eu.newrelic.com if you have an EU-based account) and click Create monitor. Specify monitor type, name, and URL. Optional: Add a validation string (available for ping and simple browser) or advanced options, which enable substring monitoring for the following types of response validation: Verify SSL (for ping and simple browser). This option verifies the validity of the SSL certificate chain. It can be duplicated by running the following syntax: openssl s_client -servername {YOUR_HOSTNAME} -connect {YOUR_HOSTNAME}:443 -CApath /etc/ssl/certs > /dev/null Copy Bypass HEAD request (for ping). This option skips the default HEAD request and instead uses the GET verb with a ping check. Redirect is Failure (for ping). If a redirect result occurs when Redirect is Failure is enabled, Synthetics categorizes it as a failure (rather than following the redirect and checking the resulting URL). Select the locations where you want your monitor to run. Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Optional: Set up alert notifications. Select Create my monitor to confirm. Wait a few minutes; then from the Monitors index check your monitor. 2. View all monitors with the Monitors index page Continuous application performance monitoring is essential to ensure that web services are in place, working correctly, and error-free. Synthetic monitoring provides this type of assurance by performing automated tests on your web application for each selected location—noting downtime instances (“violations”) and collecting aggregate numbers, results, and detailed statistics for each page resource. Use the Monitors index page to get a high level view of this information, or select an individual monitor to view the Summary, for ping monitors, or Overview, for simple and scripted monitors, page and get a deeper insight into its performance over time. How to view your monitors in the New Relic One: New Relic Explorer To view a list of monitors using the New Relic One Monitors index page: Go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Synthetic monitors. For more information, see the documentation about navigating core UI components in New Relic One. Monitors index page To view a list of monitors using the Monitors index page: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics. 3. View individual monitor results It’s not enough to understand how your web apps are performing for your West Coast customers; you need to be able to view how they’re performing across the country and around the globe. By taking advantage of synthetic monitors and visiting your Results page, you can see how everything from development to production affects user experience. You can locate interesting results by sorting the list to identify slow, fast, or other unusual results. Or filter by location to understand how monitor performance varies with geography. (The “Network timings” graph below provides a snapshot of webpage performance over a given period.) How to do it: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics and, from the Monitors tab, select your monitor. Select Monitor > Results. Gain an up-to-the-minute view of the slowest page loads for every monitored location. 4. Understand the load-time impact of each resource Visit the synthetics Resources page to see how each resource on your website—including CSS, JavaScript, images, HTML and more—is affecting your overall load. You can drill into detailed metrics collected at run time, locate performance information for time spent by third-party resources, and identify HTTP response codes for each resource. How to do it: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics and, from the Monitors drop-down menu, select your monitor. Select Monitor > Resources. 5. Configure and develop a scripted browser test Using scripted browsers, you can build complex monitoring workflows using the Selenium JavaScript Webdriver bindings. For instance, you can log in to the application, navigate to a particular link, and wait for a page element to load and add an assertion. How to do it: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics. Choose your monitor type (for example, scripted browser). Enter the name and details of your monitor (for example, Sitename.com scripted browser) Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run (for example, Mumbai, Seoul, Columbus, and Montreal). Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor (for example, five minutes). Set a notification method to alert your team when performance violations occur. You are now ready to write your script. (Below is an example of a script used to test the performance of a main navigation page.) var assert = require('chai').assert; // script-wide timeout for all wait and waitandfind functions (in ms) var default_element_timeout = 190000; //3 mins var default_pageload_timeout = 240000; //4 mins var navlinks = [\"css-locator-1\", \"css-locator-2\"]; //sets element load timeout to 3 mins $browser.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(default_element_timeout); //sets page load timoeout to 4 mins $browser.manage().timeouts().pageloadTimeout(default_pageload_timeout); //test all the main nav page performances $browser.get(\"http://www.sitename.com\").then(function() { return $browser.findelement($driver.by.classname(\"site-theme-example\")); }).then(function() { //verifies the nav list has loaded return $browser.findelement($driver.by.classname(\"site-nav-list-example\")); }).then(function() { //loops through the navlinks array navlinks.foreach(function(val, i, arr) { //finds and navigates to each navlink page return $browser.findelement($driver.by.classname(navlinks[i])).click().then(function() { //verifies that the nav list loaded before moving on return $browser.findelement($driver.by.classname(\"site-nav-list-example\")).then(function() { //verifies that the page logo footer at bottom of page has loaded return $browser.findelement($driver.by.classname(\"site-footer-logo\")); }); }); }); }); Copy",

      "body": "Application monitoring tips you need to know It's one thing to know how to use APM, but it's another thing to know how to use New Relic's application performance monitoring software well. Here are some best practices designed to help you become an APM pro—and a key asset to your team! Tip To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic Explorer in New Relic One. 1. Standardize application names Most New Relic agents provide a default application name, such as \"My Application\" or \"PHP Application,\" if you don't specify one in your New Relic configuration file. You don't want to end up with 20 identically named applications, be sure to select a descriptive identifier for your apps as soon you deploy them. To keep things consistent and easy to navigate, New Relic recommends standardizing your application naming (for example, all apps in Staging append [ Staging] or the like at the end of their names). Ideally, you want your new Java applications to be named automatically to reduce the chances of typographical errors and misnaming. How to do it For Java applications, automatic application naming can come from the following sources: Request attribute Servlet init parameter Filter init parameter Web app context parameter Web app context name (display name) Web app context path Choose the method that fits best your needs and follow these steps. For non-Java applications, there are no automatic naming methods, so refer to the documentation for your APM agent. 2. Add tags to your applications When several different applications use the same account, and each application spans multiple environments (for example, development, test, pre-production, production), it can be hard to find a specific application in your overview dashboard. That's why we recommend adding tags to your apps so that you can segment them into logical groups. The two most common tags that mature APM customers use are application name and environment. So, for example, if you wanted to view the billing application in Test, you could simply filter by \"billing app\" (name tag) and \"test\" (environment tag). Caution In the APM agent configuration settings files, use the labels field to add tags to your data. For example, see this description of the Python labels setting. APM is designed so that apps can roll up into an unlimited number of meaningful tag categories. How to do it Learn about tags. Learn how to add tags. Learn how to query tags. 3. Create and evaluate alert policies When key performance indicators spike or drop, individuals and teams in your organization need to be notified. Alerting in New Relic provides a set of tools including dynamic baselines that allow you to detect problems before they impact your end users. Alert policies can be set up in two primary ways: Static threshold alerts are great when you already know the nature of an application and its normal behaviors aren't likely to change anytime soon. Apdex score, response time, error rate, throughput are some of the static thresholds you can create alert policies on. Dynamic baseline alerts make it easy to determine and set dynamic alert thresholds for applications with varying seasonal patterns and growth trends (which make it difficult to set thresholds that define normal behavior). These alerts use baselines modeled from your application’s historical metric data. Each alert policy can contain as many conditions as you need, and each alert condition includes three components: Type of condition (metric, external service, and so on) Entities that the policy targets (for example, APM apps, browser monitoring apps, or hosts) Thresholds that escalate into alerting situations with increasing severity Once you have your alerting set up, you then want to make sure you're taking advantage of all viable notification channels. After all, what good are alerts if no one knows about them? You can manage alerts by creating specific user groups and by leveraging New Relic's integrated alert channels, including Slack, PagerDuty, webhooks, and email. Be sure to evaluate alert policies on a regular basis to ensure that they are always valid. How to do it See the detailed documentation: To set up dynamic baseline alerts and choose an application, follow standard procedures. You will see a preview of the metric with the predicted baseline You can select a metric for that application and see the corresponding baseline. Then, using the threshold sliders, you can set how closely you want your threshold to follow the baseline prediction. To set up static threshold alerts for your Apdex settings, follow standard procedures. To set up your alert notification channels, follow standard procedures. 4. Identify and set up key transactions Depending on the nature of your application, some transactions may be more important to you than others. New Relic's key transactions feature is designed to help you closely monitor what you consider to be your app's most business-critical transactions, whether that's end-user or app response time, call counts, error rates, or something else. You can also set alert threshold levels for notifications when your key transactions are performing poorly. How to do it In the menu bar, select More > Key transactions, and then select Add more. Then select the app and web transaction or, from the selected transaction, select Track as key transaction. Type a name for the key transaction, and select Track key transaction. Optional: If the agent for the selected app supports custom alerting, use the default values that New Relic automatically fills, or select Edit key alert transaction policy to set the Apdex and alert threshold values. To view the key transactions dashboard details, select View new key transaction. 5. Track deployment history When development teams are pushing new code out as frequently as possible, it can be hard to measure the impact that each deployment is having on performance. One way to stay in tune with how these changes are affecting your application is with deployment reports. These reports list recent deployments and their impact on end-users and app servers' Apdex scores, along with response times, throughput, and errors. You can also view and drill down into the details to catch errors related to recent deployments, or file a ticket and share details with your team. How to do it From the New Relic menu bar, select APM > (selected app) > Events > Deployments. To view performance after a deployment, go to the selected app's Overview dashboard in the Recent events section. A blue vertical bar on a chart indicates a deployment. To view summary information about the deployment, point to the blue bar. 6. Review APM reports From SLA, deployment, and capacity to scalability, host usage reports, and more, APM offers a variety of downloadable reporting tools surfacing historical trends—all great ways to report to senior executive teams or customers. Take a look at the full list of reports and use them to your advantage. How to do it From the APM menu bar, select Applications > (selected app) > Reports. Select the report you'd like to see. If you want to save or export a report to share, select Download this report as .csv, which will create a report with comma-separated values. 7. Review your environment with service maps Use New Relic service maps, a feature included in APM, to understand how apps and services in your architecture connect and talk to each other. Service maps are visual, customizable representations of your application architecture. Maps automatically show you your app's connections and dependencies, including databases and external services. Health indicators and performance metrics show you the current operational status for every part of your architecture. How to do it Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps. To get started, see Introduction to service maps. 8. Keep current With New Relic’s SaaS platform, getting new features is as easy as updating your agent. Most likely your organization already has a set of scripts for deploying application upgrades into your environment. In a similar fashion, you can also automate your New Relic agent deployment to ensure that your systems are up to date. Both Puppet and Chef scripts are great examples of deployment frameworks that make life easier by allowing you to automate your entire deployment and management process. How to do it Regularly review which version of the agent you're using so that you know when an update is needed. If the latest agent release contains a needed fix or added functionality, download it. To deploy the agent automatically (preferred as a method to avoid errors): Use existing deployment scripts, provided they can be adapted to handle the deployment. OR Create and maintain a script that specifically deploys and configures the New Relic agent. Ideally, the script would pull the agent files from a repository where the files are versioned (for rollback purposes). Once the script has been created, shut down the application (unless script handles this). Run the deployment script. Start the application (unless script handles this). If problems arise, run the script to roll back to the previous version. To deploy the agent manually: Back up the current agent directory. Deploy the updated agent into the existing agent directory. Modify configuration files by comparing new files with existing files. In particular, make sure things like license key and custom extensions are copied over to the new configuration. Restart the application. If problems arise, restore the old agent using the backup and restart. 9. Manage user access How you manage your users depends on which user model your users are on: See original user management docs See New Relic One user management docs",

      "body": "Want even longer periods of uninterrupted sleep? Here are eight best practices to make dynamic infrastructure and server monitoring even easier with New Relic's infrastructure monitoring. 1. Install the infrastructure agent across your entire environment Our infrastructure monitoring solution was designed to help enterprise customers monitor their large and dynamically changing environments at scale. In order to facilitate this, the UI is completely driven by tags that let you visualize aggregated metrics, events, and inventory for a large number of servers. To really get the most out of infrastructure monitoring, we recommend installing it across your entire environment, preferably even across multiple regions and clusters. This will provide a more accurate picture of the health of your host ecosystem and the impact your infrastructure has on your applications. Want to achieve faster Mean Time To Resolution (MTTR)? Install the infrastructure agent on database servers, web servers, and any other host that supports your applications. When deploying the agent, leverage custom attributes to tag your hosts so that you can use those for filtering the data presented in the UI and for setting alerts. This is in addition to any Amazon EC2 tags you may be using which will auto-import when you enable the EC2 integration. You may also prefer to keep the agent logs separate from the system logs, which you can do through the configuration. How to do it Leverage our install modules for config management tools such as Chef, Puppet and Ansible to easily deploy your agent across all your infrastructure. Read the instructions in the github repo for your config management tool referenced in the link above and define the custom_attributes you want to use to tag your hosts. Set the log_file attribute to your preferred location for the infrastructure agent logs. Tip If you are installing the agent on a single host, the process should only take a few minutes and you can find detailed instructions in our documentation. 2. Configure the native EC2 integration If you have an AWS environment, in addition to installing the infrastructure agent on your EC2 instances to monitor them, we also recommend configuring the EC2 integration so that New Relic can automatically import all the tags and metadata associated with your AWS instances. This allows you to filter down to a part of your infrastructure using the same AWS tags (example, ECTag_Role='Kafka'), and slice-and-dice your data in multiple ways. Additionally, our ‘Alerts’ and ‘Saved Filter Sets’ are completely tag-driven and dynamic, so they automatically add/remove instances matching these tags to give our users the most real-time views that scale with your cloud infrastructure. 3. Activate the integrations Monitoring your infrastructure extends beyond just CPU, memory, and storage utilization. That’s why New Relic has out-of-the-box integrations that allow you to monitor all the services that support your hosts as well. Activate any of our integrations, including AWS Billing, AWS ELB, Amazon S3, MySQL, NGINX, and more, to extend monitoring to your AWS or on-host applications, and access the pre-configured dashboards that appear for each of them. 4. Create filter sets With New Relic, users can create filter sets to organize hosts, cluster roles, and other resources based on criteria that matter the most to users. This allows you to optimize your resources by using a focused view to monitor, detect, and resolve any problems proactively. The attributes for filtering are populated from the auto-imported EC2 tags or custom tags that may be applied to hosts. You can combine as many filters as you want in a filter set, and save them to share with other people in your account. You’ll also be able to see the color-coded health status of each host inside the filter set, so you can quickly identify problematic areas of your infrastructure. Additionally, filter sets can be used in the health map to get an overview of your infrastructure performance at a glance based on the filters that matter to your teams. 5. Create alert conditions With New Relic, you can create alert conditions directly within the context of what you are currently monitoring with New Relic. For example, if you are viewing a filter set comprised of a large number of hosts and notice a problem, you don’t need to create an individual alert condition for every host within. Instead, we recommend initiating the alert condition directly from the chart of the metric you are viewing and creating it based on the filter tags. This will create an alert condition for any hosts that match those tags, allowing our infrastructure monitoring to automatically remove hosts that go offline and add new hosts to the alert condition if they match those tags. Alerts configured once for the appropriate tags will scale correctly across all future hosts. And know that you can also leverage existing alert policies for infrastructure alert conditions. 6. View infrastructure data alongside APM data The integration between APM and infrastructure monitoring lets you see your APM data and infrastructure data side by side, so you can find the root cause of problems more quickly, no matter where they originate. This allows users to view the performance relationship of your hosts and the applications running on them, allowing for quicker diagnosis of the issue and impact on the business’ health. Use health maps to quickly spot any issues or alerts related to the health of your applications and how that connects to the supporting infrastructure. The first boxes starting from the top left are those that require your attention. 7. Access Infrastructure data using the Data explorer Teams that use multiple New Relic capabilities find it useful to create a single dashboard to visually correlate the infrastructure’s health with application, browser and synthetics metrics. That’s where New Relic data exploration features comes in. All the granular metrics and events collected by infrastructure monitoring are stored in New Relic and are accessible to you immediately. Having access to the raw metrics means you can run more custom queries using NRQL, and also create dashboards to share infrastructure metrics with your team. 8. Update your agents regularly New Relic’s software engineering team is constantly pushing out improvements and new features to improve our customers’ overall monitoring experience. In order to take advantage of all the awesomeness they’re delivering, we recommend regularly updating to the latest version of the infrastructure agent. Want more user tips?

      "body": "New Relic's synthetic monitoring—powered by a Selenium-driven Chrome browser—allows you to monitor and test your apps and address issues before they affect your end users. Here are five tips to help you take immediate advantage of its full power. 1. Match your monitor type to monitoring need Synthetic monitors are virtual browsers that measure the performance of your website, recording each check in detail. They also capture aggregate numbers for load time, uptime, and average download size, as well as an overview, detailed statistics for each page resource, and downtime incidents. There are four types of synthetic monitors; the ones you deploy will depend on the things you want to monitor: Ping monitors—to ensure that your site is accessible. Simple browser monitors—to ensure end-user performance. Scripted browsers—to ensure that particular resources are present. API monitors—to ensure that your app server works as well as your website. How to do it To add a monitor, go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics (or one.eu.newrelic.com if you have an EU-based account) and click Create monitor. Specify monitor type, name, and URL. Optional: Add a validation string (available for ping and simple browser) or advanced options, which enable substring monitoring for the following types of response validation: Verify SSL (for ping and simple browser). This option verifies the validity of the SSL certificate chain. It can be duplicated by running the following syntax: openssl s_client -servername {YOUR_HOSTNAME} -connect {YOUR_HOSTNAME}:443 -CApath /etc/ssl/certs > /dev/null Copy Bypass HEAD request (for ping). This option skips the default HEAD request and instead uses the GET verb with a ping check. Redirect is Failure (for ping). If a redirect result occurs when Redirect is Failure is enabled, Synthetics categorizes it as a failure (rather than following the redirect and checking the resulting URL). Select the locations where you want your monitor to run. Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Optional: Set up alert notifications. Select Create my monitor to confirm. Wait a few minutes; then from the Monitors index check your monitor. 2. View all monitors with the Monitors index page Continuous application performance monitoring is essential to ensure that web services are in place, working correctly, and error-free. Synthetic monitoring provides this type of assurance by performing automated tests on your web application for each selected location—noting downtime instances (“violations”) and collecting aggregate numbers, results, and detailed statistics for each page resource. Use the Monitors index page to get a high level view of this information, or select an individual monitor to view the Summary, for ping monitors, or Overview, for simple and scripted monitors, page and get a deeper insight into its performance over time. How to view your monitors in the New Relic One: New Relic Explorer To view a list of monitors using the New Relic One Monitors index page: Go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Synthetic monitors. For more information, see the documentation about navigating core UI components in New Relic One. Monitors index page To view a list of monitors using the Monitors index page: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics. 3. View individual monitor results It’s not enough to understand how your web apps are performing for your West Coast customers; you need to be able to view how they’re performing across the country and around the globe. By taking advantage of synthetic monitors and visiting your Results page, you can see how everything from development to production affects user experience. You can locate interesting results by sorting the list to identify slow, fast, or other unusual results. Or filter by location to understand how monitor performance varies with geography. (The “Network timings” graph below provides a snapshot of webpage performance over a given period.) How to do it: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics and, from the Monitors tab, select your monitor. Select Monitor > Results. Gain an up-to-the-minute view of the slowest page loads for every monitored location. 4. Understand the load-time impact of each resource Visit the synthetics Resources page to see how each resource on your website—including CSS, JavaScript, images, HTML and more—is affecting your overall load. You can drill into detailed metrics collected at run time, locate performance information for time spent by third-party resources, and identify HTTP response codes for each resource. How to do it: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics and, from the Monitors drop-down menu, select your monitor. Select Monitor > Resources. 5. Configure and develop a scripted browser test Using scripted browsers, you can build complex monitoring workflows using the Selenium JavaScript Webdriver bindings. For instance, you can log in to the application, navigate to a particular link, and wait for a page element to load and add an assertion. How to do it: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics. Choose your monitor type (for example, scripted browser). Enter the name and details of your monitor (for example, Sitename.com scripted browser) Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run (for example, Mumbai, Seoul, Columbus, and Montreal). Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor (for example, five minutes). Set a notification method to alert your team when performance violations occur. You are now ready to write your script. (Below is an example of a script used to test the performance of a main navigation page.) var assert = require('chai').assert; // script-wide timeout for all wait and waitandfind functions (in ms) var default_element_timeout = 190000; //3 mins var default_pageload_timeout = 240000; //4 mins var navlinks = [\"css-locator-1\", \"css-locator-2\"]; //sets element load timeout to 3 mins $browser.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(default_element_timeout); //sets page load timoeout to 4 mins $browser.manage().timeouts().pageloadTimeout(default_pageload_timeout); //test all the main nav page performances $browser.get(\"http://www.sitename.com\").then(function() { return $browser.findelement($driver.by.classname(\"site-theme-example\")); }).then(function() { //verifies the nav list has loaded return $browser.findelement($driver.by.classname(\"site-nav-list-example\")); }).then(function() { //loops through the navlinks array navlinks.foreach(function(val, i, arr) { //finds and navigates to each navlink page return $browser.findelement($driver.by.classname(navlinks[i])).click().then(function() { //verifies that the nav list loaded before moving on return $browser.findelement($driver.by.classname(\"site-nav-list-example\")).then(function() { //verifies that the page logo footer at bottom of page has loaded return $browser.findelement($driver.by.classname(\"site-footer-logo\")); }); }); }); }); Copy",

      "body": "Application monitoring tips you need to know It's one thing to know how to use APM, but it's another thing to know how to use New Relic's application performance monitoring software well. Here are some best practices designed to help you become an APM pro—and a key asset to your team! Tip To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic Explorer in New Relic One. 1. Standardize application names Most New Relic agents provide a default application name, such as \"My Application\" or \"PHP Application,\" if you don't specify one in your New Relic configuration file. You don't want to end up with 20 identically named applications, be sure to select a descriptive identifier for your apps as soon you deploy them. To keep things consistent and easy to navigate, New Relic recommends standardizing your application naming (for example, all apps in Staging append [ Staging] or the like at the end of their names). Ideally, you want your new Java applications to be named automatically to reduce the chances of typographical errors and misnaming. How to do it For Java applications, automatic application naming can come from the following sources: Request attribute Servlet init parameter Filter init parameter Web app context parameter Web app context name (display name) Web app context path Choose the method that fits best your needs and follow these steps. For non-Java applications, there are no automatic naming methods, so refer to the documentation for your APM agent. 2. Add tags to your applications When several different applications use the same account, and each application spans multiple environments (for example, development, test, pre-production, production), it can be hard to find a specific application in your overview dashboard. That's why we recommend adding tags to your apps so that you can segment them into logical groups. The two most common tags that mature APM customers use are application name and environment. So, for example, if you wanted to view the billing application in Test, you could simply filter by \"billing app\" (name tag) and \"test\" (environment tag). Caution In the APM agent configuration settings files, use the labels field to add tags to your data. For example, see this description of the Python labels setting. APM is designed so that apps can roll up into an unlimited number of meaningful tag categories. How to do it Learn about tags. Learn how to add tags. Learn how to query tags. 3. Create and evaluate alert policies When key performance indicators spike or drop, individuals and teams in your organization need to be notified. Alerting in New Relic provides a set of tools including dynamic baselines that allow you to detect problems before they impact your end users. Alert policies can be set up in two primary ways: Static threshold alerts are great when you already know the nature of an application and its normal behaviors aren't likely to change anytime soon. Apdex score, response time, error rate, throughput are some of the static thresholds you can create alert policies on. Dynamic baseline alerts make it easy to determine and set dynamic alert thresholds for applications with varying seasonal patterns and growth trends (which make it difficult to set thresholds that define normal behavior). These alerts use baselines modeled from your application’s historical metric data. Each alert policy can contain as many conditions as you need, and each alert condition includes three components: Type of condition (metric, external service, and so on) Entities that the policy targets (for example, APM apps, browser monitoring apps, or hosts) Thresholds that escalate into alerting situations with increasing severity Once you have your alerting set up, you then want to make sure you're taking advantage of all viable notification channels. After all, what good are alerts if no one knows about them? You can manage alerts by creating specific user groups and by leveraging New Relic's integrated alert channels, including Slack, PagerDuty, webhooks, and email. Be sure to evaluate alert policies on a regular basis to ensure that they are always valid. How to do it See the detailed documentation: To set up dynamic baseline alerts and choose an application, follow standard procedures. You will see a preview of the metric with the predicted baseline You can select a metric for that application and see the corresponding baseline. Then, using the threshold sliders, you can set how closely you want your threshold to follow the baseline prediction. To set up static threshold alerts for your Apdex settings, follow standard procedures. To set up your alert notification channels, follow standard procedures. 4. Identify and set up key transactions Depending on the nature of your application, some transactions may be more important to you than others. New Relic's key transactions feature is designed to help you closely monitor what you consider to be your app's most business-critical transactions, whether that's end-user or app response time, call counts, error rates, or something else. You can also set alert threshold levels for notifications when your key transactions are performing poorly. How to do it In the menu bar, select More > Key transactions, and then select Add more. Then select the app and web transaction or, from the selected transaction, select Track as key transaction. Type a name for the key transaction, and select Track key transaction. Optional: If the agent for the selected app supports custom alerting, use the default values that New Relic automatically fills, or select Edit key alert transaction policy to set the Apdex and alert threshold values. To view the key transactions dashboard details, select View new key transaction. 5. Track deployment history When development teams are pushing new code out as frequently as possible, it can be hard to measure the impact that each deployment is having on performance. One way to stay in tune with how these changes are affecting your application is with deployment reports. These reports list recent deployments and their impact on end-users and app servers' Apdex scores, along with response times, throughput, and errors. You can also view and drill down into the details to catch errors related to recent deployments, or file a ticket and share details with your team. How to do it From the New Relic menu bar, select APM > (selected app) > Events > Deployments. To view performance after a deployment, go to the selected app's Overview dashboard in the Recent events section. A blue vertical bar on a chart indicates a deployment. To view summary information about the deployment, point to the blue bar. 6. Review APM reports From SLA, deployment, and capacity to scalability, host usage reports, and more, APM offers a variety of downloadable reporting tools surfacing historical trends—all great ways to report to senior executive teams or customers. Take a look at the full list of reports and use them to your advantage. How to do it From the APM menu bar, select Applications > (selected app) > Reports. Select the report you'd like to see. If you want to save or export a report to share, select Download this report as .csv, which will create a report with comma-separated values. 7. Review your environment with service maps Use New Relic service maps, a feature included in APM, to understand how apps and services in your architecture connect and talk to each other. Service maps are visual, customizable representations of your application architecture. Maps automatically show you your app's connections and dependencies, including databases and external services. Health indicators and performance metrics show you the current operational status for every part of your architecture. How to do it Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps. To get started, see Introduction to service maps. 8. Keep current With New Relic’s SaaS platform, getting new features is as easy as updating your agent. Most likely your organization already has a set of scripts for deploying application upgrades into your environment. In a similar fashion, you can also automate your New Relic agent deployment to ensure that your systems are up to date. Both Puppet and Chef scripts are great examples of deployment frameworks that make life easier by allowing you to automate your entire deployment and management process. How to do it Regularly review which version of the agent you're using so that you know when an update is needed. If the latest agent release contains a needed fix or added functionality, download it. To deploy the agent automatically (preferred as a method to avoid errors): Use existing deployment scripts, provided they can be adapted to handle the deployment. OR Create and maintain a script that specifically deploys and configures the New Relic agent. Ideally, the script would pull the agent files from a repository where the files are versioned (for rollback purposes). Once the script has been created, shut down the application (unless script handles this). Run the deployment script. Start the application (unless script handles this). If problems arise, run the script to roll back to the previous version. To deploy the agent manually: Back up the current agent directory. Deploy the updated agent into the existing agent directory. Modify configuration files by comparing new files with existing files. In particular, make sure things like license key and custom extensions are copied over to the new configuration. Restart the application. If problems arise, restore the old agent using the backup and restart. 9. Manage user access How you manage your users depends on which user model your users are on: See original user management docs See New Relic One user management docs",

      "body": "By eliminating crashes and increasing speed across the stack, you can build better performance into every mobile app release. Here are some best practices to take full advantage of mobile monitoring with New Relic. 1. Start collecting data Start collecting data in production. You'll see immediate value by adding our mobile monitoring SDK to your app for its next release to the app store. We recommend installing the iOS or Android agent to your production release even if you're simply testing New Relic's capabilities. This will ensure you'll get an adequate amount of data to really understand all of our mobile monitoring capabilities and your end users' experience. How to do it Add your mobile app to New Relic First, add a new app in New Relic's user interface (full steps): Go to one.newrelic.com and click Mobile. From the list of monitored apps, select Add more. Select the relevant platform. Type a name for your mobile app, and select Continue. Use one app and the associated app token for the development releases of your iOS app, another app and its associated app token for the production releases of that iOS app, and another pair of app tokens for development and production releases of your Android app. You'll be able to compare data from across the four app tokens using our query builder. Install and configure our mobile SDK Next, install and configure the mobile agent: Download the latest version of New Relic's SDK for iOS or Android, and add it to your mobile app. (Full steps for iOS and Android) Configure your installation as needed. For example: Enable the feature flag to capture MobileRequest events to use our full network analysis capabilities for iOS or Android. Automate dSYM uploads for your production builds. To avoid surprises, follow the standard pattern of where you start our mobile agent. In addition, start our agent before you initiate any other SDKs. For more information, see our documentation for Android installation and configuration and for iOS installation and configuration. Deploy a new release of your application. 2. Explore your data Immediately be able to explore your data. As soon as New Relic starts reporting data, take the time to explore the wealth of information about your mobile apps. To get started, go to one.newrelic.com and select Mobile. How to do it Analyze, resolve, and prevent crashes Find the cause of crashes so you can fix them. Then, uncover trends behind crashes so you can prevent them: From the summary UI page for a monitored mobile app, click Crash analysis. Analyze crash data so you can see and fix the most impactful crashes. Follow the breadcrumbs in the crash event trail to fix crashes and resolve critical errors more easily: From your mobile app's Crash analysis page in the UI, select a Crash type. From the crash type's Summary page, select the Crash trail tab. Monitor your key workflows Create custom breadcrumbs to monitor key workflows (such as your app's login or checkout process), track user clicks, optimize timing, and identify crash locations for faster MTTR. Get actionable session data Borrow from our example queries to: See how much of your user base has upgraded to your latest app version. Track adoption over time. Get a count of new installs as compared to upgrades from an earlier version. See the distribution of usage across geographical locations, carriers, ASN owners (wi-fi providers), devices, connection types, and more. 3. Take preventive steps Use alert notifications to help uncover the causes behind crashes and errors. Once you are running our mobile monitoring capabilities in production and have explored some of the key features, you can use New Relic to uncover critical issues with your mobile application. In particular, focus on crashes and errors. Use metric-based alerts as a starting point to gain high-level visibility into problems. Then, as new services or functionalities are added, use New Relic’s more targeted, event-based (NRQL) alerts to make sure that the most critical issues are handled swiftly. Use these alerts to determine whether a crash is impacting a large number of users. If it is, the relevant people (for example, both the mobile app team’s on-call member and the owner of the related back-end service) will be alerted. Make sure that your team knows how to respond to changes in crash rate (crashes per sessions) and the percentage of users impacted by crashes of your mobile app. How to do it Metric-based alerts Use our metric-based alerts and mobile monitoring UI: Ensure that key members of your mobile team have opted in to receive emails for new crashes. These emails will take you to the crash type in the UI page for your mobile app. Create an alert for your crash rate threshold that key members of your team can view in Slack or any other Alerts notification channel you choose. Your alert notification will include a link to our UI, where you can examine a chart with the exceeded threshold. From there, a link will take you to the relevant mobile monitoring page, where you can get additional details. Event-based alerts Combine the metric-based workflow with event-based alerts and dashboards specific to your mobile app and system. Create your NRQL alert that focuses on crashes of your most recently released production version. Create an additional NRQL alert that focuses on the percentage of users impacted by crashes in your latest app version (to check the overall impact on your user base). 4. Dig deeper into crashes Take your crash reporting to the next level. Now it’s time to tackle some of those harder-to-reproduce crashes by: Applying additional instrumentation to your application. Leveraging crash event trails, NRQL queries, and dashboards to visualize your data. How to do it Crash analysis Crashes are an inevitable part of running mobile applications at scale. We provide tools to help you understand your highest-impact crashes. Use the Crash analysis UI to see which crashes are occurring most often, the percentage of crash-free users, which files and methods are associated with perhaps 80 percent of your crashes, which crashes a particular user just experienced, and more. Go after high-impact crashes with crash analysis: Add custom attributes to categorize the highest-value customers, and then use them to segment crashes according to your most valuable audiences. Add breadcrumbs and custom events to produce a detailed trail of events leading up to every crash occurrence (over the last 90 days). Then, view this crash event trail in our mobile monitoring UI. Use our mobile monitoring's Versions trends page to make sure you’re improving the crash rate over subsequent releases and avoiding regressions. Breadcrumbs Use breadcrumbs and custom attributes to better reproduce and debug crashes. For example, use our recordBreadrumb API for Android or iOS to track mid-session changes in state that can help debug crashes, such as: Change of connection type Change of orientation CPU and memory state at key points in the app code Custom attributes Add custom attributes to existing events, so you can ask even more precise questions of your mobile app. Add dimensions such as: User ID: Use to react to specific user concerns and to better understand which customers and segments are most impacted. Store ID: Use to address problems with out-of-date devices, bad wi-fi, and so on. User segments: Use to better understand which customers and segments are most impacted; for example, logged in vs. non-logged in. Money in the cart at session end Origin or attribution of entry into the app Standardize custom attribute names across your mobile apps, and align with your website (if you're using our browser monitoring), so that you can compare and contrast performance across end-user channels. The mobile agents track the last interaction of crashed and non-crashed sessions to provide visibility into what the user viewed before exiting your app (either intentionally or due to a crash). 5. Focus on KPIs Bring your key performance indicators to life. Create custom interactions and events to hone in on the most important signals, including user activity for the business-critical aspects of your app. Using these powerful APIs, you can add custom instrumentation to just about anything. The following are some example use cases. How to do it Track and query feature use Use custom events to track feature use. For example: Use custom events to track user flow between app and website. Use custom events or mobile breadcrumbs to optimize the performance of key user flows (log in, shopping cart, etc.). use custom events to provide faster, contextualized support experiences for your digital customers. Use the recordCustomEvent API. Then compare the use of different features using: SELECT count(*) FROM MyNewMobileEventType FACET name Copy Measure page load times Use custom events to measure page load time: Create an app-launch timer to measure the time that elapses between a user-tap to launch your app and the point in your app code where the first screen is available. Record the timer value in New Relic using something like the following: recordCustomEvent(<myMobileTimers>, <appLaunch>, {attributes}) Copy Define start and stop timers to measure spinner durations, and then record this time in New Relic using something like the following: recordCustomEvent(<myMobileTimers>, <spinnerOnScreenA>, {attributes}) Copy Track specific user actions or funnel steps in the app (like \"add to cart\"), and include the price as an attribute on that event. Measure flows through the application by viewing the related funnel steps with custom events in Insights. For example, create a timer to track the start and end times of a subflow or an entire flow across multiple funnel steps to understand how long it took users to get through the process. Examine data about webpage interactions Use custom interactions to see traces associated with the same webpages. Use the agent API to disable default interactions, and focus on custom interactions so that you can review the page loads that are most crucial to your primary funnel. Define the start and stop times of these custom interactions to trace activities associated with individual steps of that funnel (for example, a specific user action or a page load). Track the last interactions of crashed and non-crashed sessions so that you can see what the user viewed before exiting your app (either intentionally or from a crash). Example query for non-crashed sessions: SELECT count(*) FROM Mobile WHERE sessionCrashed is null FACET lastInteraction SINCE 90 days ago Copy Example query for crashed sessions: SELECT count(*) FROM Mobile WHERE sessionCrashed is true FACET lastInteraction SINCE 90 days ago Copy",

      "body": "New Relic's synthetic monitoring—powered by a Selenium-driven Chrome browser—allows you to monitor and test your apps and address issues before they affect your end users. Here are five tips to help you take immediate advantage of its full power. 1. Match your monitor type to monitoring need Synthetic monitors are virtual browsers that measure the performance of your website, recording each check in detail. They also capture aggregate numbers for load time, uptime, and average download size, as well as an overview, detailed statistics for each page resource, and downtime incidents. There are four types of synthetic monitors; the ones you deploy will depend on the things you want to monitor: Ping monitors—to ensure that your site is accessible. Simple browser monitors—to ensure end-user performance. Scripted browsers—to ensure that particular resources are present. API monitors—to ensure that your app server works as well as your website. How to do it To add a monitor, go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics (or one.eu.newrelic.com if you have an EU-based account) and click Create monitor. Specify monitor type, name, and URL. Optional: Add a validation string (available for ping and simple browser) or advanced options, which enable substring monitoring for the following types of response validation: Verify SSL (for ping and simple browser). This option verifies the validity of the SSL certificate chain. It can be duplicated by running the following syntax: openssl s_client -servername {YOUR_HOSTNAME} -connect {YOUR_HOSTNAME}:443 -CApath /etc/ssl/certs > /dev/null Copy Bypass HEAD request (for ping). This option skips the default HEAD request and instead uses the GET verb with a ping check. Redirect is Failure (for ping). If a redirect result occurs when Redirect is Failure is enabled, Synthetics categorizes it as a failure (rather than following the redirect and checking the resulting URL). Select the locations where you want your monitor to run. Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Optional: Set up alert notifications. Select Create my monitor to confirm. Wait a few minutes; then from the Monitors index check your monitor. 2. View all monitors with the Monitors index page Continuous application performance monitoring is essential to ensure that web services are in place, working correctly, and error-free. Synthetic monitoring provides this type of assurance by performing automated tests on your web application for each selected location—noting downtime instances (“violations”) and collecting aggregate numbers, results, and detailed statistics for each page resource. Use the Monitors index page to get a high level view of this information, or select an individual monitor to view the Summary, for ping monitors, or Overview, for simple and scripted monitors, page and get a deeper insight into its performance over time. How to view your monitors in the New Relic One: New Relic Explorer To view a list of monitors using the New Relic One Monitors index page: Go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Synthetic monitors. For more information, see the documentation about navigating core UI components in New Relic One. Monitors index page To view a list of monitors using the Monitors index page: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics. 3. View individual monitor results It’s not enough to understand how your web apps are performing for your West Coast customers; you need to be able to view how they’re performing across the country and around the globe. By taking advantage of synthetic monitors and visiting your Results page, you can see how everything from development to production affects user experience. You can locate interesting results by sorting the list to identify slow, fast, or other unusual results. Or filter by location to understand how monitor performance varies with geography. (The “Network timings” graph below provides a snapshot of webpage performance over a given period.) How to do it: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics and, from the Monitors tab, select your monitor. Select Monitor > Results. Gain an up-to-the-minute view of the slowest page loads for every monitored location. 4. Understand the load-time impact of each resource Visit the synthetics Resources page to see how each resource on your website—including CSS, JavaScript, images, HTML and more—is affecting your overall load. You can drill into detailed metrics collected at run time, locate performance information for time spent by third-party resources, and identify HTTP response codes for each resource. How to do it: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics and, from the Monitors drop-down menu, select your monitor. Select Monitor > Resources. 5. Configure and develop a scripted browser test Using scripted browsers, you can build complex monitoring workflows using the Selenium JavaScript Webdriver bindings. For instance, you can log in to the application, navigate to a particular link, and wait for a page element to load and add an assertion. How to do it: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics. Choose your monitor type (for example, scripted browser). Enter the name and details of your monitor (for example, Sitename.com scripted browser) Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run (for example, Mumbai, Seoul, Columbus, and Montreal). Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor (for example, five minutes). Set a notification method to alert your team when performance violations occur. You are now ready to write your script. (Below is an example of a script used to test the performance of a main navigation page.) var assert = require('chai').assert; // script-wide timeout for all wait and waitandfind functions (in ms) var default_element_timeout = 190000; //3 mins var default_pageload_timeout = 240000; //4 mins var navlinks = [\"css-locator-1\", \"css-locator-2\"]; //sets element load timeout to 3 mins $browser.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(default_element_timeout); //sets page load timoeout to 4 mins $browser.manage().timeouts().pageloadTimeout(default_pageload_timeout); //test all the main nav page performances $browser.get(\"http://www.sitename.com\").then(function() { return $browser.findelement($driver.by.classname(\"site-theme-example\")); }).then(function() { //verifies the nav list has loaded return $browser.findelement($driver.by.classname(\"site-nav-list-example\")); }).then(function() { //loops through the navlinks array navlinks.foreach(function(val, i, arr) { //finds and navigates to each navlink page return $browser.findelement($driver.by.classname(navlinks[i])).click().then(function() { //verifies that the nav list loaded before moving on return $browser.findelement($driver.by.classname(\"site-nav-list-example\")).then(function() { //verifies that the page logo footer at bottom of page has loaded return $browser.findelement($driver.by.classname(\"site-footer-logo\")); }); }); }); }); Copy",

      "body": "Application monitoring tips you need to know It's one thing to know how to use APM, but it's another thing to know how to use New Relic's application performance monitoring software well. Here are some best practices designed to help you become an APM pro—and a key asset to your team! Tip To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic Explorer in New Relic One. 1. Standardize application names Most New Relic agents provide a default application name, such as \"My Application\" or \"PHP Application,\" if you don't specify one in your New Relic configuration file. You don't want to end up with 20 identically named applications, be sure to select a descriptive identifier for your apps as soon you deploy them. To keep things consistent and easy to navigate, New Relic recommends standardizing your application naming (for example, all apps in Staging append [ Staging] or the like at the end of their names). Ideally, you want your new Java applications to be named automatically to reduce the chances of typographical errors and misnaming. How to do it For Java applications, automatic application naming can come from the following sources: Request attribute Servlet init parameter Filter init parameter Web app context parameter Web app context name (display name) Web app context path Choose the method that fits best your needs and follow these steps. For non-Java applications, there are no automatic naming methods, so refer to the documentation for your APM agent. 2. Add tags to your applications When several different applications use the same account, and each application spans multiple environments (for example, development, test, pre-production, production), it can be hard to find a specific application in your overview dashboard. That's why we recommend adding tags to your apps so that you can segment them into logical groups. The two most common tags that mature APM customers use are application name and environment. So, for example, if you wanted to view the billing application in Test, you could simply filter by \"billing app\" (name tag) and \"test\" (environment tag). Caution In the APM agent configuration settings files, use the labels field to add tags to your data. For example, see this description of the Python labels setting. APM is designed so that apps can roll up into an unlimited number of meaningful tag categories. How to do it Learn about tags. Learn how to add tags. Learn how to query tags. 3. Create and evaluate alert policies When key performance indicators spike or drop, individuals and teams in your organization need to be notified. Alerting in New Relic provides a set of tools including dynamic baselines that allow you to detect problems before they impact your end users. Alert policies can be set up in two primary ways: Static threshold alerts are great when you already know the nature of an application and its normal behaviors aren't likely to change anytime soon. Apdex score, response time, error rate, throughput are some of the static thresholds you can create alert policies on. Dynamic baseline alerts make it easy to determine and set dynamic alert thresholds for applications with varying seasonal patterns and growth trends (which make it difficult to set thresholds that define normal behavior). These alerts use baselines modeled from your application’s historical metric data. Each alert policy can contain as many conditions as you need, and each alert condition includes three components: Type of condition (metric, external service, and so on) Entities that the policy targets (for example, APM apps, browser monitoring apps, or hosts) Thresholds that escalate into alerting situations with increasing severity Once you have your alerting set up, you then want to make sure you're taking advantage of all viable notification channels. After all, what good are alerts if no one knows about them? You can manage alerts by creating specific user groups and by leveraging New Relic's integrated alert channels, including Slack, PagerDuty, webhooks, and email. Be sure to evaluate alert policies on a regular basis to ensure that they are always valid. How to do it See the detailed documentation: To set up dynamic baseline alerts and choose an application, follow standard procedures. You will see a preview of the metric with the predicted baseline You can select a metric for that application and see the corresponding baseline. Then, using the threshold sliders, you can set how closely you want your threshold to follow the baseline prediction. To set up static threshold alerts for your Apdex settings, follow standard procedures. To set up your alert notification channels, follow standard procedures. 4. Identify and set up key transactions Depending on the nature of your application, some transactions may be more important to you than others. New Relic's key transactions feature is designed to help you closely monitor what you consider to be your app's most business-critical transactions, whether that's end-user or app response time, call counts, error rates, or something else. You can also set alert threshold levels for notifications when your key transactions are performing poorly. How to do it In the menu bar, select More > Key transactions, and then select Add more. Then select the app and web transaction or, from the selected transaction, select Track as key transaction. Type a name for the key transaction, and select Track key transaction. Optional: If the agent for the selected app supports custom alerting, use the default values that New Relic automatically fills, or select Edit key alert transaction policy to set the Apdex and alert threshold values. To view the key transactions dashboard details, select View new key transaction. 5. Track deployment history When development teams are pushing new code out as frequently as possible, it can be hard to measure the impact that each deployment is having on performance. One way to stay in tune with how these changes are affecting your application is with deployment reports. These reports list recent deployments and their impact on end-users and app servers' Apdex scores, along with response times, throughput, and errors. You can also view and drill down into the details to catch errors related to recent deployments, or file a ticket and share details with your team. How to do it From the New Relic menu bar, select APM > (selected app) > Events > Deployments. To view performance after a deployment, go to the selected app's Overview dashboard in the Recent events section. A blue vertical bar on a chart indicates a deployment. To view summary information about the deployment, point to the blue bar. 6. Review APM reports From SLA, deployment, and capacity to scalability, host usage reports, and more, APM offers a variety of downloadable reporting tools surfacing historical trends—all great ways to report to senior executive teams or customers. Take a look at the full list of reports and use them to your advantage. How to do it From the APM menu bar, select Applications > (selected app) > Reports. Select the report you'd like to see. If you want to save or export a report to share, select Download this report as .csv, which will create a report with comma-separated values. 7. Review your environment with service maps Use New Relic service maps, a feature included in APM, to understand how apps and services in your architecture connect and talk to each other. Service maps are visual, customizable representations of your application architecture. Maps automatically show you your app's connections and dependencies, including databases and external services. Health indicators and performance metrics show you the current operational status for every part of your architecture. How to do it Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps. To get started, see Introduction to service maps. 8. Keep current With New Relic’s SaaS platform, getting new features is as easy as updating your agent. Most likely your organization already has a set of scripts for deploying application upgrades into your environment. In a similar fashion, you can also automate your New Relic agent deployment to ensure that your systems are up to date. Both Puppet and Chef scripts are great examples of deployment frameworks that make life easier by allowing you to automate your entire deployment and management process. How to do it Regularly review which version of the agent you're using so that you know when an update is needed. If the latest agent release contains a needed fix or added functionality, download it. To deploy the agent automatically (preferred as a method to avoid errors): Use existing deployment scripts, provided they can be adapted to handle the deployment. OR Create and maintain a script that specifically deploys and configures the New Relic agent. Ideally, the script would pull the agent files from a repository where the files are versioned (for rollback purposes). Once the script has been created, shut down the application (unless script handles this). Run the deployment script. Start the application (unless script handles this). If problems arise, run the script to roll back to the previous version. To deploy the agent manually: Back up the current agent directory. Deploy the updated agent into the existing agent directory. Modify configuration files by comparing new files with existing files. In particular, make sure things like license key and custom extensions are copied over to the new configuration. Restart the application. If problems arise, restore the old agent using the backup and restart. 9.

      "body": "Want even longer periods of uninterrupted sleep? Here are eight best practices to make dynamic infrastructure and server monitoring even easier with New Relic's infrastructure monitoring. 1. Install the infrastructure agent across your entire environment Our infrastructure monitoring solution was designed to help enterprise customers monitor their large and dynamically changing environments at scale. In order to facilitate this, the UI is completely driven by tags that let you visualize aggregated metrics, events, and inventory for a large number of servers. To really get the most out of infrastructure monitoring, we recommend installing it across your entire environment, preferably even across multiple regions and clusters. This will provide a more accurate picture of the health of your host ecosystem and the impact your infrastructure has on your applications. Want to achieve faster Mean Time To Resolution (MTTR)? Install the infrastructure agent on database servers, web servers, and any other host that supports your applications. When deploying the agent, leverage custom attributes to tag your hosts so that you can use those for filtering the data presented in the UI and for setting alerts. This is in addition to any Amazon EC2 tags you may be using which will auto-import when you enable the EC2 integration. You may also prefer to keep the agent logs separate from the system logs, which you can do through the configuration. How to do it Leverage our install modules for config management tools such as Chef, Puppet and Ansible to easily deploy your agent across all your infrastructure. Read the instructions in the github repo for your config management tool referenced in the link above and define the custom_attributes you want to use to tag your hosts. Set the log_file attribute to your preferred location for the infrastructure agent logs. Tip If you are installing the agent on a single host, the process should only take a few minutes and you can find detailed instructions in our documentation. 2. Configure the native EC2 integration If you have an AWS environment, in addition to installing the infrastructure agent on your EC2 instances to monitor them, we also recommend configuring the EC2 integration so that New Relic can automatically import all the tags and metadata associated with your AWS instances. This allows you to filter down to a part of your infrastructure using the same AWS tags (example, ECTag_Role='Kafka'), and slice-and-dice your data in multiple ways. Additionally, our ‘Alerts’ and ‘Saved Filter Sets’ are completely tag-driven and dynamic, so they automatically add/remove instances matching these tags to give our users the most real-time views that scale with your cloud infrastructure. 3. Activate the integrations Monitoring your infrastructure extends beyond just CPU, memory, and storage utilization. That’s why New Relic has out-of-the-box integrations that allow you to monitor all the services that support your hosts as well. Activate any of our integrations, including AWS Billing, AWS ELB, Amazon S3, MySQL, NGINX, and more, to extend monitoring to your AWS or on-host applications, and access the pre-configured dashboards that appear for each of them. 4. Create filter sets With New Relic, users can create filter sets to organize hosts, cluster roles, and other resources based on criteria that matter the most to users. This allows you to optimize your resources by using a focused view to monitor, detect, and resolve any problems proactively. The attributes for filtering are populated from the auto-imported EC2 tags or custom tags that may be applied to hosts. You can combine as many filters as you want in a filter set, and save them to share with other people in your account. You’ll also be able to see the color-coded health status of each host inside the filter set, so you can quickly identify problematic areas of your infrastructure. Additionally, filter sets can be used in the health map to get an overview of your infrastructure performance at a glance based on the filters that matter to your teams. 5. Create alert conditions With New Relic, you can create alert conditions directly within the context of what you are currently monitoring with New Relic. For example, if you are viewing a filter set comprised of a large number of hosts and notice a problem, you don’t need to create an individual alert condition for every host within. Instead, we recommend initiating the alert condition directly from the chart of the metric you are viewing and creating it based on the filter tags. This will create an alert condition for any hosts that match those tags, allowing our infrastructure monitoring to automatically remove hosts that go offline and add new hosts to the alert condition if they match those tags. Alerts configured once for the appropriate tags will scale correctly across all future hosts. And know that you can also leverage existing alert policies for infrastructure alert conditions. 6. View infrastructure data alongside APM data The integration between APM and infrastructure monitoring lets you see your APM data and infrastructure data side by side, so you can find the root cause of problems more quickly, no matter where they originate. This allows users to view the performance relationship of your hosts and the applications running on them, allowing for quicker diagnosis of the issue and impact on the business’ health. Use health maps to quickly spot any issues or alerts related to the health of your applications and how that connects to the supporting infrastructure. The first boxes starting from the top left are those that require your attention. 7. Access Infrastructure data using the Data explorer Teams that use multiple New Relic capabilities find it useful to create a single dashboard to visually correlate the infrastructure’s health with application, browser and synthetics metrics. That’s where New Relic data exploration features comes in. All the granular metrics and events collected by infrastructure monitoring are stored in New Relic and are accessible to you immediately. Having access to the raw metrics means you can run more custom queries using NRQL, and also create dashboards to share infrastructure metrics with your team. 8. Update your agents regularly New Relic’s software engineering team is constantly pushing out improvements and new features to improve our customers’ overall monitoring experience. In order to take advantage of all the awesomeness they’re delivering, we recommend regularly updating to the latest version of the infrastructure agent. Want more user tips?

      "body": "Application monitoring tips you need to know It's one thing to know how to use APM, but it's another thing to know how to use New Relic's application performance monitoring software well. Here are some best practices designed to help you become an APM pro—and a key asset to your team! Tip To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic Explorer in New Relic One. 1. Standardize application names Most New Relic agents provide a default application name, such as \"My Application\" or \"PHP Application,\" if you don't specify one in your New Relic configuration file. You don't want to end up with 20 identically named applications, be sure to select a descriptive identifier for your apps as soon you deploy them. To keep things consistent and easy to navigate, New Relic recommends standardizing your application naming (for example, all apps in Staging append [ Staging] or the like at the end of their names). Ideally, you want your new Java applications to be named automatically to reduce the chances of typographical errors and misnaming. How to do it For Java applications, automatic application naming can come from the following sources: Request attribute Servlet init parameter Filter init parameter Web app context parameter Web app context name (display name) Web app context path Choose the method that fits best your needs and follow these steps. For non-Java applications, there are no automatic naming methods, so refer to the documentation for your APM agent. 2. Add tags to your applications When several different applications use the same account, and each application spans multiple environments (for example, development, test, pre-production, production), it can be hard to find a specific application in your overview dashboard. That's why we recommend adding tags to your apps so that you can segment them into logical groups. The two most common tags that mature APM customers use are application name and environment. So, for example, if you wanted to view the billing application in Test, you could simply filter by \"billing app\" (name tag) and \"test\" (environment tag). Caution In the APM agent configuration settings files, use the labels field to add tags to your data. For example, see this description of the Python labels setting. APM is designed so that apps can roll up into an unlimited number of meaningful tag categories. How to do it Learn about tags. Learn how to add tags. Learn how to query tags. 3. Create and evaluate alert policies When key performance indicators spike or drop, individuals and teams in your organization need to be notified. Alerting in New Relic provides a set of tools including dynamic baselines that allow you to detect problems before they impact your end users. Alert policies can be set up in two primary ways: Static threshold alerts are great when you already know the nature of an application and its normal behaviors aren't likely to change anytime soon.

Create filter sets With New Relic, users can create filter sets to organize hosts, cluster roles, and other resources based on criteria that matter the most to users. This allows you to optimize your resources by using a focused view to monitor, detect, and resolve any problems proactively. The attributes for filtering are populated from the auto-imported EC2 tags or custom tags that may be applied to hosts. You can combine as many filters as you want in a filter set, and save them to share with other people in your account. You’ll also be able to see the color-coded health status of each host inside the filter set, so you can quickly identify problematic areas of your infrastructure. Additionally, filter sets can be used in the health map to get an overview of your infrastructure performance at a glance based on the filters that matter to your teams. 5. Create alert conditions With New Relic, you can create alert conditions directly within the context of what you are currently monitoring with New Relic. For example, if you are viewing a filter set comprised of a large number of hosts and notice a problem, you don’t need to create an individual alert condition for every host within. Instead, we recommend initiating the alert condition directly from the chart of the metric you are viewing and creating it based on the filter tags. This will create an alert condition for any hosts that match those tags, allowing our infrastructure monitoring to automatically remove hosts that go offline and add new hosts to the alert condition if they match those tags. Alerts configured once for the appropriate tags will scale correctly across all future hosts. And know that you can also leverage existing alert policies for infrastructure alert conditions. 6. View infrastructure data alongside APM data The integration between APM and infrastructure monitoring lets you see your APM data and infrastructure data side by side, so you can find the root cause of problems more quickly, no matter where they originate. This allows users to view the performance relationship of your hosts and the applications running on them, allowing for quicker diagnosis of the issue and impact on the business’ health. Use health maps to quickly spot any issues or alerts related to the health of your applications and how that connects to the supporting infrastructure. The first boxes starting from the top left are those that require your attention. 7. Access Infrastructure data using the Data explorer Teams that use multiple New Relic capabilities find it useful to create a single dashboard to visually correlate the infrastructure’s health with application, browser and synthetics metrics. That’s where New Relic data exploration features comes in. All the granular metrics and events collected by infrastructure monitoring are stored in New Relic and are accessible to you immediately. Having access to the raw metrics means you can run more custom queries using NRQL, and also create dashboards to share infrastructure metrics with your team. 8. Update your agents regularly New Relic’s software engineering team is constantly pushing out improvements and new features to improve our customers’ overall monitoring experience. In order to take advantage of all the awesomeness they’re delivering, we recommend regularly updating to the latest version of the infrastructure agent. Want more user tips?

      "body": "By eliminating crashes and increasing speed across the stack, you can build better performance into every mobile app release. Here are some best practices to take full advantage of mobile monitoring with New Relic. 1. Start collecting data Start collecting data in production. You'll see immediate value by adding our mobile monitoring SDK to your app for its next release to the app store. We recommend installing the iOS or Android agent to your production release even if you're simply testing New Relic's capabilities. This will ensure you'll get an adequate amount of data to really understand all of our mobile monitoring capabilities and your end users' experience. How to do it Add your mobile app to New Relic First, add a new app in New Relic's user interface (full steps): Go to one.newrelic.com and click Mobile. From the list of monitored apps, select Add more. Select the relevant platform. Type a name for your mobile app, and select Continue. Use one app and the associated app token for the development releases of your iOS app, another app and its associated app token for the production releases of that iOS app, and another pair of app tokens for development and production releases of your Android app. You'll be able to compare data from across the four app tokens using our query builder. Install and configure our mobile SDK Next, install and configure the mobile agent: Download the latest version of New Relic's SDK for iOS or Android, and add it to your mobile app. (Full steps for iOS and Android) Configure your installation as needed. For example: Enable the feature flag to capture MobileRequest events to use our full network analysis capabilities for iOS or Android. Automate dSYM uploads for your production builds. To avoid surprises, follow the standard pattern of where you start our mobile agent. In addition, start our agent before you initiate any other SDKs. For more information, see our documentation for Android installation and configuration and for iOS installation and configuration. Deploy a new release of your application. 2. Explore your data Immediately be able to explore your data. As soon as New Relic starts reporting data, take the time to explore the wealth of information about your mobile apps. To get started, go to one.newrelic.com and select Mobile. How to do it Analyze, resolve, and prevent crashes Find the cause of crashes so you can fix them. Then, uncover trends behind crashes so you can prevent them: From the summary UI page for a monitored mobile app, click Crash analysis. Analyze crash data so you can see and fix the most impactful crashes. Follow the breadcrumbs in the crash event trail to fix crashes and resolve critical errors more easily: From your mobile app's Crash analysis page in the UI, select a Crash type. From the crash type's Summary page, select the Crash trail tab. Monitor your key workflows Create custom breadcrumbs to monitor key workflows (such as your app's login or checkout process), track user clicks, optimize timing, and identify crash locations for faster MTTR. Get actionable session data Borrow from our example queries to: See how much of your user base has upgraded to your latest app version. Track adoption over time. Get a count of new installs as compared to upgrades from an earlier version. See the distribution of usage across geographical locations, carriers, ASN owners (wi-fi providers), devices, connection types, and more. 3. Take preventive steps Use alert notifications to help uncover the causes behind crashes and errors. Once you are running our mobile monitoring capabilities in production and have explored some of the key features, you can use New Relic to uncover critical issues with your mobile application. In particular, focus on crashes and errors. Use metric-based alerts as a starting point to gain high-level visibility into problems. Then, as new services or functionalities are added, use New Relic’s more targeted, event-based (NRQL) alerts to make sure that the most critical issues are handled swiftly. Use these alerts to determine whether a crash is impacting a large number of users. If it is, the relevant people (for example, both the mobile app team’s on-call member and the owner of the related back-end service) will be alerted. Make sure that your team knows how to respond to changes in crash rate (crashes per sessions) and the percentage of users impacted by crashes of your mobile app. How to do it Metric-based alerts Use our metric-based alerts and mobile monitoring UI: Ensure that key members of your mobile team have opted in to receive emails for new crashes. These emails will take you to the crash type in the UI page for your mobile app. Create an alert for your crash rate threshold that key members of your team can view in Slack or any other Alerts notification channel you choose. Your alert notification will include a link to our UI, where you can examine a chart with the exceeded threshold. From there, a link will take you to the relevant mobile monitoring page, where you can get additional details. Event-based alerts Combine the metric-based workflow with event-based alerts and dashboards specific to your mobile app and system. Create your NRQL alert that focuses on crashes of your most recently released production version. Create an additional NRQL alert that focuses on the percentage of users impacted by crashes in your latest app version (to check the overall impact on your user base). 4. Dig deeper into crashes Take your crash reporting to the next level. Now it’s time to tackle some of those harder-to-reproduce crashes by: Applying additional instrumentation to your application. Leveraging crash event trails, NRQL queries, and dashboards to visualize your data. How to do it Crash analysis Crashes are an inevitable part of running mobile applications at scale. We provide tools to help you understand your highest-impact crashes. Use the Crash analysis UI to see which crashes are occurring most often, the percentage of crash-free users, which files and methods are associated with perhaps 80 percent of your crashes, which crashes a particular user just experienced, and more. Go after high-impact crashes with crash analysis: Add custom attributes to categorize the highest-value customers, and then use them to segment crashes according to your most valuable audiences. Add breadcrumbs and custom events to produce a detailed trail of events leading up to every crash occurrence (over the last 90 days). Then, view this crash event trail in our mobile monitoring UI. Use our mobile monitoring's Versions trends page to make sure you’re improving the crash rate over subsequent releases and avoiding regressions. Breadcrumbs Use breadcrumbs and custom attributes to better reproduce and debug crashes. For example, use our recordBreadrumb API for Android or iOS to track mid-session changes in state that can help debug crashes, such as: Change of connection type Change of orientation CPU and memory state at key points in the app code Custom attributes Add custom attributes to existing events, so you can ask even more precise questions of your mobile app. Add dimensions such as: User ID: Use to react to specific user concerns and to better understand which customers and segments are most impacted. Store ID: Use to address problems with out-of-date devices, bad wi-fi, and so on. User segments: Use to better understand which customers and segments are most impacted; for example, logged in vs. non-logged in. Money in the cart at session end Origin or attribution of entry into the app Standardize custom attribute names across your mobile apps, and align with your website (if you're using our browser monitoring), so that you can compare and contrast performance across end-user channels. The mobile agents track the last interaction of crashed and non-crashed sessions to provide visibility into what the user viewed before exiting your app (either intentionally or due to a crash). 5. Focus on KPIs Bring your key performance indicators to life. Create custom interactions and events to hone in on the most important signals, including user activity for the business-critical aspects of your app. Using these powerful APIs, you can add custom instrumentation to just about anything. The following are some example use cases. How to do it Track and query feature use Use custom events to track feature use. For example: Use custom events to track user flow between app and website. Use custom events or mobile breadcrumbs to optimize the performance of key user flows (log in, shopping cart, etc.). use custom events to provide faster, contextualized support experiences for your digital customers. Use the recordCustomEvent API. Then compare the use of different features using: SELECT count(*) FROM MyNewMobileEventType FACET name Copy Measure page load times Use custom events to measure page load time: Create an app-launch timer to measure the time that elapses between a user-tap to launch your app and the point in your app code where the first screen is available. Record the timer value in New Relic using something like the following: recordCustomEvent(<myMobileTimers>, <appLaunch>, {attributes}) Copy Define start and stop timers to measure spinner durations, and then record this time in New Relic using something like the following: recordCustomEvent(<myMobileTimers>, <spinnerOnScreenA>, {attributes}) Copy Track specific user actions or funnel steps in the app (like \"add to cart\"), and include the price as an attribute on that event. Measure flows through the application by viewing the related funnel steps with custom events in Insights. For example, create a timer to track the start and end times of a subflow or an entire flow across multiple funnel steps to understand how long it took users to get through the process. Examine data about webpage interactions Use custom interactions to see traces associated with the same webpages. Use the agent API to disable default interactions, and focus on custom interactions so that you can review the page loads that are most crucial to your primary funnel. Define the start and stop times of these custom interactions to trace activities associated with individual steps of that funnel (for example, a specific user action or a page load). Track the last interactions of crashed and non-crashed sessions so that you can see what the user viewed before exiting your app (either intentionally or from a crash). Example query for non-crashed sessions: SELECT count(*) FROM Mobile WHERE sessionCrashed is null FACET lastInteraction SINCE 90 days ago Copy Example query for crashed sessions: SELECT count(*) FROM Mobile WHERE sessionCrashed is true FACET lastInteraction SINCE 90 days ago Copy",

      "body": "New Relic's synthetic monitoring—powered by a Selenium-driven Chrome browser—allows you to monitor and test your apps and address issues before they affect your end users. Here are five tips to help you take immediate advantage of its full power. 1. Match your monitor type to monitoring need Synthetic monitors are virtual browsers that measure the performance of your website, recording each check in detail. They also capture aggregate numbers for load time, uptime, and average download size, as well as an overview, detailed statistics for each page resource, and downtime incidents. There are four types of synthetic monitors; the ones you deploy will depend on the things you want to monitor: Ping monitors—to ensure that your site is accessible. Simple browser monitors—to ensure end-user performance. Scripted browsers—to ensure that particular resources are present. API monitors—to ensure that your app server works as well as your website. How to do it To add a monitor, go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics (or one.eu.newrelic.com if you have an EU-based account) and click Create monitor. Specify monitor type, name, and URL. Optional: Add a validation string (available for ping and simple browser) or advanced options, which enable substring monitoring for the following types of response validation: Verify SSL (for ping and simple browser). This option verifies the validity of the SSL certificate chain. It can be duplicated by running the following syntax: openssl s_client -servername {YOUR_HOSTNAME} -connect {YOUR_HOSTNAME}:443 -CApath /etc/ssl/certs > /dev/null Copy Bypass HEAD request (for ping). This option skips the default HEAD request and instead uses the GET verb with a ping check. Redirect is Failure (for ping). If a redirect result occurs when Redirect is Failure is enabled, Synthetics categorizes it as a failure (rather than following the redirect and checking the resulting URL). Select the locations where you want your monitor to run. Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Optional: Set up alert notifications. Select Create my monitor to confirm. Wait a few minutes; then from the Monitors index check your monitor. 2. View all monitors with the Monitors index page Continuous application performance monitoring is essential to ensure that web services are in place, working correctly, and error-free. Synthetic monitoring provides this type of assurance by performing automated tests on your web application for each selected location—noting downtime instances (“violations”) and collecting aggregate numbers, results, and detailed statistics for each page resource. Use the Monitors index page to get a high level view of this information, or select an individual monitor to view the Summary, for ping monitors, or Overview, for simple and scripted monitors, page and get a deeper insight into its performance over time. How to view your monitors in the New Relic One: New Relic Explorer To view a list of monitors using the New Relic One Monitors index page: Go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Synthetic monitors. For more information, see the documentation about navigating core UI components in New Relic One. Monitors index page To view a list of monitors using the Monitors index page: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics. 3. View individual monitor results It’s not enough to understand how your web apps are performing for your West Coast customers; you need to be able to view how they’re performing across the country and around the globe. By taking advantage of synthetic monitors and visiting your Results page, you can see how everything from development to production affects user experience. You can locate interesting results by sorting the list to identify slow, fast, or other unusual results. Or filter by location to understand how monitor performance varies with geography. (The “Network timings” graph below provides a snapshot of webpage performance over a given period.) How to do it: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics and, from the Monitors tab, select your monitor. Select Monitor > Results. Gain an up-to-the-minute view of the slowest page loads for every monitored location. 4. Understand the load-time impact of each resource Visit the synthetics Resources page to see how each resource on your website—including CSS, JavaScript, images, HTML and more—is affecting your overall load. You can drill into detailed metrics collected at run time, locate performance information for time spent by third-party resources, and identify HTTP response codes for each resource. How to do it: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics and, from the Monitors drop-down menu, select your monitor. Select Monitor > Resources. 5. Configure and develop a scripted browser test Using scripted browsers, you can build complex monitoring workflows using the Selenium JavaScript Webdriver bindings. For instance, you can log in to the application, navigate to a particular link, and wait for a page element to load and add an assertion. How to do it: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics. Choose your monitor type (for example, scripted browser). Enter the name and details of your monitor (for example, Sitename.com scripted browser) Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run (for example, Mumbai, Seoul, Columbus, and Montreal). Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor (for example, five minutes). Set a notification method to alert your team when performance violations occur. You are now ready to write your script. (Below is an example of a script used to test the performance of a main navigation page.) var assert = require('chai').assert; // script-wide timeout for all wait and waitandfind functions (in ms) var default_element_timeout = 190000; //3 mins var default_pageload_timeout = 240000; //4 mins var navlinks = [\"css-locator-1\", \"css-locator-2\"]; //sets element load timeout to 3 mins $browser.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(default_element_timeout); //sets page load timoeout to 4 mins $browser.manage().timeouts().pageloadTimeout(default_pageload_timeout); //test all the main nav page performances $browser.get(\"http://www.sitename.com\").then(function() { return $browser.findelement($driver.by.classname(\"site-theme-example\")); }).then(function() { //verifies the nav list has loaded return $browser.findelement($driver.by.classname(\"site-nav-list-example\")); }).then(function() { //loops through the navlinks array navlinks.foreach(function(val, i, arr) { //finds and navigates to each navlink page return $browser.findelement($driver.by.classname(navlinks[i])).click().then(function() { //verifies that the nav list loaded before moving on return $browser.findelement($driver.by.classname(\"site-nav-list-example\")).then(function() { //verifies that the page logo footer at bottom of page has loaded return $browser.findelement($driver.by.classname(\"site-footer-logo\")); }); }); }); }); Copy",

      "body": "In a DevOps world, a deep understanding of customer expectations and your progress in meeting those expectations is vital to providing stability, maintaining goodwill with your users, and increasing business value. With New Relic you can measure the success of your DevOps initiatives and learn how to identify, resolve, and decrease any gaps in your DevOps performance. In this tutorial, you’ll gather key service delivery stakeholders to assess your team's progress against service level objectives (SLOs) and service level agreements (SLAs), while facilitating further optimizations. Prerequisites This tutorial assumes you’ve completed the Establish objectives and baseline tutorial. 1. Assemble a cross-functional team to review service delivery The first (and most important step) is assembling the right team. Identify the proper stakeholders and representatives to play active parts in the operations review process. This team should be comprised of individuals who develop applications, work with service delivery, maintain your ecosystem, and resolve problems for customers. While operations review teams often focus on technical members, the best teams have broad representation across the company, including representatives from Business Operations, Marketing, and Support. These cross-functional teams help ensure that the service delivery process is strongly integrated with customer expectations. If you can specifically identify how technical improvements meet customer expectations and positively impact the business’s bottom line, then your operations team is functioning at optimal levels. Tip Ideally, the cross-functional operations review team should also be the team that defines your SLOs. If this is not possible, try to ensure that some members of the operations review team are also on the team responsible for SLOs. 2. Review service records and note key metrics Create a regular meeting to track your service records. New Relic recommends reviewing your previous service records, and pinpointing specific metrics to analyze at every review. For example, start with application state, alert conditions, and runtime anomalies. Look at the same metrics on two separate occasions to identify and assess patterns, inconsistencies, and anomalies. Monitor these metrics using the service delivery Insights dashboards you created in the Establish objectives and baselines tutorial. The widgets on these dashboards provide a high-level overview of the relationships between different performance indicators and baselines: insights.newrelic.com > (select a dashboard): Use dashboards to visualize metrics related to service delivery. When conducting a thorough performance review, make several dashboards that have corresponding widgets. Use these dashboards to hone-in on two specific time periods that you want to compare. This comparative analysis could cover everything from Infrastructure or browser performance, to Synthetics testing or business impact. To get started with performance indicators in Insights, read the following example queries. These queries provide information that you can consider incorporating for the operations review. Daily uptime SELECT percentage(count(result), where result = 'SUCCESS') from SyntheticCheck since 1 Day ago Copy Create dashboards that are dedicated to the functionality that drives your software development process, such as testing. For example, collect related metrics on uptime, types of monitors, geo-locations, and other data points that are required for appropriately measuring SLAs. The following dashboard provides such an example: insights.newrelic.com > (select a dashboard): Track your relevant SLAs together in one dashboard. Device performance breakdown SELECT count(*) as '# Pages',average(duration) as 'AVG',percentile(duration,50,75) as '%',average(duration - backendDuration) as 'Front',average(backendDuration) as 'Back',average(connectionSetupDuration) as 'Connection',average(domProcessingDuration) as 'DOM Processing',average(pageRenderingDuration) as 'Page Rendering' FROM PageView FACET deviceType LIMIT 3 SINCE 1 day ago Copy Top URL performance SELECT count(*) as '# Pages',average(duration) as 'AVG',percentile(duration,50,75) as '%',average(duration - backendDuration) as 'Front',average(backendDuration) as 'Back',average(connectionSetupDuration) as 'Connection',average(domProcessingDuration) as 'DOM Processing',average(pageRenderingDuration) as 'Page Rendering' FROM PageView facet pageUrl SINCE 1 day ago limit 30 Copy Memory usage SELECT average(memoryUsedBytes) /1000000 AS 'Avg MB Used', average(memoryFreeBytes)/1000000 AS 'Avg MB Free', average(memoryFreeBytes/memoryTotalBytes)*100 as 'Memory used %' FROM SystemSample since 30 minutes ago Copy Server CPU SELECT average(cpuPercent) FROM SystemSample since 3 hours ago facet hostname limit 400 Copy Combine the results into a single dashboard to help drive decisions during your operations review. Dashboards that give a brief overview of performance across your entire application stack are invaluable for cross-functional team reviews. Tip Beyond Insights, the APM reports allow you to see how you’re performing on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis with built in SLA reports and other detailed reports. The out-of-the-box details from these reports give your operations team a launch pad for conversations about progress against objectives and overall performance. 3. Summarize events related to application alerts, downtime, and errors Now that you’ve gathered data about your service delivery, the next step is to dive deeper into specific incidents that warrant further investigation or surface a need for broader team action. For example, notable downtime and errors are key areas to investigate as a team. After completing the Setup proactive alerting tutorial, you can explore notifications of violations as they occur. Once these violations are brought to your attention, acknowledge the specific incident and have an ongoing record of both opened and closed incidents. Use the incident reports as a focal point for discussion of gaps. alerts.newrelic.com > Incidents: Identify performance issues and SLA gaps with New Relic Alerts incident reports. Ultimately, it’s important to solicit feedback from the cross-functional team on the causes of the incidents to determine how you can improve service delivery processes to prevent reoccurrences. One approach might be to focus on one or two notable incidents, use the New Relic UI to walk through the data points leading up to those incidents, and assess the actions that occurred. Summarize the incident and the cross-functional feedback on causes and potential solutions as succinctly as possible. Over time, you’ll notice patterns that will require deeper action.",

The goal is to provide your teams a predictable framework and process to: Maximize efficiency in communication and effort. Minimize the overall impact to your business. Prerequisites Before starting this tutorial, be sure to complete these New Relic tutorials: Establish team dashboards Set up proactive alerting 1. Assign first responders to team dashboards Recommendation: For each team dashboard, make sure: It has an owner who assumes responsibility for the health of the applications and features it monitors. There is no ambiguity about who is responsible for attending to and resolving an alert condition. This policy will vary between organizations depending on size, structure, and culture. For example, some teams may prefer to assign dashboards and alerts based on de-facto features or application ownership. Other teams may prefer to adopt an on-call rotation (often referred to as \"pager duty\"). In on-call rotations, designated team members handle all first-line incident responses, and they resolve or delegate responsibilities based on predetermined incident thresholds. 2. Determine incident thresholds for alert conditions For each of your applications: Identify the thresholds for what is officially considered an incident. As you create alert policies with New Relic Alerts, make sure each set of threshold criteria is context-dependent. Document incident evaluation and known remediation procedures in runbooks. Include links to your runbooks when you define conditions and thresholds for your alert policies. For instance, a certain alert condition may be dismissable during low-traffic periods but require active remediation during peak hours. 3. Ensure alerts have auditable notification channels Recommendation: Make sure that communications during critical incidents take place in easily accessible and highly visible channels. A group chat room dedicated to incident communication is usually a great choice. This allows all stakeholders to participate or observe and provides a chronology of notifications, key decisions, and actions for postmortem analysis. Use any of the available notification channels in New Relic Alerts. For example, to set up a notification channel in Slack: Make sure your organization has completed New Relic's integration requirements with Slack. In the Slack app, select the dropdown in the top-left corner of the app, and select Customize Slack. Click Configure apps. From the list of app integrations, select New Relic. Expand the instructions for New Relic Alerts, and follow the steps to configure notifications from New Relic. 4. Automate triage and resolution steps Automation of simple or repeatable incident response tasks will increase efficiency and minimize the impact of incidents. With proper automation in place, you can disable or isolate faulty application components as soon as an alert threshold is reached, rather than after a notification has been issued. For example, a team managing an application for a digital media company wants to be able to remove commenting abilities from the website if the system has errors. In this case, they could: Add an endpoint to their front-end web application that will toggle a feature flag enabling or disabling the UI components associated with posting comments on an article. Create an alert policy with a threshold set on the sustained error rate in the commenting service. Assign a webhook notification channel that will send a POST request to this endpoint, as well as to the standard team notification channels. In this scenario, errors in the commenting system will trigger the webhook and remove the commenting UI from the website. Users can still use core functionality of the site without seeing errors generated by the commenting service. The application will maintain a stable but degraded state, allowing the team to focus on recovery without the pressure of preventing users from accessing the site. You can also use webhooks to create issues and action items in ticketing systems that have REST APIs, such as Zendesk. Use New Relic Alerts to create a webhook notification channel, and customize the webhook payload as needed.",

With New Relic you can measure the success of your DevOps initiatives and learn how to identify, resolve, and decrease any gaps in your DevOps performance. In this tutorial, you’ll gather key service delivery stakeholders to assess your team's progress against service level objectives (SLOs) and service level agreements (SLAs), while facilitating further optimizations. Prerequisites This tutorial assumes you’ve completed the Establish objectives and baseline tutorial. 1. Assemble a cross-functional team to review service delivery The first (and most important step) is assembling the right team. Identify the proper stakeholders and representatives to play active parts in the operations review process. This team should be comprised of individuals who develop applications, work with service delivery, maintain your ecosystem, and resolve problems for customers. While operations review teams often focus on technical members, the best teams have broad representation across the company, including representatives from Business Operations, Marketing, and Support. These cross-functional teams help ensure that the service delivery process is strongly integrated with customer expectations. If you can specifically identify how technical improvements meet customer expectations and positively impact the business’s bottom line, then your operations team is functioning at optimal levels. Tip Ideally, the cross-functional operations review team should also be the team that defines your SLOs. If this is not possible, try to ensure that some members of the operations review team are also on the team responsible for SLOs. 2. Review service records and note key metrics Create a regular meeting to track your service records. New Relic recommends reviewing your previous service records, and pinpointing specific metrics to analyze at every review. For example, start with application state, alert conditions, and runtime anomalies. Look at the same metrics on two separate occasions to identify and assess patterns, inconsistencies, and anomalies. Monitor these metrics using the service delivery Insights dashboards you created in the Establish objectives and baselines tutorial. The widgets on these dashboards provide a high-level overview of the relationships between different performance indicators and baselines: insights.newrelic.com > (select a dashboard): Use dashboards to visualize metrics related to service delivery. When conducting a thorough performance review, make several dashboards that have corresponding widgets. Use these dashboards to hone-in on two specific time periods that you want to compare. This comparative analysis could cover everything from Infrastructure or browser performance, to Synthetics testing or business impact. To get started with performance indicators in Insights, read the following example queries. These queries provide information that you can consider incorporating for the operations review. Daily uptime SELECT percentage(count(result), where result = 'SUCCESS') from SyntheticCheck since 1 Day ago Copy Create dashboards that are dedicated to the functionality that drives your software development process, such as testing. For example, collect related metrics on uptime, types of monitors, geo-locations, and other data points that are required for appropriately measuring SLAs. The following dashboard provides such an example: insights.newrelic.com > (select a dashboard): Track your relevant SLAs together in one dashboard.

      "body": "The term \"alerting\" often carries some negative connotations; for too many developers, alerting correlates too closely with errors, mistakes, and ongoing issues. However, for developers who are proactive about alerting, they know they don’t have to stare at their dashboards all day, because effective alerts will tell them when to check in. Well-defined alerts help you understand the health of your systems, so you can respond to performance problems before they affect your customers. Alerts can become overwhelming, so tune alerts and leverage AI so you get alerted on what matters. Prerequisites This tutorial assumes you have: Instrumented your applications in New Relic. Reviewed the tutorial Establish objectives and baselines before you begin this one. Optional: added custom attributes and events. 1. Define required alerting policies based on Service Level Objectives A service level objective (SLO) is an agreed upon means of measuring the performance of your service. The SLO defines a target value of a specified quantitative measure, which is called a service level indicator (SLI). Examples service level indicators could be average response time, response time percentile, and application availability. SLOs would then clarify a target value for those SLIs such as: Average response time should be less than 200 ms. 95% of requests should be completed within 250 ms. Availability of the service should be 99.99%. These SLOs can also be logically grouped together to provide an overall boolean indicator of whether the service is meeting expectations or not (for example, “95% of requests completed within 250 ms AND availability is 99.99%”), which can be helpful for alerting purposes. Use these SLIs as key performance indicators (KPIs) so your team and organization can measure your service and ensure it’s meeting customer expectations. By breaking down the quantitative performance metrics that are required of your services, you can then identify what kinds of alerts you should set for each. For instance, you could set an alert to notify you if web transaction times go above half a millisecond, or if the error rate goes higher than .20%. However, not every SLO needs to become an alert. A strong alert strategy takes SLOs and creates a set of simple, actionable alerts. New Relic often finds that our most mature DevOps customers set fewer alerts in general and focus those alerts on a core set of metrics that indicate when their customer experience is truly degraded. As a result, New Relic DevOps customers often use Apdex as part of their alerting strategy to align alerts with signs of degraded user satisfaction. As you design your alert strategy, keep this question in mind: “If the customer isn’t impacted, is it worth waking someone up?” For a simple framework of areas to set alerts for, use the following questions and advised metrics and KPIs: Questions Metrics and KPIs Are we open for business? Use Synthetic monitoring pings to determine if the site is up and scripted checks to determine that the most important capabilities (such as a checkout cart) are working. How's our underlying infrastructure? Set KPIs for key hardware, virtual hosts, containers, network, and storage components. How's the health of our application? Track metrics for JVM performance, queuing, caching, and similar dependencies. How’s the overall quality of our application? Use an Apdex score to quickly access an application’s quality. How are our customers doing? Consider real end-user metrics (browser or APM), synthetic users (Synthetics), and Apdex scores. How's our overall business doing? Focus on key transactions within an application, and tie that to expected business outcomes to illustrate correlation between your application and business performance. 2. Set specific alerts for performance, correctness, throughput, availability, and dependencies With New Relic you can set alerts on your instrumented applications, end-user experience, infrastructure, databases, and more. New Relic will alert you if your site’s availability dips or if your error rate spikes above acceptable levels, as defined by your SLOs. You can set warning thresholds to monitor issues that may be approaching a critical severity but don’t yet warrant a pager notification. Setting thresholds for when alerts should notify teams can be challenging. Thresholds that are too tight will create alert fatigue while thresholds that are too loose will lead to unhappy customers. Baseline alerts allow you to set dynamic thresholds for alerts based on historical performance. Use baselines to tune your alert to the right threshold. For example, an alert in APM can notify incident response teams if web transaction times deviate from historical performance for an allotted amount of time. alerts.newrelic.com > (select an alert policy) > (select an alert condition) > Define thresholds You can set this same kind of alert in browser to catch sub-optimal performance. In the following example, we’ve set both a warning and a violation for throughput: alerts.newrelic.com > (select an alert policy) > (select an alert condition) > Define thresholds As you develop smaller, independent services running on increasingly ephemeral architectures, your environments become significantly more complex. Visibility into outliers can be an important tool for understanding likely performance issues. You should set alerts to automatically fire when you have an outlier -- this can indicate misbehaving hosts, load balancers, or apps. For example, a load balancer divides web traffic approximately evenly across five different servers. You can set an alert based on a NRQL query, and notification to be sent if any server starts getting significantly more or less traffic than the other servers. Here’s the graph: alerts.newrelic.com > (select an alert policy) > (select an alert condition) > Define thresholds And here’s a sample NRQL query: SELECT average(cpuPercent) FROM SystemSample WHERE apmApplicationNames = 'MY-APP-NAME' FACET hostname Copy Now you have set static, baseline, and outlier alerts. This can provide a comprehensive awareness of your ecosystem. Refer to the New Relic Alerts documentation for more details about optimizing your alerts. 3. Identify groups to alert, and set broadcasting methods Alerting without the proper broadcasting methods leaves you vulnerable. Your alerts strategy should include a notification channel to ensure the appropriate teams are notified if your application or architecture encounters issues. New Relic has many notification integrations, but we recommend that you start simple and add more complexity later. We recommend that you first send alerts to a group chat channel (for example, using Slack). Evaluate these alerts in real time for several weeks to understand which alerts are indicative of important or problematic issues. These are the the types of alerts that warrant waking someone up. 4. Leverage AI to fine-tune alerts and seek anomalies To ensure you aren't training your teams to turn off or ignore notifications, keep your alerts valid and fresh. As you use New Relic to optimize your application and infrastructure performance, tighten your New Relic Alerts policy conditions to keep pace with your improved performance. To keep alerts to a minimum, leverage New Relic Applied Intelligence features, such as Incident Intelligence, which correlates related alerts into one actionable issue combining machine learning and manual input. Check to make sure alerts are correlated correctly and train your system to obtain the most accurate incident correlation. An additional way to reduce alert noise is by flapping detection and suppression. When an issue is \"flapping,\" it is cycling between an open and resolved state, creating a new alert every time it cycles. Effectively handling these can reduce the number of total alerts sent to your team. Finally, when you have maintenance scheduled, take advantage of alert muting rules to suppress those alerts you don't need. Now that you have tuned your alerts to valid notifications, you can proactively go after anomalies so you can fix issues before they become incidents. Enable Proactive Detection of anomalies and set some level of notification for them. 5. Create an alerts dashboard Be sure to check your alerts and confirm that they're firing regularly and are still relevant for your customer satisfaction metrics. Use the New Relic platform to create dashboards centered around alerts and incidents for the most common policy conditions and violations. insights.newrelic.com > All dashboards > (selected dashboard) Use NRQL to create your dashboards. For example, the dashboard above was created using the following NRQL queries: Incidents by condition: SELECT count(*) FROM ALERT_NAME WHERE current_state = 'open' FACET condition_name SINCE 1 week ago Copy Incidents by policy: SELECT count(*) FROM ALERT_NAME where current_state = 'open' FACET policy_name SINCE 60 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy Alert trends over time: SELECT count(*) FROM ALERT_NAME WHERE current_state IS NOT NULL FACET policy_name SINCE 1 week ago TIMESERIES Copy Incident details: SELECT timestamp, incident_id, policy_name, condition_name, details, severity FROM ALERT_NAME SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT 40 Copy Visualizing this data provides a resource you can share with others to refine the alerts and thresholds you’re using. For a more extensive discussion on notification channels, refer to the incident orchestration tutorial. Conclusion Establishing a focused alerts policy helps you pinpoint any degradation that could impact performance in your application or infrastructure. With proactive alerting, you will decrease user-reported incidents, and allow your teams to spend less time firefighting and more time deploying significant changes to your product.",

      "body": "At each step of your cloud adoption process, New Relic plays a critical role in helping you establish baselines, prioritize migration steps, validate improvements, and manage cloud costs. New Relic can also help you refactor, or re-architect, your software and services when you migrate them to the cloud. One key aspect of refactoring your software is splitting out your components into different services available from your cloud provider. For example, you might move your database component away from a traditional MySQL database to a cloud-hosted solution, like Amazon Relational Database (RDS) services such as DynamoDB or Aurora. If you move to the Azure cloud, you might adopt Azure SQL or Cosmos DB. When you move to solutions like those, you increase your database redundancy and resiliency. If you evaluate your overall ROI properly, you should start to see the cost/benefit ratio taking effect once you complete your refactoring. 1. Deploy monitoring New Relic is a true multi-tenant SaaS solution, meaning New Relic designed the agents to work at every layer of your application stack. To get started, deploy the agents: APM to collect application-tier performance metrics Browser monitoring to collect front-end web metrics Mobile monitoring to collect front-end mobile app metrics Infrastructure to collect host/server metrics Cloud-based integrations As you refactor your application and integrate new cloud services, you can also use New Relic to monitor and report data about your cloud services, offering you a comprehensive view of your entire architecture in one place. Cloud-based integrations available through New Relic include Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure. This tutorial describes a database migration and focuses on APM and Infrastructure. 2. Set deployment markers With New Relic, you can track deployments by setting deployment markers. Deployment tracking lets you quickly see how deployments affect your application’s performance and gauge its performance before and after you refactor. You can view deployments on the Deployments page in APM: rpm.newrelic.com/apm > (selected app) > Events > Deployments: Here is an example of the Deployments page and details about a selected deployment. 3. Establish baselines When you install the APM agent at the application layer, New Relic immediately starts collecting and displaying metrics. Use these metrics to set your pre-migration application baseline. APM agents collect performance metrics about outbound calls to databases. In the Monitoring section of the APM UI, click Databases to see a view of your database metrics. The following shows a database running on MySQL that will be refactored to use DynamoDB after migrating to AWS: one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitoring > Databases: Use this page to view and sort detailed information about database performance. 4. Refactor your applications To take advantage of the cloud, research what services are available from your cloud provider, and then re-architect and uncouple your applications. 5. Create dashboards to track refactoring your applications Apply your KPIs to your baseline measurements to validate cloud improvements, and, ideally, start seeing the impact of moving to the cloud. New Relic’s reporting for database interactions goes much deeper than high-level performance metrics about calls to the database layer in APM. You get access to metrics about slow queries so you can filter by database vendor and cache type. You can also see host and instance details for databases visually within Service Maps and within the context of transaction traces. Because all of your performance metrics are available for querying in New Relic, it's easy to build dashboards to show the performance of your database calls before, during, and after your refactoring in a single unified view. Here is an example of a dashboard for an application that uses DynamoDB and was migrated to AWS: Build a dashboard that shows the performance of your database calls. 6. Create comparison dashboards To compare both the pre- and post-refactor baselines, create a dashboard that displays the KPIs you baselined. The following dashboard shows the MySQL request query latency as compared with all of the operations for DynamoDB. You can see that, for this example, the request query latency for DynamoDB is too small to even register on the graph. Performance is clearly optimized with this cloud-based database. Use dashboards to visualize pre- and post-refactor baselines. With APM agents and the other integrations New Relic provides, you can measure the effectiveness of refactoring your applications using a broad spectrum of metrics.",

      "body": "Cloud migrations can take many forms. Some companies choose to port their applications directly from their data center to the cloud (a “Lift and Shift” migration) while others focus on completely re-architecting their applications to take advantage of benefits available only in the cloud. No matter your approach, there are three primary questions you want to answer after your migration: Has my application gotten slower? Is my application less stable than before? Am I losing customers due to either of the previous questions? To answer these questions, start by performing some basic testing to establish a baseline for the performance and availability of your systems. A baseline is a measurement of the current performance and availability of your application, which you then use as a comparison after your migration to validate your business case. In some cases, you may change a baseline when you perform migration acceptance testing. You can also use a baseline as a comparison point during your migration to make sure that you are on track. 1. Identify components Before you begin a cloud migration, identify all the tiers of your entire application stack. List all of the components (applications, services, etc.) that you want to migrate. Segment the application stack as follows: Application (backend/microservices/cron jobs) Dependency services, such as the message queue Database Website Underlying server and infrastructure Tip Make sure that you have access to applications and instances before you start creating application baselines. Engage your application owners, DevOps engineers, and product managers for access. Example: List of components Here is an example of the list of components in an application stack: Component Name Owner Language Stack Accessibility (Internet, Intranet) Operating System Service 1 John Doe Java Internet RHEL 6 Service 2 Maya Wiz .NET Intranet Win2003 R2 RabbitMQ John Doe Java Intranet AIX Website Maya Wiz Classic ASP Internet Win2000 MS SQL Dave Z NA Intranet Win2003 R2 2. Determine compatibility Once you identify the applications that you want to migrate, it is time to verify which application tiers to monitor with the New Relic platform. Work with stakeholders in your organization to determine the amount of instrumentation that is possible–or allowed–within your organization. This is an important step and one that will pay off, as the more you can instrument, the better your baselines. Here are the New Relic products to use for baselining, depending on the components that you identified: APM: Monitor your web apps with APM. See Compatibility and requirements for New Relic agents and products to learn precise compatibility details for each supported language. Infrastructure: Monitor your hosts with infrastructure. See Compatibility and requirements for infrastructure for supported operating systems and environments. You can also instrument other products and services with on-host integrations. Synthetics: Monitor web frontends and APIs with synthetics. Sometimes, you may not be able to instrument your on-premise environment with APM or Infrastructure. For example, maybe your organization's policy forbids installing an agent behind a firewall. In these cases, if the application has a web frontend, use Synthetics, as it offers non-agent monitoring while still providing the ability to establish a baseline. Example: Components matched to New Relic products Match the components that you identified with their corresponding products: Component Name Tier Owner Language Stack Accessibility (Internet/ Intranet) Operating System New Relic Products Service 1 John Doe Java Internet RHEL 6 APM, Infrastructure, Synthetics Service 2 Maya Wiz .NET Intranet Win2003 R2 APM, Infrastructure ActiveMQ John Doe Java Intranet AIX APM Website Maya Wiz Classic ASP Internet Win2000 Synthetics MS SQL Dave Z n/a Intranet Win2003 R2 Infrastructure, On-host Integration 3. Deploy monitoring Based on the component-product matches you made, deploy agents or monitors across your architecture: Deploy APM Install the APM agent on your application stack. The steps to install the APM agent are different based on language. Deploy New Relic Infrastructure After reviewing the requirements for infrastructure, follow the instructions to install the infrastructure agent on your hosts: Install for Linux Install for Windows Server Install on AWS Elastic Beanstalk Install with a configuration management tool Deploy Infrastructure on-host integrations To gain extended visibility into applications that your code depends on, deploy on-host integrations. Available integrations include Apache, MySQL, NGINX, and others. Create New Relic Synthetics monitors New Relic Synthetics is a suite of automated, scriptable tools to monitor your websites, critical business transactions, and API endpoints. To get started add a monitor. Tip Make sure to verify that your website URL is accessible from the public network. You may also need to add New Relic IPs to your allow list. 4. Gather metrics After you deploy the agents and monitors, identify which metrics are the most important to your business and use these metrics to define your KPIs. Some recommendations include: Response time: Time taken to respond to a request. Throughput: Number of requests that came in through the application. Requesting queuing (Apache, IIS, NGINX): Duration of time taken for a request to reach your application. Database call duration: Duration of time taken to complete a database call. DB call counts: Number of calls made by application code to the database. Error rate: Percent of errors reported. Apdex score: An industry standard to measure user satisfaction with the response time of web applications and services. DNS setup timing: The time it takes to connect and receive data from DNS. SSL setup timing: The time it takes to establish an SSL connection. You can find some of these metrics in service maps, as well as on APM, and [browser] (/docs/ /new-relic-browser/getting-started/browser-overview-page-website-performance-summary) overview pages. For more detailed information about navigating, interpreting, and using APM, check out these New Relic University’s tutorials: Overview dashboard tour Transactions dashboard Understanding Apdex 5. Set up Dashboards After you define your KPIs, it is easy to visualize them in dashboards. Dashboards provide a single location to view all the data that New Relic products gather. Dashboards data consists of events, and each event has an event type, a timestamp, and key-value attributes. For more information about events, see Data collection and Default events for New Relic products. You can locate your KPIs and business metrics data in New Relic using the data explorer and the NRQL query language. You can also build dashboards to track the performance of those KPIs: Example: Component performance compared against baselines Continuing the examples in this document, the following table illustrates the maturity of your application performance over a period of time based on deployment milestones. Each milestone will serve as a new baseline for your applications: Component Milestone 1 Milestone 2 Milestone N Environment Component Name Response Time SLA Apdex Response Time SLA Apdex Response On-Prem Service 1 1.5 secs 80% 70% 1.5 secs 68% 0.65 1.4 secs Cloud Service 1 0.9 secs 96.8% 95% 0.9 secs 98% 0.99 0.7 secs On-Prem Service 2 0.7 secs 73% 68% 0.7 secs 80% 0.78 0.85 secs Cloud Service 2 0.6 secs 90% 92% 0.6 secs 89% 0.90 0.5 secs After your migration, compare these baselines against your migration acceptance testing baselines. Expert tips If you find that you need data that is not captured by default instrumentation, New Relic makes it easy to capture custom data: APM custom instrumentation Browser custom data Infrastructure custom attributes Custom event data Mobile custom data Synthetics custom attributes You can also learn more about APM custom instrumentation with the New Relic University Custom data tutorial series.",

      "body": "New Relic's synthetic monitoring—powered by a Selenium-driven Chrome browser—allows you to monitor and test your apps and address issues before they affect your end users. Here are five tips to help you take immediate advantage of its full power. 1. Match your monitor type to monitoring need Synthetic monitors are virtual browsers that measure the performance of your website, recording each check in detail. They also capture aggregate numbers for load time, uptime, and average download size, as well as an overview, detailed statistics for each page resource, and downtime incidents. There are four types of synthetic monitors; the ones you deploy will depend on the things you want to monitor: Ping monitors—to ensure that your site is accessible. Simple browser monitors—to ensure end-user performance. Scripted browsers—to ensure that particular resources are present. API monitors—to ensure that your app server works as well as your website. How to do it To add a monitor, go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics (or one.eu.newrelic.com if you have an EU-based account) and click Create monitor. Specify monitor type, name, and URL. Optional: Add a validation string (available for ping and simple browser) or advanced options, which enable substring monitoring for the following types of response validation: Verify SSL (for ping and simple browser). This option verifies the validity of the SSL certificate chain. It can be duplicated by running the following syntax: openssl s_client -servername {YOUR_HOSTNAME} -connect {YOUR_HOSTNAME}:443 -CApath /etc/ssl/certs > /dev/null Copy Bypass HEAD request (for ping). This option skips the default HEAD request and instead uses the GET verb with a ping check. Redirect is Failure (for ping). If a redirect result occurs when Redirect is Failure is enabled, Synthetics categorizes it as a failure (rather than following the redirect and checking the resulting URL). Select the locations where you want your monitor to run. Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Optional: Set up alert notifications. Select Create my monitor to confirm. Wait a few minutes; then from the Monitors index check your monitor. 2. View all monitors with the Monitors index page Continuous application performance monitoring is essential to ensure that web services are in place, working correctly, and error-free. Synthetic monitoring provides this type of assurance by performing automated tests on your web application for each selected location—noting downtime instances (“violations”) and collecting aggregate numbers, results, and detailed statistics for each page resource. Use the Monitors index page to get a high level view of this information, or select an individual monitor to view the Summary, for ping monitors, or Overview, for simple and scripted monitors, page and get a deeper insight into its performance over time. How to view your monitors in the New Relic One: New Relic Explorer To view a list of monitors using the New Relic One Monitors index page: Go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Synthetic monitors. For more information, see the documentation about navigating core UI components in New Relic One. Monitors index page To view a list of monitors using the Monitors index page: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics. 3. View individual monitor results It’s not enough to understand how your web apps are performing for your West Coast customers; you need to be able to view how they’re performing across the country and around the globe. By taking advantage of synthetic monitors and visiting your Results page, you can see how everything from development to production affects user experience. You can locate interesting results by sorting the list to identify slow, fast, or other unusual results. Or filter by location to understand how monitor performance varies with geography. (The “Network timings” graph below provides a snapshot of webpage performance over a given period.) How to do it: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics and, from the Monitors tab, select your monitor. Select Monitor > Results. Gain an up-to-the-minute view of the slowest page loads for every monitored location. 4. Understand the load-time impact of each resource Visit the synthetics Resources page to see how each resource on your website—including CSS, JavaScript, images, HTML and more—is affecting your overall load. You can drill into detailed metrics collected at run time, locate performance information for time spent by third-party resources, and identify HTTP response codes for each resource. How to do it: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics and, from the Monitors drop-down menu, select your monitor. Select Monitor > Resources. 5. Configure and develop a scripted browser test Using scripted browsers, you can build complex monitoring workflows using the Selenium JavaScript Webdriver bindings. For instance, you can log in to the application, navigate to a particular link, and wait for a page element to load and add an assertion. How to do it: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics. Choose your monitor type (for example, scripted browser). Enter the name and details of your monitor (for example, Sitename.com scripted browser) Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run (for example, Mumbai, Seoul, Columbus, and Montreal). Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor (for example, five minutes). Set a notification method to alert your team when performance violations occur. You are now ready to write your script. (Below is an example of a script used to test the performance of a main navigation page.) var assert = require('chai').assert; // script-wide timeout for all wait and waitandfind functions (in ms) var default_element_timeout = 190000; //3 mins var default_pageload_timeout = 240000; //4 mins var navlinks = [\"css-locator-1\", \"css-locator-2\"]; //sets element load timeout to 3 mins $browser.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(default_element_timeout); //sets page load timoeout to 4 mins $browser.manage().timeouts().pageloadTimeout(default_pageload_timeout); //test all the main nav page performances $browser.get(\"http://www.sitename.com\").then(function() { return $browser.findelement($driver.by.classname(\"site-theme-example\")); }).then(function() { //verifies the nav list has loaded return $browser.findelement($driver.by.classname(\"site-nav-list-example\")); }).then(function() { //loops through the navlinks array navlinks.foreach(function(val, i, arr) { //finds and navigates to each navlink page return $browser.findelement($driver.by.classname(navlinks[i])).click().then(function() { //verifies that the nav list loaded before moving on return $browser.findelement($driver.by.classname(\"site-nav-list-example\")).then(function() { //verifies that the page logo footer at bottom of page has loaded return $browser.findelement($driver.by.classname(\"site-footer-logo\")); }); }); }); }); Copy",

      "body": "In a DevOps world, a deep understanding of customer expectations and your progress in meeting those expectations is vital to providing stability, maintaining goodwill with your users, and increasing business value. With New Relic you can measure the success of your DevOps initiatives and learn how to identify, resolve, and decrease any gaps in your DevOps performance. In this tutorial, you’ll gather key service delivery stakeholders to assess your team's progress against service level objectives (SLOs) and service level agreements (SLAs), while facilitating further optimizations. Prerequisites This tutorial assumes you’ve completed the Establish objectives and baseline tutorial. 1. Assemble a cross-functional team to review service delivery The first (and most important step) is assembling the right team. Identify the proper stakeholders and representatives to play active parts in the operations review process. This team should be comprised of individuals who develop applications, work with service delivery, maintain your ecosystem, and resolve problems for customers. While operations review teams often focus on technical members, the best teams have broad representation across the company, including representatives from Business Operations, Marketing, and Support. These cross-functional teams help ensure that the service delivery process is strongly integrated with customer expectations. If you can specifically identify how technical improvements meet customer expectations and positively impact the business’s bottom line, then your operations team is functioning at optimal levels. Tip Ideally, the cross-functional operations review team should also be the team that defines your SLOs. If this is not possible, try to ensure that some members of the operations review team are also on the team responsible for SLOs. 2. Review service records and note key metrics Create a regular meeting to track your service records. New Relic recommends reviewing your previous service records, and pinpointing specific metrics to analyze at every review. For example, start with application state, alert conditions, and runtime anomalies. Look at the same metrics on two separate occasions to identify and assess patterns, inconsistencies, and anomalies. Monitor these metrics using the service delivery Insights dashboards you created in the Establish objectives and baselines tutorial. The widgets on these dashboards provide a high-level overview of the relationships between different performance indicators and baselines: insights.newrelic.com > (select a dashboard): Use dashboards to visualize metrics related to service delivery. When conducting a thorough performance review, make several dashboards that have corresponding widgets. Use these dashboards to hone-in on two specific time periods that you want to compare. This comparative analysis could cover everything from Infrastructure or browser performance, to Synthetics testing or business impact. To get started with performance indicators in Insights, read the following example queries. These queries provide information that you can consider incorporating for the operations review. Daily uptime SELECT percentage(count(result), where result = 'SUCCESS') from SyntheticCheck since 1 Day ago Copy Create dashboards that are dedicated to the functionality that drives your software development process, such as testing. For example, collect related metrics on uptime, types of monitors, geo-locations, and other data points that are required for appropriately measuring SLAs. The following dashboard provides such an example: insights.newrelic.com > (select a dashboard): Track your relevant SLAs together in one dashboard. Device performance breakdown SELECT count(*) as '# Pages',average(duration) as 'AVG',percentile(duration,50,75) as '%',average(duration - backendDuration) as 'Front',average(backendDuration) as 'Back',average(connectionSetupDuration) as 'Connection',average(domProcessingDuration) as 'DOM Processing',average(pageRenderingDuration) as 'Page Rendering' FROM PageView FACET deviceType LIMIT 3 SINCE 1 day ago Copy Top URL performance SELECT count(*) as '# Pages',average(duration) as 'AVG',percentile(duration,50,75) as '%',average(duration - backendDuration) as 'Front',average(backendDuration) as 'Back',average(connectionSetupDuration) as 'Connection',average(domProcessingDuration) as 'DOM Processing',average(pageRenderingDuration) as 'Page Rendering' FROM PageView facet pageUrl SINCE 1 day ago limit 30 Copy Memory usage SELECT average(memoryUsedBytes) /1000000 AS 'Avg MB Used', average(memoryFreeBytes)/1000000 AS 'Avg MB Free', average(memoryFreeBytes/memoryTotalBytes)*100 as 'Memory used %' FROM SystemSample since 30 minutes ago Copy Server CPU SELECT average(cpuPercent) FROM SystemSample since 3 hours ago facet hostname limit 400 Copy Combine the results into a single dashboard to help drive decisions during your operations review. Dashboards that give a brief overview of performance across your entire application stack are invaluable for cross-functional team reviews. Tip Beyond Insights, the APM reports allow you to see how you’re performing on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis with built in SLA reports and other detailed reports. The out-of-the-box details from these reports give your operations team a launch pad for conversations about progress against objectives and overall performance. 3. Summarize events related to application alerts, downtime, and errors Now that you’ve gathered data about your service delivery, the next step is to dive deeper into specific incidents that warrant further investigation or surface a need for broader team action. For example, notable downtime and errors are key areas to investigate as a team. After completing the Setup proactive alerting tutorial, you can explore notifications of violations as they occur. Once these violations are brought to your attention, acknowledge the specific incident and have an ongoing record of both opened and closed incidents. Use the incident reports as a focal point for discussion of gaps. alerts.newrelic.com > Incidents: Identify performance issues and SLA gaps with New Relic Alerts incident reports. Ultimately, it’s important to solicit feedback from the cross-functional team on the causes of the incidents to determine how you can improve service delivery processes to prevent reoccurrences. One approach might be to focus on one or two notable incidents, use the New Relic UI to walk through the data points leading up to those incidents, and assess the actions that occurred. Summarize the incident and the cross-functional feedback on causes and potential solutions as succinctly as possible. Over time, you’ll notice patterns that will require deeper action.",

      "body": "Incident orchestration is the alignment of teams, tools, and processes to prepare for incidents and outages in your software. The goal is to provide your teams a predictable framework and process to: Maximize efficiency in communication and effort. Minimize the overall impact to your business. Prerequisites Before starting this tutorial, be sure to complete these New Relic tutorials: Establish team dashboards Set up proactive alerting 1. Assign first responders to team dashboards Recommendation: For each team dashboard, make sure: It has an owner who assumes responsibility for the health of the applications and features it monitors. There is no ambiguity about who is responsible for attending to and resolving an alert condition. This policy will vary between organizations depending on size, structure, and culture. For example, some teams may prefer to assign dashboards and alerts based on de-facto features or application ownership. Other teams may prefer to adopt an on-call rotation (often referred to as \"pager duty\"). In on-call rotations, designated team members handle all first-line incident responses, and they resolve or delegate responsibilities based on predetermined incident thresholds. 2. Determine incident thresholds for alert conditions For each of your applications: Identify the thresholds for what is officially considered an incident. As you create alert policies with New Relic Alerts, make sure each set of threshold criteria is context-dependent. Document incident evaluation and known remediation procedures in runbooks. Include links to your runbooks when you define conditions and thresholds for your alert policies. For instance, a certain alert condition may be dismissable during low-traffic periods but require active remediation during peak hours. 3. Ensure alerts have auditable notification channels Recommendation: Make sure that communications during critical incidents take place in easily accessible and highly visible channels. A group chat room dedicated to incident communication is usually a great choice. This allows all stakeholders to participate or observe and provides a chronology of notifications, key decisions, and actions for postmortem analysis. Use any of the available notification channels in New Relic Alerts. For example, to set up a notification channel in Slack: Make sure your organization has completed New Relic's integration requirements with Slack. In the Slack app, select the dropdown in the top-left corner of the app, and select Customize Slack. Click Configure apps. From the list of app integrations, select New Relic. Expand the instructions for New Relic Alerts, and follow the steps to configure notifications from New Relic. 4. Automate triage and resolution steps Automation of simple or repeatable incident response tasks will increase efficiency and minimize the impact of incidents. With proper automation in place, you can disable or isolate faulty application components as soon as an alert threshold is reached, rather than after a notification has been issued. For example, a team managing an application for a digital media company wants to be able to remove commenting abilities from the website if the system has errors. In this case, they could: Add an endpoint to their front-end web application that will toggle a feature flag enabling or disabling the UI components associated with posting comments on an article. Create an alert policy with a threshold set on the sustained error rate in the commenting service. Assign a webhook notification channel that will send a POST request to this endpoint, as well as to the standard team notification channels. In this scenario, errors in the commenting system will trigger the webhook and remove the commenting UI from the website. Users can still use core functionality of the site without seeing errors generated by the commenting service. The application will maintain a stable but degraded state, allowing the team to focus on recovery without the pressure of preventing users from accessing the site. You can also use webhooks to create issues and action items in ticketing systems that have REST APIs, such as Zendesk. Use New Relic Alerts to create a webhook notification channel, and customize the webhook payload as needed.",

      "body": "The term \"alerting\" often carries some negative connotations; for too many developers, alerting correlates too closely with errors, mistakes, and ongoing issues. However, for developers who are proactive about alerting, they know they don’t have to stare at their dashboards all day, because effective alerts will tell them when to check in. Well-defined alerts help you understand the health of your systems, so you can respond to performance problems before they affect your customers. Alerts can become overwhelming, so tune alerts and leverage AI so you get alerted on what matters. Prerequisites This tutorial assumes you have: Instrumented your applications in New Relic. Reviewed the tutorial Establish objectives and baselines before you begin this one. Optional: added custom attributes and events. 1. Define required alerting policies based on Service Level Objectives A service level objective (SLO) is an agreed upon means of measuring the performance of your service. The SLO defines a target value of a specified quantitative measure, which is called a service level indicator (SLI). Examples service level indicators could be average response time, response time percentile, and application availability. SLOs would then clarify a target value for those SLIs such as: Average response time should be less than 200 ms. 95% of requests should be completed within 250 ms. Availability of the service should be 99.99%. These SLOs can also be logically grouped together to provide an overall boolean indicator of whether the service is meeting expectations or not (for example, “95% of requests completed within 250 ms AND availability is 99.99%”), which can be helpful for alerting purposes. Use these SLIs as key performance indicators (KPIs) so your team and organization can measure your service and ensure it’s meeting customer expectations. By breaking down the quantitative performance metrics that are required of your services, you can then identify what kinds of alerts you should set for each. For instance, you could set an alert to notify you if web transaction times go above half a millisecond, or if the error rate goes higher than .20%. However, not every SLO needs to become an alert. A strong alert strategy takes SLOs and creates a set of simple, actionable alerts. New Relic often finds that our most mature DevOps customers set fewer alerts in general and focus those alerts on a core set of metrics that indicate when their customer experience is truly degraded. As a result, New Relic DevOps customers often use Apdex as part of their alerting strategy to align alerts with signs of degraded user satisfaction. As you design your alert strategy, keep this question in mind: “If the customer isn’t impacted, is it worth waking someone up?” For a simple framework of areas to set alerts for, use the following questions and advised metrics and KPIs: Questions Metrics and KPIs Are we open for business? Use Synthetic monitoring pings to determine if the site is up and scripted checks to determine that the most important capabilities (such as a checkout cart) are working. How's our underlying infrastructure? Set KPIs for key hardware, virtual hosts, containers, network, and storage components. How's the health of our application? Track metrics for JVM performance, queuing, caching, and similar dependencies. How’s the overall quality of our application? Use an Apdex score to quickly access an application’s quality. How are our customers doing? Consider real end-user metrics (browser or APM), synthetic users (Synthetics), and Apdex scores. How's our overall business doing? Focus on key transactions within an application, and tie that to expected business outcomes to illustrate correlation between your application and business performance. 2. Set specific alerts for performance, correctness, throughput, availability, and dependencies With New Relic you can set alerts on your instrumented applications, end-user experience, infrastructure, databases, and more. New Relic will alert you if your site’s availability dips or if your error rate spikes above acceptable levels, as defined by your SLOs. You can set warning thresholds to monitor issues that may be approaching a critical severity but don’t yet warrant a pager notification. Setting thresholds for when alerts should notify teams can be challenging. Thresholds that are too tight will create alert fatigue while thresholds that are too loose will lead to unhappy customers. Baseline alerts allow you to set dynamic thresholds for alerts based on historical performance. Use baselines to tune your alert to the right threshold. For example, an alert in APM can notify incident response teams if web transaction times deviate from historical performance for an allotted amount of time. alerts.newrelic.com > (select an alert policy) > (select an alert condition) > Define thresholds You can set this same kind of alert in browser to catch sub-optimal performance. In the following example, we’ve set both a warning and a violation for throughput: alerts.newrelic.com > (select an alert policy) > (select an alert condition) > Define thresholds As you develop smaller, independent services running on increasingly ephemeral architectures, your environments become significantly more complex. Visibility into outliers can be an important tool for understanding likely performance issues. You should set alerts to automatically fire when you have an outlier -- this can indicate misbehaving hosts, load balancers, or apps. For example, a load balancer divides web traffic approximately evenly across five different servers. You can set an alert based on a NRQL query, and notification to be sent if any server starts getting significantly more or less traffic than the other servers. Here’s the graph: alerts.newrelic.com > (select an alert policy) > (select an alert condition) > Define thresholds And here’s a sample NRQL query: SELECT average(cpuPercent) FROM SystemSample WHERE apmApplicationNames = 'MY-APP-NAME' FACET hostname Copy Now you have set static, baseline, and outlier alerts. This can provide a comprehensive awareness of your ecosystem. Refer to the New Relic Alerts documentation for more details about optimizing your alerts. 3. Identify groups to alert, and set broadcasting methods Alerting without the proper broadcasting methods leaves you vulnerable. Your alerts strategy should include a notification channel to ensure the appropriate teams are notified if your application or architecture encounters issues. New Relic has many notification integrations, but we recommend that you start simple and add more complexity later. We recommend that you first send alerts to a group chat channel (for example, using Slack). Evaluate these alerts in real time for several weeks to understand which alerts are indicative of important or problematic issues. These are the the types of alerts that warrant waking someone up. 4. Leverage AI to fine-tune alerts and seek anomalies To ensure you aren't training your teams to turn off or ignore notifications, keep your alerts valid and fresh. As you use New Relic to optimize your application and infrastructure performance, tighten your New Relic Alerts policy conditions to keep pace with your improved performance. To keep alerts to a minimum, leverage New Relic Applied Intelligence features, such as Incident Intelligence, which correlates related alerts into one actionable issue combining machine learning and manual input. Check to make sure alerts are correlated correctly and train your system to obtain the most accurate incident correlation. An additional way to reduce alert noise is by flapping detection and suppression. When an issue is \"flapping,\" it is cycling between an open and resolved state, creating a new alert every time it cycles. Effectively handling these can reduce the number of total alerts sent to your team. Finally, when you have maintenance scheduled, take advantage of alert muting rules to suppress those alerts you don't need. Now that you have tuned your alerts to valid notifications, you can proactively go after anomalies so you can fix issues before they become incidents. Enable Proactive Detection of anomalies and set some level of notification for them. 5. Create an alerts dashboard Be sure to check your alerts and confirm that they're firing regularly and are still relevant for your customer satisfaction metrics. Use the New Relic platform to create dashboards centered around alerts and incidents for the most common policy conditions and violations. insights.newrelic.com > All dashboards > (selected dashboard) Use NRQL to create your dashboards. For example, the dashboard above was created using the following NRQL queries: Incidents by condition: SELECT count(*) FROM ALERT_NAME WHERE current_state = 'open' FACET condition_name SINCE 1 week ago Copy Incidents by policy: SELECT count(*) FROM ALERT_NAME where current_state = 'open' FACET policy_name SINCE 60 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy Alert trends over time: SELECT count(*) FROM ALERT_NAME WHERE current_state IS NOT NULL FACET policy_name SINCE 1 week ago TIMESERIES Copy Incident details: SELECT timestamp, incident_id, policy_name, condition_name, details, severity FROM ALERT_NAME SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT 40 Copy Visualizing this data provides a resource you can share with others to refine the alerts and thresholds you’re using. For a more extensive discussion on notification channels, refer to the incident orchestration tutorial. Conclusion Establishing a focused alerts policy helps you pinpoint any degradation that could impact performance in your application or infrastructure. With proactive alerting, you will decrease user-reported incidents, and allow your teams to spend less time firefighting and more time deploying significant changes to your product.",

Device performance breakdown SELECT count(*) as '# Pages',average(duration) as 'AVG',percentile(duration,50,75) as '%',average(duration - backendDuration) as 'Front',average(backendDuration) as 'Back',average(connectionSetupDuration) as 'Connection',average(domProcessingDuration) as 'DOM Processing',average(pageRenderingDuration) as 'Page Rendering' FROM PageView FACET deviceType LIMIT 3 SINCE 1 day ago Copy Top URL performance SELECT count(*) as '# Pages',average(duration) as 'AVG',percentile(duration,50,75) as '%',average(duration - backendDuration) as 'Front',average(backendDuration) as 'Back',average(connectionSetupDuration) as 'Connection',average(domProcessingDuration) as 'DOM Processing',average(pageRenderingDuration) as 'Page Rendering' FROM PageView facet pageUrl SINCE 1 day ago limit 30 Copy Memory usage SELECT average(memoryUsedBytes) /1000000 AS 'Avg MB Used', average(memoryFreeBytes)/1000000 AS 'Avg MB Free', average(memoryFreeBytes/memoryTotalBytes)*100 as 'Memory used %' FROM SystemSample since 30 minutes ago Copy Server CPU SELECT average(cpuPercent) FROM SystemSample since 3 hours ago facet hostname limit 400 Copy Combine the results into a single dashboard to help drive decisions during your operations review. Dashboards that give a brief overview of performance across your entire application stack are invaluable for cross-functional team reviews. Tip Beyond Insights, the APM reports allow you to see how you’re performing on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis with built in SLA reports and other detailed reports. The out-of-the-box details from these reports give your operations team a launch pad for conversations about progress against objectives and overall performance. 3. Summarize events related to application alerts, downtime, and errors Now that you’ve gathered data about your service delivery, the next step is to dive deeper into specific incidents that warrant further investigation or surface a need for broader team action. For example, notable downtime and errors are key areas to investigate as a team. After completing the Setup proactive alerting tutorial, you can explore notifications of violations as they occur. Once these violations are brought to your attention, acknowledge the specific incident and have an ongoing record of both opened and closed incidents. Use the incident reports as a focal point for discussion of gaps. alerts.newrelic.com > Incidents: Identify performance issues and SLA gaps with New Relic Alerts incident reports. Ultimately, it’s important to solicit feedback from the cross-functional team on the causes of the incidents to determine how you can improve service delivery processes to prevent reoccurrences. One approach might be to focus on one or two notable incidents, use the New Relic UI to walk through the data points leading up to those incidents, and assess the actions that occurred. Summarize the incident and the cross-functional feedback on causes and potential solutions as succinctly as possible. Over time, you’ll notice patterns that will require deeper action.",

      "body": "Incident orchestration is the alignment of teams, tools, and processes to prepare for incidents and outages in your software. The goal is to provide your teams a predictable framework and process to: Maximize efficiency in communication and effort. Minimize the overall impact to your business. Prerequisites Before starting this tutorial, be sure to complete these New Relic tutorials: Establish team dashboards Set up proactive alerting 1. Assign first responders to team dashboards Recommendation: For each team dashboard, make sure: It has an owner who assumes responsibility for the health of the applications and features it monitors. There is no ambiguity about who is responsible for attending to and resolving an alert condition. This policy will vary between organizations depending on size, structure, and culture. For example, some teams may prefer to assign dashboards and alerts based on de-facto features or application ownership. Other teams may prefer to adopt an on-call rotation (often referred to as \"pager duty\"). In on-call rotations, designated team members handle all first-line incident responses, and they resolve or delegate responsibilities based on predetermined incident thresholds. 2. Determine incident thresholds for alert conditions For each of your applications: Identify the thresholds for what is officially considered an incident. As you create alert policies with New Relic Alerts, make sure each set of threshold criteria is context-dependent. Document incident evaluation and known remediation procedures in runbooks. Include links to your runbooks when you define conditions and thresholds for your alert policies. For instance, a certain alert condition may be dismissable during low-traffic periods but require active remediation during peak hours. 3. Ensure alerts have auditable notification channels Recommendation: Make sure that communications during critical incidents take place in easily accessible and highly visible channels. A group chat room dedicated to incident communication is usually a great choice. This allows all stakeholders to participate or observe and provides a chronology of notifications, key decisions, and actions for postmortem analysis. Use any of the available notification channels in New Relic Alerts. For example, to set up a notification channel in Slack: Make sure your organization has completed New Relic's integration requirements with Slack. In the Slack app, select the dropdown in the top-left corner of the app, and select Customize Slack. Click Configure apps. From the list of app integrations, select New Relic. Expand the instructions for New Relic Alerts, and follow the steps to configure notifications from New Relic. 4. Automate triage and resolution steps Automation of simple or repeatable incident response tasks will increase efficiency and minimize the impact of incidents. With proper automation in place, you can disable or isolate faulty application components as soon as an alert threshold is reached, rather than after a notification has been issued. For example, a team managing an application for a digital media company wants to be able to remove commenting abilities from the website if the system has errors. In this case, they could: Add an endpoint to their front-end web application that will toggle a feature flag enabling or disabling the UI components associated with posting comments on an article. Create an alert policy with a threshold set on the sustained error rate in the commenting service. Assign a webhook notification channel that will send a POST request to this endpoint, as well as to the standard team notification channels. In this scenario, errors in the commenting system will trigger the webhook and remove the commenting UI from the website. Users can still use core functionality of the site without seeing errors generated by the commenting service. The application will maintain a stable but degraded state, allowing the team to focus on recovery without the pressure of preventing users from accessing the site. You can also use webhooks to create issues and action items in ticketing systems that have REST APIs, such as Zendesk. Use New Relic Alerts to create a webhook notification channel, and customize the webhook payload as needed.",

      "body": "The term \"alerting\" often carries some negative connotations; for too many developers, alerting correlates too closely with errors, mistakes, and ongoing issues. However, for developers who are proactive about alerting, they know they don’t have to stare at their dashboards all day, because effective alerts will tell them when to check in. Well-defined alerts help you understand the health of your systems, so you can respond to performance problems before they affect your customers. Alerts can become overwhelming, so tune alerts and leverage AI so you get alerted on what matters. Prerequisites This tutorial assumes you have: Instrumented your applications in New Relic. Reviewed the tutorial Establish objectives and baselines before you begin this one. Optional: added custom attributes and events. 1. Define required alerting policies based on Service Level Objectives A service level objective (SLO) is an agreed upon means of measuring the performance of your service. The SLO defines a target value of a specified quantitative measure, which is called a service level indicator (SLI). Examples service level indicators could be average response time, response time percentile, and application availability. SLOs would then clarify a target value for those SLIs such as: Average response time should be less than 200 ms. 95% of requests should be completed within 250 ms. Availability of the service should be 99.99%. These SLOs can also be logically grouped together to provide an overall boolean indicator of whether the service is meeting expectations or not (for example, “95% of requests completed within 250 ms AND availability is 99.99%”), which can be helpful for alerting purposes. Use these SLIs as key performance indicators (KPIs) so your team and organization can measure your service and ensure it’s meeting customer expectations. By breaking down the quantitative performance metrics that are required of your services, you can then identify what kinds of alerts you should set for each. For instance, you could set an alert to notify you if web transaction times go above half a millisecond, or if the error rate goes higher than .20%. However, not every SLO needs to become an alert. A strong alert strategy takes SLOs and creates a set of simple, actionable alerts. New Relic often finds that our most mature DevOps customers set fewer alerts in general and focus those alerts on a core set of metrics that indicate when their customer experience is truly degraded. As a result, New Relic DevOps customers often use Apdex as part of their alerting strategy to align alerts with signs of degraded user satisfaction. As you design your alert strategy, keep this question in mind: “If the customer isn’t impacted, is it worth waking someone up?” For a simple framework of areas to set alerts for, use the following questions and advised metrics and KPIs: Questions Metrics and KPIs Are we open for business? Use Synthetic monitoring pings to determine if the site is up and scripted checks to determine that the most important capabilities (such as a checkout cart) are working. How's our underlying infrastructure? Set KPIs for key hardware, virtual hosts, containers, network, and storage components. How's the health of our application? Track metrics for JVM performance, queuing, caching, and similar dependencies. How’s the overall quality of our application? Use an Apdex score to quickly access an application’s quality. How are our customers doing? Consider real end-user metrics (browser or APM), synthetic users (Synthetics), and Apdex scores. How's our overall business doing? Focus on key transactions within an application, and tie that to expected business outcomes to illustrate correlation between your application and business performance. 2. Set specific alerts for performance, correctness, throughput, availability, and dependencies With New Relic you can set alerts on your instrumented applications, end-user experience, infrastructure, databases, and more. New Relic will alert you if your site’s availability dips or if your error rate spikes above acceptable levels, as defined by your SLOs. You can set warning thresholds to monitor issues that may be approaching a critical severity but don’t yet warrant a pager notification. Setting thresholds for when alerts should notify teams can be challenging. Thresholds that are too tight will create alert fatigue while thresholds that are too loose will lead to unhappy customers. Baseline alerts allow you to set dynamic thresholds for alerts based on historical performance. Use baselines to tune your alert to the right threshold. For example, an alert in APM can notify incident response teams if web transaction times deviate from historical performance for an allotted amount of time. alerts.newrelic.com > (select an alert policy) > (select an alert condition) > Define thresholds You can set this same kind of alert in browser to catch sub-optimal performance. In the following example, we’ve set both a warning and a violation for throughput: alerts.newrelic.com > (select an alert policy) > (select an alert condition) > Define thresholds As you develop smaller, independent services running on increasingly ephemeral architectures, your environments become significantly more complex. Visibility into outliers can be an important tool for understanding likely performance issues. You should set alerts to automatically fire when you have an outlier -- this can indicate misbehaving hosts, load balancers, or apps. For example, a load balancer divides web traffic approximately evenly across five different servers. You can set an alert based on a NRQL query, and notification to be sent if any server starts getting significantly more or less traffic than the other servers. Here’s the graph: alerts.newrelic.com > (select an alert policy) > (select an alert condition) > Define thresholds And here’s a sample NRQL query: SELECT average(cpuPercent) FROM SystemSample WHERE apmApplicationNames = 'MY-APP-NAME' FACET hostname Copy Now you have set static, baseline, and outlier alerts. This can provide a comprehensive awareness of your ecosystem. Refer to the New Relic Alerts documentation for more details about optimizing your alerts. 3. Identify groups to alert, and set broadcasting methods Alerting without the proper broadcasting methods leaves you vulnerable. Your alerts strategy should include a notification channel to ensure the appropriate teams are notified if your application or architecture encounters issues. New Relic has many notification integrations, but we recommend that you start simple and add more complexity later. We recommend that you first send alerts to a group chat channel (for example, using Slack). Evaluate these alerts in real time for several weeks to understand which alerts are indicative of important or problematic issues. These are the the types of alerts that warrant waking someone up. 4. Leverage AI to fine-tune alerts and seek anomalies To ensure you aren't training your teams to turn off or ignore notifications, keep your alerts valid and fresh. As you use New Relic to optimize your application and infrastructure performance, tighten your New Relic Alerts policy conditions to keep pace with your improved performance. To keep alerts to a minimum, leverage New Relic Applied Intelligence features, such as Incident Intelligence, which correlates related alerts into one actionable issue combining machine learning and manual input. Check to make sure alerts are correlated correctly and train your system to obtain the most accurate incident correlation. An additional way to reduce alert noise is by flapping detection and suppression. When an issue is \"flapping,\" it is cycling between an open and resolved state, creating a new alert every time it cycles. Effectively handling these can reduce the number of total alerts sent to your team. Finally, when you have maintenance scheduled, take advantage of alert muting rules to suppress those alerts you don't need. Now that you have tuned your alerts to valid notifications, you can proactively go after anomalies so you can fix issues before they become incidents. Enable Proactive Detection of anomalies and set some level of notification for them. 5. Create an alerts dashboard Be sure to check your alerts and confirm that they're firing regularly and are still relevant for your customer satisfaction metrics. Use the New Relic platform to create dashboards centered around alerts and incidents for the most common policy conditions and violations. insights.newrelic.com > All dashboards > (selected dashboard) Use NRQL to create your dashboards. For example, the dashboard above was created using the following NRQL queries: Incidents by condition: SELECT count(*) FROM ALERT_NAME WHERE current_state = 'open' FACET condition_name SINCE 1 week ago Copy Incidents by policy: SELECT count(*) FROM ALERT_NAME where current_state = 'open' FACET policy_name SINCE 60 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy Alert trends over time: SELECT count(*) FROM ALERT_NAME WHERE current_state IS NOT NULL FACET policy_name SINCE 1 week ago TIMESERIES Copy Incident details: SELECT timestamp, incident_id, policy_name, condition_name, details, severity FROM ALERT_NAME SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT 40 Copy Visualizing this data provides a resource you can share with others to refine the alerts and thresholds you’re using. For a more extensive discussion on notification channels, refer to the incident orchestration tutorial. Conclusion Establishing a focused alerts policy helps you pinpoint any degradation that could impact performance in your application or infrastructure. With proactive alerting, you will decrease user-reported incidents, and allow your teams to spend less time firefighting and more time deploying significant changes to your product.",

      "body": "Application remediation involves gathering metrics and performance statistics about your application. This helps you identify bottlenecks and errors that can lead to instability in your software (and frustration for your users). New Relic provides views of your application’s performance to help you quickly identify and remediate errors. These quick wins ensure you and your colleagues can accelerate the momentum of DevOps in your organization. 1. Use semantic naming throughout New Relic Use semantic naming to give meaningful, structured names and labels to the applications you’re monitoring. Create a scalable syntax that can be understood, filtered, and sorted by any team who might use New Relic now or in the future. When you create your naming structure, be sure to consider growth and the potential for scaling/changes in your application’s architecture. Consider the following naming structure: store--us-web-prod store--us-web-stage store--us-web-dev This structure allows for additions to scale (for example, store-eu-web-prod-02), and makes the application’s environment searchable. Any convention you use should be unique to your organization’s structure, but be sure to use a convention that will allow you to optimize your environment as need. 2. Deploy the New Relic agent Review the compatibility and requirements for New Relic agents and products, and then follow the documentation to install the appropriate agent in your application. Once the agent is installed, you should see data begin to populate in New Relic within minutes. Tip If after several minutes, New Relic is not showing performance information, see No data appears. 3. Identify application performance outliers and errors The default charts in New Relic tell a story about your application’s performance. If there are performance issues, patterns in the charts highlight the causes. The following figure, from the Overview page in APM, shows a large spike occurred at noon on March 27th, and was nearly double the response time of our application’s overall trend: one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitoring > Overview Additionally, the response time breakdown shows a spike in Web external (which indicates downstream dependencies). Since the spike seems to correlate with periods of higher throughput, we can then use the Throughput chart to analyze the problem in more detail. 4. Drill into specific time frames Click and drag on a graph, to drill into a focused time slice of performance data to better isolate any issue you’re investigating. In this example, we’ve narrowed the view on the spike we saw in web transactions times: one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitoring > Overview Here, it’s obvious that some part of Web external, which is an application or service called by our Web portal app, is likely the source of the issue. 5. Drill into transaction traces to investigate outliers New Relic displays transactions ordered with the most time consuming transaction at the top. Click a transaction to navigate to the Transactions page and expand that transaction into its component parts and see any transaction traces that have been captured as a result of any performance issues. New Relic automatically captures these traces whenever a transaction violates your Apdex score by more than four times for a specific number of seconds. Tip If you’re not capturing any transaction traces, you may not be violating these thresholds. Be sure to configure transaction traces for your applications as needed. In the following example, we see that interceptor.ServletConfigInter... has significant transaction times: one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitoring > Overview In fact, it’s responsible for 99.9% of the app server time, which means we’re getting closer to identifying the culprit of our spike. Here, we see the same spike from before, but the performance of the transaction is broken down into its components: one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitoring > Overview While the share of the response times for most components of this transaction remained stable, GetPlansController (in brown) spiked massively. From the Transaction traces table, we can drill further into the transaction trace to get method-level detail of where the issue is occurring. 6. Identify performance outliers in the database We identified that GetPlansController is consuming the vast majority of our response time. Here we see it in the transaction trace summary: one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitoring > Overview Trace details shows an execution timeline of this transaction, and we see that Plan Service is the external transaction causing the issues—the red color-coding indicates the problem. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitoring > Overview From this point, we can navigate to the Transactions summary page for Plan Service: one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitoring > Transactions The breakdown of the GetPlans transaction shows that database calls, particularly MySQL PlansTable select, appear to be a significant portion of the overall response time. The Breakdown table further identifies the problem: the number of database calls per transaction is very high. Note again that it’s highlighted in red. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitoring > Transactions Once again, we can look at a transaction trace to find what might be causing these queries. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitoring > Transactions Finally we find that an extremely large number of select methods account for the majority of transaction time. We can now take steps to address this potential N+1 query problem. After we remediate this issue, improved response times will lead to fewer frustrated requests and more satisfied customers—which will be reflected in this application's Apdex score. 7. Explore and Resolve Clusters of Errors When you need to track down what causes errors in your app, it may not be easy to identify the cause. Using applied intelligence developed by New Relic, APM Error Profiles automatically compare one set of events to another. An error profile is a collection of attributes with significantly different traits compared to non-errors. New Relic displays pie charts that sorts error attributes by the greatest deviation from the “norm.\" For backend errors, go to APM, select Error Analytics in the left nav, and then click on the Error Profile tab. In this example, the culprit is obviously a web transaction validating coupons, and now you can view the error stack trace, message, and the line of code from which the error was thrown. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Error Analytics > Error Profile As a quality customer experience increasingly relies on complex client-side logic, it’s important to quickly analyze and understand JavaScript errors. From one.newrelic.com, click Browser in the top header, and then click JS errors in left navigation menu. Expand the details about JavaScript errors by clicking on a attribute. In this case, we've expanded the transaction names that are related to the errors: one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > JS errors Roughly half of the errors come from phone.jsp, so that is the place to start investigating. Then determine if you can safely ignore the error, or if you should resolve the error with code edits and a new deployment, or provide communication about the issue to your customers. Now that you have dealt with performance outliers and clusters of errors, you are well on your way to optimizing your application so you can baseline it for trend analysis.",

      "body": "Successfully scaling DevOps requires a robust understanding of dependencies across application teams and related services. Use New Relics service maps to discover and mitigate risky dependencies from upstream and downstream services. Prerequisites This tutorial assumes you’ve completed the previous DevOps procedures. 1. Analyze dependencies with service maps Use service maps for each application and note any dependent systems and transactions. New Relic recommends that you start by viewing the entire architecture using the Discover your environment option. one.newrelic.com > Service Maps > App/Service list This initial view shows all applications that are configured in your account. Applications that have violated a warning threshold are shown in yellow, and those with an active alert are shown in red. Healthy applications appear in green. New Relic uses a bold line to map applications to the services (such as databases) they connect to. Familiarize yourself with these maps to see how applications and their services fit together. Take note of which applications have the most dependencies and which rely on the same dependency, such as an API. Click an application to see high level metrics about that app, including throughput, response time, Apdex score, and error rate for the last 30 minutes. Tracking throughput is a good way to determine which of your applications are serving the most traffic. After looking at the architecture as a whole, review the applications that have the most dependencies. Select the App/Services list to see a full list of your applications. one.newrelic.com > Service Maps > App/Service list In this example, we’ve chosen Tower-Chicago from the App/Services list. All of the traffic being sent to Tower-Chicago is coming from Proxy-East. In this case, Tower-Chicago is showing 48.3 requests per minute, or 11.3% of the 426 requests per minute flowing through Proxy-East. one.newrelic.com > Service Maps > App/Service list In most cases, the separate applications and services represented in service maps are created and maintained by separate teams. This exercise of walking through the dependencies of your architecture should involve representatives from each of those teams. Teams should work together to ask questions such as: How critical is this particular dependency? What would happen if it were to go down? What happened last time it went down? Was there a revenue loss? 2. Identify back-end application dependency risks Once you’ve analyzed your applications’ dependencies, you’ll want to examine the quality of dependency execution. For example, is the dependency stable and predictable for each application or transaction you’ve identified? To do this, you’ll first need to gather as much information as you can about the applications from New Relic Insights, which helps you analyze data that is collected about the applications in more detail. Here is an example NRQL query to further analyze back-end service performance: SELECT count(appName)/30 as 'Throughput', apdex(duration), average(duration), stddev(duration), max(duration), count(error_type), uniquecount(host) FROM Transaction FACET appName SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO Copy This query shows you each application’s request per minute (throughput), Apdex score, and an overview of how the application is performing overall (through the standard deviation calculation, in which lower numbers are generally better). It also shows errors for the time period and the number of hosts on which the application is running. insights.newrelic.com > query results Next, gather information on incidents and events related to the services from New Relic Alerts: Click Alerts > Incidents > All Incidents. alerts.newrelic.com > Incidents > All Incidents Click Alerts > Events > All Events. alerts.newrelic.com > Incidents > All Events Tip Using webhooks to send alert events to New Relic Insights, allows you to supplement your dashboards with Alerts data. The process is outlined in this community discussion post. Here is a simplified example of the results of this exercise: Application Number of dependencies RPM Hosts APDEX (avg) Last outage TTR (hrs) Routing Service 10 983 4 .93 2/19/18 .75 Tower Austin 1 58 1 .95 10/11/17 1.5 Proxy-East 11 498 4 .92 1/4/18 .25 Proxy-West 11 495 4 .97 12/3/17 .25 WebPortal 7 396 8 .98 4/1/18 2.5 Supplement this data with the data that your teams know about your service and that you gathered from the dependency exercise in step 1, and use that data to develop hypotheses about the highest risk areas in your services that should be mitigated. 3. Identify front-end dependency risk Once you’ve analyzed back-end dependencies, explore front-end dependencies. This is a critical step because as you walk higher up the stack and closer to the user, you will likely have more dependencies and abstractions. Service maps seamlessly integrate data from browser monitoring and mobile monitoring to help you understand the dependencies from front-end user interfaces to back-end services. one.newrelic.com > Service Maps Use the service map view to drill into front-end dependencies, and execute a similar exercise to the one you executed for back-end dependencies. This exercise will again expose data to help you identify risk areas you should address and optimize. We recommend that you conduct the analysis with user interface (UI) teams so that you can also gather a complementary qualitative understanding of what the UI teams consider critical based on their experience. A ranking from the UI teams of the most critical dependency is a useful output of this work. 4. Identify Microservice Dependencies If you are using microservices, you can have dozens, if not hundreds, of services that are calling each other. Use Distributed Tracing to see how all those services connect together and how your requests flow through those different services. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. A distributed trace is composed of multiple \"spans,\" which represent time spent in services or resources of those services. Click on the Distributed tracing menu in APM left nav. You can see “trace listing” view where you’ll be able to quickly identify slow traces and traces with errors. The scatter plot lets you easily see outliers. Below that are the trace summaries, click on a trace to see details. Dive into distributed traces to see how long each span takes. Click into each span to see historical performance charts and associated attributes that layer in the context you need to understand and troubleshoot issues. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Distributed tracing This rounds out your list of dependencies. 5. Create an action plan for risk mitigation Once you’ve analyzed the dependencies across your application from both front-end and back-end services, create an action plan to reduce dependency risks and achieve your service level objectives (SLO). As you prioritize these next steps, we recommend you keep these four principles in mind: Understand your risk tolerance. It’s helpful to have a clear picture of your tolerance for risk, which ideally should be informed by your service level objectives (refer to the Establish Objectives and Baselines tutorial for more information). Set an alert policy to monitor dependencies that you’ve determined have a high relationship to SLO achievement. Minimize dependencies. The simpler you keep your code, the less functions you'll have referring to other modules. Removing unnecessary complexity is an important way to ensure you have a maintainable system that meets your customers’ expectations. Localize dependencies. For the code you write, package together functions that depend on each other whenever possible. Stabilize dependencies. When dependencies are unavoidable, mitigate risks by ensuring these dependencies point to modules that are the least likely to change or are easier to substitute. When your action plan is complete, monitor the results of the efforts. The efficacy of your actions to resolve dependency risks should ultimately be measured by your SLOs",

      "body": "In a DevOps world, a deep understanding of customer expectations and your progress in meeting those expectations is vital to providing stability, maintaining goodwill with your users, and increasing business value. With New Relic you can measure the success of your DevOps initiatives and learn how to identify, resolve, and decrease any gaps in your DevOps performance. In this tutorial, you’ll gather key service delivery stakeholders to assess your team's progress against service level objectives (SLOs) and service level agreements (SLAs), while facilitating further optimizations. Prerequisites This tutorial assumes you’ve completed the Establish objectives and baseline tutorial. 1. Assemble a cross-functional team to review service delivery The first (and most important step) is assembling the right team. Identify the proper stakeholders and representatives to play active parts in the operations review process. This team should be comprised of individuals who develop applications, work with service delivery, maintain your ecosystem, and resolve problems for customers. While operations review teams often focus on technical members, the best teams have broad representation across the company, including representatives from Business Operations, Marketing, and Support. These cross-functional teams help ensure that the service delivery process is strongly integrated with customer expectations. If you can specifically identify how technical improvements meet customer expectations and positively impact the business’s bottom line, then your operations team is functioning at optimal levels. Tip Ideally, the cross-functional operations review team should also be the team that defines your SLOs. If this is not possible, try to ensure that some members of the operations review team are also on the team responsible for SLOs. 2. Review service records and note key metrics Create a regular meeting to track your service records. New Relic recommends reviewing your previous service records, and pinpointing specific metrics to analyze at every review. For example, start with application state, alert conditions, and runtime anomalies. Look at the same metrics on two separate occasions to identify and assess patterns, inconsistencies, and anomalies. Monitor these metrics using the service delivery Insights dashboards you created in the Establish objectives and baselines tutorial. The widgets on these dashboards provide a high-level overview of the relationships between different performance indicators and baselines: insights.newrelic.com > (select a dashboard): Use dashboards to visualize metrics related to service delivery. When conducting a thorough performance review, make several dashboards that have corresponding widgets. Use these dashboards to hone-in on two specific time periods that you want to compare. This comparative analysis could cover everything from Infrastructure or browser performance, to Synthetics testing or business impact. To get started with performance indicators in Insights, read the following example queries. These queries provide information that you can consider incorporating for the operations review. Daily uptime SELECT percentage(count(result), where result = 'SUCCESS') from SyntheticCheck since 1 Day ago Copy Create dashboards that are dedicated to the functionality that drives your software development process, such as testing. For example, collect related metrics on uptime, types of monitors, geo-locations, and other data points that are required for appropriately measuring SLAs. The following dashboard provides such an example: insights.newrelic.com > (select a dashboard): Track your relevant SLAs together in one dashboard. Device performance breakdown SELECT count(*) as '# Pages',average(duration) as 'AVG',percentile(duration,50,75) as '%',average(duration - backendDuration) as 'Front',average(backendDuration) as 'Back',average(connectionSetupDuration) as 'Connection',average(domProcessingDuration) as 'DOM Processing',average(pageRenderingDuration) as 'Page Rendering' FROM PageView FACET deviceType LIMIT 3 SINCE 1 day ago Copy Top URL performance SELECT count(*) as '# Pages',average(duration) as 'AVG',percentile(duration,50,75) as '%',average(duration - backendDuration) as 'Front',average(backendDuration) as 'Back',average(connectionSetupDuration) as 'Connection',average(domProcessingDuration) as 'DOM Processing',average(pageRenderingDuration) as 'Page Rendering' FROM PageView facet pageUrl SINCE 1 day ago limit 30 Copy Memory usage SELECT average(memoryUsedBytes) /1000000 AS 'Avg MB Used', average(memoryFreeBytes)/1000000 AS 'Avg MB Free', average(memoryFreeBytes/memoryTotalBytes)*100 as 'Memory used %' FROM SystemSample since 30 minutes ago Copy Server CPU SELECT average(cpuPercent) FROM SystemSample since 3 hours ago facet hostname limit 400 Copy Combine the results into a single dashboard to help drive decisions during your operations review. Dashboards that give a brief overview of performance across your entire application stack are invaluable for cross-functional team reviews. Tip Beyond Insights, the APM reports allow you to see how you’re performing on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis with built in SLA reports and other detailed reports. The out-of-the-box details from these reports give your operations team a launch pad for conversations about progress against objectives and overall performance. 3. Summarize events related to application alerts, downtime, and errors Now that you’ve gathered data about your service delivery, the next step is to dive deeper into specific incidents that warrant further investigation or surface a need for broader team action. For example, notable downtime and errors are key areas to investigate as a team. After completing the Setup proactive alerting tutorial, you can explore notifications of violations as they occur. Once these violations are brought to your attention, acknowledge the specific incident and have an ongoing record of both opened and closed incidents. Use the incident reports as a focal point for discussion of gaps. alerts.newrelic.com > Incidents: Identify performance issues and SLA gaps with New Relic Alerts incident reports. Ultimately, it’s important to solicit feedback from the cross-functional team on the causes of the incidents to determine how you can improve service delivery processes to prevent reoccurrences. One approach might be to focus on one or two notable incidents, use the New Relic UI to walk through the data points leading up to those incidents, and assess the actions that occurred. Summarize the incident and the cross-functional feedback on causes and potential solutions as succinctly as possible. Over time, you’ll notice patterns that will require deeper action.",

The goal is to provide your teams a predictable framework and process to: Maximize efficiency in communication and effort. Minimize the overall impact to your business. Prerequisites Before starting this tutorial, be sure to complete these New Relic tutorials: Establish team dashboards Set up proactive alerting 1. Assign first responders to team dashboards Recommendation: For each team dashboard, make sure: It has an owner who assumes responsibility for the health of the applications and features it monitors. There is no ambiguity about who is responsible for attending to and resolving an alert condition. This policy will vary between organizations depending on size, structure, and culture. For example, some teams may prefer to assign dashboards and alerts based on de-facto features or application ownership. Other teams may prefer to adopt an on-call rotation (often referred to as \"pager duty\"). In on-call rotations, designated team members handle all first-line incident responses, and they resolve or delegate responsibilities based on predetermined incident thresholds. 2. Determine incident thresholds for alert conditions For each of your applications: Identify the thresholds for what is officially considered an incident. As you create alert policies with New Relic Alerts, make sure each set of threshold criteria is context-dependent. Document incident evaluation and known remediation procedures in runbooks. Include links to your runbooks when you define conditions and thresholds for your alert policies. For instance, a certain alert condition may be dismissable during low-traffic periods but require active remediation during peak hours. 3. Ensure alerts have auditable notification channels Recommendation: Make sure that communications during critical incidents take place in easily accessible and highly visible channels. A group chat room dedicated to incident communication is usually a great choice. This allows all stakeholders to participate or observe and provides a chronology of notifications, key decisions, and actions for postmortem analysis. Use any of the available notification channels in New Relic Alerts. For example, to set up a notification channel in Slack: Make sure your organization has completed New Relic's integration requirements with Slack. In the Slack app, select the dropdown in the top-left corner of the app, and select Customize Slack. Click Configure apps. From the list of app integrations, select New Relic. Expand the instructions for New Relic Alerts, and follow the steps to configure notifications from New Relic. 4. Automate triage and resolution steps Automation of simple or repeatable incident response tasks will increase efficiency and minimize the impact of incidents. With proper automation in place, you can disable or isolate faulty application components as soon as an alert threshold is reached, rather than after a notification has been issued. For example, a team managing an application for a digital media company wants to be able to remove commenting abilities from the website if the system has errors. In this case, they could: Add an endpoint to their front-end web application that will toggle a feature flag enabling or disabling the UI components associated with posting comments on an article. Create an alert policy with a threshold set on the sustained error rate in the commenting service. Assign a webhook notification channel that will send a POST request to this endpoint, as well as to the standard team notification channels. In this scenario, errors in the commenting system will trigger the webhook and remove the commenting UI from the website. Users can still use core functionality of the site without seeing errors generated by the commenting service. The application will maintain a stable but degraded state, allowing the team to focus on recovery without the pressure of preventing users from accessing the site. You can also use webhooks to create issues and action items in ticketing systems that have REST APIs, such as Zendesk. Use New Relic Alerts to create a webhook notification channel, and customize the webhook payload as needed.",

      "body": "The term \"alerting\" often carries some negative connotations; for too many developers, alerting correlates too closely with errors, mistakes, and ongoing issues. However, for developers who are proactive about alerting, they know they don’t have to stare at their dashboards all day, because effective alerts will tell them when to check in. Well-defined alerts help you understand the health of your systems, so you can respond to performance problems before they affect your customers. Alerts can become overwhelming, so tune alerts and leverage AI so you get alerted on what matters. Prerequisites This tutorial assumes you have: Instrumented your applications in New Relic. Reviewed the tutorial Establish objectives and baselines before you begin this one. Optional: added custom attributes and events. 1. Define required alerting policies based on Service Level Objectives A service level objective (SLO) is an agreed upon means of measuring the performance of your service. The SLO defines a target value of a specified quantitative measure, which is called a service level indicator (SLI). Examples service level indicators could be average response time, response time percentile, and application availability. SLOs would then clarify a target value for those SLIs such as: Average response time should be less than 200 ms. 95% of requests should be completed within 250 ms. Availability of the service should be 99.99%. These SLOs can also be logically grouped together to provide an overall boolean indicator of whether the service is meeting expectations or not (for example, “95% of requests completed within 250 ms AND availability is 99.99%”), which can be helpful for alerting purposes. Use these SLIs as key performance indicators (KPIs) so your team and organization can measure your service and ensure it’s meeting customer expectations. By breaking down the quantitative performance metrics that are required of your services, you can then identify what kinds of alerts you should set for each. For instance, you could set an alert to notify you if web transaction times go above half a millisecond, or if the error rate goes higher than .20%. However, not every SLO needs to become an alert. A strong alert strategy takes SLOs and creates a set of simple, actionable alerts. New Relic often finds that our most mature DevOps customers set fewer alerts in general and focus those alerts on a core set of metrics that indicate when their customer experience is truly degraded. As a result, New Relic DevOps customers often use Apdex as part of their alerting strategy to align alerts with signs of degraded user satisfaction. As you design your alert strategy, keep this question in mind: “If the customer isn’t impacted, is it worth waking someone up?” For a simple framework of areas to set alerts for, use the following questions and advised metrics and KPIs: Questions Metrics and KPIs Are we open for business? Use Synthetic monitoring pings to determine if the site is up and scripted checks to determine that the most important capabilities (such as a checkout cart) are working. How's our underlying infrastructure? Set KPIs for key hardware, virtual hosts, containers, network, and storage components. How's the health of our application? Track metrics for JVM performance, queuing, caching, and similar dependencies. How’s the overall quality of our application? Use an Apdex score to quickly access an application’s quality. How are our customers doing? Consider real end-user metrics (browser or APM), synthetic users (Synthetics), and Apdex scores. How's our overall business doing? Focus on key transactions within an application, and tie that to expected business outcomes to illustrate correlation between your application and business performance. 2. Set specific alerts for performance, correctness, throughput, availability, and dependencies With New Relic you can set alerts on your instrumented applications, end-user experience, infrastructure, databases, and more. New Relic will alert you if your site’s availability dips or if your error rate spikes above acceptable levels, as defined by your SLOs. You can set warning thresholds to monitor issues that may be approaching a critical severity but don’t yet warrant a pager notification. Setting thresholds for when alerts should notify teams can be challenging. Thresholds that are too tight will create alert fatigue while thresholds that are too loose will lead to unhappy customers. Baseline alerts allow you to set dynamic thresholds for alerts based on historical performance. Use baselines to tune your alert to the right threshold. For example, an alert in APM can notify incident response teams if web transaction times deviate from historical performance for an allotted amount of time. alerts.newrelic.com > (select an alert policy) > (select an alert condition) > Define thresholds You can set this same kind of alert in browser to catch sub-optimal performance. In the following example, we’ve set both a warning and a violation for throughput: alerts.newrelic.com > (select an alert policy) > (select an alert condition) > Define thresholds As you develop smaller, independent services running on increasingly ephemeral architectures, your environments become significantly more complex. Visibility into outliers can be an important tool for understanding likely performance issues. You should set alerts to automatically fire when you have an outlier -- this can indicate misbehaving hosts, load balancers, or apps. For example, a load balancer divides web traffic approximately evenly across five different servers. You can set an alert based on a NRQL query, and notification to be sent if any server starts getting significantly more or less traffic than the other servers. Here’s the graph: alerts.newrelic.com > (select an alert policy) > (select an alert condition) > Define thresholds And here’s a sample NRQL query: SELECT average(cpuPercent) FROM SystemSample WHERE apmApplicationNames = 'MY-APP-NAME' FACET hostname Copy Now you have set static, baseline, and outlier alerts. This can provide a comprehensive awareness of your ecosystem. Refer to the New Relic Alerts documentation for more details about optimizing your alerts. 3. Identify groups to alert, and set broadcasting methods Alerting without the proper broadcasting methods leaves you vulnerable. Your alerts strategy should include a notification channel to ensure the appropriate teams are notified if your application or architecture encounters issues. New Relic has many notification integrations, but we recommend that you start simple and add more complexity later. We recommend that you first send alerts to a group chat channel (for example, using Slack). Evaluate these alerts in real time for several weeks to understand which alerts are indicative of important or problematic issues. These are the the types of alerts that warrant waking someone up. 4. Leverage AI to fine-tune alerts and seek anomalies To ensure you aren't training your teams to turn off or ignore notifications, keep your alerts valid and fresh. As you use New Relic to optimize your application and infrastructure performance, tighten your New Relic Alerts policy conditions to keep pace with your improved performance. To keep alerts to a minimum, leverage New Relic Applied Intelligence features, such as Incident Intelligence, which correlates related alerts into one actionable issue combining machine learning and manual input. Check to make sure alerts are correlated correctly and train your system to obtain the most accurate incident correlation. An additional way to reduce alert noise is by flapping detection and suppression. When an issue is \"flapping,\" it is cycling between an open and resolved state, creating a new alert every time it cycles. Effectively handling these can reduce the number of total alerts sent to your team. Finally, when you have maintenance scheduled, take advantage of alert muting rules to suppress those alerts you don't need. Now that you have tuned your alerts to valid notifications, you can proactively go after anomalies so you can fix issues before they become incidents. Enable Proactive Detection of anomalies and set some level of notification for them. 5. Create an alerts dashboard Be sure to check your alerts and confirm that they're firing regularly and are still relevant for your customer satisfaction metrics. Use the New Relic platform to create dashboards centered around alerts and incidents for the most common policy conditions and violations. insights.newrelic.com > All dashboards > (selected dashboard) Use NRQL to create your dashboards. For example, the dashboard above was created using the following NRQL queries: Incidents by condition: SELECT count(*) FROM ALERT_NAME WHERE current_state = 'open' FACET condition_name SINCE 1 week ago Copy Incidents by policy: SELECT count(*) FROM ALERT_NAME where current_state = 'open' FACET policy_name SINCE 60 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy Alert trends over time: SELECT count(*) FROM ALERT_NAME WHERE current_state IS NOT NULL FACET policy_name SINCE 1 week ago TIMESERIES Copy Incident details: SELECT timestamp, incident_id, policy_name, condition_name, details, severity FROM ALERT_NAME SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT 40 Copy Visualizing this data provides a resource you can share with others to refine the alerts and thresholds you’re using. For a more extensive discussion on notification channels, refer to the incident orchestration tutorial. Conclusion Establishing a focused alerts policy helps you pinpoint any degradation that could impact performance in your application or infrastructure. With proactive alerting, you will decrease user-reported incidents, and allow your teams to spend less time firefighting and more time deploying significant changes to your product.",

      "body": "In a DevOps world, a deep understanding of customer expectations and your progress in meeting those expectations is vital to providing stability, maintaining goodwill with your users, and increasing business value. With New Relic you can measure the success of your DevOps initiatives and learn how to identify, resolve, and decrease any gaps in your DevOps performance. In this tutorial, you’ll gather key service delivery stakeholders to assess your team's progress against service level objectives (SLOs) and service level agreements (SLAs), while facilitating further optimizations. Prerequisites This tutorial assumes you’ve completed the Establish objectives and baseline tutorial. 1. Assemble a cross-functional team to review service delivery The first (and most important step) is assembling the right team. Identify the proper stakeholders and representatives to play active parts in the operations review process. This team should be comprised of individuals who develop applications, work with service delivery, maintain your ecosystem, and resolve problems for customers. While operations review teams often focus on technical members, the best teams have broad representation across the company, including representatives from Business Operations, Marketing, and Support. These cross-functional teams help ensure that the service delivery process is strongly integrated with customer expectations. If you can specifically identify how technical improvements meet customer expectations and positively impact the business’s bottom line, then your operations team is functioning at optimal levels. Tip Ideally, the cross-functional operations review team should also be the team that defines your SLOs. If this is not possible, try to ensure that some members of the operations review team are also on the team responsible for SLOs. 2. Review service records and note key metrics Create a regular meeting to track your service records. New Relic recommends reviewing your previous service records, and pinpointing specific metrics to analyze at every review. For example, start with application state, alert conditions, and runtime anomalies. Look at the same metrics on two separate occasions to identify and assess patterns, inconsistencies, and anomalies. Monitor these metrics using the service delivery Insights dashboards you created in the Establish objectives and baselines tutorial. The widgets on these dashboards provide a high-level overview of the relationships between different performance indicators and baselines: insights.newrelic.com > (select a dashboard): Use dashboards to visualize metrics related to service delivery. When conducting a thorough performance review, make several dashboards that have corresponding widgets. Use these dashboards to hone-in on two specific time periods that you want to compare. This comparative analysis could cover everything from Infrastructure or browser performance, to Synthetics testing or business impact. To get started with performance indicators in Insights, read the following example queries. These queries provide information that you can consider incorporating for the operations review. Daily uptime SELECT percentage(count(result), where result = 'SUCCESS') from SyntheticCheck since 1 Day ago Copy Create dashboards that are dedicated to the functionality that drives your software development process, such as testing. For example, collect related metrics on uptime, types of monitors, geo-locations, and other data points that are required for appropriately measuring SLAs. The following dashboard provides such an example: insights.newrelic.com > (select a dashboard): Track your relevant SLAs together in one dashboard. Device performance breakdown SELECT count(*) as '# Pages',average(duration) as 'AVG',percentile(duration,50,75) as '%',average(duration - backendDuration) as 'Front',average(backendDuration) as 'Back',average(connectionSetupDuration) as 'Connection',average(domProcessingDuration) as 'DOM Processing',average(pageRenderingDuration) as 'Page Rendering' FROM PageView FACET deviceType LIMIT 3 SINCE 1 day ago Copy Top URL performance SELECT count(*) as '# Pages',average(duration) as 'AVG',percentile(duration,50,75) as '%',average(duration - backendDuration) as 'Front',average(backendDuration) as 'Back',average(connectionSetupDuration) as 'Connection',average(domProcessingDuration) as 'DOM Processing',average(pageRenderingDuration) as 'Page Rendering' FROM PageView facet pageUrl SINCE 1 day ago limit 30 Copy Memory usage SELECT average(memoryUsedBytes) /1000000 AS 'Avg MB Used', average(memoryFreeBytes)/1000000 AS 'Avg MB Free', average(memoryFreeBytes/memoryTotalBytes)*100 as 'Memory used %' FROM SystemSample since 30 minutes ago Copy Server CPU SELECT average(cpuPercent) FROM SystemSample since 3 hours ago facet hostname limit 400 Copy Combine the results into a single dashboard to help drive decisions during your operations review. Dashboards that give a brief overview of performance across your entire application stack are invaluable for cross-functional team reviews. Tip Beyond Insights, the APM reports allow you to see how you’re performing on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis with built in SLA reports and other detailed reports. The out-of-the-box details from these reports give your operations team a launch pad for conversations about progress against objectives and overall performance. 3. Summarize events related to application alerts, downtime, and errors Now that you’ve gathered data about your service delivery, the next step is to dive deeper into specific incidents that warrant further investigation or surface a need for broader team action. For example, notable downtime and errors are key areas to investigate as a team. After completing the Setup proactive alerting tutorial, you can explore notifications of violations as they occur. Once these violations are brought to your attention, acknowledge the specific incident and have an ongoing record of both opened and closed incidents. Use the incident reports as a focal point for discussion of gaps. alerts.newrelic.com > Incidents: Identify performance issues and SLA gaps with New Relic Alerts incident reports. Ultimately, it’s important to solicit feedback from the cross-functional team on the causes of the incidents to determine how you can improve service delivery processes to prevent reoccurrences. One approach might be to focus on one or two notable incidents, use the New Relic UI to walk through the data points leading up to those incidents, and assess the actions that occurred. Summarize the incident and the cross-functional feedback on causes and potential solutions as succinctly as possible. Over time, you’ll notice patterns that will require deeper action.",

      "body": "The term \"alerting\" often carries some negative connotations; for too many developers, alerting correlates too closely with errors, mistakes, and ongoing issues. However, for developers who are proactive about alerting, they know they don’t have to stare at their dashboards all day, because effective alerts will tell them when to check in. Well-defined alerts help you understand the health of your systems, so you can respond to performance problems before they affect your customers. Alerts can become overwhelming, so tune alerts and leverage AI so you get alerted on what matters. Prerequisites This tutorial assumes you have: Instrumented your applications in New Relic. Reviewed the tutorial Establish objectives and baselines before you begin this one. Optional: added custom attributes and events. 1. Define required alerting policies based on Service Level Objectives A service level objective (SLO) is an agreed upon means of measuring the performance of your service. The SLO defines a target value of a specified quantitative measure, which is called a service level indicator (SLI). Examples service level indicators could be average response time, response time percentile, and application availability. SLOs would then clarify a target value for those SLIs such as: Average response time should be less than 200 ms. 95% of requests should be completed within 250 ms. Availability of the service should be 99.99%. These SLOs can also be logically grouped together to provide an overall boolean indicator of whether the service is meeting expectations or not (for example, “95% of requests completed within 250 ms AND availability is 99.99%”), which can be helpful for alerting purposes. Use these SLIs as key performance indicators (KPIs) so your team and organization can measure your service and ensure it’s meeting customer expectations. By breaking down the quantitative performance metrics that are required of your services, you can then identify what kinds of alerts you should set for each. For instance, you could set an alert to notify you if web transaction times go above half a millisecond, or if the error rate goes higher than .20%. However, not every SLO needs to become an alert. A strong alert strategy takes SLOs and creates a set of simple, actionable alerts. New Relic often finds that our most mature DevOps customers set fewer alerts in general and focus those alerts on a core set of metrics that indicate when their customer experience is truly degraded. As a result, New Relic DevOps customers often use Apdex as part of their alerting strategy to align alerts with signs of degraded user satisfaction. As you design your alert strategy, keep this question in mind: “If the customer isn’t impacted, is it worth waking someone up?” For a simple framework of areas to set alerts for, use the following questions and advised metrics and KPIs: Questions Metrics and KPIs Are we open for business? Use Synthetic monitoring pings to determine if the site is up and scripted checks to determine that the most important capabilities (such as a checkout cart) are working. How's our underlying infrastructure? Set KPIs for key hardware, virtual hosts, containers, network, and storage components. How's the health of our application? Track metrics for JVM performance, queuing, caching, and similar dependencies. How’s the overall quality of our application? Use an Apdex score to quickly access an application’s quality. How are our customers doing? Consider real end-user metrics (browser or APM), synthetic users (Synthetics), and Apdex scores. How's our overall business doing? Focus on key transactions within an application, and tie that to expected business outcomes to illustrate correlation between your application and business performance. 2. Set specific alerts for performance, correctness, throughput, availability, and dependencies With New Relic you can set alerts on your instrumented applications, end-user experience, infrastructure, databases, and more. New Relic will alert you if your site’s availability dips or if your error rate spikes above acceptable levels, as defined by your SLOs. You can set warning thresholds to monitor issues that may be approaching a critical severity but don’t yet warrant a pager notification. Setting thresholds for when alerts should notify teams can be challenging. Thresholds that are too tight will create alert fatigue while thresholds that are too loose will lead to unhappy customers. Baseline alerts allow you to set dynamic thresholds for alerts based on historical performance. Use baselines to tune your alert to the right threshold. For example, an alert in APM can notify incident response teams if web transaction times deviate from historical performance for an allotted amount of time. alerts.newrelic.com > (select an alert policy) > (select an alert condition) > Define thresholds You can set this same kind of alert in browser to catch sub-optimal performance. In the following example, we’ve set both a warning and a violation for throughput: alerts.newrelic.com > (select an alert policy) > (select an alert condition) > Define thresholds As you develop smaller, independent services running on increasingly ephemeral architectures, your environments become significantly more complex. Visibility into outliers can be an important tool for understanding likely performance issues. You should set alerts to automatically fire when you have an outlier -- this can indicate misbehaving hosts, load balancers, or apps. For example, a load balancer divides web traffic approximately evenly across five different servers. You can set an alert based on a NRQL query, and notification to be sent if any server starts getting significantly more or less traffic than the other servers. Here’s the graph: alerts.newrelic.com > (select an alert policy) > (select an alert condition) > Define thresholds And here’s a sample NRQL query: SELECT average(cpuPercent) FROM SystemSample WHERE apmApplicationNames = 'MY-APP-NAME' FACET hostname Copy Now you have set static, baseline, and outlier alerts. This can provide a comprehensive awareness of your ecosystem. Refer to the New Relic Alerts documentation for more details about optimizing your alerts. 3. Identify groups to alert, and set broadcasting methods Alerting without the proper broadcasting methods leaves you vulnerable. Your alerts strategy should include a notification channel to ensure the appropriate teams are notified if your application or architecture encounters issues. New Relic has many notification integrations, but we recommend that you start simple and add more complexity later. We recommend that you first send alerts to a group chat channel (for example, using Slack). Evaluate these alerts in real time for several weeks to understand which alerts are indicative of important or problematic issues. These are the the types of alerts that warrant waking someone up. 4. Leverage AI to fine-tune alerts and seek anomalies To ensure you aren't training your teams to turn off or ignore notifications, keep your alerts valid and fresh. As you use New Relic to optimize your application and infrastructure performance, tighten your New Relic Alerts policy conditions to keep pace with your improved performance. To keep alerts to a minimum, leverage New Relic Applied Intelligence features, such as Incident Intelligence, which correlates related alerts into one actionable issue combining machine learning and manual input. Check to make sure alerts are correlated correctly and train your system to obtain the most accurate incident correlation. An additional way to reduce alert noise is by flapping detection and suppression. When an issue is \"flapping,\" it is cycling between an open and resolved state, creating a new alert every time it cycles. Effectively handling these can reduce the number of total alerts sent to your team. Finally, when you have maintenance scheduled, take advantage of alert muting rules to suppress those alerts you don't need. Now that you have tuned your alerts to valid notifications, you can proactively go after anomalies so you can fix issues before they become incidents. Enable Proactive Detection of anomalies and set some level of notification for them. 5. Create an alerts dashboard Be sure to check your alerts and confirm that they're firing regularly and are still relevant for your customer satisfaction metrics. Use the New Relic platform to create dashboards centered around alerts and incidents for the most common policy conditions and violations. insights.newrelic.com > All dashboards > (selected dashboard) Use NRQL to create your dashboards. For example, the dashboard above was created using the following NRQL queries: Incidents by condition: SELECT count(*) FROM ALERT_NAME WHERE current_state = 'open' FACET condition_name SINCE 1 week ago Copy Incidents by policy: SELECT count(*) FROM ALERT_NAME where current_state = 'open' FACET policy_name SINCE 60 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy Alert trends over time: SELECT count(*) FROM ALERT_NAME WHERE current_state IS NOT NULL FACET policy_name SINCE 1 week ago TIMESERIES Copy Incident details: SELECT timestamp, incident_id, policy_name, condition_name, details, severity FROM ALERT_NAME SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT 40 Copy Visualizing this data provides a resource you can share with others to refine the alerts and thresholds you’re using. For a more extensive discussion on notification channels, refer to the incident orchestration tutorial. Conclusion Establishing a focused alerts policy helps you pinpoint any degradation that could impact performance in your application or infrastructure. With proactive alerting, you will decrease user-reported incidents, and allow your teams to spend less time firefighting and more time deploying significant changes to your product.",

      "body": "In a DevOps world, a deep understanding of customer expectations and your progress in meeting those expectations is vital to providing stability, maintaining goodwill with your users, and increasing business value. With New Relic you can measure the success of your DevOps initiatives and learn how to identify, resolve, and decrease any gaps in your DevOps performance. In this tutorial, you’ll gather key service delivery stakeholders to assess your team's progress against service level objectives (SLOs) and service level agreements (SLAs), while facilitating further optimizations. Prerequisites This tutorial assumes you’ve completed the Establish objectives and baseline tutorial. 1. Assemble a cross-functional team to review service delivery The first (and most important step) is assembling the right team. Identify the proper stakeholders and representatives to play active parts in the operations review process. This team should be comprised of individuals who develop applications, work with service delivery, maintain your ecosystem, and resolve problems for customers. While operations review teams often focus on technical members, the best teams have broad representation across the company, including representatives from Business Operations, Marketing, and Support. These cross-functional teams help ensure that the service delivery process is strongly integrated with customer expectations. If you can specifically identify how technical improvements meet customer expectations and positively impact the business’s bottom line, then your operations team is functioning at optimal levels. Tip Ideally, the cross-functional operations review team should also be the team that defines your SLOs. If this is not possible, try to ensure that some members of the operations review team are also on the team responsible for SLOs. 2. Review service records and note key metrics Create a regular meeting to track your service records. New Relic recommends reviewing your previous service records, and pinpointing specific metrics to analyze at every review. For example, start with application state, alert conditions, and runtime anomalies. Look at the same metrics on two separate occasions to identify and assess patterns, inconsistencies, and anomalies. Monitor these metrics using the service delivery Insights dashboards you created in the Establish objectives and baselines tutorial. The widgets on these dashboards provide a high-level overview of the relationships between different performance indicators and baselines: insights.newrelic.com > (select a dashboard): Use dashboards to visualize metrics related to service delivery. When conducting a thorough performance review, make several dashboards that have corresponding widgets. Use these dashboards to hone-in on two specific time periods that you want to compare. This comparative analysis could cover everything from Infrastructure or browser performance, to Synthetics testing or business impact. To get started with performance indicators in Insights, read the following example queries. These queries provide information that you can consider incorporating for the operations review. Daily uptime SELECT percentage(count(result), where result = 'SUCCESS') from SyntheticCheck since 1 Day ago Copy Create dashboards that are dedicated to the functionality that drives your software development process, such as testing. For example, collect related metrics on uptime, types of monitors, geo-locations, and other data points that are required for appropriately measuring SLAs. The following dashboard provides such an example: insights.newrelic.com > (select a dashboard): Track your relevant SLAs together in one dashboard. Device performance breakdown SELECT count(*) as '# Pages',average(duration) as 'AVG',percentile(duration,50,75) as '%',average(duration - backendDuration) as 'Front',average(backendDuration) as 'Back',average(connectionSetupDuration) as 'Connection',average(domProcessingDuration) as 'DOM Processing',average(pageRenderingDuration) as 'Page Rendering' FROM PageView FACET deviceType LIMIT 3 SINCE 1 day ago Copy Top URL performance SELECT count(*) as '# Pages',average(duration) as 'AVG',percentile(duration,50,75) as '%',average(duration - backendDuration) as 'Front',average(backendDuration) as 'Back',average(connectionSetupDuration) as 'Connection',average(domProcessingDuration) as 'DOM Processing',average(pageRenderingDuration) as 'Page Rendering' FROM PageView facet pageUrl SINCE 1 day ago limit 30 Copy Memory usage SELECT average(memoryUsedBytes) /1000000 AS 'Avg MB Used', average(memoryFreeBytes)/1000000 AS 'Avg MB Free', average(memoryFreeBytes/memoryTotalBytes)*100 as 'Memory used %' FROM SystemSample since 30 minutes ago Copy Server CPU SELECT average(cpuPercent) FROM SystemSample since 3 hours ago facet hostname limit 400 Copy Combine the results into a single dashboard to help drive decisions during your operations review. Dashboards that give a brief overview of performance across your entire application stack are invaluable for cross-functional team reviews. Tip Beyond Insights, the APM reports allow you to see how you’re performing on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis with built in SLA reports and other detailed reports. The out-of-the-box details from these reports give your operations team a launch pad for conversations about progress against objectives and overall performance. 3. Summarize events related to application alerts, downtime, and errors Now that you’ve gathered data about your service delivery, the next step is to dive deeper into specific incidents that warrant further investigation or surface a need for broader team action. For example, notable downtime and errors are key areas to investigate as a team. After completing the Setup proactive alerting tutorial, you can explore notifications of violations as they occur. Once these violations are brought to your attention, acknowledge the specific incident and have an ongoing record of both opened and closed incidents. Use the incident reports as a focal point for discussion of gaps. alerts.newrelic.com > Incidents: Identify performance issues and SLA gaps with New Relic Alerts incident reports. Ultimately, it’s important to solicit feedback from the cross-functional team on the causes of the incidents to determine how you can improve service delivery processes to prevent reoccurrences. One approach might be to focus on one or two notable incidents, use the New Relic UI to walk through the data points leading up to those incidents, and assess the actions that occurred. Summarize the incident and the cross-functional feedback on causes and potential solutions as succinctly as possible. Over time, you’ll notice patterns that will require deeper action.",

      "body": "Incident orchestration is the alignment of teams, tools, and processes to prepare for incidents and outages in your software. The goal is to provide your teams a predictable framework and process to: Maximize efficiency in communication and effort. Minimize the overall impact to your business. Prerequisites Before starting this tutorial, be sure to complete these New Relic tutorials: Establish team dashboards Set up proactive alerting 1. Assign first responders to team dashboards Recommendation: For each team dashboard, make sure: It has an owner who assumes responsibility for the health of the applications and features it monitors. There is no ambiguity about who is responsible for attending to and resolving an alert condition. This policy will vary between organizations depending on size, structure, and culture. For example, some teams may prefer to assign dashboards and alerts based on de-facto features or application ownership. Other teams may prefer to adopt an on-call rotation (often referred to as \"pager duty\"). In on-call rotations, designated team members handle all first-line incident responses, and they resolve or delegate responsibilities based on predetermined incident thresholds. 2. Determine incident thresholds for alert conditions For each of your applications: Identify the thresholds for what is officially considered an incident. As you create alert policies with New Relic Alerts, make sure each set of threshold criteria is context-dependent. Document incident evaluation and known remediation procedures in runbooks. Include links to your runbooks when you define conditions and thresholds for your alert policies. For instance, a certain alert condition may be dismissable during low-traffic periods but require active remediation during peak hours. 3. Ensure alerts have auditable notification channels Recommendation: Make sure that communications during critical incidents take place in easily accessible and highly visible channels. A group chat room dedicated to incident communication is usually a great choice. This allows all stakeholders to participate or observe and provides a chronology of notifications, key decisions, and actions for postmortem analysis. Use any of the available notification channels in New Relic Alerts. For example, to set up a notification channel in Slack: Make sure your organization has completed New Relic's integration requirements with Slack. In the Slack app, select the dropdown in the top-left corner of the app, and select Customize Slack. Click Configure apps. From the list of app integrations, select New Relic. Expand the instructions for New Relic Alerts, and follow the steps to configure notifications from New Relic. 4. Automate triage and resolution steps Automation of simple or repeatable incident response tasks will increase efficiency and minimize the impact of incidents. With proper automation in place, you can disable or isolate faulty application components as soon as an alert threshold is reached, rather than after a notification has been issued. For example, a team managing an application for a digital media company wants to be able to remove commenting abilities from the website if the system has errors. In this case, they could: Add an endpoint to their front-end web application that will toggle a feature flag enabling or disabling the UI components associated with posting comments on an article. Create an alert policy with a threshold set on the sustained error rate in the commenting service. Assign a webhook notification channel that will send a POST request to this endpoint, as well as to the standard team notification channels. In this scenario, errors in the commenting system will trigger the webhook and remove the commenting UI from the website. Users can still use core functionality of the site without seeing errors generated by the commenting service. The application will maintain a stable but degraded state, allowing the team to focus on recovery without the pressure of preventing users from accessing the site. You can also use webhooks to create issues and action items in ticketing systems that have REST APIs, such as Zendesk. Use New Relic Alerts to create a webhook notification channel, and customize the webhook payload as needed.",

Well-defined alerts help you understand the health of your systems, so you can respond to performance problems before they affect your customers. Alerts can become overwhelming, so tune alerts and leverage AI so you get alerted on what matters. Prerequisites This tutorial assumes you have: Instrumented your applications in New Relic. Reviewed the tutorial Establish objectives and baselines before you begin this one. Optional: added custom attributes and events. 1. Define required alerting policies based on Service Level Objectives A service level objective (SLO) is an agreed upon means of measuring the performance of your service. The SLO defines a target value of a specified quantitative measure, which is called a service level indicator (SLI). Examples service level indicators could be average response time, response time percentile, and application availability. SLOs would then clarify a target value for those SLIs such as: Average response time should be less than 200 ms. 95% of requests should be completed within 250 ms. Availability of the service should be 99.99%. These SLOs can also be logically grouped together to provide an overall boolean indicator of whether the service is meeting expectations or not (for example, “95% of requests completed within 250 ms AND availability is 99.99%”), which can be helpful for alerting purposes. Use these SLIs as key performance indicators (KPIs) so your team and organization can measure your service and ensure it’s meeting customer expectations. By breaking down the quantitative performance metrics that are required of your services, you can then identify what kinds of alerts you should set for each. For instance, you could set an alert to notify you if web transaction times go above half a millisecond, or if the error rate goes higher than .20%. However, not every SLO needs to become an alert. A strong alert strategy takes SLOs and creates a set of simple, actionable alerts. New Relic often finds that our most mature DevOps customers set fewer alerts in general and focus those alerts on a core set of metrics that indicate when their customer experience is truly degraded. As a result, New Relic DevOps customers often use Apdex as part of their alerting strategy to align alerts with signs of degraded user satisfaction. As you design your alert strategy, keep this question in mind: “If the customer isn’t impacted, is it worth waking someone up?” For a simple framework of areas to set alerts for, use the following questions and advised metrics and KPIs: Questions Metrics and KPIs Are we open for business? Use Synthetic monitoring pings to determine if the site is up and scripted checks to determine that the most important capabilities (such as a checkout cart) are working. How's our underlying infrastructure? Set KPIs for key hardware, virtual hosts, containers, network, and storage components. How's the health of our application? Track metrics for JVM performance, queuing, caching, and similar dependencies. How’s the overall quality of our application? Use an Apdex score to quickly access an application’s quality. How are our customers doing? Consider real end-user metrics (browser or APM), synthetic users (Synthetics), and Apdex scores. How's our overall business doing? Focus on key transactions within an application, and tie that to expected business outcomes to illustrate correlation between your application and business performance. 2. Set specific alerts for performance, correctness, throughput, availability, and dependencies With New Relic you can set alerts on your instrumented applications, end-user experience, infrastructure, databases, and more. New Relic will alert you if your site’s availability dips or if your error rate spikes above acceptable levels, as defined by your SLOs. You can set warning thresholds to monitor issues that may be approaching a critical severity but don’t yet warrant a pager notification. Setting thresholds for when alerts should notify teams can be challenging. Thresholds that are too tight will create alert fatigue while thresholds that are too loose will lead to unhappy customers. Baseline alerts allow you to set dynamic thresholds for alerts based on historical performance. Use baselines to tune your alert to the right threshold. For example, an alert in APM can notify incident response teams if web transaction times deviate from historical performance for an allotted amount of time. alerts.newrelic.com > (select an alert policy) > (select an alert condition) > Define thresholds You can set this same kind of alert in browser to catch sub-optimal performance. In the following example, we’ve set both a warning and a violation for throughput: alerts.newrelic.com > (select an alert policy) > (select an alert condition) > Define thresholds As you develop smaller, independent services running on increasingly ephemeral architectures, your environments become significantly more complex. Visibility into outliers can be an important tool for understanding likely performance issues. You should set alerts to automatically fire when you have an outlier -- this can indicate misbehaving hosts, load balancers, or apps. For example, a load balancer divides web traffic approximately evenly across five different servers. You can set an alert based on a NRQL query, and notification to be sent if any server starts getting significantly more or less traffic than the other servers. Here’s the graph: alerts.newrelic.com > (select an alert policy) > (select an alert condition) > Define thresholds And here’s a sample NRQL query: SELECT average(cpuPercent) FROM SystemSample WHERE apmApplicationNames = 'MY-APP-NAME' FACET hostname Copy Now you have set static, baseline, and outlier alerts. This can provide a comprehensive awareness of your ecosystem. Refer to the New Relic Alerts documentation for more details about optimizing your alerts. 3. Identify groups to alert, and set broadcasting methods Alerting without the proper broadcasting methods leaves you vulnerable. Your alerts strategy should include a notification channel to ensure the appropriate teams are notified if your application or architecture encounters issues. New Relic has many notification integrations, but we recommend that you start simple and add more complexity later. We recommend that you first send alerts to a group chat channel (for example, using Slack). Evaluate these alerts in real time for several weeks to understand which alerts are indicative of important or problematic issues. These are the the types of alerts that warrant waking someone up. 4. Leverage AI to fine-tune alerts and seek anomalies To ensure you aren't training your teams to turn off or ignore notifications, keep your alerts valid and fresh. As you use New Relic to optimize your application and infrastructure performance, tighten your New Relic Alerts policy conditions to keep pace with your improved performance. To keep alerts to a minimum, leverage New Relic Applied Intelligence features, such as Incident Intelligence, which correlates related alerts into one actionable issue combining machine learning and manual input. Check to make sure alerts are correlated correctly and train your system to obtain the most accurate incident correlation. An additional way to reduce alert noise is by flapping detection and suppression. When an issue is \"flapping,\" it is cycling between an open and resolved state, creating a new alert every time it cycles. Effectively handling these can reduce the number of total alerts sent to your team. Finally, when you have maintenance scheduled, take advantage of alert muting rules to suppress those alerts you don't need. Now that you have tuned your alerts to valid notifications, you can proactively go after anomalies so you can fix issues before they become incidents. Enable Proactive Detection of anomalies and set some level of notification for them. 5. Create an alerts dashboard Be sure to check your alerts and confirm that they're firing regularly and are still relevant for your customer satisfaction metrics. Use the New Relic platform to create dashboards centered around alerts and incidents for the most common policy conditions and violations. insights.newrelic.com > All dashboards > (selected dashboard) Use NRQL to create your dashboards. For example, the dashboard above was created using the following NRQL queries: Incidents by condition: SELECT count(*) FROM ALERT_NAME WHERE current_state = 'open' FACET condition_name SINCE 1 week ago Copy Incidents by policy: SELECT count(*) FROM ALERT_NAME where current_state = 'open' FACET policy_name SINCE 60 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy Alert trends over time: SELECT count(*) FROM ALERT_NAME WHERE current_state IS NOT NULL FACET policy_name SINCE 1 week ago TIMESERIES Copy Incident details: SELECT timestamp, incident_id, policy_name, condition_name, details, severity FROM ALERT_NAME SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT 40 Copy Visualizing this data provides a resource you can share with others to refine the alerts and thresholds you’re using. For a more extensive discussion on notification channels, refer to the incident orchestration tutorial. Conclusion Establishing a focused alerts policy helps you pinpoint any degradation that could impact performance in your application or infrastructure. With proactive alerting, you will decrease user-reported incidents, and allow your teams to spend less time firefighting and more time deploying significant changes to your product.",

      "body": "The term alerting often carries some negative connotations: many developers correlate alerting with errors, mistakes, and ongoing issues. However, developers who are proactive about alerting, know they don't have to stare at dashboards all day because effective alerts tell them when to check in. Well-defined alerts help you understand the health of your systems, so you can respond to performance problems before they affect your customers. Further, a focused alerts policy helps you pinpoint any degradation that could impact performance in your application or environment. With proactive alerting, you'll decrease user-reported incidents, and your teams will spend less time firefighting and more time deploying significant changes to your product. After you define the right alerts, proper incident orchestration aligns your teams, tools, and processes to prepare for incidents and outages in your software. The goal is to provide your teams a predictable framework and process to: Maximize efficiency in communication and effort. Minimize the overall impact to your business. Prerequisites This tutorial assumes you have: Instrumented your applications in New Relic. Reviewed the Establish objectives and baselines tutorial. Optionally added custom attributes and events. 1. Define policies Define required alerting policies based on SLOs. A service level objective (SLO) is an agreed upon means of measuring the performance of your service. The SLO defines a target value of a specified quantitative measure, which is called a service level indicator (SLI). Examples of service level indicators could be average response time, response time percentile, and application availability. SLOs would then clarify a target value for those SLIs such as: Average response time should be less than 200 ms. 95% of requests should be completed within 250 ms. Availability of the service should be 99.99%. These SLOs can also be logically grouped together to provide an overall boolean indicator of whether the service is meeting expectations or not (for example, 95% of requests completed within 250 ms AND availability is 99.99%), which can be helpful for alerting purposes. Use these SLIs as key performance indicators (KPIs) so your team and organization can measure your service and ensure it's meeting customer expectations. By breaking down the quantitative performance metrics that are required of your services, you can then identify what kinds of alerts you should set for each. For instance, you could set an alert to notify you if web transaction times go above half a millisecond, or if the error rate goes higher than 0.20%. However, not every SLO needs to become an alert. A strong alerting strategy takes SLOs and creates a set of simple, actionable alerts. New Relic often finds that our most mature customers set fewer alerts in general and focus those alerts on a core set of metrics that indicate when their customer experience is truly degraded. As a result, New Relic customers often use Apdex as part of their alerting strategy to align alerts with signs of degraded user satisfaction. As you design your alerting strategy, keep this question in mind: “If the customer isn’t impacted, is it worth waking someone up?” Example questions and KPI solutions For a simple framework of areas to set alerts for, use the following questions and advised metrics and KPIs: Questions Metrics and KPIs Are we open for business? Use browser monitoring and APM to alert on site availability. How's our underlying infrastructure? Set KPIs for key hardware, network, and storage components. How's the health of our application? Track metrics for JVM performance, queuing, caching, and similar dependencies. How’s the overall quality of our application? Use an Apdex score to quickly access an application’s quality. How are our customers doing? Consider real end-user metrics (browser or APM), synthetic users (Synthetics), and Apdex scores. How's our overall business doing? Focus on key transactions within an application, and tie them to expected business outcomes to illustrate correlation between your application and business performance. 2. Set specific alerts Set specific alerts for performance, correctness, throughput, availability, and dependencies With New Relic you can set alerts on your instrumented applications, end-user experience, infrastructure, databases, and more. New Relic will alert you if your site's availability dips or if your error rate spikes above acceptable levels, as defined by your SLOs. You can set warning thresholds to monitor issues that may be approaching a critical severity but don't yet warrant a pager notification. Setting thresholds for when alerts should notify teams can be challenging. Thresholds that are too tight will create alert fatigue while thresholds that are too loose will lead to unhappy customers. Baseline alerts allow you to set dynamic thresholds for alerts based on historical performance. Use baselines to tune your alert to the right threshold. For example, an alert in APM can notify incident response teams if web transaction times deviate from historical performance for an allotted amount of time. alerts.newrelic.com > (selected alert policy) > (selected alert condition) > Define thresholds You can set this same kind of alert in browser to catch sub-optimal performance. In the following example, we've set both a warning and a violation for throughput: alerts.newrelic.com > (selected alert policy) > (selected alert condition) > Define thresholds As you develop smaller, independent services running on increasingly ephemeral architectures, your environments become significantly more complex. Visibility into outliers can be an important tool for understanding likely performance issues. You should set alerts to automatically fire when you have an outlier, which can indicate misbehaving hosts, load balancers, or apps. For example, a load balancer divides web traffic across five different servers. You can set an alert based on a NRQL query and receive a notification if any server starts getting significantly more or less traffic than the other servers. Here is an example chart: And here's a sample NRQL query: SELECT average(cpuPercent) FROM SystemSample WHERE apmApplicationNames = 'MY-APP-NAME' FACET hostname Copy Now you have set static, baseline, and outlier alerts. This can provide a comprehensive awareness of your ecosystem. Refer to the New Relic Alerts documentation for more details about optimizing your alerts. 3. Identify groups Identify groups to alert, set broadcasting methods, and assign first responders to team dashboards Alerting without the proper broadcasting methods leaves you vulnerable. Your alerting strategy should include a notification channel to ensure the appropriate teams are notified if your application or architecture encounters issues. New Relic has many notification integrations, but we recommend that you start simple and add more complexity later. We recommend that you first send alerts to a group chat channel (for example, using Slack or PagerDuty). Evaluate these alerts in real time for several weeks to understand which alerts are indicative of important or problematic issues. These are the types of alerts that warrant waking someone up. Recommendation: For each team dashboard, make sure: It has an owner who assumes responsibility for the health of the applications and features it monitors. There is no ambiguity about who is responsible for attending to and resolving an alert condition. This policy will vary between organizations depending on size, structure, and culture. For example, some teams may prefer to assign dashboards and alerts based on de-facto features or application ownership. Other teams may prefer to adopt an on-call rotation (often referred to as pager duty). In on-call rotations, designated team members handle all first-line incident responses, and they resolve or delegate responsibilities based on predetermined incident thresholds. 4. Determine thresholds Determine incident thresholds for alert conditions For each of your applications: Identify the thresholds for what is officially considered an incident. Make sure each set of threshold criteria is context-dependent. Document incident evaluation and known remediation procedures in runbooks. Include links to your runbooks when you define conditions and thresholds for your alert policies. For instance, a certain alert condition may be dismissable during low-traffic periods but require active remediation during peak hours. 5. Set notification channels Ensure alerts have auditable notification channels Make sure that communications during critical incidents take place in easily accessible and highly visible channels. A group chat room dedicated to incident communication is usually a great choice. This allows all stakeholders to participate or observe and provides a chronology of notifications, key decisions, and actions for postmortem analysis. Use any of the available notification channels in New Relic Alerts. For example, to set up a notification channel in Slack: Make sure your organization has completed New Relic's integration requirements with Slack. In the Slack app, select the dropdown in the top-left corner of the app, and select Customize Slack. Click Configure apps. From the list of app integrations, select New Relic. Expand the instructions for New Relic Alerts, and follow the steps to configure notifications from New Relic. 6. Automate resolution Automate triage and resolution steps Automation of simple or repeatable incident response tasks will increase efficiency and minimize the impact of incidents. With proper automation in place, you can disable or isolate faulty application components as soon as an alert threshold is reached, rather than after a notification has been issued. For example, a team managing an application for a digital media company wants to be able to remove commenting abilities from the website if the system has errors. In this case, they could: Add an endpoint to their front-end web application that will toggle a feature flag enabling or disabling the UI components associated with posting comments on an article. Create an alert policy with a threshold set on the sustained error rate in the commenting service. Assign a webhook notification channel that will send a POST request to this endpoint, as well as to the standard team notification channels. In this scenario, errors in the commenting system will trigger the webhook and remove the commenting UI from the website. Users can still use core functionality of the site without seeing errors generated by the commenting service. The application will maintain a stable but degraded state, allowing the team to focus on recovery without the pressure of preventing users from accessing the site. You can also use webhooks to create issues and action items in ticketing systems that have REST APIs, such as Zendesk. Use New Relic Alerts to create a webhook notification channel, and customize the webhook payload as needed. 7. Establish reviews Establish a post mortem process After the incident has been resolved, key stakeholders and participants must capture accurate and thorough documentation of the incident. At a minimum, we recommend that the retro documentation includes: A root cause analysis A chronology and summary of remediation steps and their result, whether they were successful or not A measure of the impact to the business in terms of user experience and financial losses, if possible Recommendations for system or feature improvements to prevent a recurrence Recommendations for process and communication improvements Store post mortem reports in a highly visible, searchable repository, such as a shared drive folder or wiki. Culturally, it's essential that this process focuses on constructive learning and improvement rather than punishment or blame. Example post mortem report Here is a brief example of a post mortem report: Post mortem Comments Date March 1, 2018 Executive summary From approximately 1:45PM until 2:30PM, users could not add items to their carts, which prevented any checkouts from occurring during the incident period. Root cause We determined that a change was made to the CSS rules on the product detail page that effectively disabled the Add to cart button. Timeline 1:50PM: Successful checkouts < 10 for 5 minutes alert triggered; assigned to Alice. 1:55PM: After reviewing the ecommerce team dashboard, Alice determined that the threshold was breached immediately following a deploy by Bob. She notified him of the incident. 2:00PM: Alice and Bob began troubleshooting. Attempts at recreating the issue in production were successful. 2:20PM: Bob determined that his change to the CSS on the product detail page disabled the Add to cart button. He deployed a hotfix. 2:30PM: Functionality was restored and the incident was resolved. Impact No checkouts were completed during the duration of the incident. Our typical revenue for a Thursday during this timeframe is $30,000. Recommendations We have been discussing implementing New Relic Synthetics for awhile now. If we had a Synthetic check on the checkout process, this issue would have been detected immediately. We should also implement more thorough unit tests in the front-end web app. 8. Fine-tune process Fine-tune alerts and thresholds As you use New Relic to optimize your application and infrastructure performance, tighten your New Relic Alerts policy conditions to keep pace with your improved performance. When rolling out new code or modifications that could negatively impact performance over a period of time, loosen your threshold conditions to allow for these short-term changes. For instance, we recommend using pre-established baselines and thresholds to increase efficiency during high-impact times for your business, such as annual events and major releases. Fine-tuning gives you the flexibility you need to increase efficiencies and extend your notification channels. As noted earlier, we recommend you start with a group chat service when you first establish notifications. Once you've identified other tools you'd like to integrate with, set up a notification channel to maintain your momentum. Tools such as xMatters and PagerDuty provide popular integrations, but don't overlook simple methods, such as webhooks. The goal is to continuously improve your alerting scheme. Be sure to check your alerts and confirm that they're firing regularly and are still relevant for your customer satisfaction metrics. Use the New Relic platform to create dashboards centered around alerts and incidents for the most common policy conditions and violations. insights.newrelic.com > All dashboards > (selected dashboard) Use the New Relic query language and the Insights query API to create your dashboards. The dashboard above was created using the following NRQL queries. It's recommended you recreate them as needed for your alerting dashboards. Incidents by condition: SELECT count(*) FROM ALERT_NAME WHERE current_state = 'open' FACET condition_name SINCE 1 week ago Copy Incidents by policy: SELECT count(*) FROM ALERT_NAME where current_state = 'open' FACET policy_name SINCE 60 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy Alert trends over time: SELECT count(*) FROM ALERT_NAME WHERE current_state IS NOT NULL FACET policy_name SINCE 1 week ago TIMESERIES Copy Incident details: SELECT timestamp, incident_id, policy_name, condition_name, details, severity FROM ALERT_NAME SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT 40 Copy Visualizing this data provides a resource you can share with others to refine the alerts and thresholds you're using. Expert tip In addition to instrumenting and measuring application and infrastructure metrics, mature DevOps organizations often measure and optimize the efficiency of incident response processes. For example, you can use webhooks to send alert events to New Relic Insights. This allows you to supplement your team dashboards with New Relic Alerts data.",

      "body": "In a monolithic application, a simple stack trace can contain enough diagnostic data to determine the root cause of a code defect. But cloud computing and microservices have blurred the lines between software and infrastructure; in modern architectures, requests are distributed across many smaller services—often with ephemeral lifespans—hosted in both on-premise and cloud environments. Spotting code defects becomes much more complex. APM's distributed tracing automatically helps teams troubleshoot such distributed systems. Distributed traces are just one component of a well-monitored system. You need a holistic view of your distributed system, especially when tracking the root cause of a defect, as there are volumes of data to evaluate and understand. When managing a microservices environment, it's critical that you have the capability to spot bottlenecks and problem spans quickly so that you don't compromise your mean-time-to-resolution (MTTR) or end-user experience. At New Relic, we understand these challenges inherently. In our journey, we've transitioned from a Ruby monolith to a multi-language distributed environment built on more than 300 microservices, for which we average 50 code deploys a day. Such challenges inform both how we've built and how we monitor New Relic. Use the New Relic platform to translate your data into relevant insights, so you can collaborate around a common framework to build context and quickly optimize and troubleshoot your complex, distributed systems. 1. Identify high-priority areas to monitor Distributed systems are complex. Before engaging with the New Relic platform, we recommend that you identify the most critical areas of your systems to observe, and focus on instrumenting those high-priority areas first. Google's SRE handbook suggests monitoring the \"four golden signals\": traffic, latency, errors, and saturation, as shown in the following dashboard: Dashboards: Visualize key areas to monitor with dashboards. Too often, teams monitor what is either 1) easy to measure or 2) interpretable. Avoid this fallacy. When making choices about what to monitor, involve product managers and other stakeholders from your organization. Your goal is to monitor what matters to your business, not to overload your teams with noise. 2. Instrument to get the visibility you require Once you've identified your key priorities, instrument the appropriate parts of your system with the New Relic platform. Monitor your web apps with APM. See compatibility and requirements for New Relic agents and products to learn precise compatibility details for each supported language and then install the APM agent on your application stack. Steps for installing APM agents vary based on language. Enable distributed tracing for APM, which will affect some existing APM features. If you're accustomed to using APM without distributed tracing, read the transition guide before you enable this feature. Monitor your compute resources with infrastructure. See compatibility and requirements for infrastructure monitoring for supported operating systems and environments. You can also instrument other products and services with on-host integrations. Monitor your front-end experience with mobile and browser. 3. Create dashboards Use dashboards to get an overview of your entire system and baseline performance, so you can better understand how the components work together. Insights provides a single framework for aligning disparate teams around relevant data. Approach this first build as your launching point, giving your teams something to react to as you begin to ascribe context to your system. You should continue to build and iterate your dashboards as you analyze, troubleshoot, and optimize your distributed system. Even after you have a basic understanding of your system, use dashboards to inform the decisions you make going forward. Dashboards provide central repository of truth, allowing all stakeholders to build context about the health of your system. Here is an example of a query that displays the slowest applications. SELECT percentile(duration, 99) as 'Slowest duration' FROM Transaction FACET name Copy Using this query you can focus on the slowest application to dig deeper: After running the query, dashboards displays the slowest durations. 4. Dig deeper with distributed tracing After you have basic instrumentation and contextual dashboards in place, you can begin to dig deeper to troubleshoot or optimize your system. A differentiated feature in New Relic One's Global Distributed Tracing is that you can come in with vague context for what you're investigating and search across all accounts and traces to get down to the actual user interactions that have those attributes somewhere in their trace. You no longer must begin with the application or specific entity to search for traces that include that application. For example, start with an analysis of your complex service calls, using the distributed tracing UI to: View a scatter plot chart showing the frequency, duration, and other facets of your distributed traces Group traces by root entry, service, service entry, or traces with errors View a trace list Filter specific traces to meet certain parameters You'll likely discover that you want to take the analysis one step further by annotating your traces with information that adds context to your troubleshooting, like User ID. You can do this in New Relic using custom attributes. one.newrelic.com > APM > Distributed tracing: use the distributed tracing UI to monitor and analyze modern distributed systems. 5. Annotate message queues with distributed tracing payload APIs To see connections between services in some environments—for example, in a system that relies heavily on queues—you may need to do some manual instrumentation using the distributed tracing payload APIs to ensure you're propagating the payload. This gives agents the necessary context to create spans with the right correlation; you'll see end-to-end traces for all linked services, including those that cross through the queue. Example annotated message queue For example: Start a transaction. Create the distributed tracing payload on the producer service within a New Relic transaction. As part of the message, add the distributed tracing payload. ​​newrelic.setTransactionName(\"Send Message\") // Create SQS service object var sqs = new AWS.SQS({apiVersion: '2012-11-05'}); var transactionHandle = newrelic.getTransaction(); var payload = transactionHandle.createDistributedTracePayload(); var jsonPayload = payload.text(); //add the jsonPayload as a MessageAttribute var params = { DelaySeconds: 10, MessageAttributes: { \"Testing\": { DataType: \"String\", StringValue: \"123\" }, \"TraceContext\": { DataType: \"String\", StringValue: jsonPayload } }, MessageBody: \"Testing 123\", QueueUrl: \"https://sqs.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/408155283954/sqs-testing\" }; Copy With the context of a transaction, receive the payload on the consumer service. sqs.receiveMessage(params, function(err, data) { if (err) { console.log(\"Receive Error\", err); } else if (data && data.Messages) { console.log(\"trace context:\") var traceContext = data.Messages[0].MessageAttributes.TraceContext.StringValue; if (traceContext != \"\") { var transactionHandle = newrelic.getTransaction(); transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTracePayload(traceContext); } Copy 6. Annotate and tag traces with custom attributes We recommend that you use custom attributes to decorate events with additional information for better tracing. For example, by adding key-value pairs, you can attach a user ID to trace a specific user through the call stack and review failing requests to determine if that user is having an unusually poor experience. We recommend adding custom attributes based on your use case; for example, if your instrumenting an order management system, you could add an order number custom attribute to your traces. To add custom attributes, you must first enable them for your agent, and then make an API call to record the attribute. Tip For more agent-specific information on collecting custom attributes, see Collect custom attributes sqs.sendMessage(params, function(err, data) { if (err) { res.send(\"Error: \"+ err); } else { res.send(\"Success! Message ID: \"+ data.MessageId); newrelic.addCustomAttribute(\"Message ID\", data.MessageId) } }); Copy 7. Leverage Synthetics to get a high-level view of system health In complex, distributed systems, you need to track and monitor many signals. Sometimes it may be that no one signal is concerning, yet your whole system is behaving anomalously. To get a complete picture, it's critical to analyze symptomatic data in tandem with system-level data. Synthetics allows you to interact with the entire system as an external user would, giving your teams high-level checks for performance and user experience. These external checks help you understand if the entire system is doing what you want regardless of what specific signals may indicate.",

      "body": "Proper instrumentation gives teams full visibility into the impact of the changes they make in a system. Capturing tangible, measurable metrics from before and after each change allows teams to optimize changes in isolation and reduce the impact to other work happening in the system. Prerequisite Before starting this tutorial, complete the Establish objectives and baselines. 1. Integrate measurements into your development process With appropriate measurements incorporated into all phases of your development cycle, you can surface errors and performance issues before your customers uncover them. As your application teams plan their work, use your KPI dashboards in daily stand-ups and other planning meetings to analyze necessary debugging work, assess whether recent deployments were successful, and prioritize other work efforts. When development and operations teams use dashboards during planning and discussions, they ensure that they're consistently incorporating feedback about customer experiences and reliability risks into their development efforts. For proper testing, ensure that instrumentation in your pre-production environments is in parity with your production environments. Use dashboards to compare the environments and verify that the code and infrastructure changes you make across them are correct, and eliminate any anomalies before pushing code to production. Beyond using instrumentation to measure software performance, also use it to analyze team efficiency. For example, with your alerts data, use NRQL and external integrations to calculate mean time to repair (MTTR) by subtracting the difference in event timestamps as the current state of each event changes from OPEN to ACKNOWLEDGED to CLOSED. Or push events into Insights from a source code management (SCM) system like GitHub, and calculate the amount of time it takes a code change to go live by comparing the timestamp of a commit event to that of a deploy event. Plotted over time, this could become a KPI in a DevOps transformation. 2. Add automated deployment markers It's important to track deployments and the impact code and infrastructure changes have on your end-user experience. Using deployment markers in APM, you can record deployments for each application. A deployment marker is an event indicating that a deployment happened, and it's paired with metadata available from your SCM system (for example, the user, revision, or change-log). APM displays a vertical line, or “marker,” on charts and graphs at the deployment event's timestamp. When you hover over the line, APM displays the associated metadata for that deployment. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitoring > Overview APM also provides a chronological list of deployments of your application. Additional metrics, such as error rate and Apdex from the time of the deployment, are available as well. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Events > Deployments Tracking deployments is a valuable way to determine the root cause of immediate, long-term, or gradual degradations in your application. New Relic recommends that you make POST requests to the New Relic REST API as the final step of a successful CI/CD deployment as described in the API documentation. The following tools have integrations or plugins available to help automate this: Chef (see newrelic_deployment) Jenkins Ansible Puppet 3. Test your pipeline with Infrastructure An important part of optimizing your cloud native environment is a making a cultural shift toward smaller, more frequent changes to your code and infrastructure. After you complete the first two steps of this tutorial, begin to test and gather appropriate performance insights about your deployment pipeline to more clearly understand the impact of the changes you make. Code changes should be as small as possible in terms of the number of lines of code and source files you change. Changes should also involve as few team members as possible. This makes it much easier to identify issue owners and determine root causes if errors occur. Similarly, infrastructure changes should also have as small a footprint as possible to minimize the number of applications affected by each change. New Relic Infrastructure helps you see when an infrastructure change has caused a spike in issues, as shown in the following example: one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Hosts For cloud infrastructure changes or larger code changes, consider using a blue/green deployment strategy. APM supports multiple app names, which is a good fit for this model. To implement this strategy: Deploy a version of your application to existing infrastructure using a rollup app name that signifies it as the “blue” version (or control version). Deploy a new version of your application to a subset of the infrastructure (or an alternate set of infrastructure) with a rollup name that signifies this as the “green” version (or experimental version). Ensure that traffic is routed appropriately between both versions. Compare established KPI dashboards of both versions against one another. Optimize the new version accordingly to meet your KPI targets. When you're satisfied with the application's performance, deploy the new version across your infrastructure using the original app name, and consider this the new baseline for any future changes you'll make to the application.",

      "body": "In a DevOps world, a deep understanding of customer expectations and your progress in meeting those expectations is vital to providing stability, maintaining goodwill with your users, and increasing business value. With New Relic you can measure the success of your DevOps initiatives and learn how to identify, resolve, and decrease any gaps in your DevOps performance. In this tutorial, you’ll gather key service delivery stakeholders to assess your team's progress against service level objectives (SLOs) and service level agreements (SLAs), while facilitating further optimizations. Prerequisites This tutorial assumes you’ve completed the Establish objectives and baseline tutorial. 1. Assemble a cross-functional team to review service delivery The first (and most important step) is assembling the right team. Identify the proper stakeholders and representatives to play active parts in the operations review process. This team should be comprised of individuals who develop applications, work with service delivery, maintain your ecosystem, and resolve problems for customers. While operations review teams often focus on technical members, the best teams have broad representation across the company, including representatives from Business Operations, Marketing, and Support. These cross-functional teams help ensure that the service delivery process is strongly integrated with customer expectations. If you can specifically identify how technical improvements meet customer expectations and positively impact the business’s bottom line, then your operations team is functioning at optimal levels. Tip Ideally, the cross-functional operations review team should also be the team that defines your SLOs. If this is not possible, try to ensure that some members of the operations review team are also on the team responsible for SLOs. 2. Review service records and note key metrics Create a regular meeting to track your service records. New Relic recommends reviewing your previous service records, and pinpointing specific metrics to analyze at every review. For example, start with application state, alert conditions, and runtime anomalies. Look at the same metrics on two separate occasions to identify and assess patterns, inconsistencies, and anomalies. Monitor these metrics using the service delivery Insights dashboards you created in the Establish objectives and baselines tutorial. The widgets on these dashboards provide a high-level overview of the relationships between different performance indicators and baselines: insights.newrelic.com > (select a dashboard): Use dashboards to visualize metrics related to service delivery. When conducting a thorough performance review, make several dashboards that have corresponding widgets. Use these dashboards to hone-in on two specific time periods that you want to compare. This comparative analysis could cover everything from Infrastructure or browser performance, to Synthetics testing or business impact. To get started with performance indicators in Insights, read the following example queries. These queries provide information that you can consider incorporating for the operations review. Daily uptime SELECT percentage(count(result), where result = 'SUCCESS') from SyntheticCheck since 1 Day ago Copy Create dashboards that are dedicated to the functionality that drives your software development process, such as testing. For example, collect related metrics on uptime, types of monitors, geo-locations, and other data points that are required for appropriately measuring SLAs. The following dashboard provides such an example: insights.newrelic.com > (select a dashboard): Track your relevant SLAs together in one dashboard. Device performance breakdown SELECT count(*) as '# Pages',average(duration) as 'AVG',percentile(duration,50,75) as '%',average(duration - backendDuration) as 'Front',average(backendDuration) as 'Back',average(connectionSetupDuration) as 'Connection',average(domProcessingDuration) as 'DOM Processing',average(pageRenderingDuration) as 'Page Rendering' FROM PageView FACET deviceType LIMIT 3 SINCE 1 day ago Copy Top URL performance SELECT count(*) as '# Pages',average(duration) as 'AVG',percentile(duration,50,75) as '%',average(duration - backendDuration) as 'Front',average(backendDuration) as 'Back',average(connectionSetupDuration) as 'Connection',average(domProcessingDuration) as 'DOM Processing',average(pageRenderingDuration) as 'Page Rendering' FROM PageView facet pageUrl SINCE 1 day ago limit 30 Copy Memory usage SELECT average(memoryUsedBytes) /1000000 AS 'Avg MB Used', average(memoryFreeBytes)/1000000 AS 'Avg MB Free', average(memoryFreeBytes/memoryTotalBytes)*100 as 'Memory used %' FROM SystemSample since 30 minutes ago Copy Server CPU SELECT average(cpuPercent) FROM SystemSample since 3 hours ago facet hostname limit 400 Copy Combine the results into a single dashboard to help drive decisions during your operations review. Dashboards that give a brief overview of performance across your entire application stack are invaluable for cross-functional team reviews. Tip Beyond Insights, the APM reports allow you to see how you’re performing on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis with built in SLA reports and other detailed reports. The out-of-the-box details from these reports give your operations team a launch pad for conversations about progress against objectives and overall performance. 3. Summarize events related to application alerts, downtime, and errors Now that you’ve gathered data about your service delivery, the next step is to dive deeper into specific incidents that warrant further investigation or surface a need for broader team action. For example, notable downtime and errors are key areas to investigate as a team. After completing the Setup proactive alerting tutorial, you can explore notifications of violations as they occur. Once these violations are brought to your attention, acknowledge the specific incident and have an ongoing record of both opened and closed incidents. Use the incident reports as a focal point for discussion of gaps. alerts.newrelic.com > Incidents: Identify performance issues and SLA gaps with New Relic Alerts incident reports. Ultimately, it’s important to solicit feedback from the cross-functional team on the causes of the incidents to determine how you can improve service delivery processes to prevent reoccurrences. One approach might be to focus on one or two notable incidents, use the New Relic UI to walk through the data points leading up to those incidents, and assess the actions that occurred. Summarize the incident and the cross-functional feedback on causes and potential solutions as succinctly as possible. Over time, you’ll notice patterns that will require deeper action.",

      "body": "Incident orchestration is the alignment of teams, tools, and processes to prepare for incidents and outages in your software. The goal is to provide your teams a predictable framework and process to: Maximize efficiency in communication and effort. Minimize the overall impact to your business. Prerequisites Before starting this tutorial, be sure to complete these New Relic tutorials: Establish team dashboards Set up proactive alerting 1. Assign first responders to team dashboards Recommendation: For each team dashboard, make sure: It has an owner who assumes responsibility for the health of the applications and features it monitors. There is no ambiguity about who is responsible for attending to and resolving an alert condition. This policy will vary between organizations depending on size, structure, and culture. For example, some teams may prefer to assign dashboards and alerts based on de-facto features or application ownership. Other teams may prefer to adopt an on-call rotation (often referred to as \"pager duty\"). In on-call rotations, designated team members handle all first-line incident responses, and they resolve or delegate responsibilities based on predetermined incident thresholds. 2. Determine incident thresholds for alert conditions For each of your applications: Identify the thresholds for what is officially considered an incident. As you create alert policies with New Relic Alerts, make sure each set of threshold criteria is context-dependent. Document incident evaluation and known remediation procedures in runbooks. Include links to your runbooks when you define conditions and thresholds for your alert policies. For instance, a certain alert condition may be dismissable during low-traffic periods but require active remediation during peak hours. 3. Ensure alerts have auditable notification channels Recommendation: Make sure that communications during critical incidents take place in easily accessible and highly visible channels. A group chat room dedicated to incident communication is usually a great choice. This allows all stakeholders to participate or observe and provides a chronology of notifications, key decisions, and actions for postmortem analysis. Use any of the available notification channels in New Relic Alerts. For example, to set up a notification channel in Slack: Make sure your organization has completed New Relic's integration requirements with Slack. In the Slack app, select the dropdown in the top-left corner of the app, and select Customize Slack. Click Configure apps. From the list of app integrations, select New Relic. Expand the instructions for New Relic Alerts, and follow the steps to configure notifications from New Relic. 4. Automate triage and resolution steps Automation of simple or repeatable incident response tasks will increase efficiency and minimize the impact of incidents. With proper automation in place, you can disable or isolate faulty application components as soon as an alert threshold is reached, rather than after a notification has been issued. For example, a team managing an application for a digital media company wants to be able to remove commenting abilities from the website if the system has errors. In this case, they could: Add an endpoint to their front-end web application that will toggle a feature flag enabling or disabling the UI components associated with posting comments on an article. Create an alert policy with a threshold set on the sustained error rate in the commenting service. Assign a webhook notification channel that will send a POST request to this endpoint, as well as to the standard team notification channels. In this scenario, errors in the commenting system will trigger the webhook and remove the commenting UI from the website. Users can still use core functionality of the site without seeing errors generated by the commenting service. The application will maintain a stable but degraded state, allowing the team to focus on recovery without the pressure of preventing users from accessing the site. You can also use webhooks to create issues and action items in ticketing systems that have REST APIs, such as Zendesk. Use New Relic Alerts to create a webhook notification channel, and customize the webhook payload as needed.",

      "body": "The term \"alerting\" often carries some negative connotations; for too many developers, alerting correlates too closely with errors, mistakes, and ongoing issues. However, for developers who are proactive about alerting, they know they don’t have to stare at their dashboards all day, because effective alerts will tell them when to check in. Well-defined alerts help you understand the health of your systems, so you can respond to performance problems before they affect your customers. Alerts can become overwhelming, so tune alerts and leverage AI so you get alerted on what matters. Prerequisites This tutorial assumes you have: Instrumented your applications in New Relic. Reviewed the tutorial Establish objectives and baselines before you begin this one. Optional: added custom attributes and events. 1. Define required alerting policies based on Service Level Objectives A service level objective (SLO) is an agreed upon means of measuring the performance of your service. The SLO defines a target value of a specified quantitative measure, which is called a service level indicator (SLI). Examples service level indicators could be average response time, response time percentile, and application availability. SLOs would then clarify a target value for those SLIs such as: Average response time should be less than 200 ms. 95% of requests should be completed within 250 ms. Availability of the service should be 99.99%. These SLOs can also be logically grouped together to provide an overall boolean indicator of whether the service is meeting expectations or not (for example, “95% of requests completed within 250 ms AND availability is 99.99%”), which can be helpful for alerting purposes. Use these SLIs as key performance indicators (KPIs) so your team and organization can measure your service and ensure it’s meeting customer expectations. By breaking down the quantitative performance metrics that are required of your services, you can then identify what kinds of alerts you should set for each. For instance, you could set an alert to notify you if web transaction times go above half a millisecond, or if the error rate goes higher than .20%. However, not every SLO needs to become an alert. A strong alert strategy takes SLOs and creates a set of simple, actionable alerts. New Relic often finds that our most mature DevOps customers set fewer alerts in general and focus those alerts on a core set of metrics that indicate when their customer experience is truly degraded. As a result, New Relic DevOps customers often use Apdex as part of their alerting strategy to align alerts with signs of degraded user satisfaction. As you design your alert strategy, keep this question in mind: “If the customer isn’t impacted, is it worth waking someone up?” For a simple framework of areas to set alerts for, use the following questions and advised metrics and KPIs: Questions Metrics and KPIs Are we open for business? Use Synthetic monitoring pings to determine if the site is up and scripted checks to determine that the most important capabilities (such as a checkout cart) are working. How's our underlying infrastructure? Set KPIs for key hardware, virtual hosts, containers, network, and storage components. How's the health of our application? Track metrics for JVM performance, queuing, caching, and similar dependencies. How’s the overall quality of our application? Use an Apdex score to quickly access an application’s quality. How are our customers doing? Consider real end-user metrics (browser or APM), synthetic users (Synthetics), and Apdex scores. How's our overall business doing? Focus on key transactions within an application, and tie that to expected business outcomes to illustrate correlation between your application and business performance. 2. Set specific alerts for performance, correctness, throughput, availability, and dependencies With New Relic you can set alerts on your instrumented applications, end-user experience, infrastructure, databases, and more. New Relic will alert you if your site’s availability dips or if your error rate spikes above acceptable levels, as defined by your SLOs. You can set warning thresholds to monitor issues that may be approaching a critical severity but don’t yet warrant a pager notification. Setting thresholds for when alerts should notify teams can be challenging. Thresholds that are too tight will create alert fatigue while thresholds that are too loose will lead to unhappy customers. Baseline alerts allow you to set dynamic thresholds for alerts based on historical performance. Use baselines to tune your alert to the right threshold. For example, an alert in APM can notify incident response teams if web transaction times deviate from historical performance for an allotted amount of time. alerts.newrelic.com > (select an alert policy) > (select an alert condition) > Define thresholds You can set this same kind of alert in browser to catch sub-optimal performance. In the following example, we’ve set both a warning and a violation for throughput: alerts.newrelic.com > (select an alert policy) > (select an alert condition) > Define thresholds As you develop smaller, independent services running on increasingly ephemeral architectures, your environments become significantly more complex. Visibility into outliers can be an important tool for understanding likely performance issues. You should set alerts to automatically fire when you have an outlier -- this can indicate misbehaving hosts, load balancers, or apps. For example, a load balancer divides web traffic approximately evenly across five different servers. You can set an alert based on a NRQL query, and notification to be sent if any server starts getting significantly more or less traffic than the other servers. Here’s the graph: alerts.newrelic.com > (select an alert policy) > (select an alert condition) > Define thresholds And here’s a sample NRQL query: SELECT average(cpuPercent) FROM SystemSample WHERE apmApplicationNames = 'MY-APP-NAME' FACET hostname Copy Now you have set static, baseline, and outlier alerts. This can provide a comprehensive awareness of your ecosystem. Refer to the New Relic Alerts documentation for more details about optimizing your alerts. 3. Identify groups to alert, and set broadcasting methods Alerting without the proper broadcasting methods leaves you vulnerable. Your alerts strategy should include a notification channel to ensure the appropriate teams are notified if your application or architecture encounters issues. New Relic has many notification integrations, but we recommend that you start simple and add more complexity later. We recommend that you first send alerts to a group chat channel (for example, using Slack). Evaluate these alerts in real time for several weeks to understand which alerts are indicative of important or problematic issues. These are the the types of alerts that warrant waking someone up. 4. Leverage AI to fine-tune alerts and seek anomalies To ensure you aren't training your teams to turn off or ignore notifications, keep your alerts valid and fresh. As you use New Relic to optimize your application and infrastructure performance, tighten your New Relic Alerts policy conditions to keep pace with your improved performance. To keep alerts to a minimum, leverage New Relic Applied Intelligence features, such as Incident Intelligence, which correlates related alerts into one actionable issue combining machine learning and manual input. Check to make sure alerts are correlated correctly and train your system to obtain the most accurate incident correlation. An additional way to reduce alert noise is by flapping detection and suppression. When an issue is \"flapping,\" it is cycling between an open and resolved state, creating a new alert every time it cycles. Effectively handling these can reduce the number of total alerts sent to your team. Finally, when you have maintenance scheduled, take advantage of alert muting rules to suppress those alerts you don't need. Now that you have tuned your alerts to valid notifications, you can proactively go after anomalies so you can fix issues before they become incidents. Enable Proactive Detection of anomalies and set some level of notification for them. 5. Create an alerts dashboard Be sure to check your alerts and confirm that they're firing regularly and are still relevant for your customer satisfaction metrics. Use the New Relic platform to create dashboards centered around alerts and incidents for the most common policy conditions and violations. insights.newrelic.com > All dashboards > (selected dashboard) Use NRQL to create your dashboards. For example, the dashboard above was created using the following NRQL queries: Incidents by condition: SELECT count(*) FROM ALERT_NAME WHERE current_state = 'open' FACET condition_name SINCE 1 week ago Copy Incidents by policy: SELECT count(*) FROM ALERT_NAME where current_state = 'open' FACET policy_name SINCE 60 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy Alert trends over time: SELECT count(*) FROM ALERT_NAME WHERE current_state IS NOT NULL FACET policy_name SINCE 1 week ago TIMESERIES Copy Incident details: SELECT timestamp, incident_id, policy_name, condition_name, details, severity FROM ALERT_NAME SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT 40 Copy Visualizing this data provides a resource you can share with others to refine the alerts and thresholds you’re using. For a more extensive discussion on notification channels, refer to the incident orchestration tutorial. Conclusion Establishing a focused alerts policy helps you pinpoint any degradation that could impact performance in your application or infrastructure. With proactive alerting, you will decrease user-reported incidents, and allow your teams to spend less time firefighting and more time deploying significant changes to your product.",

      "body": "In a DevOps world, a deep understanding of customer expectations and your progress in meeting those expectations is vital to providing stability, maintaining goodwill with your users, and increasing business value. With New Relic you can measure the success of your DevOps initiatives and learn how to identify, resolve, and decrease any gaps in your DevOps performance. In this tutorial, you’ll gather key service delivery stakeholders to assess your team's progress against service level objectives (SLOs) and service level agreements (SLAs), while facilitating further optimizations. Prerequisites This tutorial assumes you’ve completed the Establish objectives and baseline tutorial. 1. Assemble a cross-functional team to review service delivery The first (and most important step) is assembling the right team. Identify the proper stakeholders and representatives to play active parts in the operations review process. This team should be comprised of individuals who develop applications, work with service delivery, maintain your ecosystem, and resolve problems for customers. While operations review teams often focus on technical members, the best teams have broad representation across the company, including representatives from Business Operations, Marketing, and Support. These cross-functional teams help ensure that the service delivery process is strongly integrated with customer expectations. If you can specifically identify how technical improvements meet customer expectations and positively impact the business’s bottom line, then your operations team is functioning at optimal levels. Tip Ideally, the cross-functional operations review team should also be the team that defines your SLOs. If this is not possible, try to ensure that some members of the operations review team are also on the team responsible for SLOs. 2. Review service records and note key metrics Create a regular meeting to track your service records. New Relic recommends reviewing your previous service records, and pinpointing specific metrics to analyze at every review. For example, start with application state, alert conditions, and runtime anomalies. Look at the same metrics on two separate occasions to identify and assess patterns, inconsistencies, and anomalies. Monitor these metrics using the service delivery Insights dashboards you created in the Establish objectives and baselines tutorial. The widgets on these dashboards provide a high-level overview of the relationships between different performance indicators and baselines: insights.newrelic.com > (select a dashboard): Use dashboards to visualize metrics related to service delivery. When conducting a thorough performance review, make several dashboards that have corresponding widgets. Use these dashboards to hone-in on two specific time periods that you want to compare. This comparative analysis could cover everything from Infrastructure or browser performance, to Synthetics testing or business impact. To get started with performance indicators in Insights, read the following example queries. These queries provide information that you can consider incorporating for the operations review. Daily uptime SELECT percentage(count(result), where result = 'SUCCESS') from SyntheticCheck since 1 Day ago Copy Create dashboards that are dedicated to the functionality that drives your software development process, such as testing. For example, collect related metrics on uptime, types of monitors, geo-locations, and other data points that are required for appropriately measuring SLAs. The following dashboard provides such an example: insights.newrelic.com > (select a dashboard): Track your relevant SLAs together in one dashboard. Device performance breakdown SELECT count(*) as '# Pages',average(duration) as 'AVG',percentile(duration,50,75) as '%',average(duration - backendDuration) as 'Front',average(backendDuration) as 'Back',average(connectionSetupDuration) as 'Connection',average(domProcessingDuration) as 'DOM Processing',average(pageRenderingDuration) as 'Page Rendering' FROM PageView FACET deviceType LIMIT 3 SINCE 1 day ago Copy Top URL performance SELECT count(*) as '# Pages',average(duration) as 'AVG',percentile(duration,50,75) as '%',average(duration - backendDuration) as 'Front',average(backendDuration) as 'Back',average(connectionSetupDuration) as 'Connection',average(domProcessingDuration) as 'DOM Processing',average(pageRenderingDuration) as 'Page Rendering' FROM PageView facet pageUrl SINCE 1 day ago limit 30 Copy Memory usage SELECT average(memoryUsedBytes) /1000000 AS 'Avg MB Used', average(memoryFreeBytes)/1000000 AS 'Avg MB Free', average(memoryFreeBytes/memoryTotalBytes)*100 as 'Memory used %' FROM SystemSample since 30 minutes ago Copy Server CPU SELECT average(cpuPercent) FROM SystemSample since 3 hours ago facet hostname limit 400 Copy Combine the results into a single dashboard to help drive decisions during your operations review. Dashboards that give a brief overview of performance across your entire application stack are invaluable for cross-functional team reviews. Tip Beyond Insights, the APM reports allow you to see how you’re performing on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis with built in SLA reports and other detailed reports. The out-of-the-box details from these reports give your operations team a launch pad for conversations about progress against objectives and overall performance. 3. Summarize events related to application alerts, downtime, and errors Now that you’ve gathered data about your service delivery, the next step is to dive deeper into specific incidents that warrant further investigation or surface a need for broader team action. For example, notable downtime and errors are key areas to investigate as a team. After completing the Setup proactive alerting tutorial, you can explore notifications of violations as they occur. Once these violations are brought to your attention, acknowledge the specific incident and have an ongoing record of both opened and closed incidents. Use the incident reports as a focal point for discussion of gaps. alerts.newrelic.com > Incidents: Identify performance issues and SLA gaps with New Relic Alerts incident reports. Ultimately, it’s important to solicit feedback from the cross-functional team on the causes of the incidents to determine how you can improve service delivery processes to prevent reoccurrences. One approach might be to focus on one or two notable incidents, use the New Relic UI to walk through the data points leading up to those incidents, and assess the actions that occurred. Summarize the incident and the cross-functional feedback on causes and potential solutions as succinctly as possible. Over time, you’ll notice patterns that will require deeper action.",

      "body": "Incident orchestration is the alignment of teams, tools, and processes to prepare for incidents and outages in your software. The goal is to provide your teams a predictable framework and process to: Maximize efficiency in communication and effort. Minimize the overall impact to your business. Prerequisites Before starting this tutorial, be sure to complete these New Relic tutorials: Establish team dashboards Set up proactive alerting 1. Assign first responders to team dashboards Recommendation: For each team dashboard, make sure: It has an owner who assumes responsibility for the health of the applications and features it monitors. There is no ambiguity about who is responsible for attending to and resolving an alert condition. This policy will vary between organizations depending on size, structure, and culture. For example, some teams may prefer to assign dashboards and alerts based on de-facto features or application ownership. Other teams may prefer to adopt an on-call rotation (often referred to as \"pager duty\"). In on-call rotations, designated team members handle all first-line incident responses, and they resolve or delegate responsibilities based on predetermined incident thresholds. 2. Determine incident thresholds for alert conditions For each of your applications: Identify the thresholds for what is officially considered an incident. As you create alert policies with New Relic Alerts, make sure each set of threshold criteria is context-dependent. Document incident evaluation and known remediation procedures in runbooks. Include links to your runbooks when you define conditions and thresholds for your alert policies. For instance, a certain alert condition may be dismissable during low-traffic periods but require active remediation during peak hours. 3. Ensure alerts have auditable notification channels Recommendation: Make sure that communications during critical incidents take place in easily accessible and highly visible channels. A group chat room dedicated to incident communication is usually a great choice. This allows all stakeholders to participate or observe and provides a chronology of notifications, key decisions, and actions for postmortem analysis. Use any of the available notification channels in New Relic Alerts. For example, to set up a notification channel in Slack: Make sure your organization has completed New Relic's integration requirements with Slack. In the Slack app, select the dropdown in the top-left corner of the app, and select Customize Slack. Click Configure apps. From the list of app integrations, select New Relic. Expand the instructions for New Relic Alerts, and follow the steps to configure notifications from New Relic. 4. Automate triage and resolution steps Automation of simple or repeatable incident response tasks will increase efficiency and minimize the impact of incidents. With proper automation in place, you can disable or isolate faulty application components as soon as an alert threshold is reached, rather than after a notification has been issued. For example, a team managing an application for a digital media company wants to be able to remove commenting abilities from the website if the system has errors. In this case, they could: Add an endpoint to their front-end web application that will toggle a feature flag enabling or disabling the UI components associated with posting comments on an article. Create an alert policy with a threshold set on the sustained error rate in the commenting service. Assign a webhook notification channel that will send a POST request to this endpoint, as well as to the standard team notification channels. In this scenario, errors in the commenting system will trigger the webhook and remove the commenting UI from the website. Users can still use core functionality of the site without seeing errors generated by the commenting service. The application will maintain a stable but degraded state, allowing the team to focus on recovery without the pressure of preventing users from accessing the site. You can also use webhooks to create issues and action items in ticketing systems that have REST APIs, such as Zendesk. Use New Relic Alerts to create a webhook notification channel, and customize the webhook payload as needed.",

      "body": "The term \"alerting\" often carries some negative connotations; for too many developers, alerting correlates too closely with errors, mistakes, and ongoing issues. However, for developers who are proactive about alerting, they know they don’t have to stare at their dashboards all day, because effective alerts will tell them when to check in. Well-defined alerts help you understand the health of your systems, so you can respond to performance problems before they affect your customers. Alerts can become overwhelming, so tune alerts and leverage AI so you get alerted on what matters. Prerequisites This tutorial assumes you have: Instrumented your applications in New Relic. Reviewed the tutorial Establish objectives and baselines before you begin this one. Optional: added custom attributes and events. 1. Define required alerting policies based on Service Level Objectives A service level objective (SLO) is an agreed upon means of measuring the performance of your service. The SLO defines a target value of a specified quantitative measure, which is called a service level indicator (SLI). Examples service level indicators could be average response time, response time percentile, and application availability. SLOs would then clarify a target value for those SLIs such as: Average response time should be less than 200 ms. 95% of requests should be completed within 250 ms. Availability of the service should be 99.99%. These SLOs can also be logically grouped together to provide an overall boolean indicator of whether the service is meeting expectations or not (for example, “95% of requests completed within 250 ms AND availability is 99.99%”), which can be helpful for alerting purposes. Use these SLIs as key performance indicators (KPIs) so your team and organization can measure your service and ensure it’s meeting customer expectations. By breaking down the quantitative performance metrics that are required of your services, you can then identify what kinds of alerts you should set for each. For instance, you could set an alert to notify you if web transaction times go above half a millisecond, or if the error rate goes higher than .20%. However, not every SLO needs to become an alert. A strong alert strategy takes SLOs and creates a set of simple, actionable alerts. New Relic often finds that our most mature DevOps customers set fewer alerts in general and focus those alerts on a core set of metrics that indicate when their customer experience is truly degraded. As a result, New Relic DevOps customers often use Apdex as part of their alerting strategy to align alerts with signs of degraded user satisfaction. As you design your alert strategy, keep this question in mind: “If the customer isn’t impacted, is it worth waking someone up?” For a simple framework of areas to set alerts for, use the following questions and advised metrics and KPIs: Questions Metrics and KPIs Are we open for business? Use Synthetic monitoring pings to determine if the site is up and scripted checks to determine that the most important capabilities (such as a checkout cart) are working. How's our underlying infrastructure? Set KPIs for key hardware, virtual hosts, containers, network, and storage components. How's the health of our application? Track metrics for JVM performance, queuing, caching, and similar dependencies. How’s the overall quality of our application? Use an Apdex score to quickly access an application’s quality. How are our customers doing? Consider real end-user metrics (browser or APM), synthetic users (Synthetics), and Apdex scores. How's our overall business doing? Focus on key transactions within an application, and tie that to expected business outcomes to illustrate correlation between your application and business performance. 2. Set specific alerts for performance, correctness, throughput, availability, and dependencies With New Relic you can set alerts on your instrumented applications, end-user experience, infrastructure, databases, and more. New Relic will alert you if your site’s availability dips or if your error rate spikes above acceptable levels, as defined by your SLOs. You can set warning thresholds to monitor issues that may be approaching a critical severity but don’t yet warrant a pager notification. Setting thresholds for when alerts should notify teams can be challenging. Thresholds that are too tight will create alert fatigue while thresholds that are too loose will lead to unhappy customers. Baseline alerts allow you to set dynamic thresholds for alerts based on historical performance. Use baselines to tune your alert to the right threshold. For example, an alert in APM can notify incident response teams if web transaction times deviate from historical performance for an allotted amount of time. alerts.newrelic.com > (select an alert policy) > (select an alert condition) > Define thresholds You can set this same kind of alert in browser to catch sub-optimal performance. In the following example, we’ve set both a warning and a violation for throughput: alerts.newrelic.com > (select an alert policy) > (select an alert condition) > Define thresholds As you develop smaller, independent services running on increasingly ephemeral architectures, your environments become significantly more complex. Visibility into outliers can be an important tool for understanding likely performance issues. You should set alerts to automatically fire when you have an outlier -- this can indicate misbehaving hosts, load balancers, or apps. For example, a load balancer divides web traffic approximately evenly across five different servers. You can set an alert based on a NRQL query, and notification to be sent if any server starts getting significantly more or less traffic than the other servers. Here’s the graph: alerts.newrelic.com > (select an alert policy) > (select an alert condition) > Define thresholds And here’s a sample NRQL query: SELECT average(cpuPercent) FROM SystemSample WHERE apmApplicationNames = 'MY-APP-NAME' FACET hostname Copy Now you have set static, baseline, and outlier alerts. This can provide a comprehensive awareness of your ecosystem. Refer to the New Relic Alerts documentation for more details about optimizing your alerts. 3. Identify groups to alert, and set broadcasting methods Alerting without the proper broadcasting methods leaves you vulnerable. Your alerts strategy should include a notification channel to ensure the appropriate teams are notified if your application or architecture encounters issues. New Relic has many notification integrations, but we recommend that you start simple and add more complexity later. We recommend that you first send alerts to a group chat channel (for example, using Slack). Evaluate these alerts in real time for several weeks to understand which alerts are indicative of important or problematic issues. These are the the types of alerts that warrant waking someone up. 4. Leverage AI to fine-tune alerts and seek anomalies To ensure you aren't training your teams to turn off or ignore notifications, keep your alerts valid and fresh. As you use New Relic to optimize your application and infrastructure performance, tighten your New Relic Alerts policy conditions to keep pace with your improved performance. To keep alerts to a minimum, leverage New Relic Applied Intelligence features, such as Incident Intelligence, which correlates related alerts into one actionable issue combining machine learning and manual input. Check to make sure alerts are correlated correctly and train your system to obtain the most accurate incident correlation. An additional way to reduce alert noise is by flapping detection and suppression. When an issue is \"flapping,\" it is cycling between an open and resolved state, creating a new alert every time it cycles. Effectively handling these can reduce the number of total alerts sent to your team. Finally, when you have maintenance scheduled, take advantage of alert muting rules to suppress those alerts you don't need. Now that you have tuned your alerts to valid notifications, you can proactively go after anomalies so you can fix issues before they become incidents. Enable Proactive Detection of anomalies and set some level of notification for them. 5. Create an alerts dashboard Be sure to check your alerts and confirm that they're firing regularly and are still relevant for your customer satisfaction metrics. Use the New Relic platform to create dashboards centered around alerts and incidents for the most common policy conditions and violations. insights.newrelic.com > All dashboards > (selected dashboard) Use NRQL to create your dashboards. For example, the dashboard above was created using the following NRQL queries: Incidents by condition: SELECT count(*) FROM ALERT_NAME WHERE current_state = 'open' FACET condition_name SINCE 1 week ago Copy Incidents by policy: SELECT count(*) FROM ALERT_NAME where current_state = 'open' FACET policy_name SINCE 60 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy Alert trends over time: SELECT count(*) FROM ALERT_NAME WHERE current_state IS NOT NULL FACET policy_name SINCE 1 week ago TIMESERIES Copy Incident details: SELECT timestamp, incident_id, policy_name, condition_name, details, severity FROM ALERT_NAME SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT 40 Copy Visualizing this data provides a resource you can share with others to refine the alerts and thresholds you’re using. For a more extensive discussion on notification channels, refer to the incident orchestration tutorial. Conclusion Establishing a focused alerts policy helps you pinpoint any degradation that could impact performance in your application or infrastructure. With proactive alerting, you will decrease user-reported incidents, and allow your teams to spend less time firefighting and more time deploying significant changes to your product.",

      "body": "Overview Digital customer experience is your end user’s experience across all your digital touch points. There are four core factors that impact a user’s experience: Availability (Is it reachable?) Performance (Does it perform well enough to be usable?) Content quality (Does it have what users need and can they find it?) Product and content relevance (Does it have what users care about?) Digital customer experience includes web, mobile, and IoT. The first version of this guide is focused on measuring the end user web experience. Quality Foundation is about creating a standard practice to help you understand your digital customer experience in a meaningful way. This implementation guide will help you: Look at customer experience in relation to: Global functions, such as search and login Lines of business Regions Report back to business stakeholders on what they care about Prioritize what you work on Create a repeatable practice Desired Outcome Improve customer engagement and retention by measuring and improving performance in a way that better aligns to the end user experience. Key Performance Indicators Quality Foundation measures the following KPIs: JavaScript error rate This KPI measures the number of JavaScript errors per page view. Goal: Remove irrelevant JavaScript errors being tracked either by tuning ingest or using filtering. Reduce JavaScript errors that impact customer performance. HTTP error rate HTTP errors (or HTTP 4xx and 5xx responses) happen when calls to the backend are not successful. Goal: Measure and reduce the HTTP error rate to ensure your customers are able to do what they came to your site to do. Time to first byte (TTFB) This KPI measures the time from navigation start (a user clicking a link) to the browser receiving the first byte of the response from the server. Goal: Reduce the time to first byte by improving CDN, network, and service performance. Largest contentful paint (LCP) Part of Core Web Vitals. Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) measures the time it takes to load the largest image after a user has navigated to a new page. Goal: Reduce LCP to 2.5 seconds or better for the 75% percentile for all pages or at least the most critical pages. First input delay (FID) Part of Core Web Vitals. Measures the interactivity of a page by tracking the time between user interaction (such as clicking a link or entering text) when the browser begins processing the event. Goal: Reduce FID to 100 milliseconds or better for the 75% percentile for all pages or at least the most critical pages. Cumulative layout shift (CLS) Part of Core Web Vitals. Measures how much the page layout shifts during render. Goal: Maintain a score of 0.1 or less for the 75% percentile for all pages or at least the most critical pages. Prerequisites Required knowledge Familiarity with synthetic monitoring Familiarity with browser monitoring Familiarity with basic Browser UI views Familiarity with SPA data in Browser UI Required Installation and Configuration Browser Pro installed in all pages SPA enabled for single page applications Synthetics monitors configured: Ping monitors configured for anonymous users Scripted synthetics check configured for login flow Monitors should be configured to test from all regions applicable to your users Monitors should be configured for each domain and each login flow Data retention for browser events greater than or equal to 2x an average sprint Establish current state Review instrumented pages Validate Browser URL grouping Understand how you will segment your data Import the quality foundation dashboard Capture current performance for each dashboard page Review instrumented pages Review Browser apps and pages to make sure that everything you expect to report back to New Relic is. You can do this by reviewing the Page Views tab in the Browser UI or running the following query: SELECT uniques(pageUrl) from PageView LIMIT MAX Copy You may need to filter out URLs that contain request or customer ID. Validate Browser URL grouping Ensure Browser segments are captured correctly so user experience performance is measurable in both the NewRelic UI as well as at the aggregate level when querying via NRQL. A segment is the text between two / in a URL or between . of a domain name. For example, in the URL website.com/product/widget-name, the segments are: website .com product widget-name When there are a lot of URLs with a lot of segments, URLs can get crushed, so that website.com/product/widget-name becomes website.com/ or website.com/product/. In this example, the first crushed URL is not particularly useful, but the second one may be a useful way of aggregating customer experience data for the product. Not sure whether you need to tune your configuration? Import the Segment Allow List Investigation dashboard in GitHub to help. Once you’ve identified which segments to add, you can add them using Segment allow lists in Browser. Understand how you will segment your data Make Customer Experience data understandable and actionable by breaking it out into different segments. In this case, segments refer to groups of data. It does not refer to sections of URLs, as in segment allow lists. Consider the following statements: Most of our users experience 3 seconds or better to first input delay. On average, we see 2 seconds to the largest contentful paint. Last week, there were 1 million page views. Compared to: Most of the users in the US, Canada, and EMEA experience 2 seconds or better to first input delay. Malaysia and Indonesia users experience 4 seconds; we are looking into this. Customers buying car insurance typically see 1 second to largest contentful paint. For home insurance, it’s 4 seconds. Last week, there were 700,000 page views on mobile browser apps compared to 300,000 on desktop. Let’s make sure we’re optimizing our mobile experience. Typical segmentation involves breaking down user experience into the following categories: Segment Guidance Region/Location Basic: Group by country. Browser events automatically contain the country code of requests, so there is nothing you need to do to break it out further. Advanced: Make regional grouping match regional SLO groups by creating your own region attribute using custom attributes in Browser. Facet by countryCode. Related attributes: regionCode city asnLatitude asnLongitude Device Break out performance and engagement device type so you can understand: Typical breakdown of desktop vs mobile browser users Experience of desktop vs mobile browser users Facet by deviceType. Related attributes: userAgentName userAgentOS userAgentVersion Product/Line of Business In this scenario, a product is a separate line of business or service provided by your organization. Some examples of industries and respective products: An insurance company that sells both car and house insurance A media company that has multiple streaming services or channels A travel company that provides car rental as well as hotel bookings Basic: Break out performance by product by: Faceting on pageUrl: Use this approach when multiple products are grouped into one browser app in New Relic. Faceting by appName: Use this approach when each product is instrumented as a separate web app. Grouping by appName and then facet: Use this approach when there are multiple apps in browser supporting one product. Advanced: Add product offering as a custom attribute to browser pages using custom attributes. Environment During instrumentation or afterwards, follow a naming convention that specifies the environment in Browser. Well named browser apps specify product and/or function as well as environment. Examples: account-management.prod hotels-book.prod car-insurance.uat Using app naming conventions to specify the environment supports filtering data in both the UI and in dashboards. For more information, see the documentation for how to rename Browser apps. Team In some organizations, a single team supports multiple products, while in others, a product is big enough to be supported by multiple teams. Report on team performance against customer experience or engagement by either adding the team name to the Browser app name (for example, account-management.prod.unicorn-squad) or by using custom attributes. Import the quality foundation dashboard This step creates the dashboard that you will use to measure your customer experience and improve it. Clone the GitHub repository. Follow the GitHub repository README instructions to implement the dashboard. Make sure to align the dashboard to lines of business or customer facing offerings rather than teams. This ensures optimization time is spent where it is most impactful. Capture current performance for each dashboard page Follow the GitHub README instructions. Use the dashboard from the previous step to understand the overall performance for each line of business. If relevant, apply filters to see performance across region or device. If values drop below targets and it matters, add it to the sheet as a candidate for improvement. Not worth tracking: A company that sells insurance in the US only notices poor performance in Malaysia. Worth tracking: A company that sells insurance in the US only notices poor performance with respect to mobile users in the US. Improvement Process Plan your work Decide which KPIs to improve Improve targeted KPIs Improve page load performance Improve AJAX response times Improve the AJAX error rate Improve JavaScript errors Plan your work Whether you have a dedicated initiative to improve performance or classifying as ongoing maintenance, you need to track your progress at the end of every sprint. Decide which KPIs to improve You now know what your user experience looks like across multiple lines of business. Where should you be improving? Start with business priorities. If you have clear business directives or have access to a senior manager above who does, you should focus on what matters most to your organization. For example, let’s say your company has recently launched a new initiative around a line of business but the KPIs associated with the UI are below target. This is where you should focus time initially. Next, focus on KPIs for each line of business. Finally, filter each line of business by device, region, etc., to see if additional focus is needed for specific regions or devices. Improve targeted KPIs To track your progress, create a new dashboard or add a new page to the existing dashboard and name it Quality Foundation KPI Improvement. For more information, see Improve Web Uptime. Improve page load performance Narrow your focus to specific pages that aren’t meeting target KPI values. For each page load KPI result that is out of bounds in the Quality Foundation Dashboard, remove the COMPARE WITH clause and add FACET pageUrl/targetGroupedUrl LIMIT MAX to find which pages are the poor performers. Use targetGroupedUrl when there are many results; for example, when the customer ID is part of the URL. Otherwise, use pageUrl. Original Dashboard query: FROM PageViewTiming SELECT percentile(largestContentfulPaint, 75) WHERE appName ='WebPortal' AND pageUrl LIKE '%phone%' SINCE 1 week AGO COMPARE WITH 1 week AGO Copy New query to identify problem pages: FROM PageViewTiming SELECT percentile(largestContentfulPaint, 75) WHERE appName ='WebPortal' AND pageUrl LIKE '%phone%' FACET targetGroupedUrl LIMIT MAX Copy Once you have identified which pages to improve, improve them following these best practices. Improve AJAX response times Find the slow requests. Go to the Ajax duration widget on the dashboard. View query, then open in query builder. Add facet requestUrl LIMIT MAX to the end of the query. Run the query. View the results as a table and save to your KPI Improvement dashboard as LOB - AjaxResponseTimes. Focus improving requests with a timeToSettle > 2.5s. Use New Relic’s recommended best practices to improve response times. See AJAX troubleshooting tips. Improve the AJAX error rate Find the failing requests. Go to Dashboards > Query builder. Enter FROM AjaxRequest SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE httpResponseCode >= 400) WHERE httpResponseCode >= 200 AND <Ajax Request filter> SINCE 1 week AGO facet pageUrl, appName Copy Run the query. View the results as a table and save to your KPI Improvement dashboard as LOB - Pages with AjaxErrors. Run the query again for the most problematic pages to find the requests that are failing: FROM AjaxRequest SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE httpResponseCode >= 400) WHERE httpResponseCode >= 200 AND pageUrl=<problematic page> AND appName = <corresponding app> <Ajax Request filter> SINCE 1 week AGO facet requestUrl Copy Use New Relic’s recommended best practices to improve response times. See AJAX troubleshooting tips. Improve JavaScript errors Find the most common failures. Go to Dashboards > Query builder Enter FROM JavaScriptError SELECT count(errorClass) SINCE 1 week AGO WHERE <PageView filter> FACET transactionName, errorClass, errorMessage, domain Copy Run the query. View the results as a table and save to your KPI Improvement dashboard as LOB - Javascript Errors. Use this information to figure out which errors need to be addressed Use New Relic’s recommended best practices to resolve errors that need addressing. See JavaScript errors page: Detect and analyze errors. Remove third party errors that do not add value. You may be using a third party JavaScript that is noisy but works as expected. You can take a couple of approaches: Remove the domain name from the JavaScript error/Pageview ratio widget and add it as its own widget so you can see unexpected changes. You can alert on this using Baseline NRQL alerts. Drop the JavaScript error using drop filters. Only use this option if the volume of errors is impacting your data ingest in a significant way. Be as specific as you can in the drop filter. Conclusion Best practices to adopt Revisit performance metrics (shared in this document as Quality Foundation KPIs) at the end of each sprint. Incorporate performance improvements into developer sprints. Openly share metrics with the lines of the business you support as well as other internal stakeholders. Define Customer Experience SLOs. Create alerts for business critical drops in Quality Foundation KPIs. Value Realization At the end of this process you should now: Have an understanding of your end user experience in a way that is tangible, actionable, and easy for engineers as well as the business to understand. Know how releases impact your end customers. Know how your customers are impacted by service, infrastructure, or network level events. See latency issues caused by backend services if they exist. Have created, or be on the path to create, a common language with business owners so you are working together. This can open new avenues for recognition and sponsorship for new projects.",

Set up an alert to notify you when multiple locations fail. 2. Create workloads Create workloads that correlate synthetic monitors with browser applications, services, and infrastructure. Include a link to the workload in the alert runbook. You can also find the correlated workload for a synthetic using global search. Make sure that alerts are configured for each tier of your workload. This way you can see the health of each of the tiers in one view. This will save you time in troubleshooting. You do not need to create alert notifications for each tier to benefit from this view. 3. Investigate outages at lowest tier first When an outage occurs, start investigating at the lowest tier that is alerting. For instance, if you see that you have an infrastructure issue and a JavaScript issue, investigate infrastructure prior to javascript unless you have a second person or team you can delegate that to. Use the tools that are available to you for troubleshooting: Make sure that distributed tracing is enabled for browser monitoring as well as APM. Use the Browser UI to help you understand what is happening at the end user tier. Use Lookout to help you understand what’s causing flapping or reoccurring issues.",

      "body": "Page load performance measurement continues to evolve. In order to improve the overall performance and user experience, it helps to understand the different metrics and how they relate to each other. Before following the guidance below, narrow your scope to specific pages that you are trying to improve. For maximum impact, focus on pages that are frequently accessed but have a lower than accepted score for the 75th percentile of users. Page Load KPI How to improve time to first byte (TTFB): Time to first byte measures the time from navigation start (a user clicking a link) to the browser receiving the first byte of the response from the server. If users in the 75th percentile are experiencing a TTFB of greater than 0.5s for one or more of your pages, you can break timings down further by querying the following attributes in PageView: backendDuration connectionSetupDuration dnsLookupDuration networkDuration Frequently slowness prior to rendering is caused by slowness in the backend, either from third party APIs or backend applications. Synthetics monitoring for third party APIs helps operations and development teams understand when the root cause is outside of their control. Even if you cannot control the code, you can influence the outcome by sharing synthetics results with the third party to help them understand what your customers are experiencing. If the backend applications are owned by you or your team, you can use APM agents, Pixie, or OpenTelemetry to understand and manage performance. To make cross team communication easier, we recommend implementing Service Level Management boundaries. Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) Cumulative layout shift is a score that indicates how much content shifts once it has already loaded. General tips and tricks for improving CLS: Specify dimensions for stylesheets and let the browser’s default CSS control the aspect ratio. Statically reserve space for ad slots. Avoid ads near the top of the viewport. Avoid inserting new content above existing content. Precompute sufficient space for embeds. Additional resources: Google’s approach to CLS optimization Lighthouse is a tool by Google that runs a synthetic test against a specific page and provides a list of recommendations that include how to optimize CLS. Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) Largest contentful paint measures the difference between the start of page render until the time to paint the largest content element. Common causes for a slow lcp, according to web.dev: Slow server response times Render-blocking JavaScript and CSS Slow resource load times Client-side rendering Use Browser session trace information to understand which of the common causes above factor into the particular page you are trying to optimize. Approaches to improve LCP: Making use of CDNs and paying attention to caching and edge server performance Establishing third party connections early Delaying non-critical Javascript and CSS Additional resources: Google’s approach to LCP optimization Lighthouse is a tool by Google that runs a synthetic test against a specific page and provides a list of recommendations that include how to optimize CLS. First Input Delay (FID) First input delay is the time between when a user first interacts with a page to the time when the browser is able to respond. It’s a field metric that varies based on real user behavior (results vary based on user impatience and action timing) but can be optimized by reducing TBT, total blocking time. To do this, you need to: Break up long blocking tasks. Optimize bloated JavaScript. Look at moving logic server side and/or use web workers to run threads in the background. Use Browser session trace information to understand where your blocking intervals are occurring and for how long they last.

      "body": "Overview Digital customer experience is your end user’s experience across all your digital touch points. There are four core factors that impact a user’s experience: Availability (Is it reachable?) Performance (Does it perform well enough to be usable?) Content quality (Does it have what users need and can they find it?) Product and content relevance (Does it have what users care about?) Digital customer experience includes web, mobile, and IoT. The first version of this guide is focused on measuring the end user web experience. Quality Foundation is about creating a standard practice to help you understand your digital customer experience in a meaningful way. This implementation guide will help you: Look at customer experience in relation to: Global functions, such as search and login Lines of business Regions Report back to business stakeholders on what they care about Prioritize what you work on Create a repeatable practice Desired Outcome Improve customer engagement and retention by measuring and improving performance in a way that better aligns to the end user experience. Key Performance Indicators Quality Foundation measures the following KPIs: JavaScript error rate This KPI measures the number of JavaScript errors per page view. Goal: Remove irrelevant JavaScript errors being tracked either by tuning ingest or using filtering. Reduce JavaScript errors that impact customer performance. HTTP error rate HTTP errors (or HTTP 4xx and 5xx responses) happen when calls to the backend are not successful. Goal: Measure and reduce the HTTP error rate to ensure your customers are able to do what they came to your site to do. Time to first byte (TTFB) This KPI measures the time from navigation start (a user clicking a link) to the browser receiving the first byte of the response from the server. Goal: Reduce the time to first byte by improving CDN, network, and service performance. Largest contentful paint (LCP) Part of Core Web Vitals. Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) measures the time it takes to load the largest image after a user has navigated to a new page. Goal: Reduce LCP to 2.5 seconds or better for the 75% percentile for all pages or at least the most critical pages. First input delay (FID) Part of Core Web Vitals. Measures the interactivity of a page by tracking the time between user interaction (such as clicking a link or entering text) when the browser begins processing the event. Goal: Reduce FID to 100 milliseconds or better for the 75% percentile for all pages or at least the most critical pages. Cumulative layout shift (CLS) Part of Core Web Vitals. Measures how much the page layout shifts during render. Goal: Maintain a score of 0.1 or less for the 75% percentile for all pages or at least the most critical pages. Prerequisites Required knowledge Familiarity with synthetic monitoring Familiarity with browser monitoring Familiarity with basic Browser UI views Familiarity with SPA data in Browser UI Required Installation and Configuration Browser Pro installed in all pages SPA enabled for single page applications Synthetics monitors configured: Ping monitors configured for anonymous users Scripted synthetics check configured for login flow Monitors should be configured to test from all regions applicable to your users Monitors should be configured for each domain and each login flow Data retention for browser events greater than or equal to 2x an average sprint Establish current state Review instrumented pages Validate Browser URL grouping Understand how you will segment your data Import the quality foundation dashboard Capture current performance for each dashboard page Review instrumented pages Review Browser apps and pages to make sure that everything you expect to report back to New Relic is. You can do this by reviewing the Page Views tab in the Browser UI or running the following query: SELECT uniques(pageUrl) from PageView LIMIT MAX Copy You may need to filter out URLs that contain request or customer ID. Validate Browser URL grouping Ensure Browser segments are captured correctly so user experience performance is measurable in both the NewRelic UI as well as at the aggregate level when querying via NRQL. A segment is the text between two / in a URL or between . of a domain name. For example, in the URL website.com/product/widget-name, the segments are: website .com product widget-name When there are a lot of URLs with a lot of segments, URLs can get crushed, so that website.com/product/widget-name becomes website.com/ or website.com/product/. In this example, the first crushed URL is not particularly useful, but the second one may be a useful way of aggregating customer experience data for the product. Not sure whether you need to tune your configuration? Import the Segment Allow List Investigation dashboard in GitHub to help. Once you’ve identified which segments to add, you can add them using Segment allow lists in Browser. Understand how you will segment your data Make Customer Experience data understandable and actionable by breaking it out into different segments. In this case, segments refer to groups of data. It does not refer to sections of URLs, as in segment allow lists. Consider the following statements: Most of our users experience 3 seconds or better to first input delay. On average, we see 2 seconds to the largest contentful paint. Last week, there were 1 million page views. Compared to: Most of the users in the US, Canada, and EMEA experience 2 seconds or better to first input delay. Malaysia and Indonesia users experience 4 seconds; we are looking into this. Customers buying car insurance typically see 1 second to largest contentful paint. For home insurance, it’s 4 seconds. Last week, there were 700,000 page views on mobile browser apps compared to 300,000 on desktop. Let’s make sure we’re optimizing our mobile experience. Typical segmentation involves breaking down user experience into the following categories: Segment Guidance Region/Location Basic: Group by country. Browser events automatically contain the country code of requests, so there is nothing you need to do to break it out further. Advanced: Make regional grouping match regional SLO groups by creating your own region attribute using custom attributes in Browser. Facet by countryCode. Related attributes: regionCode city asnLatitude asnLongitude Device Break out performance and engagement device type so you can understand: Typical breakdown of desktop vs mobile browser users Experience of desktop vs mobile browser users Facet by deviceType. Related attributes: userAgentName userAgentOS userAgentVersion Product/Line of Business In this scenario, a product is a separate line of business or service provided by your organization. Some examples of industries and respective products: An insurance company that sells both car and house insurance A media company that has multiple streaming services or channels A travel company that provides car rental as well as hotel bookings Basic: Break out performance by product by: Faceting on pageUrl: Use this approach when multiple products are grouped into one browser app in New Relic. Faceting by appName: Use this approach when each product is instrumented as a separate web app. Grouping by appName and then facet: Use this approach when there are multiple apps in browser supporting one product. Advanced: Add product offering as a custom attribute to browser pages using custom attributes. Environment During instrumentation or afterwards, follow a naming convention that specifies the environment in Browser. Well named browser apps specify product and/or function as well as environment. Examples: account-management.prod hotels-book.prod car-insurance.uat Using app naming conventions to specify the environment supports filtering data in both the UI and in dashboards. For more information, see the documentation for how to rename Browser apps. Team In some organizations, a single team supports multiple products, while in others, a product is big enough to be supported by multiple teams. Report on team performance against customer experience or engagement by either adding the team name to the Browser app name (for example, account-management.prod.unicorn-squad) or by using custom attributes. Import the quality foundation dashboard This step creates the dashboard that you will use to measure your customer experience and improve it. Clone the GitHub repository. Follow the GitHub repository README instructions to implement the dashboard. Make sure to align the dashboard to lines of business or customer facing offerings rather than teams. This ensures optimization time is spent where it is most impactful. Capture current performance for each dashboard page Follow the GitHub README instructions. Use the dashboard from the previous step to understand the overall performance for each line of business. If relevant, apply filters to see performance across region or device. If values drop below targets and it matters, add it to the sheet as a candidate for improvement. Not worth tracking: A company that sells insurance in the US only notices poor performance in Malaysia. Worth tracking: A company that sells insurance in the US only notices poor performance with respect to mobile users in the US. Improvement Process Plan your work Decide which KPIs to improve Improve targeted KPIs Improve page load performance Improve AJAX response times Improve the AJAX error rate Improve JavaScript errors Plan your work Whether you have a dedicated initiative to improve performance or classifying as ongoing maintenance, you need to track your progress at the end of every sprint. Decide which KPIs to improve You now know what your user experience looks like across multiple lines of business. Where should you be improving? Start with business priorities. If you have clear business directives or have access to a senior manager above who does, you should focus on what matters most to your organization. For example, let’s say your company has recently launched a new initiative around a line of business but the KPIs associated with the UI are below target. This is where you should focus time initially. Next, focus on KPIs for each line of business. Finally, filter each line of business by device, region, etc., to see if additional focus is needed for specific regions or devices. Improve targeted KPIs To track your progress, create a new dashboard or add a new page to the existing dashboard and name it Quality Foundation KPI Improvement. For more information, see Improve Web Uptime. Improve page load performance Narrow your focus to specific pages that aren’t meeting target KPI values. For each page load KPI result that is out of bounds in the Quality Foundation Dashboard, remove the COMPARE WITH clause and add FACET pageUrl/targetGroupedUrl LIMIT MAX to find which pages are the poor performers. Use targetGroupedUrl when there are many results; for example, when the customer ID is part of the URL. Otherwise, use pageUrl. Original Dashboard query: FROM PageViewTiming SELECT percentile(largestContentfulPaint, 75) WHERE appName ='WebPortal' AND pageUrl LIKE '%phone%' SINCE 1 week AGO COMPARE WITH 1 week AGO Copy New query to identify problem pages: FROM PageViewTiming SELECT percentile(largestContentfulPaint, 75) WHERE appName ='WebPortal' AND pageUrl LIKE '%phone%' FACET targetGroupedUrl LIMIT MAX Copy Once you have identified which pages to improve, improve them following these best practices. Improve AJAX response times Find the slow requests. Go to the Ajax duration widget on the dashboard. View query, then open in query builder. Add facet requestUrl LIMIT MAX to the end of the query. Run the query. View the results as a table and save to your KPI Improvement dashboard as LOB - AjaxResponseTimes. Focus improving requests with a timeToSettle > 2.5s. Use New Relic’s recommended best practices to improve response times. See AJAX troubleshooting tips. Improve the AJAX error rate Find the failing requests. Go to Dashboards > Query builder. Enter FROM AjaxRequest SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE httpResponseCode >= 400) WHERE httpResponseCode >= 200 AND <Ajax Request filter> SINCE 1 week AGO facet pageUrl, appName Copy Run the query. View the results as a table and save to your KPI Improvement dashboard as LOB - Pages with AjaxErrors. Run the query again for the most problematic pages to find the requests that are failing: FROM AjaxRequest SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE httpResponseCode >= 400) WHERE httpResponseCode >= 200 AND pageUrl=<problematic page> AND appName = <corresponding app> <Ajax Request filter> SINCE 1 week AGO facet requestUrl Copy Use New Relic’s recommended best practices to improve response times. See AJAX troubleshooting tips. Improve JavaScript errors Find the most common failures. Go to Dashboards > Query builder Enter FROM JavaScriptError SELECT count(errorClass) SINCE 1 week AGO WHERE <PageView filter> FACET transactionName, errorClass, errorMessage, domain Copy Run the query. View the results as a table and save to your KPI Improvement dashboard as LOB - Javascript Errors. Use this information to figure out which errors need to be addressed Use New Relic’s recommended best practices to resolve errors that need addressing. See JavaScript errors page: Detect and analyze errors. Remove third party errors that do not add value. You may be using a third party JavaScript that is noisy but works as expected. You can take a couple of approaches: Remove the domain name from the JavaScript error/Pageview ratio widget and add it as its own widget so you can see unexpected changes. You can alert on this using Baseline NRQL alerts. Drop the JavaScript error using drop filters. Only use this option if the volume of errors is impacting your data ingest in a significant way. Be as specific as you can in the drop filter. Conclusion Best practices to adopt Revisit performance metrics (shared in this document as Quality Foundation KPIs) at the end of each sprint. Incorporate performance improvements into developer sprints. Openly share metrics with the lines of the business you support as well as other internal stakeholders. Define Customer Experience SLOs. Create alerts for business critical drops in Quality Foundation KPIs. Value Realization At the end of this process you should now: Have an understanding of your end user experience in a way that is tangible, actionable, and easy for engineers as well as the business to understand. Know how releases impact your end customers. Know how your customers are impacted by service, infrastructure, or network level events. See latency issues caused by backend services if they exist. Have created, or be on the path to create, a common language with business owners so you are working together. This can open new avenues for recognition and sponsorship for new projects.",

      "body": "Overview Bottom of the funnel analysis is about improving conversion by focusing on performance at the end of the user journey. Most sites and apps are built with one or more purposes in mind. If there is a purpose, there is likely to be a user journey. Some examples: Purpose User journey Brand awareness Download a whitepaper Customer support Raise a support ticket Customer services (registration, forms, payments) Make a payment Entertainment Stream a movie Goods Buy clothes and accessories Informational purposes Find a support program in your state Lead generation Join distribution list to get promotions and coupons Outreach Get information about events in your town Services (Travel, rentals, bookings) Book a flight Social media Share a selfie When a user completes a journey, we think of it as a conversion. All conversions have a value - from a few dollars to thousands. The best way to improve the conversion rate is to start at the bottom of the funnel, when the intent to complete the user journey is clear. What if I have performance issues in the middle of the funnel? Any glaring issues with your app or site should be addressed, no matter where they occur. When it comes to optimizing conversion, it's better to start at the bottom of the funnel for two reasons: Higher return on investment. Users at this stage are already more likely to convert. Addressing performance issues here will see an immediate impact on the bottom line. If you have issues at the bottom of the funnel, optimizing earlier stages may not have much of an impact on the conversion rate. Once you've optimized the bottom of the funnel you can use the same techniques to optimize earlier stages of the user journey. Optimizing the top or the middle of the funnel without focusing on the bottom first is a bit like fishing with a holey net. You can get more fish into the net by optimizing when and where you fish but you risk losing all that optimization as soon as you take the net out of the water. Desired outcome Increase revenue by resolving issues that appear when a user attempts to complete an action. Key performance indicators Bottom of the Funnel Analysis measures the following KPIs: KPI Description Goal Bottom of the Funnel Success Rate/Conversion Rate The rate of conversion once a user has gone far enough to demonstrate intent to complete an action to actual completion. Examples of this are rate of: Checkout -> Order submission Insurance form review -> submission Completing sign up details -> submission Increase the rate of conversion by addressing errors and latency at the bottom of the funnel Revenue at Risk due to Latency Value of a conversion * number of pages or interactions in the bottom of the funnel that are slower than the industry threshold. Focus on reducing this value by improving page KPIs Revenue at Risk due to Errors Value of a conversion * number of backend errors in the bottom of the funnel interactions Tune this value to make it meaningful by filtering out errors that aren't visible to the end user. Once this is meaningful, focus on reducing it. Create an alert to notify you if it suddenly trends upward. Prerequisites Required knowledge Familiarity with synthetic monitoring Familiarity with browser monitoring Familiarity with basic Browser UI views Familiarity with SPA data in Browser UI Required installation and configuration Browser Pro installed in relevant pages SPA enabled for single page applications Data retention for browser events greater than or equal to 2x an average sprint Establish current state Identify where the bottom of the funnel starts Distinguish between pages and actions Create a scripted synthetics monitor for the bottom of the funnel Import the bottom of the funnel dashboard Capture current performance Identify where the bottom of the funnel starts The Bottom of the Funnel is focused on the final steps of a user journey where a user has gone far enough to show intent to complete the journey. Some examples: Ecommerce user journey The user journey is simplified so you can focus on where the bottom of the funnel begins - at checkout. Most users entering the checkout phase plan to purchase something. Reducing errors and latency from this point onward is more likely to improve conversions than focusing on any other part of the funnel. Car insurance purchase user journey In the example above, you have the user’s interest in car insurance as they enter information, but you do not know their intent until they see the quote and continue to proceed. Distinguish between pages and actions The final steps of a user’s journey is likely to be a mix of full page loads and AJAX calls. You will need to know all pages and Ajax requests for the next step. If you are not sure which requests are running from the page in question, you can run: SELECT count(*) FROM AjaxRequest WHERE pageUrl like ‘%FILTER%’ FACET groupedRequestUrl SINCE 1 DAY AGO Copy Create a scripted monitor for the bottom of the funnel Make sure you have a scripted monitor for each path through the bottom of the funnel. The goal is to make sure your bottom of the funnel services are working around the clock. For example, you may have a checkout flow that calls a different payment API depending on the customer’s payment preferences. Import the Bottom of the Funnel Dashboard Follow the instructions documented in the public GitHub README. Capture Current Performance Follow the GitHub repository README instructions. Use the dashboard from the previous step to understand the bottom of the funnel performance. Create a plan to improve KPIs that don’t meet target values as well as reduce revenue at risk. Improvement process Plan your work Whether you have a dedicated initiative to improve performance or classifying as ongoing maintenance, you need to track your progress at the end of every sprint. For detailed information, see: Improve uptime Improve page load performance Improve AJAX performance Advanced topics Should I apply segmentation? Segmentation (breaking out performance into cohorts, such as region and device type) is a good idea if: Your organization has initiatives tied to addressing a target audience from a particular cohort that you can segment by using either custom attributes or data that is already available in New Relic. You are already familiar with Bottom of the Funnel Analysis and there is a significant enough difference in performance among different cohorts to warrant tracking and/or developer focus. Conclusion Best practices going forward Revisit performance metrics at the end of each sprint. Any time the user journey changes, revisit if the steps at the Bottom of the Funnel are the same. Incorporate changes in developer sprints as needed. Openly share metrics with the lines of the business you support as well as other internal stakeholders. Revisit your Customer Experience SLOs. Do you need to define more ambitious SLOs for the end of the funnel? Create alerts for business critical drops in Quality Foundation KPIs. Value realization At the end of this process you should: Know your user conversion rate and have addressed errors or performance issues that negatively impact it. Increased revenue for your company.

      "body": "Overview Digital customer experience is your end user’s experience across all your digital touch points. There are four core factors that impact a user’s experience: Availability (Is it reachable?) Performance (Does it perform well enough to be usable?) Content quality (Does it have what users need and can they find it?) Product and content relevance (Does it have what users care about?) Digital customer experience includes web, mobile, and IoT. The first version of this guide is focused on measuring the end user web experience. Quality Foundation is about creating a standard practice to help you understand your digital customer experience in a meaningful way. This implementation guide will help you: Look at customer experience in relation to: Global functions, such as search and login Lines of business Regions Report back to business stakeholders on what they care about Prioritize what you work on Create a repeatable practice Desired Outcome Improve customer engagement and retention by measuring and improving performance in a way that better aligns to the end user experience. Key Performance Indicators Quality Foundation measures the following KPIs: JavaScript error rate This KPI measures the number of JavaScript errors per page view. Goal: Remove irrelevant JavaScript errors being tracked either by tuning ingest or using filtering. Reduce JavaScript errors that impact customer performance. HTTP error rate HTTP errors (or HTTP 4xx and 5xx responses) happen when calls to the backend are not successful. Goal: Measure and reduce the HTTP error rate to ensure your customers are able to do what they came to your site to do. Time to first byte (TTFB) This KPI measures the time from navigation start (a user clicking a link) to the browser receiving the first byte of the response from the server. Goal: Reduce the time to first byte by improving CDN, network, and service performance. Largest contentful paint (LCP) Part of Core Web Vitals. Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) measures the time it takes to load the largest image after a user has navigated to a new page. Goal: Reduce LCP to 2.5 seconds or better for the 75% percentile for all pages or at least the most critical pages. First input delay (FID) Part of Core Web Vitals. Measures the interactivity of a page by tracking the time between user interaction (such as clicking a link or entering text) when the browser begins processing the event. Goal: Reduce FID to 100 milliseconds or better for the 75% percentile for all pages or at least the most critical pages. Cumulative layout shift (CLS) Part of Core Web Vitals. Measures how much the page layout shifts during render. Goal: Maintain a score of 0.1 or less for the 75% percentile for all pages or at least the most critical pages. Prerequisites Required knowledge Familiarity with synthetic monitoring Familiarity with browser monitoring Familiarity with basic Browser UI views Familiarity with SPA data in Browser UI Required Installation and Configuration Browser Pro installed in all pages SPA enabled for single page applications Synthetics monitors configured: Ping monitors configured for anonymous users Scripted synthetics check configured for login flow Monitors should be configured to test from all regions applicable to your users Monitors should be configured for each domain and each login flow Data retention for browser events greater than or equal to 2x an average sprint Establish current state Review instrumented pages Validate Browser URL grouping Understand how you will segment your data Import the quality foundation dashboard Capture current performance for each dashboard page Review instrumented pages Review Browser apps and pages to make sure that everything you expect to report back to New Relic is. You can do this by reviewing the Page Views tab in the Browser UI or running the following query: SELECT uniques(pageUrl) from PageView LIMIT MAX Copy You may need to filter out URLs that contain request or customer ID. Validate Browser URL grouping Ensure Browser segments are captured correctly so user experience performance is measurable in both the NewRelic UI as well as at the aggregate level when querying via NRQL. A segment is the text between two / in a URL or between . of a domain name. For example, in the URL website.com/product/widget-name, the segments are: website .com product widget-name When there are a lot of URLs with a lot of segments, URLs can get crushed, so that website.com/product/widget-name becomes website.com/ or website.com/product/. In this example, the first crushed URL is not particularly useful, but the second one may be a useful way of aggregating customer experience data for the product. Not sure whether you need to tune your configuration? Import the Segment Allow List Investigation dashboard in GitHub to help. Once you’ve identified which segments to add, you can add them using Segment allow lists in Browser. Understand how you will segment your data Make Customer Experience data understandable and actionable by breaking it out into different segments. In this case, segments refer to groups of data. It does not refer to sections of URLs, as in segment allow lists. Consider the following statements: Most of our users experience 3 seconds or better to first input delay. On average, we see 2 seconds to the largest contentful paint. Last week, there were 1 million page views. Compared to: Most of the users in the US, Canada, and EMEA experience 2 seconds or better to first input delay. Malaysia and Indonesia users experience 4 seconds; we are looking into this. Customers buying car insurance typically see 1 second to largest contentful paint. For home insurance, it’s 4 seconds. Last week, there were 700,000 page views on mobile browser apps compared to 300,000 on desktop. Let’s make sure we’re optimizing our mobile experience. Typical segmentation involves breaking down user experience into the following categories: Segment Guidance Region/Location Basic: Group by country. Browser events automatically contain the country code of requests, so there is nothing you need to do to break it out further. Advanced: Make regional grouping match regional SLO groups by creating your own region attribute using custom attributes in Browser. Facet by countryCode. Related attributes: regionCode city asnLatitude asnLongitude Device Break out performance and engagement device type so you can understand: Typical breakdown of desktop vs mobile browser users Experience of desktop vs mobile browser users Facet by deviceType. Related attributes: userAgentName userAgentOS userAgentVersion Product/Line of Business In this scenario, a product is a separate line of business or service provided by your organization. Some examples of industries and respective products: An insurance company that sells both car and house insurance A media company that has multiple streaming services or channels A travel company that provides car rental as well as hotel bookings Basic: Break out performance by product by: Faceting on pageUrl: Use this approach when multiple products are grouped into one browser app in New Relic. Faceting by appName: Use this approach when each product is instrumented as a separate web app. Grouping by appName and then facet: Use this approach when there are multiple apps in browser supporting one product. Advanced: Add product offering as a custom attribute to browser pages using custom attributes. Environment During instrumentation or afterwards, follow a naming convention that specifies the environment in Browser. Well named browser apps specify product and/or function as well as environment. Examples: account-management.prod hotels-book.prod car-insurance.uat Using app naming conventions to specify the environment supports filtering data in both the UI and in dashboards. For more information, see the documentation for how to rename Browser apps. Team In some organizations, a single team supports multiple products, while in others, a product is big enough to be supported by multiple teams. Report on team performance against customer experience or engagement by either adding the team name to the Browser app name (for example, account-management.prod.unicorn-squad) or by using custom attributes. Import the quality foundation dashboard This step creates the dashboard that you will use to measure your customer experience and improve it. Clone the GitHub repository. Follow the GitHub repository README instructions to implement the dashboard. Make sure to align the dashboard to lines of business or customer facing offerings rather than teams. This ensures optimization time is spent where it is most impactful. Capture current performance for each dashboard page Follow the GitHub README instructions. Use the dashboard from the previous step to understand the overall performance for each line of business. If relevant, apply filters to see performance across region or device. If values drop below targets and it matters, add it to the sheet as a candidate for improvement. Not worth tracking: A company that sells insurance in the US only notices poor performance in Malaysia. Worth tracking: A company that sells insurance in the US only notices poor performance with respect to mobile users in the US. Improvement Process Plan your work Decide which KPIs to improve Improve targeted KPIs Improve page load performance Improve AJAX response times Improve the AJAX error rate Improve JavaScript errors Plan your work Whether you have a dedicated initiative to improve performance or classifying as ongoing maintenance, you need to track your progress at the end of every sprint. Decide which KPIs to improve You now know what your user experience looks like across multiple lines of business. Where should you be improving? Start with business priorities. If you have clear business directives or have access to a senior manager above who does, you should focus on what matters most to your organization. For example, let’s say your company has recently launched a new initiative around a line of business but the KPIs associated with the UI are below target. This is where you should focus time initially. Next, focus on KPIs for each line of business. Finally, filter each line of business by device, region, etc., to see if additional focus is needed for specific regions or devices. Improve targeted KPIs To track your progress, create a new dashboard or add a new page to the existing dashboard and name it Quality Foundation KPI Improvement. For more information, see Improve Web Uptime. Improve page load performance Narrow your focus to specific pages that aren’t meeting target KPI values. For each page load KPI result that is out of bounds in the Quality Foundation Dashboard, remove the COMPARE WITH clause and add FACET pageUrl/targetGroupedUrl LIMIT MAX to find which pages are the poor performers. Use targetGroupedUrl when there are many results; for example, when the customer ID is part of the URL. Otherwise, use pageUrl. Original Dashboard query: FROM PageViewTiming SELECT percentile(largestContentfulPaint, 75) WHERE appName ='WebPortal' AND pageUrl LIKE '%phone%' SINCE 1 week AGO COMPARE WITH 1 week AGO Copy New query to identify problem pages: FROM PageViewTiming SELECT percentile(largestContentfulPaint, 75) WHERE appName ='WebPortal' AND pageUrl LIKE '%phone%' FACET targetGroupedUrl LIMIT MAX Copy Once you have identified which pages to improve, improve them following these best practices. Improve AJAX response times Find the slow requests. Go to the Ajax duration widget on the dashboard. View query, then open in query builder. Add facet requestUrl LIMIT MAX to the end of the query. Run the query. View the results as a table and save to your KPI Improvement dashboard as LOB - AjaxResponseTimes. Focus improving requests with a timeToSettle > 2.5s. Use New Relic’s recommended best practices to improve response times. See AJAX troubleshooting tips. Improve the AJAX error rate Find the failing requests. Go to Dashboards > Query builder. Enter FROM AjaxRequest SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE httpResponseCode >= 400) WHERE httpResponseCode >= 200 AND <Ajax Request filter> SINCE 1 week AGO facet pageUrl, appName Copy Run the query. View the results as a table and save to your KPI Improvement dashboard as LOB - Pages with AjaxErrors. Run the query again for the most problematic pages to find the requests that are failing: FROM AjaxRequest SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE httpResponseCode >= 400) WHERE httpResponseCode >= 200 AND pageUrl=<problematic page> AND appName = <corresponding app> <Ajax Request filter> SINCE 1 week AGO facet requestUrl Copy Use New Relic’s recommended best practices to improve response times. See AJAX troubleshooting tips. Improve JavaScript errors Find the most common failures. Go to Dashboards > Query builder Enter FROM JavaScriptError SELECT count(errorClass) SINCE 1 week AGO WHERE <PageView filter> FACET transactionName, errorClass, errorMessage, domain Copy Run the query. View the results as a table and save to your KPI Improvement dashboard as LOB - Javascript Errors. Use this information to figure out which errors need to be addressed Use New Relic’s recommended best practices to resolve errors that need addressing. See JavaScript errors page: Detect and analyze errors. Remove third party errors that do not add value. You may be using a third party JavaScript that is noisy but works as expected. You can take a couple of approaches: Remove the domain name from the JavaScript error/Pageview ratio widget and add it as its own widget so you can see unexpected changes. You can alert on this using Baseline NRQL alerts. Drop the JavaScript error using drop filters. Only use this option if the volume of errors is impacting your data ingest in a significant way. Be as specific as you can in the drop filter. Conclusion Best practices to adopt Revisit performance metrics (shared in this document as Quality Foundation KPIs) at the end of each sprint. Incorporate performance improvements into developer sprints. Openly share metrics with the lines of the business you support as well as other internal stakeholders. Define Customer Experience SLOs. Create alerts for business critical drops in Quality Foundation KPIs. Value Realization At the end of this process you should now: Have an understanding of your end user experience in a way that is tangible, actionable, and easy for engineers as well as the business to understand. Know how releases impact your end customers. Know how your customers are impacted by service, infrastructure, or network level events. See latency issues caused by backend services if they exist. Have created, or be on the path to create, a common language with business owners so you are working together. This can open new avenues for recognition and sponsorship for new projects.",

      "body": "Page load performance measurement continues to evolve. In order to improve the overall performance and user experience, it helps to understand the different metrics and how they relate to each other. Before following the guidance below, narrow your scope to specific pages that you are trying to improve. For maximum impact, focus on pages that are frequently accessed but have a lower than accepted score for the 75th percentile of users. Page Load KPI How to improve time to first byte (TTFB): Time to first byte measures the time from navigation start (a user clicking a link) to the browser receiving the first byte of the response from the server. If users in the 75th percentile are experiencing a TTFB of greater than 0.5s for one or more of your pages, you can break timings down further by querying the following attributes in PageView: backendDuration connectionSetupDuration dnsLookupDuration networkDuration Frequently slowness prior to rendering is caused by slowness in the backend, either from third party APIs or backend applications. Synthetics monitoring for third party APIs helps operations and development teams understand when the root cause is outside of their control. Even if you cannot control the code, you can influence the outcome by sharing synthetics results with the third party to help them understand what your customers are experiencing. If the backend applications are owned by you or your team, you can use APM agents, Pixie, or OpenTelemetry to understand and manage performance. To make cross team communication easier, we recommend implementing Service Level Management boundaries. Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) Cumulative layout shift is a score that indicates how much content shifts once it has already loaded. General tips and tricks for improving CLS: Specify dimensions for stylesheets and let the browser’s default CSS control the aspect ratio. Statically reserve space for ad slots. Avoid ads near the top of the viewport. Avoid inserting new content above existing content. Precompute sufficient space for embeds. Additional resources: Google’s approach to CLS optimization Lighthouse is a tool by Google that runs a synthetic test against a specific page and provides a list of recommendations that include how to optimize CLS. Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) Largest contentful paint measures the difference between the start of page render until the time to paint the largest content element. Common causes for a slow lcp, according to web.dev: Slow server response times Render-blocking JavaScript and CSS Slow resource load times Client-side rendering Use Browser session trace information to understand which of the common causes above factor into the particular page you are trying to optimize. Approaches to improve LCP: Making use of CDNs and paying attention to caching and edge server performance Establishing third party connections early Delaying non-critical Javascript and CSS Additional resources: Google’s approach to LCP optimization Lighthouse is a tool by Google that runs a synthetic test against a specific page and provides a list of recommendations that include how to optimize CLS. First Input Delay (FID) First input delay is the time between when a user first interacts with a page to the time when the browser is able to respond. It’s a field metric that varies based on real user behavior (results vary based on user impatience and action timing) but can be optimized by reducing TBT, total blocking time. To do this, you need to: Break up long blocking tasks. Optimize bloated JavaScript. Look at moving logic server side and/or use web workers to run threads in the background. Use Browser session trace information to understand where your blocking intervals are occurring and for how long they last.

      "body": "Overview Bottom of the funnel analysis is about improving conversion by focusing on performance at the end of the user journey. Most sites and apps are built with one or more purposes in mind. If there is a purpose, there is likely to be a user journey. Some examples: Purpose User journey Brand awareness Download a whitepaper Customer support Raise a support ticket Customer services (registration, forms, payments) Make a payment Entertainment Stream a movie Goods Buy clothes and accessories Informational purposes Find a support program in your state Lead generation Join distribution list to get promotions and coupons Outreach Get information about events in your town Services (Travel, rentals, bookings) Book a flight Social media Share a selfie When a user completes a journey, we think of it as a conversion. All conversions have a value - from a few dollars to thousands. The best way to improve the conversion rate is to start at the bottom of the funnel, when the intent to complete the user journey is clear. What if I have performance issues in the middle of the funnel? Any glaring issues with your app or site should be addressed, no matter where they occur. When it comes to optimizing conversion, it's better to start at the bottom of the funnel for two reasons: Higher return on investment. Users at this stage are already more likely to convert. Addressing performance issues here will see an immediate impact on the bottom line. If you have issues at the bottom of the funnel, optimizing earlier stages may not have much of an impact on the conversion rate. Once you've optimized the bottom of the funnel you can use the same techniques to optimize earlier stages of the user journey. Optimizing the top or the middle of the funnel without focusing on the bottom first is a bit like fishing with a holey net. You can get more fish into the net by optimizing when and where you fish but you risk losing all that optimization as soon as you take the net out of the water. Desired outcome Increase revenue by resolving issues that appear when a user attempts to complete an action. Key performance indicators Bottom of the Funnel Analysis measures the following KPIs: KPI Description Goal Bottom of the Funnel Success Rate/Conversion Rate The rate of conversion once a user has gone far enough to demonstrate intent to complete an action to actual completion. Examples of this are rate of: Checkout -> Order submission Insurance form review -> submission Completing sign up details -> submission Increase the rate of conversion by addressing errors and latency at the bottom of the funnel Revenue at Risk due to Latency Value of a conversion * number of pages or interactions in the bottom of the funnel that are slower than the industry threshold. Focus on reducing this value by improving page KPIs Revenue at Risk due to Errors Value of a conversion * number of backend errors in the bottom of the funnel interactions Tune this value to make it meaningful by filtering out errors that aren't visible to the end user. Once this is meaningful, focus on reducing it. Create an alert to notify you if it suddenly trends upward. Prerequisites Required knowledge Familiarity with synthetic monitoring Familiarity with browser monitoring Familiarity with basic Browser UI views Familiarity with SPA data in Browser UI Required installation and configuration Browser Pro installed in relevant pages SPA enabled for single page applications Data retention for browser events greater than or equal to 2x an average sprint Establish current state Identify where the bottom of the funnel starts Distinguish between pages and actions Create a scripted synthetics monitor for the bottom of the funnel Import the bottom of the funnel dashboard Capture current performance Identify where the bottom of the funnel starts The Bottom of the Funnel is focused on the final steps of a user journey where a user has gone far enough to show intent to complete the journey. Some examples: Ecommerce user journey The user journey is simplified so you can focus on where the bottom of the funnel begins - at checkout. Most users entering the checkout phase plan to purchase something. Reducing errors and latency from this point onward is more likely to improve conversions than focusing on any other part of the funnel. Car insurance purchase user journey In the example above, you have the user’s interest in car insurance as they enter information, but you do not know their intent until they see the quote and continue to proceed. Distinguish between pages and actions The final steps of a user’s journey is likely to be a mix of full page loads and AJAX calls. You will need to know all pages and Ajax requests for the next step. If you are not sure which requests are running from the page in question, you can run: SELECT count(*) FROM AjaxRequest WHERE pageUrl like ‘%FILTER%’ FACET groupedRequestUrl SINCE 1 DAY AGO Copy Create a scripted monitor for the bottom of the funnel Make sure you have a scripted monitor for each path through the bottom of the funnel. The goal is to make sure your bottom of the funnel services are working around the clock. For example, you may have a checkout flow that calls a different payment API depending on the customer’s payment preferences. Import the Bottom of the Funnel Dashboard Follow the instructions documented in the public GitHub README. Capture Current Performance Follow the GitHub repository README instructions. Use the dashboard from the previous step to understand the bottom of the funnel performance. Create a plan to improve KPIs that don’t meet target values as well as reduce revenue at risk. Improvement process Plan your work Whether you have a dedicated initiative to improve performance or classifying as ongoing maintenance, you need to track your progress at the end of every sprint. For detailed information, see: Improve uptime Improve page load performance Improve AJAX performance Advanced topics Should I apply segmentation? Segmentation (breaking out performance into cohorts, such as region and device type) is a good idea if: Your organization has initiatives tied to addressing a target audience from a particular cohort that you can segment by using either custom attributes or data that is already available in New Relic. You are already familiar with Bottom of the Funnel Analysis and there is a significant enough difference in performance among different cohorts to warrant tracking and/or developer focus. Conclusion Best practices going forward Revisit performance metrics at the end of each sprint. Any time the user journey changes, revisit if the steps at the Bottom of the Funnel are the same. Incorporate changes in developer sprints as needed. Openly share metrics with the lines of the business you support as well as other internal stakeholders. Revisit your Customer Experience SLOs. Do you need to define more ambitious SLOs for the end of the funnel? Create alerts for business critical drops in Quality Foundation KPIs. Value realization At the end of this process you should: Know your user conversion rate and have addressed errors or performance issues that negatively impact it. Increased revenue for your company. Created, or be on the path to create, a common language with business owners so you are working together; opening new avenues for recognition and sponsorship for new projects.",

Include a link to the workload in the alert runbook. You can also find the correlated workload for a synthetic using global search. Make sure that alerts are configured for each tier of your workload. This way you can see the health of each of the tiers in one view. This will save you time in troubleshooting. You do not need to create alert notifications for each tier to benefit from this view. 3. Investigate outages at lowest tier first When an outage occurs, start investigating at the lowest tier that is alerting. For instance, if you see that you have an infrastructure issue and a JavaScript issue, investigate infrastructure prior to javascript unless you have a second person or team you can delegate that to. Use the tools that are available to you for troubleshooting: Make sure that distributed tracing is enabled for browser monitoring as well as APM.

In order to improve the overall performance and user experience, it helps to understand the different metrics and how they relate to each other. Before following the guidance below, narrow your scope to specific pages that you are trying to improve. For maximum impact, focus on pages that are frequently accessed but have a lower than accepted score for the 75th percentile of users. Page Load KPI How to improve time to first byte (TTFB): Time to first byte measures the time from navigation start (a user clicking a link) to the browser receiving the first byte of the response from the server. If users in the 75th percentile are experiencing a TTFB of greater than 0.5s for one or more of your pages, you can break timings down further by querying the following attributes in PageView: backendDuration connectionSetupDuration dnsLookupDuration networkDuration Frequently slowness prior to rendering is caused by slowness in the backend, either from third party APIs or backend applications. Synthetics monitoring for third party APIs helps operations and development teams understand when the root cause is outside of their control. Even if you cannot control the code, you can influence the outcome by sharing synthetics results with the third party to help them understand what your customers are experiencing. If the backend applications are owned by you or your team, you can use APM agents, Pixie, or OpenTelemetry to understand and manage performance. To make cross team communication easier, we recommend implementing Service Level Management boundaries. Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) Cumulative layout shift is a score that indicates how much content shifts once it has already loaded. General tips and tricks for improving CLS: Specify dimensions for stylesheets and let the browser’s default CSS control the aspect ratio. Statically reserve space for ad slots. Avoid ads near the top of the viewport. Avoid inserting new content above existing content. Precompute sufficient space for embeds. Additional resources: Google’s approach to CLS optimization Lighthouse is a tool by Google that runs a synthetic test against a specific page and provides a list of recommendations that include how to optimize CLS. Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) Largest contentful paint measures the difference between the start of page render until the time to paint the largest content element. Common causes for a slow lcp, according to web.dev: Slow server response times Render-blocking JavaScript and CSS Slow resource load times Client-side rendering Use Browser session trace information to understand which of the common causes above factor into the particular page you are trying to optimize. Approaches to improve LCP: Making use of CDNs and paying attention to caching and edge server performance Establishing third party connections early Delaying non-critical Javascript and CSS Additional resources: Google’s approach to LCP optimization Lighthouse is a tool by Google that runs a synthetic test against a specific page and provides a list of recommendations that include how to optimize CLS. First Input Delay (FID) First input delay is the time between when a user first interacts with a page to the time when the browser is able to respond. It’s a field metric that varies based on real user behavior (results vary based on user impatience and action timing) but can be optimized by reducing TBT, total blocking time. To do this, you need to: Break up long blocking tasks. Optimize bloated JavaScript. Look at moving logic server side and/or use web workers to run threads in the background. Use Browser session trace information to understand where your blocking intervals are occurring and for how long they last.

      "body": "Overview Bottom of the funnel analysis is about improving conversion by focusing on performance at the end of the user journey. Most sites and apps are built with one or more purposes in mind. If there is a purpose, there is likely to be a user journey. Some examples: Purpose User journey Brand awareness Download a whitepaper Customer support Raise a support ticket Customer services (registration, forms, payments) Make a payment Entertainment Stream a movie Goods Buy clothes and accessories Informational purposes Find a support program in your state Lead generation Join distribution list to get promotions and coupons Outreach Get information about events in your town Services (Travel, rentals, bookings) Book a flight Social media Share a selfie When a user completes a journey, we think of it as a conversion. All conversions have a value - from a few dollars to thousands. The best way to improve the conversion rate is to start at the bottom of the funnel, when the intent to complete the user journey is clear. What if I have performance issues in the middle of the funnel? Any glaring issues with your app or site should be addressed, no matter where they occur. When it comes to optimizing conversion, it's better to start at the bottom of the funnel for two reasons: Higher return on investment. Users at this stage are already more likely to convert. Addressing performance issues here will see an immediate impact on the bottom line. If you have issues at the bottom of the funnel, optimizing earlier stages may not have much of an impact on the conversion rate. Once you've optimized the bottom of the funnel you can use the same techniques to optimize earlier stages of the user journey. Optimizing the top or the middle of the funnel without focusing on the bottom first is a bit like fishing with a holey net. You can get more fish into the net by optimizing when and where you fish but you risk losing all that optimization as soon as you take the net out of the water. Desired outcome Increase revenue by resolving issues that appear when a user attempts to complete an action. Key performance indicators Bottom of the Funnel Analysis measures the following KPIs: KPI Description Goal Bottom of the Funnel Success Rate/Conversion Rate The rate of conversion once a user has gone far enough to demonstrate intent to complete an action to actual completion. Examples of this are rate of: Checkout -> Order submission Insurance form review -> submission Completing sign up details -> submission Increase the rate of conversion by addressing errors and latency at the bottom of the funnel Revenue at Risk due to Latency Value of a conversion * number of pages or interactions in the bottom of the funnel that are slower than the industry threshold. Focus on reducing this value by improving page KPIs Revenue at Risk due to Errors Value of a conversion * number of backend errors in the bottom of the funnel interactions Tune this value to make it meaningful by filtering out errors that aren't visible to the end user. Once this is meaningful, focus on reducing it. Create an alert to notify you if it suddenly trends upward. Prerequisites Required knowledge Familiarity with synthetic monitoring Familiarity with browser monitoring Familiarity with basic Browser UI views Familiarity with SPA data in Browser UI Required installation and configuration Browser Pro installed in relevant pages SPA enabled for single page applications Data retention for browser events greater than or equal to 2x an average sprint Establish current state Identify where the bottom of the funnel starts Distinguish between pages and actions Create a scripted synthetics monitor for the bottom of the funnel Import the bottom of the funnel dashboard Capture current performance Identify where the bottom of the funnel starts The Bottom of the Funnel is focused on the final steps of a user journey where a user has gone far enough to show intent to complete the journey. Some examples: Ecommerce user journey The user journey is simplified so you can focus on where the bottom of the funnel begins - at checkout. Most users entering the checkout phase plan to purchase something. Reducing errors and latency from this point onward is more likely to improve conversions than focusing on any other part of the funnel. Car insurance purchase user journey In the example above, you have the user’s interest in car insurance as they enter information, but you do not know their intent until they see the quote and continue to proceed. Distinguish between pages and actions The final steps of a user’s journey is likely to be a mix of full page loads and AJAX calls. You will need to know all pages and Ajax requests for the next step. If you are not sure which requests are running from the page in question, you can run: SELECT count(*) FROM AjaxRequest WHERE pageUrl like ‘%FILTER%’ FACET groupedRequestUrl SINCE 1 DAY AGO Copy Create a scripted monitor for the bottom of the funnel Make sure you have a scripted monitor for each path through the bottom of the funnel. The goal is to make sure your bottom of the funnel services are working around the clock. For example, you may have a checkout flow that calls a different payment API depending on the customer’s payment preferences. Import the Bottom of the Funnel Dashboard Follow the instructions documented in the public GitHub README. Capture Current Performance Follow the GitHub repository README instructions. Use the dashboard from the previous step to understand the bottom of the funnel performance. Create a plan to improve KPIs that don’t meet target values as well as reduce revenue at risk.

      "body": "Overview IT Operations is expected to provide services that meet the business’s requirements for performance and reliability. However, many ops teams attempt to measure performance and reliability using legacy methods, like measuring resource consumption. That, in turn, requires that they create complex dashboards of granular metrics which they then try to correlate with application performance and reliability. These complex dashboards require subject matter experts to interpret the results for business stakeholders. Legacy methods create barriers to understanding what a good system state looks like and how bad system states impact the business. Essentially, IT ends up not sharing a common metric vocabulary with the business. This fundamental disconnect will result in the perception that IT is not able to deliver the services that the business requires, with all the implications and impacts that perception carries. Service Level Management (SLM) eliminates that disconnect by better explaining the overall performance of a system in terms that are easily understood by both IT and the business. The intent is to show whether or not the system is meeting its performance and reliability expectations, and if it is trending toward or away from improvement, so proactive steps can be taken. The end goal is that systems are better oriented toward desired business outcomes with IT’s attention focused on issues in areas with the highest business impact. You are a good candidate for SLM if any of the following are true: The business impact of performance and reliability issues are not well understood by all stakeholders. Your MTTx is too high. You are collecting many resource consumption metrics (such as CPU, disk, or memory) or are maintaining many metric correlation rules in order to identify system problems. You can’t see the value of your observability tool(s). Desired outcome Service Level Management’s overall goal is to easily measure and communicate the overall health, performance, and quality of your digital products and services to all stakeholders. By implementing SLM at key output points in your systems, you will have a simpler and more responsive observability practice, tighter alignment with the business, and faster paths to improvement. The SLM process described in this guide will help you to identify the points in your systems where you should measure the key performance metrics of service performance and quality. It will also define and drive a simpler alerting strategy, continuous improvement methodologies, and improved problem resolution workflows. Key performance indicators You will use the SLM process to collect and measure the following KPIs, often referred to as the “Golden Signals”: Service response time Service response time measures the amount of time a service requires to process a transaction. It starts when a transaction request is received by the service and ends when the response is sent. Goal: Reduce transaction response time. Best practices: Measure response time at service boundaries. Use continuous improvement processes to drive down response times. Ensure that non-business transactions (such as health checks) are not included or measured. Map this KPI back to business impact. Report KPIs to all stakeholders. Service quality Service quality is the number of transactions that result in an unhandled error. Typically, these are transactions whose HTTP response code is greater than or equal to 400. Goal: Reduce the number of unhandled errors. Best practices: Measure error rates at service boundaries. Continually identify and remediate sources of high error volumes. Map this KPI back to business impact. Report KPIs to all stakeholders. Service level objective attainment SLO attainment is the percentage of time a business service is meeting its response time and quality goals. Goal: Improve response time and quality to ensure high SLO attainment. Best practices: Use continuous improvement processes to maintain / improve SLO attainment. Map this KPI back to business impact. Report KPIs to all stakeholders. Service uptime Service uptime is the percentage of time a service can be reached by at least one client. Typically this is measured using synthetic transactions from representative remote locations. Goal: Use continuous improvement processes to watch uptime metrics and take appropriate steps to ensure uptime meets business requirements. Best practices: Use continuous improvement processes to maintain / improve SLO attainment. Map this KPI back to business impact Report KPIs to all stakeholders. These KPIs directly measure the most important aspects of an IT service, speed and quality, in a way that is easy and intuitive to understand and communicate to technical and non-technical stakeholders. Prerequisites Before you begin, if you don’t have equivalent experience, you should complete the New Relic University (NRU) Overview Course. You should also have a basic understanding of: New Relic One APM and infrastructure monitoring New Relic One Dashboards and NRQL New Relic One alerting best practices Establish current state As with any continuous improvement process, the first step of SLM is to establish the current state of your KPIs. To do so, you will need to perform the following tasks: Determine in-scope services Identify service boundaries Deploy instrumentation Perform SLM educational workshops Analyze KPIs and set baseline SLOs Establish / optimize Alerting Build problem resolution workflows Execute continuous improvement review To help illustrate this process, we are going to apply it to an example IT service, an ecommerce site for a cellular telephone provider. Determine in-scope services You should first identify the IT services that are going to be in-scope for the initial iteration of the SLM process. These services should be key to ongoing business operations and as close to your customers as possible. Most commonly, you will be applying the SLM process to an application, since that is the service your customers are expecting you to deliver. SLM can be applied to infrastructure-based services; however, it is a more advanced application of SLM which is applicable to a much smaller set of organizations. If you are considering implementing SLM for infrastructure, you should ensure that the service(s) you are instrumenting are actually the closest to your organization’s end-customer. If your infrastructure is hosting a customer-facing app, then the app should be the target of SLM. Absent anything else, a good methodology for identifying in-scope services is to consult your disaster recovery plan. Typically, the most critical business services are prioritized there. Identify service boundaries Next, you should identify each service’s boundary, which is the service component that is closest to the client sending transaction requests. This should be the application receiving the request from the client, browser, or mobile device, and may also be known as the \"external API.\" Reverse proxies, CDNs, and load balancers are not part of the service boundary. Their service level compliance should be measured via the Uptime KPI (external test requests for connectivity). If your services are using APM, you can identify service boundaries using the service map or dependencies features. A service component is on a boundary if it has no inbound connections. In the example below (from a service map), you can see that the WebPortal is on the boundary. An example of using service maps in New Relic One to identify service boundaries. In contrast, the following screenshot (from the dependencies page) shows that the Inventory Service is not on a boundary since it has incoming connections from the WebPortal. Subsequent examples in this guide will build on the WebPortal service boundary. An example of using the dependencies UI in New Relic One to identify service boundaries. You should understand that the SLM process defines a service boundary as being downstream of any dependencies. The service boundary is the point where all the effects and impacts of dependent services are measured as they contribute to the total response time and quality of the service. By measuring service level compliance at the boundary, you will be able to see the impact that all service components upstream of the boundary have on service delivery. This means that your initial steps into SLM can focus on the services that are closest to your users, yet still capture the contribution of more distant services. As your practice matures, you will be able to identify the next round of upstream services that would benefit from direct SLM instrumentation. In our example, the WebService is downstream of the Fulfillment, Plan, Promo, Login, and Inventory services (among others). By applying SLM at the WebService, we will be seeing the impact of the upstream services on the WebService. Any impactful issues with an upstream service will be reflected in the WebService’s service level KPIs. By instrumenting one service, we are capturing the contribution of five additional services. This greatly simplifies our observability practice. In time, problematic upstream services will self-identify themselves as candidates for direct SLM instrumentation. Deploy instrumentation To collect SLM service response time and transaction success KPIs, you need to deploy instrumentation into the components of your production apps on the service boundary. If you don’t have instrumentation that can do this in production already, then you will need to engage the teams and stakeholders that can help you to get this done. For detailed information on deploying the New Relic instrumentation that can gather this information, see our APM install documentation. The uptime KPIs can be collected using synthetic transactions, which don’t require any instrumentation to be added to the service. If needed, you can start your SLM journey there while waiting for the direct instrumentation to be deployed. The uptime tests should perform a basic, yet realistic, check of the service’s functionality. For detailed information on this capability, see our synthetic monitoring documentation. Perform SLM educational workshops You should share the self-paced New Relic Essentials training course with the appropriate stakeholders so they can understand how the New Relic technology platform will aid in the SLM process. Analyze KPIs and set baseline SLOs The SLM process uses speed and quality as its key performance indicators. In technical terms, speed means response time and quality means error rate. At the end of this phase, you will have created baseline service level objectives for each service in the form of a percentage. For example: “98% of service X’s transactions will be error free and occur in less than 500 milliseconds.” For each in-scope service, you should analyze speed and quality at the service boundary. This will give you an overall understanding of how the entire service and all of its dependencies are performing. As you iterate through the SLM process, you can then identify and prioritize the upstream service components that require direct SLM instrumentation. To analyze KPIs, you should do the following for each service: Identify the volume and 95th percentile response time for each of the service’s transactions over a relatively long period of time, typically between seven days and one month. It is important that you use percentile rather than average, so you can see the entire range of response times, including outliers. If you use averages, you will hide outliers. The following is an example of the initial baseline report. Here you can see the volume, p95 response time, and error volume for the WebPortal and a few other services. The WebPortal’s p95 response time is .36 seconds (or 36 milliseconds), so we have decided to set the SLO target to 0.4 seconds. Example of an initial baseline report measuring volume and 95th percentile response time. Next you should review and identify any non-business transactions, since they should not be included in the SLO attainment calculation. For example, you should not include health check / keep alive transactions and you may not want to include administrative transactions. In the example below, we are looking at some of the transactions from the WebPortal service. We have decided that the about.jsp transaction is a non-business transaction that should not be tracked in our SLO attainment calculation. Example showing transaction breakdowns from the initial baseline report to help identify what to track (or not track) for SLO. Finally, import and edit the SLM template dashboard to exclude non-business transactions. Then use the p95 response time as your baseline response time service level objective. For the example chart, we chose 0.4 seconds as our response time threshold and set our service level objective to 95%. This means that we are expecting 95% of the WebPortal’s business transactions to complete in 0.4 seconds or less and without an error. The red line on the chart shows us our 95% service level objective. Example chart now excluding the non-business transactions. As you can see, there are periods of hours where the app is not meeting its SLOs. If we are going to maintain the 95% target, we would need to identify and fix the service components or dependencies that are causing these problems. Establish or optimize alerting After you have set your service level objectives, you will then configure alerts that will inform you when your SLO attainment has dipped below your goal. These alerts will show you when incidents with a high business impact are occurring. When they are triggered, they should be given a high priority and you should engage the proper teams to start the process of diagnosing the source of the problem. A basic starting point is to configure an alert that triggers when your SLO attainment has dipped under your baseline for more than 10 minutes. For more information, see our documentation on configuring alerts. Build problem resolution workflows As we’ve been discussing, the intent of the SLM process is to identify when business impacting issues occur in your IT services. When this occurs, a diagnostic investigation should be launched. The goal of the investigation is to identify what service element is causing the business impacting issue. SLM tells you that there is a problem with business impact, the diagnostic process helps you to find where the problem is. Typically, your high level diagnostic workflow will start at the service boundary and go as follows: Look at the service’s individual transactions and see which one(s) are departing from their performance and/or response time SLOs. Look at each service component responsible for delivering that transaction until you find the component that is failing. Use in-depth diagnostics to identify the root cause of the problem and then resolve it. Execute continuous improvement review This is an ongoing phase of the SLM process where data is reviewed and adjustments are made as required. Your KPIs should be reported to upper management to ensure that stakeholder teams are appropriately prioritizing work and that you are meeting the SLO goals you’ve set. Periodic KPIs should be recorded and retained over periods of months to years to establish a baseline and to show the rate of improvement. In addition, each time you execute the continuous improvement process, you should: Review each service’s architecture to ensure your instrumentation is deployed at the boundary and that there are no observabilty gaps. Review each service’s transactions to confirm that only business transactions are included in your SLO calculations. Review each service’s SLO and determine if it meets the business’s performance and quality requirements. If it does not, then the SLO should be changed and the appropriate stakeholders notified so they can work to improve performance and quality. Review your SLO attainment and determine if any upstream services should be added to the SLM process. Next steps After you’ve established the SLM process, you should identify other services that would benefit from SLM instrumentation. These may be other front-line services or upstream dependencies of services that are covered by SLOs that have shown themselves to be frequent contributors to SLO attainment failures. As you do this, you should start to measure and report your SLM coverage as a percentage of applications covered by SLOs. For example, you may say that 20% of your apps have established SLOs. As SLM expands into your organization and as its value is seen by management and other stakeholders, you may find that you need a dedicated team to manage the SLM process. The SLM process should also become a primary driver to help you prioritize issue resolution activities. SLO attainment failures are a direct indicator that your IT services are having a negative business impact which is visible to your customers as poor performance and/or unhandled errors. Value realization Once the SLM process is established, you will see a reduction in the effort required to identify business impacting issues, a better ability to communicate with your business stakeholders, and an easier time proving the business’ return on investment in IT services. Your SLM KPIs will provide quantifiable proof of these improvements. In addtion, you should be able to simplify your observability strategy by removing or reducing your dependency on legacy consumption metrics and the logic required to correlate them against your true goal of measuring performance and quality. Once you are firmly on the path to SLM's goals, consider moving to other use cases within the Uptime, Performance, and Reliability value stream, such as Service Level Management, or Reliability Engineering. You can also move to other observability maturity value streams, such as Customer Experience. Additional resources Need help getting started?

      "body": "Overview Teams suffer from alert fatigue when they experience high alert volumes and alerts that are not aligned to business impact. As they start to believe that most alerts are false, they may prioritize easy to resolve alerts over others.  Also, they may close unresolved incidents so they can stay within their SLA targets. The result will be slower incident responses, magnified issue scope, and increased severity when true business impacting issues occur. Alert Quality Management (AQM) focuses on reducing the number of nuisance incidents so that you focus only on alerts with true business impact.  This reduces alert fatigue and ensures that you and your team focus your attention on the right places at the right times. You are a good candidate for AQM if: You have too many alerts. You have alerts that stay open for long time periods. Your alerts are not relevant. Your customers discover your issues before your monitoring tools do. You can't see the value of your observability tool(s). Desired outcome An alert strategy based on measuring business impact will result in faster response times and greater proactive awareness of critical events.  An improved alert signal to noise ratio reduces confusion and improves rapid identification and problem isolation. AQM's overall goal is to ensure that fewer, more valuable, incidents are created, resulting in: Increased uptime and availability Reduced MTTR Decreased alert volume The ability to easily identify alerts that are not valuable, so you can either make them valuable or remove them. The AQM process described in this guide generates the key performance indicators and metrics that you will use to measure progress towards these goals.  The metrics are measured in real time, published in a dashboard, and are used to drive a continuous improvement process that identifies and reduces nuisance alerts and increases user engagement in incident investigation. AQM does not encompass anomaly detection or AIOps, which are designed to detect unknown or unexpected modes of failure.  The two practices (AQM and ML/AI) work hand in hand, they are not mutually exclusive. Key performance indicators You will use the AQM process to collect and measure the following KPIs: Incident volume Incident Count Accumulated incident time Mean Time to Close (MTTC) Percent Under 5 Minutes User Engagement Mean Time to Investigate  (MTTI) % of Incidents Investigated These KPIs will help you to find the noisiest and least valuable alerts so you can improve their value or eliminate them.  You will then use the long term metric trends to show real business impact to management and stakeholders.  Detailed information on each metric follows. Incident volume You should treat incidents (with or without alerts) like a queue of tasks.  Just like a queue, the number of alerts should spend time near zero. Each incident should be a trigger for action to resolve the condition.  If an alert does not result in action, then you should question the value of the alert condition. If you see a constant rate of incidents or specific incidents that are \"always-on\", then you should question why. Are you in a constant state of business impact, or do you simply have a large volume of noise? The alert volume KPIs help you to answer those questions and to measure progress towards a healthy state of high quality alerting. Incident count KPI Incident Count is the number of incidents generated over a period of time. Typically you should compare the current and previous weeks. Goal: Reduce the number of low value / nuisance incidents. Best practices: Ensure condition settings are intended to detect real business impact. Ensure condition settings are detecting abnormal behavior. Communicate that the incident details \"Acknowledge\" feature helps measure meaningful and actionable alerts. See Percentage Incident Acknowledge KPI. Report AQM KPIs to all stakeholders. Accumulated incident duration KPI Accumulated incident duration is the total sum of minutes that all the incidents accumulated over a period of time. Typically you should compare the current and previous weeks. Goal: Reduce the total accumulated minutes of incidents. Best practices: Do not manually close incidents. Manual closure will skew the real duration of incident length. Eliminate alerts that do not result in any remediation actions from the recipients. Improve percent investigated and mean-time-to-investigate KPIs by communicating their importance in improving detection and response times. Report AQM KPIs to all Stakeholders. Mean time to close (MTTC) KPI Average duration of incidents within the period of time measured. Goal: Reduce MTTC Best practices: Do not manually close incidents. Manual closure will skew the real duration of incident length. Improve Reliability Engineering skills. Report AQM KPIs to all stakeholders. Percent under 5 minutes KPI Percentage of incidents where the duration of the incident is under five minutes. This can be an indicator of incident flapping. Goal: Minimize percentage of incidents with short durations Best practices: Ensure that conditions are detecting legitimate deviations from expected behavior. See Baselining and Service Level Management. Ensure that conditions are detecting legitimate deviations that correlate to business impact or impending business impact. User engagement You should measure the value of an incident by the amount of attention it receives.  Engagement in this context is measured by whether or not an incident has been acknowledged. The amount of engagement an individual alert receives is a direct measurement of its value.  More engagement implies a valuable alert, less (or zero) engagement implies a nuisance alert that should be modified or disabled. There is a significant difference between measuring the moment of incident awareness vs. acknowledging the moment resolution activity begins. If you are using an integration with New Relic Alerting, be sure that the \"acknowledge\" event that is sent to New Relic is triggered when resolution activity begins, not when the incident is sent to the external incident management tool.  For more information regarding the standard Incident Management process, see \"Incident Management Process: 5 Steps to Effective Resolution Posted on August 31, 2020 by OnPage Corporation. -- in reference to ITIL4\" Percentage Acknowledged KPI Incidents acknowledged identifies the percentage of incidents that have been engaged with and had their acknowledged property set to true. Typically you should compare the current and previous weeks. Goal: Increase the percentage of incident engagement. Best practices: Educate the DevOps team on when it is appropriate to acknowledge an incident alert. Gamify alert acknowledgement to drive usage. Discourage mass acknowledgement exercises. Mean time to investigate (MTTI) KPI Mean time to investigate identifies the average time it takes for an incident to be triaged. Typically you should compare the current and previous weeks. Goal: Reduce the mean time to investigate Best practices: Work at building incident responder's confidence in alerts. Ensure that valuable alerts are acknowledged. Incentivize response teams to respond quickly to alerts. Prerequisites Before you begin, if you don't have equivalent experience, complete the New Relic University (NRU) Overview Course. Also, make sure you have a basic understanding of: NR1 Alert policy and conditions configuration NR1 incident notification channel webhook configuration NR1 NRQL NR1 alerting best practices NR1 APM & Infrastructure How to baseline data in order to determine anomalies vs. normal behavior. Establish current state As with any continuous improvement process, the first step of AQM is to establish the current state of your KPIs. To do so, perform the following tasks: Install and configure the incident event webhook Install the AQM Dashboard Perform initial AQM orientation and enablement Accumulate AQM data Perform second enablement session Install and configure the incident event webhook The webhook will create New Relic events for each incident as it proceeds through its lifecycle (open, acknowledge, close). To ensure that the AQM process generates accurate and valuable findings, this webhook must be added as a notification channel to every alert policy. The AQM process requires incident, not violation data. This is why you will not be using the default NrAiIncident event, which provides violation data only.  Instead, you will use this webhook to send the required incident data to New Relic. To use the webhook, do the following: Identify your primary production account and each of your accounts that you will be analyzing with the AQM process. Install the incident event webhook into each account that will participate in the AQM process and configure the webhook to report nrAQMIncident events to your primary production account. Assign the webhook as a notification channel to every alert policy in each account. This example shows a webhook notification channel assigned to each alert policy for a New Relic account with multiple sub-accounts. The webhook, AQM dashboard, and detailed installation instructions can be found in the New Relic OMA resource center on GitHub. Install the AQM dashboard The AQM dashboard is the primary asset that drives the AQM process.  You need to install the AQM dashboard into the primary production account you identified in the \"Install and configure incident event webhook\" step you previously performed by doing the following: Download the dashboard definition JSON file from the New Relic OMA resource center GitHub repo. Import the definition into your primary production account. For more details on importing dashboards, see the New Relic Introduction to dashboards documentation Perform initial AQM orientation and enablement During this phase, your incident management team(s) and other stakeholders will learn the goals of the AQM process and the scope of their involvement in it. The most critical portion of this task is educating your team on the importance of acknowledging incident alerts, since that's how the alert's value is determined.  In general, instruct them to follow these guidelines: If you look at an alert and decide to take any sort of further investigative action, acknowledge the alert. If you typically close an alert without doing anything else, do not acknowledge the alert. If the incident alert is always on, do not close or acknowledge it. For further details, see Second Enablement Session. You can use the first session template presentation to communicate this material to your stakeholders. Accumulate AQM data The overall process requires at least two weeks of data before it can proceed.  During this time, you should periodically check the following items: Confirm that incident alert event data is accumulating. Confirm that the webhook is attached to every alert policy. Ensure that incident responders are following the alert acknowledgement guidelines. Perform second enablement session During this phase, you will introduce incident management teams and other stakeholders to the initial AQM data and the ongoing continuous  improvement process you'll be following. The process consists of four activities: Review AQM Dashboard and KPI Trending: Here you and the stakeholders will look at the AQM KPIs and identify their week over week trends.  The team should identify areas where KPIs are not improving and develop strategies to drive improvement. Identify Achievements, Challenges, and Opportunities: Here you and the stakeholders will map the current state of alert quality to business impact, identifying areas where improvement has resulted in better business outcomes and areas where problems are impacting business outcomes. Incident Policy Review: Using the AQM dashboard, you and the stakeholders will identify the noisiest incident policies.  Once identified, those policies should be evaluated as detailed in step 4 below. Alert Policy Recommendations: In this step, you and the stakeholders will review the noisiest policies using the following criteria: Do the alerts have any business impact? Are the policies properly configured? Are they telling us something about the resource that needs to be fixed? Are the policies necessary? Do they have business impact? Are the thresholds set properly? Technical recommendations: Here, you and the stakeholders will review any technical recommendations, including: Are there application / system problems for engineering to review? Are there poorly constructed policies that need to be fixed? Are there instrumentation gaps? You can use the second session template presentation to keep this part of the AQM process organized. Improvement process This is the ongoing phase of the continuous improvement process where you periodically review your accumulated AQM data and make adjustments as needed to alert policies. You should perform this step once a week until your alert volume is acceptable. You can then perform it less frequently. During this phase you should: Report your KPIs each week to upper management to ensure that the stakeholder teams are appropriately prioritizing the work and to show that progress towards the promised business outcomes are being reached. Record and retain your weekly KPIs  over periods of months to years to establish a baseline and to show the rate of improvement. You should keep in mind that this is a continuous improvment process, you will continue to collect and evaluate the KPIs over long periods of time to ensure you are meeting your AQM goals. Value realization Once the AQM process is established, you will see significant reductions in the volume of alerts while reliability and stability remain the same or improve.  In addition, you should see that your alerts have a clear and unambiguous business impact.  Your AQM KPIs will provide quantifiable proof of these improvements. Once you are firmly on the path to AQM's goals, consider moving to other use cases within the Uptime, Performance, and Reliability value stream, such as Service Level Management, or Reliability Engineering.  You can also move to other observability maturity value streams, such as Customer Experience. KPI reference Following are the descriptions of each KPI as well as sample NRQL queries that will extract them from the New Relic platform.  These KPIs are also included in the AQM dashboard that can be downloaded from the New Relic OMA resource center GitHub repo.

      "body": "Overview IT Operations is expected to provide services that meet the business’s requirements for performance and reliability. However, many ops teams attempt to measure performance and reliability using legacy methods, like measuring resource consumption. That, in turn, requires that they create complex dashboards of granular metrics which they then try to correlate with application performance and reliability. These complex dashboards require subject matter experts to interpret the results for business stakeholders. Legacy methods create barriers to understanding what a good system state looks like and how bad system states impact the business. Essentially, IT ends up not sharing a common metric vocabulary with the business. This fundamental disconnect will result in the perception that IT is not able to deliver the services that the business requires, with all the implications and impacts that perception carries. Service Level Management (SLM) eliminates that disconnect by better explaining the overall performance of a system in terms that are easily understood by both IT and the business. The intent is to show whether or not the system is meeting its performance and reliability expectations, and if it is trending toward or away from improvement, so proactive steps can be taken. The end goal is that systems are better oriented toward desired business outcomes with IT’s attention focused on issues in areas with the highest business impact. You are a good candidate for SLM if any of the following are true: The business impact of performance and reliability issues are not well understood by all stakeholders. Your MTTx is too high. You are collecting many resource consumption metrics (such as CPU, disk, or memory) or are maintaining many metric correlation rules in order to identify system problems. You can’t see the value of your observability tool(s). Desired outcome Service Level Management’s overall goal is to easily measure and communicate the overall health, performance, and quality of your digital products and services to all stakeholders. By implementing SLM at key output points in your systems, you will have a simpler and more responsive observability practice, tighter alignment with the business, and faster paths to improvement. The SLM process described in this guide will help you to identify the points in your systems where you should measure the key performance metrics of service performance and quality. It will also define and drive a simpler alerting strategy, continuous improvement methodologies, and improved problem resolution workflows. Key performance indicators You will use the SLM process to collect and measure the following KPIs, often referred to as the “Golden Signals”: Service response time Service response time measures the amount of time a service requires to process a transaction. It starts when a transaction request is received by the service and ends when the response is sent. Goal: Reduce transaction response time. Best practices: Measure response time at service boundaries. Use continuous improvement processes to drive down response times. Ensure that non-business transactions (such as health checks) are not included or measured. Map this KPI back to business impact. Report KPIs to all stakeholders. Service quality Service quality is the number of transactions that result in an unhandled error. Typically, these are transactions whose HTTP response code is greater than or equal to 400. Goal: Reduce the number of unhandled errors. Best practices: Measure error rates at service boundaries. Continually identify and remediate sources of high error volumes. Map this KPI back to business impact. Report KPIs to all stakeholders. Service level objective attainment SLO attainment is the percentage of time a business service is meeting its response time and quality goals. Goal: Improve response time and quality to ensure high SLO attainment. Best practices: Use continuous improvement processes to maintain / improve SLO attainment. Map this KPI back to business impact. Report KPIs to all stakeholders. Service uptime Service uptime is the percentage of time a service can be reached by at least one client. Typically this is measured using synthetic transactions from representative remote locations. Goal: Use continuous improvement processes to watch uptime metrics and take appropriate steps to ensure uptime meets business requirements. Best practices: Use continuous improvement processes to maintain / improve SLO attainment. Map this KPI back to business impact Report KPIs to all stakeholders. These KPIs directly measure the most important aspects of an IT service, speed and quality, in a way that is easy and intuitive to understand and communicate to technical and non-technical stakeholders. Prerequisites Before you begin, if you don’t have equivalent experience, you should complete the New Relic University (NRU) Overview Course. You should also have a basic understanding of: New Relic One APM and infrastructure monitoring New Relic One Dashboards and NRQL New Relic One alerting best practices Establish current state As with any continuous improvement process, the first step of SLM is to establish the current state of your KPIs. To do so, you will need to perform the following tasks: Determine in-scope services Identify service boundaries Deploy instrumentation Perform SLM educational workshops Analyze KPIs and set baseline SLOs Establish / optimize Alerting Build problem resolution workflows Execute continuous improvement review To help illustrate this process, we are going to apply it to an example IT service, an ecommerce site for a cellular telephone provider. Determine in-scope services You should first identify the IT services that are going to be in-scope for the initial iteration of the SLM process. These services should be key to ongoing business operations and as close to your customers as possible. Most commonly, you will be applying the SLM process to an application, since that is the service your customers are expecting you to deliver. SLM can be applied to infrastructure-based services; however, it is a more advanced application of SLM which is applicable to a much smaller set of organizations. If you are considering implementing SLM for infrastructure, you should ensure that the service(s) you are instrumenting are actually the closest to your organization’s end-customer. If your infrastructure is hosting a customer-facing app, then the app should be the target of SLM. Absent anything else, a good methodology for identifying in-scope services is to consult your disaster recovery plan. Typically, the most critical business services are prioritized there. Identify service boundaries Next, you should identify each service’s boundary, which is the service component that is closest to the client sending transaction requests. This should be the application receiving the request from the client, browser, or mobile device, and may also be known as the \"external API.\" Reverse proxies, CDNs, and load balancers are not part of the service boundary. Their service level compliance should be measured via the Uptime KPI (external test requests for connectivity). If your services are using APM, you can identify service boundaries using the service map or dependencies features. A service component is on a boundary if it has no inbound connections. In the example below (from a service map), you can see that the WebPortal is on the boundary. An example of using service maps in New Relic One to identify service boundaries. In contrast, the following screenshot (from the dependencies page) shows that the Inventory Service is not on a boundary since it has incoming connections from the WebPortal. Subsequent examples in this guide will build on the WebPortal service boundary. An example of using the dependencies UI in New Relic One to identify service boundaries. You should understand that the SLM process defines a service boundary as being downstream of any dependencies. The service boundary is the point where all the effects and impacts of dependent services are measured as they contribute to the total response time and quality of the service. By measuring service level compliance at the boundary, you will be able to see the impact that all service components upstream of the boundary have on service delivery. This means that your initial steps into SLM can focus on the services that are closest to your users, yet still capture the contribution of more distant services. As your practice matures, you will be able to identify the next round of upstream services that would benefit from direct SLM instrumentation. In our example, the WebService is downstream of the Fulfillment, Plan, Promo, Login, and Inventory services (among others). By applying SLM at the WebService, we will be seeing the impact of the upstream services on the WebService. Any impactful issues with an upstream service will be reflected in the WebService’s service level KPIs. By instrumenting one service, we are capturing the contribution of five additional services. This greatly simplifies our observability practice. In time, problematic upstream services will self-identify themselves as candidates for direct SLM instrumentation. Deploy instrumentation To collect SLM service response time and transaction success KPIs, you need to deploy instrumentation into the components of your production apps on the service boundary. If you don’t have instrumentation that can do this in production already, then you will need to engage the teams and stakeholders that can help you to get this done. For detailed information on deploying the New Relic instrumentation that can gather this information, see our APM install documentation. The uptime KPIs can be collected using synthetic transactions, which don’t require any instrumentation to be added to the service. If needed, you can start your SLM journey there while waiting for the direct instrumentation to be deployed. The uptime tests should perform a basic, yet realistic, check of the service’s functionality. For detailed information on this capability, see our synthetic monitoring documentation. Perform SLM educational workshops You should share the self-paced New Relic Essentials training course with the appropriate stakeholders so they can understand how the New Relic technology platform will aid in the SLM process. Analyze KPIs and set baseline SLOs The SLM process uses speed and quality as its key performance indicators. In technical terms, speed means response time and quality means error rate. At the end of this phase, you will have created baseline service level objectives for each service in the form of a percentage. For example: “98% of service X’s transactions will be error free and occur in less than 500 milliseconds.” For each in-scope service, you should analyze speed and quality at the service boundary. This will give you an overall understanding of how the entire service and all of its dependencies are performing. As you iterate through the SLM process, you can then identify and prioritize the upstream service components that require direct SLM instrumentation. To analyze KPIs, you should do the following for each service: Identify the volume and 95th percentile response time for each of the service’s transactions over a relatively long period of time, typically between seven days and one month. It is important that you use percentile rather than average, so you can see the entire range of response times, including outliers. If you use averages, you will hide outliers. The following is an example of the initial baseline report. Here you can see the volume, p95 response time, and error volume for the WebPortal and a few other services. The WebPortal’s p95 response time is .36 seconds (or 36 milliseconds), so we have decided to set the SLO target to 0.4 seconds. Example of an initial baseline report measuring volume and 95th percentile response time. Next you should review and identify any non-business transactions, since they should not be included in the SLO attainment calculation. For example, you should not include health check / keep alive transactions and you may not want to include administrative transactions. In the example below, we are looking at some of the transactions from the WebPortal service. We have decided that the about.jsp transaction is a non-business transaction that should not be tracked in our SLO attainment calculation. Example showing transaction breakdowns from the initial baseline report to help identify what to track (or not track) for SLO. Finally, import and edit the SLM template dashboard to exclude non-business transactions. Then use the p95 response time as your baseline response time service level objective. For the example chart, we chose 0.4 seconds as our response time threshold and set our service level objective to 95%. This means that we are expecting 95% of the WebPortal’s business transactions to complete in 0.4 seconds or less and without an error. The red line on the chart shows us our 95% service level objective. Example chart now excluding the non-business transactions. As you can see, there are periods of hours where the app is not meeting its SLOs. If we are going to maintain the 95% target, we would need to identify and fix the service components or dependencies that are causing these problems. Establish or optimize alerting After you have set your service level objectives, you will then configure alerts that will inform you when your SLO attainment has dipped below your goal. These alerts will show you when incidents with a high business impact are occurring. When they are triggered, they should be given a high priority and you should engage the proper teams to start the process of diagnosing the source of the problem. A basic starting point is to configure an alert that triggers when your SLO attainment has dipped under your baseline for more than 10 minutes. For more information, see our documentation on configuring alerts. Build problem resolution workflows As we’ve been discussing, the intent of the SLM process is to identify when business impacting issues occur in your IT services. When this occurs, a diagnostic investigation should be launched. The goal of the investigation is to identify what service element is causing the business impacting issue. SLM tells you that there is a problem with business impact, the diagnostic process helps you to find where the problem is. Typically, your high level diagnostic workflow will start at the service boundary and go as follows: Look at the service’s individual transactions and see which one(s) are departing from their performance and/or response time SLOs. Look at each service component responsible for delivering that transaction until you find the component that is failing. Use in-depth diagnostics to identify the root cause of the problem and then resolve it. Execute continuous improvement review This is an ongoing phase of the SLM process where data is reviewed and adjustments are made as required. Your KPIs should be reported to upper management to ensure that stakeholder teams are appropriately prioritizing work and that you are meeting the SLO goals you’ve set. Periodic KPIs should be recorded and retained over periods of months to years to establish a baseline and to show the rate of improvement. In addition, each time you execute the continuous improvement process, you should: Review each service’s architecture to ensure your instrumentation is deployed at the boundary and that there are no observabilty gaps. Review each service’s transactions to confirm that only business transactions are included in your SLO calculations. Review each service’s SLO and determine if it meets the business’s performance and quality requirements. If it does not, then the SLO should be changed and the appropriate stakeholders notified so they can work to improve performance and quality. Review your SLO attainment and determine if any upstream services should be added to the SLM process. Next steps After you’ve established the SLM process, you should identify other services that would benefit from SLM instrumentation. These may be other front-line services or upstream dependencies of services that are covered by SLOs that have shown themselves to be frequent contributors to SLO attainment failures. As you do this, you should start to measure and report your SLM coverage as a percentage of applications covered by SLOs. For example, you may say that 20% of your apps have established SLOs. As SLM expands into your organization and as its value is seen by management and other stakeholders, you may find that you need a dedicated team to manage the SLM process. The SLM process should also become a primary driver to help you prioritize issue resolution activities. SLO attainment failures are a direct indicator that your IT services are having a negative business impact which is visible to your customers as poor performance and/or unhandled errors. Value realization Once the SLM process is established, you will see a reduction in the effort required to identify business impacting issues, a better ability to communicate with your business stakeholders, and an easier time proving the business’ return on investment in IT services. Your SLM KPIs will provide quantifiable proof of these improvements. In addtion, you should be able to simplify your observability strategy by removing or reducing your dependency on legacy consumption metrics and the logic required to correlate them against your true goal of measuring performance and quality. Once you are firmly on the path to SLM's goals, consider moving to other use cases within the Uptime, Performance, and Reliability value stream, such as Service Level Management, or Reliability Engineering.

      "body": "Overview Teams suffer from alert fatigue when they experience high alert volumes and alerts that are not aligned to business impact. As they start to believe that most alerts are false, they may prioritize easy to resolve alerts over others.  Also, they may close unresolved incidents so they can stay within their SLA targets. The result will be slower incident responses, magnified issue scope, and increased severity when true business impacting issues occur. Alert Quality Management (AQM) focuses on reducing the number of nuisance incidents so that you focus only on alerts with true business impact.  This reduces alert fatigue and ensures that you and your team focus your attention on the right places at the right times. You are a good candidate for AQM if: You have too many alerts. You have alerts that stay open for long time periods. Your alerts are not relevant. Your customers discover your issues before your monitoring tools do. You can't see the value of your observability tool(s). Desired outcome An alert strategy based on measuring business impact will result in faster response times and greater proactive awareness of critical events.  An improved alert signal to noise ratio reduces confusion and improves rapid identification and problem isolation. AQM's overall goal is to ensure that fewer, more valuable, incidents are created, resulting in: Increased uptime and availability Reduced MTTR Decreased alert volume The ability to easily identify alerts that are not valuable, so you can either make them valuable or remove them. The AQM process described in this guide generates the key performance indicators and metrics that you will use to measure progress towards these goals.  The metrics are measured in real time, published in a dashboard, and are used to drive a continuous improvement process that identifies and reduces nuisance alerts and increases user engagement in incident investigation. AQM does not encompass anomaly detection or AIOps, which are designed to detect unknown or unexpected modes of failure.  The two practices (AQM and ML/AI) work hand in hand, they are not mutually exclusive. Key performance indicators You will use the AQM process to collect and measure the following KPIs: Incident volume Incident Count Accumulated incident time Mean Time to Close (MTTC) Percent Under 5 Minutes User Engagement Mean Time to Investigate  (MTTI) % of Incidents Investigated These KPIs will help you to find the noisiest and least valuable alerts so you can improve their value or eliminate them.  You will then use the long term metric trends to show real business impact to management and stakeholders.  Detailed information on each metric follows. Incident volume You should treat incidents (with or without alerts) like a queue of tasks.  Just like a queue, the number of alerts should spend time near zero. Each incident should be a trigger for action to resolve the condition.  If an alert does not result in action, then you should question the value of the alert condition. If you see a constant rate of incidents or specific incidents that are \"always-on\", then you should question why. Are you in a constant state of business impact, or do you simply have a large volume of noise? The alert volume KPIs help you to answer those questions and to measure progress towards a healthy state of high quality alerting. Incident count KPI Incident Count is the number of incidents generated over a period of time. Typically you should compare the current and previous weeks. Goal: Reduce the number of low value / nuisance incidents. Best practices: Ensure condition settings are intended to detect real business impact. Ensure condition settings are detecting abnormal behavior. Communicate that the incident details \"Acknowledge\" feature helps measure meaningful and actionable alerts. See Percentage Incident Acknowledge KPI. Report AQM KPIs to all stakeholders. Accumulated incident duration KPI Accumulated incident duration is the total sum of minutes that all the incidents accumulated over a period of time. Typically you should compare the current and previous weeks. Goal: Reduce the total accumulated minutes of incidents. Best practices: Do not manually close incidents. Manual closure will skew the real duration of incident length. Eliminate alerts that do not result in any remediation actions from the recipients. Improve percent investigated and mean-time-to-investigate KPIs by communicating their importance in improving detection and response times. Report AQM KPIs to all Stakeholders. Mean time to close (MTTC) KPI Average duration of incidents within the period of time measured. Goal: Reduce MTTC Best practices: Do not manually close incidents. Manual closure will skew the real duration of incident length. Improve Reliability Engineering skills. Report AQM KPIs to all stakeholders. Percent under 5 minutes KPI Percentage of incidents where the duration of the incident is under five minutes. This can be an indicator of incident flapping. Goal: Minimize percentage of incidents with short durations Best practices: Ensure that conditions are detecting legitimate deviations from expected behavior. See Baselining and Service Level Management. Ensure that conditions are detecting legitimate deviations that correlate to business impact or impending business impact. User engagement You should measure the value of an incident by the amount of attention it receives.  Engagement in this context is measured by whether or not an incident has been acknowledged. The amount of engagement an individual alert receives is a direct measurement of its value.  More engagement implies a valuable alert, less (or zero) engagement implies a nuisance alert that should be modified or disabled. There is a significant difference between measuring the moment of incident awareness vs. acknowledging the moment resolution activity begins. If you are using an integration with New Relic Alerting, be sure that the \"acknowledge\" event that is sent to New Relic is triggered when resolution activity begins, not when the incident is sent to the external incident management tool.  For more information regarding the standard Incident Management process, see \"Incident Management Process: 5 Steps to Effective Resolution Posted on August 31, 2020 by OnPage Corporation. -- in reference to ITIL4\" Percentage Acknowledged KPI Incidents acknowledged identifies the percentage of incidents that have been engaged with and had their acknowledged property set to true. Typically you should compare the current and previous weeks. Goal: Increase the percentage of incident engagement. Best practices: Educate the DevOps team on when it is appropriate to acknowledge an incident alert. Gamify alert acknowledgement to drive usage. Discourage mass acknowledgement exercises. Mean time to investigate (MTTI) KPI Mean time to investigate identifies the average time it takes for an incident to be triaged. Typically you should compare the current and previous weeks. Goal: Reduce the mean time to investigate Best practices: Work at building incident responder's confidence in alerts. Ensure that valuable alerts are acknowledged. Incentivize response teams to respond quickly to alerts. Prerequisites Before you begin, if you don't have equivalent experience, complete the New Relic University (NRU) Overview Course. Also, make sure you have a basic understanding of: NR1 Alert policy and conditions configuration NR1 incident notification channel webhook configuration NR1 NRQL NR1 alerting best practices NR1 APM & Infrastructure How to baseline data in order to determine anomalies vs. normal behavior. Establish current state As with any continuous improvement process, the first step of AQM is to establish the current state of your KPIs. To do so, perform the following tasks: Install and configure the incident event webhook Install the AQM Dashboard Perform initial AQM orientation and enablement Accumulate AQM data Perform second enablement session Install and configure the incident event webhook The webhook will create New Relic events for each incident as it proceeds through its lifecycle (open, acknowledge, close). To ensure that the AQM process generates accurate and valuable findings, this webhook must be added as a notification channel to every alert policy. The AQM process requires incident, not violation data. This is why you will not be using the default NrAiIncident event, which provides violation data only.  Instead, you will use this webhook to send the required incident data to New Relic. To use the webhook, do the following: Identify your primary production account and each of your accounts that you will be analyzing with the AQM process. Install the incident event webhook into each account that will participate in the AQM process and configure the webhook to report nrAQMIncident events to your primary production account. Assign the webhook as a notification channel to every alert policy in each account. This example shows a webhook notification channel assigned to each alert policy for a New Relic account with multiple sub-accounts. The webhook, AQM dashboard, and detailed installation instructions can be found in the New Relic OMA resource center on GitHub. Install the AQM dashboard The AQM dashboard is the primary asset that drives the AQM process.  You need to install the AQM dashboard into the primary production account you identified in the \"Install and configure incident event webhook\" step you previously performed by doing the following: Download the dashboard definition JSON file from the New Relic OMA resource center GitHub repo. Import the definition into your primary production account. For more details on importing dashboards, see the New Relic Introduction to dashboards documentation Perform initial AQM orientation and enablement During this phase, your incident management team(s) and other stakeholders will learn the goals of the AQM process and the scope of their involvement in it. The most critical portion of this task is educating your team on the importance of acknowledging incident alerts, since that's how the alert's value is determined.  In general, instruct them to follow these guidelines: If you look at an alert and decide to take any sort of further investigative action, acknowledge the alert. If you typically close an alert without doing anything else, do not acknowledge the alert. If the incident alert is always on, do not close or acknowledge it. For further details, see Second Enablement Session. You can use the first session template presentation to communicate this material to your stakeholders. Accumulate AQM data The overall process requires at least two weeks of data before it can proceed.  During this time, you should periodically check the following items: Confirm that incident alert event data is accumulating. Confirm that the webhook is attached to every alert policy. Ensure that incident responders are following the alert acknowledgement guidelines. Perform second enablement session During this phase, you will introduce incident management teams and other stakeholders to the initial AQM data and the ongoing continuous  improvement process you'll be following. The process consists of four activities: Review AQM Dashboard and KPI Trending: Here you and the stakeholders will look at the AQM KPIs and identify their week over week trends.  The team should identify areas where KPIs are not improving and develop strategies to drive improvement. Identify Achievements, Challenges, and Opportunities: Here you and the stakeholders will map the current state of alert quality to business impact, identifying areas where improvement has resulted in better business outcomes and areas where problems are impacting business outcomes. Incident Policy Review: Using the AQM dashboard, you and the stakeholders will identify the noisiest incident policies.  Once identified, those policies should be evaluated as detailed in step 4 below. Alert Policy Recommendations: In this step, you and the stakeholders will review the noisiest policies using the following criteria: Do the alerts have any business impact? Are the policies properly configured? Are they telling us something about the resource that needs to be fixed? Are the policies necessary? Do they have business impact? Are the thresholds set properly? Technical recommendations: Here, you and the stakeholders will review any technical recommendations, including: Are there application / system problems for engineering to review? Are there poorly constructed policies that need to be fixed? Are there instrumentation gaps? You can use the second session template presentation to keep this part of the AQM process organized. Improvement process This is the ongoing phase of the continuous improvement process where you periodically review your accumulated AQM data and make adjustments as needed to alert policies. You should perform this step once a week until your alert volume is acceptable. You can then perform it less frequently. During this phase you should: Report your KPIs each week to upper management to ensure that the stakeholder teams are appropriately prioritizing the work and to show that progress towards the promised business outcomes are being reached. Record and retain your weekly KPIs  over periods of months to years to establish a baseline and to show the rate of improvement. You should keep in mind that this is a continuous improvment process, you will continue to collect and evaluate the KPIs over long periods of time to ensure you are meeting your AQM goals. Value realization Once the AQM process is established, you will see significant reductions in the volume of alerts while reliability and stability remain the same or improve.  In addition, you should see that your alerts have a clear and unambiguous business impact.  Your AQM KPIs will provide quantifiable proof of these improvements. Once you are firmly on the path to AQM's goals, consider moving to other use cases within the Uptime, Performance, and Reliability value stream, such as Service Level Management, or Reliability Engineering.  You can also move to other observability maturity value streams, such as Customer Experience. KPI reference Following are the descriptions of each KPI as well as sample NRQL queries that will extract them from the New Relic platform.  These KPIs are also included in the AQM dashboard that can be downloaded from the New Relic OMA resource center GitHub repo. Incident volume Incident count KPI Incident Count is the number of incidents generated over a period of time. Typically you should compare the current and previous weeks. NRQL: FROM nrAQMIncident SELECT count(*) AS 'Incident Count' WHERE current_state='open' AND severity='CRITICAL' SINCE 1 WEEK AGO COMPARE WITH 1 WEEK AGO Accumulated incident duration KPI Accumulated incident duration is the total sum of minutes that all the incidents accumulated over a period of time. Typically you should compare the current and previous weeks. NRQL: FROM nrAQMIncident SELECT sum(duration)/(1000*60) AS 'Incident Minutes' WHERE current_state='closed' AND severity='CRITICAL' SINCE 1 WEEK AGO COMPARE WITH 1 WEEK AGO Mean time to close (MTTC) KPI Average duration of incidents within the period of time measured. NRQL: FROM nrAQMIncident SELECT average(duration/(1000*60)) AS 'Incident MTTC (minutes)' WHERE current_state='closed' AND severity='CRITICAL' SINCE 1 WEEK AGO COMPARE WITH 1 WEEK AGO Percent under 5 minutes KPI Percentage of incidents where the duration of the incident is under five minutes. This can be an indicator of incident flapping. NRQL: FROM nrAQMIncident SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE duration <= 5 * 60 * 100) AS '% Under 5min' WHERE current_state='closed' AND severity='CRITICAL' SINCE 1 WEEK AGO COMPARE WITH 1 WEEK AGO Incident engagement Percentage Acknowledged KPI Incidents acknowledged identifies the percentage of incidents that have been engaged with and had their acknowledged property set to true. Typically you should compare the current and previous weeks. NRQL: FROM nrAQMIncident SELECT filter(count(*), WHERE current_state='acknowledged')/filter(count(*), WHERE current_state='open')*100 AS '% Investigated' WHERE severity='CRITICAL' SINCE 1 WEEK AGO COMPARE WITH 1 WEEK AGO Mean time to investigate (MTTI) KPI Mean time to investigate identifies the average time it takes for an incident to be triaged. Typically you should compare the current and previous weeks. NRQL: FROM nrAQMIncident SELECT average(duration/(1000*60)) AS 'Incident MTTI (minutes)' WHERE current_state='acknowledged' AND severity='CRITICAL' SINCE 1 WEEK AGO COMPARE WITH 1 WEEK AGO Additional resources Want to get your hands dirty before you start implementing this in your account?

      "body": "Overview IT Operations is expected to provide services that meet the business’s requirements for performance and reliability. However, many ops teams attempt to measure performance and reliability using legacy methods, like measuring resource consumption. That, in turn, requires that they create complex dashboards of granular metrics which they then try to correlate with application performance and reliability. These complex dashboards require subject matter experts to interpret the results for business stakeholders. Legacy methods create barriers to understanding what a good system state looks like and how bad system states impact the business. Essentially, IT ends up not sharing a common metric vocabulary with the business. This fundamental disconnect will result in the perception that IT is not able to deliver the services that the business requires, with all the implications and impacts that perception carries. Service Level Management (SLM) eliminates that disconnect by better explaining the overall performance of a system in terms that are easily understood by both IT and the business. The intent is to show whether or not the system is meeting its performance and reliability expectations, and if it is trending toward or away from improvement, so proactive steps can be taken. The end goal is that systems are better oriented toward desired business outcomes with IT’s attention focused on issues in areas with the highest business impact. You are a good candidate for SLM if any of the following are true: The business impact of performance and reliability issues are not well understood by all stakeholders. Your MTTx is too high. You are collecting many resource consumption metrics (such as CPU, disk, or memory) or are maintaining many metric correlation rules in order to identify system problems. You can’t see the value of your observability tool(s). Desired outcome Service Level Management’s overall goal is to easily measure and communicate the overall health, performance, and quality of your digital products and services to all stakeholders. By implementing SLM at key output points in your systems, you will have a simpler and more responsive observability practice, tighter alignment with the business, and faster paths to improvement. The SLM process described in this guide will help you to identify the points in your systems where you should measure the key performance metrics of service performance and quality. It will also define and drive a simpler alerting strategy, continuous improvement methodologies, and improved problem resolution workflows. Key performance indicators You will use the SLM process to collect and measure the following KPIs, often referred to as the “Golden Signals”: Service response time Service response time measures the amount of time a service requires to process a transaction. It starts when a transaction request is received by the service and ends when the response is sent. Goal: Reduce transaction response time. Best practices: Measure response time at service boundaries. Use continuous improvement processes to drive down response times. Ensure that non-business transactions (such as health checks) are not included or measured. Map this KPI back to business impact. Report KPIs to all stakeholders. Service quality Service quality is the number of transactions that result in an unhandled error. Typically, these are transactions whose HTTP response code is greater than or equal to 400. Goal: Reduce the number of unhandled errors. Best practices: Measure error rates at service boundaries. Continually identify and remediate sources of high error volumes. Map this KPI back to business impact. Report KPIs to all stakeholders. Service level objective attainment SLO attainment is the percentage of time a business service is meeting its response time and quality goals. Goal: Improve response time and quality to ensure high SLO attainment. Best practices: Use continuous improvement processes to maintain / improve SLO attainment. Map this KPI back to business impact. Report KPIs to all stakeholders. Service uptime Service uptime is the percentage of time a service can be reached by at least one client. Typically this is measured using synthetic transactions from representative remote locations. Goal: Use continuous improvement processes to watch uptime metrics and take appropriate steps to ensure uptime meets business requirements. Best practices: Use continuous improvement processes to maintain / improve SLO attainment. Map this KPI back to business impact Report KPIs to all stakeholders. These KPIs directly measure the most important aspects of an IT service, speed and quality, in a way that is easy and intuitive to understand and communicate to technical and non-technical stakeholders. Prerequisites Before you begin, if you don’t have equivalent experience, you should complete the New Relic University (NRU) Overview Course. You should also have a basic understanding of: New Relic One APM and infrastructure monitoring New Relic One Dashboards and NRQL New Relic One alerting best practices Establish current state As with any continuous improvement process, the first step of SLM is to establish the current state of your KPIs. To do so, you will need to perform the following tasks: Determine in-scope services Identify service boundaries Deploy instrumentation Perform SLM educational workshops Analyze KPIs and set baseline SLOs Establish / optimize Alerting Build problem resolution workflows Execute continuous improvement review To help illustrate this process, we are going to apply it to an example IT service, an ecommerce site for a cellular telephone provider. Determine in-scope services You should first identify the IT services that are going to be in-scope for the initial iteration of the SLM process. These services should be key to ongoing business operations and as close to your customers as possible. Most commonly, you will be applying the SLM process to an application, since that is the service your customers are expecting you to deliver. SLM can be applied to infrastructure-based services; however, it is a more advanced application of SLM which is applicable to a much smaller set of organizations. If you are considering implementing SLM for infrastructure, you should ensure that the service(s) you are instrumenting are actually the closest to your organization’s end-customer. If your infrastructure is hosting a customer-facing app, then the app should be the target of SLM. Absent anything else, a good methodology for identifying in-scope services is to consult your disaster recovery plan. Typically, the most critical business services are prioritized there. Identify service boundaries Next, you should identify each service’s boundary, which is the service component that is closest to the client sending transaction requests. This should be the application receiving the request from the client, browser, or mobile device, and may also be known as the \"external API.\" Reverse proxies, CDNs, and load balancers are not part of the service boundary. Their service level compliance should be measured via the Uptime KPI (external test requests for connectivity). If your services are using APM, you can identify service boundaries using the service map or dependencies features. A service component is on a boundary if it has no inbound connections. In the example below (from a service map), you can see that the WebPortal is on the boundary. An example of using service maps in New Relic One to identify service boundaries. In contrast, the following screenshot (from the dependencies page) shows that the Inventory Service is not on a boundary since it has incoming connections from the WebPortal. Subsequent examples in this guide will build on the WebPortal service boundary. An example of using the dependencies UI in New Relic One to identify service boundaries. You should understand that the SLM process defines a service boundary as being downstream of any dependencies. The service boundary is the point where all the effects and impacts of dependent services are measured as they contribute to the total response time and quality of the service. By measuring service level compliance at the boundary, you will be able to see the impact that all service components upstream of the boundary have on service delivery. This means that your initial steps into SLM can focus on the services that are closest to your users, yet still capture the contribution of more distant services. As your practice matures, you will be able to identify the next round of upstream services that would benefit from direct SLM instrumentation. In our example, the WebService is downstream of the Fulfillment, Plan, Promo, Login, and Inventory services (among others). By applying SLM at the WebService, we will be seeing the impact of the upstream services on the WebService. Any impactful issues with an upstream service will be reflected in the WebService’s service level KPIs. By instrumenting one service, we are capturing the contribution of five additional services. This greatly simplifies our observability practice. In time, problematic upstream services will self-identify themselves as candidates for direct SLM instrumentation. Deploy instrumentation To collect SLM service response time and transaction success KPIs, you need to deploy instrumentation into the components of your production apps on the service boundary. If you don’t have instrumentation that can do this in production already, then you will need to engage the teams and stakeholders that can help you to get this done. For detailed information on deploying the New Relic instrumentation that can gather this information, see our APM install documentation. The uptime KPIs can be collected using synthetic transactions, which don’t require any instrumentation to be added to the service. If needed, you can start your SLM journey there while waiting for the direct instrumentation to be deployed. The uptime tests should perform a basic, yet realistic, check of the service’s functionality. For detailed information on this capability, see our synthetic monitoring documentation. Perform SLM educational workshops You should share the self-paced New Relic Essentials training course with the appropriate stakeholders so they can understand how the New Relic technology platform will aid in the SLM process. Analyze KPIs and set baseline SLOs The SLM process uses speed and quality as its key performance indicators. In technical terms, speed means response time and quality means error rate. At the end of this phase, you will have created baseline service level objectives for each service in the form of a percentage. For example: “98% of service X’s transactions will be error free and occur in less than 500 milliseconds.” For each in-scope service, you should analyze speed and quality at the service boundary. This will give you an overall understanding of how the entire service and all of its dependencies are performing. As you iterate through the SLM process, you can then identify and prioritize the upstream service components that require direct SLM instrumentation. To analyze KPIs, you should do the following for each service: Identify the volume and 95th percentile response time for each of the service’s transactions over a relatively long period of time, typically between seven days and one month. It is important that you use percentile rather than average, so you can see the entire range of response times, including outliers. If you use averages, you will hide outliers. The following is an example of the initial baseline report. Here you can see the volume, p95 response time, and error volume for the WebPortal and a few other services. The WebPortal’s p95 response time is .36 seconds (or 36 milliseconds), so we have decided to set the SLO target to 0.4 seconds. Example of an initial baseline report measuring volume and 95th percentile response time. Next you should review and identify any non-business transactions, since they should not be included in the SLO attainment calculation. For example, you should not include health check / keep alive transactions and you may not want to include administrative transactions. In the example below, we are looking at some of the transactions from the WebPortal service. We have decided that the about.jsp transaction is a non-business transaction that should not be tracked in our SLO attainment calculation. Example showing transaction breakdowns from the initial baseline report to help identify what to track (or not track) for SLO. Finally, import and edit the SLM template dashboard to exclude non-business transactions. Then use the p95 response time as your baseline response time service level objective. For the example chart, we chose 0.4 seconds as our response time threshold and set our service level objective to 95%. This means that we are expecting 95% of the WebPortal’s business transactions to complete in 0.4 seconds or less and without an error. The red line on the chart shows us our 95% service level objective. Example chart now excluding the non-business transactions. As you can see, there are periods of hours where the app is not meeting its SLOs. If we are going to maintain the 95% target, we would need to identify and fix the service components or dependencies that are causing these problems. Establish or optimize alerting After you have set your service level objectives, you will then configure alerts that will inform you when your SLO attainment has dipped below your goal. These alerts will show you when incidents with a high business impact are occurring. When they are triggered, they should be given a high priority and you should engage the proper teams to start the process of diagnosing the source of the problem. A basic starting point is to configure an alert that triggers when your SLO attainment has dipped under your baseline for more than 10 minutes. For more information, see our documentation on configuring alerts. Build problem resolution workflows As we’ve been discussing, the intent of the SLM process is to identify when business impacting issues occur in your IT services. When this occurs, a diagnostic investigation should be launched. The goal of the investigation is to identify what service element is causing the business impacting issue. SLM tells you that there is a problem with business impact, the diagnostic process helps you to find where the problem is. Typically, your high level diagnostic workflow will start at the service boundary and go as follows: Look at the service’s individual transactions and see which one(s) are departing from their performance and/or response time SLOs. Look at each service component responsible for delivering that transaction until you find the component that is failing. Use in-depth diagnostics to identify the root cause of the problem and then resolve it. Execute continuous improvement review This is an ongoing phase of the SLM process where data is reviewed and adjustments are made as required. Your KPIs should be reported to upper management to ensure that stakeholder teams are appropriately prioritizing work and that you are meeting the SLO goals you’ve set. Periodic KPIs should be recorded and retained over periods of months to years to establish a baseline and to show the rate of improvement. In addition, each time you execute the continuous improvement process, you should: Review each service’s architecture to ensure your instrumentation is deployed at the boundary and that there are no observabilty gaps. Review each service’s transactions to confirm that only business transactions are included in your SLO calculations. Review each service’s SLO and determine if it meets the business’s performance and quality requirements. If it does not, then the SLO should be changed and the appropriate stakeholders notified so they can work to improve performance and quality. Review your SLO attainment and determine if any upstream services should be added to the SLM process. Next steps After you’ve established the SLM process, you should identify other services that would benefit from SLM instrumentation. These may be other front-line services or upstream dependencies of services that are covered by SLOs that have shown themselves to be frequent contributors to SLO attainment failures. As you do this, you should start to measure and report your SLM coverage as a percentage of applications covered by SLOs. For example, you may say that 20% of your apps have established SLOs. As SLM expands into your organization and as its value is seen by management and other stakeholders, you may find that you need a dedicated team to manage the SLM process. The SLM process should also become a primary driver to help you prioritize issue resolution activities. SLO attainment failures are a direct indicator that your IT services are having a negative business impact which is visible to your customers as poor performance and/or unhandled errors. Value realization Once the SLM process is established, you will see a reduction in the effort required to identify business impacting issues, a better ability to communicate with your business stakeholders, and an easier time proving the business’ return on investment in IT services. Your SLM KPIs will provide quantifiable proof of these improvements. In addtion, you should be able to simplify your observability strategy by removing or reducing your dependency on legacy consumption metrics and the logic required to correlate them against your true goal of measuring performance and quality. Once you are firmly on the path to SLM's goals, consider moving to other use cases within the Uptime, Performance, and Reliability value stream, such as Service Level Management, or Reliability Engineering. You can also move to other observability maturity value streams, such as Customer Experience. Additional resources Need help getting started?

GitHub authentication fails If you suddenly find that you can no longer push to your remote branch in GitHub Desktop, you may have developed a problem with SSH. If logging out of GitHub Desktop via Preferences doesn’t seem to help, you can confirm if you have an SSH issue by switching to the command line and trying to push manually.

My build is failing mysteriously Here’s a few things you can check if your build is failing: Indenting in the nav files Front matter If there's apostrophes and colons in frontmatter fields, surround them with quotes to avoid problems. Missing closed brackets or tags Poorly formatted image links Be careful when renaming images and their filename paths. A mismatch can cause the entire local build to fail. Be especially careful when dealing with image files that are imported. Image filenames Image filenames are case-sensitive. Using the wrong capitalization results in a missing image in the doc. Images with encoded values (like %) in the filename can be especially tricky, try to avoid them. Diagnose markdown errors with yarn-verify If you know which file is causing an error, you can further troubleshoot with the yarn verify-mdx path/to/file.mdx command. This command returns more information about the error than the normal Gatsby output. This includes things such as the specific character and line number causing the error. Example: Troubleshoot with yarn-verify Let's pretend I've made a changes to multiple docs in my branch. When I try to either run the site locally or access the Gatsby Cloud build, I get the following error: Unexpected character = (U+003D) before name, expected a character that can start a name, such as a letter, $, or _/usr/src/app/www/src/content/docs/new-relic-solutions/observability-maturity/uptime-performance-reliability/aqm-implementation-guide.mdx: Unexpected character = (U+003D) before name, expected a character that can start a name, such as a letter, $, or _ Copy The error does tell me that the doc with an error is /docs/new-relic-solutions/observability-maturity/uptime-performance-reliability/aqm-implementation-guide.mdx. Other than that, all I know is that there is a = character messing things up somewhere. Cool, but this is a NRQL doc, there are a dozens of = characters. So, I run yarn verify-mdx src/content/docs/new-relic-solutions/observability-maturity/uptime-performance-reliability/aqm-implementation-guide.mdx. This returns the following: reading src/content/docs/new-relic-solutions/observability-maturity/uptime-performance-reliability/aqm-implementation-guide.mdx { \"message\": \"Unexpected character `=` (U+003D) before name, expected a character that can start a name, such as a letter, `$`, or `_`\", \"name\": \"284:227\", \"reason\": \"Unexpected character `=` (U+003D) before name, expected a character that can start a name, such as a letter, `$`, or `_`\", \"line\": 284, \"column\": 227, \"location\": { \"start\": { \"line\": 284, \"column\": 227, \"offset\": 19129, \"index\": 1 }, \"end\": { \"line\": null, \"column\": null } }, \"source\": \"remark-mdx\", \"ruleId\": \"unexpected-character\", \"fatal\": true } [ Copy In this case, the relvant info is: \"line\": 284, \"column\": 227, Copy and \"source\": \"remark-mdx\", \"ruleId\": \"unexpected-character\", \"fatal\": true Copy This tells me that there is an unexpected character in line 284, column 227. Then I can go to that section of the doc and further troubleshoot, knowing exactly where the error comes from. In this case, I likely just need to wrap a NRQL example in quotes. Issues with the local site If you're running with issues with your local build, try these options: Stop and restart yarn In the terminal, ensure you're in the /docs-website directory. Hit CONTROL+C to interrupt the yarn process, if necessary. Run yarn && yarn start. Ensure the problem isn't with your branch In the terminal, ensure you're in the docs-website directory. Hit CONTROL+C to stop yarn, if necessary. In GitHub Desktop, commit any changes needed on your branch, and then switch to the Develop branch. Back in the terminal, run yarn && yarn start. If the site now builds correctly, the issue is with the changes in your branch. Stop Yarn again, go back to your branch, and troubleshoot. Clean your local cache Run yarn clean to blow away your local cache. This will make your next build slower, so make sure you have time! In the terminal, ensure you're in the docs-website directory. Hit CONTROL+C to stop yarn, if necessary. Begin a new build by running yarn clean && yarn && yarn start. Remove corrupted cache files There may be times when your .cache directory has been corrupted. This directory is ignored by Git, which means that it travels with you from branch to branch. This might be the problem if your local builds are failing regardless of which branch you’re on. To solve this from your /docs-website directory, run rm -rf .cache. Start a build from start Blow away all your node modules, hidden .cache folder, and local cache and start a build from scratch. This takes a long time to run, around 10–20 minutes. In the terminal, ensure you're in the docs-website directory. Hit CONTROL+C to stop yarn, if necessary. Blow away modules and cache and start from scratch by running the kknuke Keyboard Maestro command, or run yarn reboot in your terminal. Important If you use the kknuke Keyboard Maestro command, when everything completes, start the site by running yarn start. Run your local build in private mode Sometimes the local site builds, but pages within the site don't. Running the local build in a private/incognito session may to fix this issue. You can also try clearing out your browser's cache. My redirect throws a 404 error when testing it locally Redirects are a bit strange on local builds. To test them, navigate to the page that is being redirected, wait until it throws a 404, and then wait ~1-2 minutes. It should redirect you after a while. If it doesn’t, ensure you set up the redirect correctly. You can also test the redirects out in the Gatsby build. A check fails in the PR Important The only checks needed to merge a PR are the checks marked as required on the PR. These are run linter, run tests, license/cla, and unpaired translations removed for merges to develop, and build the docs site for merges to main. If a required check fails, the failure must be addressed in order for the PR to be merged. If an optional check fails, reach out in the help channel so that the hero can look into the failure, but feel free to merge the PR since optional checks don't block releases. Rarely, a build or check will fail due to some internal error. You can re-run the check by going to the PR, clicking Details, and then clicking Re-run jobs. If that doesn't fix it, you probably have genuine build errors. Pull down locally and troubleshoot. Reset the 'build the docs site' build check Caution This adds a LOT of time to the build check. There are times when this check fails. If this happens after your local builds have built successfully, you may need to force a rebuild of the cache. In your local repo, find the file gatsby-config.js (use CMD-P to jump to it fast in VSCode). Swap the first and second line of code. It doesn’t matter what order these lines are in, except to make the Gatsby Build check rebuild the cache. const fs = require('fs'); const parse = require('rehype-parse'); Save the file and commit the change to your PR. Re-run the build checks. Wait a LOOOOONG time. Troubleshoot merging conflicts Merge conflicts can seem pretty scary, but it’s ultimately just deciding between two different versions of a doc. Here are some tips on how to get through it. Fix your merge conflict as soon as possible. Especially if you’re working on taxonomy changes. If your branch lingers for a while it can get outdated from develop pretty fast and that can cause some unexpected issues. Check your fix locally to make sure that it looks good there. Ask your PR approver to review your PR after you fix the merge conflict. Here are two options to resolve conflicts: When you see the conflicts in GitHub desktop, click the option to resolve these in VS Code. Use the GitHub website editor (click the Resolve conflict button) to fix these. What’s new related merge conflicts Merge conflicts pop up pretty often with what’s new posts because the whats-new-ids.json file that’s automatically updated when the site builds can get out-of-date pretty fast. If you see changes to this file show up in GitHub Desktop, make sure to discard them, rather than push them up to your branch. This will make it less likely that other people will have to deal with merge conflicts related to this file. Caution Never merge a PR that changes whats-new-ids.json.",

      "body": "Overview Teams suffer from alert fatigue when they experience high alert volumes and alerts that are not aligned to business impact. As they start to believe that most alerts are false, they may prioritize easy to resolve alerts over others.  Also, they may close unresolved incidents so they can stay within their SLA targets. The result will be slower incident responses, magnified issue scope, and increased severity when true business impacting issues occur. Alert Quality Management (AQM) focuses on reducing the number of nuisance incidents so that you focus only on alerts with true business impact.  This reduces alert fatigue and ensures that you and your team focus your attention on the right places at the right times. You are a good candidate for AQM if: You have too many alerts. You have alerts that stay open for long time periods. Your alerts are not relevant. Your customers discover your issues before your monitoring tools do. You can't see the value of your observability tool(s). Desired outcome An alert strategy based on measuring business impact will result in faster response times and greater proactive awareness of critical events.  An improved alert signal to noise ratio reduces confusion and improves rapid identification and problem isolation. AQM's overall goal is to ensure that fewer, more valuable, incidents are created, resulting in: Increased uptime and availability Reduced MTTR Decreased alert volume The ability to easily identify alerts that are not valuable, so you can either make them valuable or remove them. The AQM process described in this guide generates the key performance indicators and metrics that you will use to measure progress towards these goals.  The metrics are measured in real time, published in a dashboard, and are used to drive a continuous improvement process that identifies and reduces nuisance alerts and increases user engagement in incident investigation. AQM does not encompass anomaly detection or AIOps, which are designed to detect unknown or unexpected modes of failure.  The two practices (AQM and ML/AI) work hand in hand, they are not mutually exclusive. Key performance indicators You will use the AQM process to collect and measure the following KPIs: Incident volume Incident Count Accumulated incident time Mean Time to Close (MTTC) Percent Under 5 Minutes User Engagement Mean Time to Investigate  (MTTI) % of Incidents Investigated These KPIs will help you to find the noisiest and least valuable alerts so you can improve their value or eliminate them.  You will then use the long term metric trends to show real business impact to management and stakeholders.  Detailed information on each metric follows. Incident volume You should treat incidents (with or without alerts) like a queue of tasks.  Just like a queue, the number of alerts should spend time near zero. Each incident should be a trigger for action to resolve the condition.  If an alert does not result in action, then you should question the value of the alert condition. If you see a constant rate of incidents or specific incidents that are \"always-on\", then you should question why. Are you in a constant state of business impact, or do you simply have a large volume of noise? The alert volume KPIs help you to answer those questions and to measure progress towards a healthy state of high quality alerting. Incident count KPI Incident Count is the number of incidents generated over a period of time. Typically you should compare the current and previous weeks. Goal: Reduce the number of low value / nuisance incidents. Best practices: Ensure condition settings are intended to detect real business impact. Ensure condition settings are detecting abnormal behavior. Communicate that the incident details \"Acknowledge\" feature helps measure meaningful and actionable alerts. See Percentage Incident Acknowledge KPI. Report AQM KPIs to all stakeholders. Accumulated incident duration KPI Accumulated incident duration is the total sum of minutes that all the incidents accumulated over a period of time. Typically you should compare the current and previous weeks. Goal: Reduce the total accumulated minutes of incidents. Best practices: Do not manually close incidents. Manual closure will skew the real duration of incident length. Eliminate alerts that do not result in any remediation actions from the recipients. Improve percent investigated and mean-time-to-investigate KPIs by communicating their importance in improving detection and response times. Report AQM KPIs to all Stakeholders. Mean time to close (MTTC) KPI Average duration of incidents within the period of time measured. Goal: Reduce MTTC Best practices: Do not manually close incidents. Manual closure will skew the real duration of incident length. Improve Reliability Engineering skills. Report AQM KPIs to all stakeholders. Percent under 5 minutes KPI Percentage of incidents where the duration of the incident is under five minutes. This can be an indicator of incident flapping. Goal: Minimize percentage of incidents with short durations Best practices: Ensure that conditions are detecting legitimate deviations from expected behavior. See Baselining and Service Level Management. Ensure that conditions are detecting legitimate deviations that correlate to business impact or impending business impact. User engagement You should measure the value of an incident by the amount of attention it receives.  Engagement in this context is measured by whether or not an incident has been acknowledged. The amount of engagement an individual alert receives is a direct measurement of its value.  More engagement implies a valuable alert, less (or zero) engagement implies a nuisance alert that should be modified or disabled. There is a significant difference between measuring the moment of incident awareness vs. acknowledging the moment resolution activity begins. If you are using an integration with New Relic Alerting, be sure that the \"acknowledge\" event that is sent to New Relic is triggered when resolution activity begins, not when the incident is sent to the external incident management tool.  For more information regarding the standard Incident Management process, see \"Incident Management Process: 5 Steps to Effective Resolution Posted on August 31, 2020 by OnPage Corporation. -- in reference to ITIL4\" Percentage Acknowledged KPI Incidents acknowledged identifies the percentage of incidents that have been engaged with and had their acknowledged property set to true. Typically you should compare the current and previous weeks. Goal: Increase the percentage of incident engagement. Best practices: Educate the DevOps team on when it is appropriate to acknowledge an incident alert. Gamify alert acknowledgement to drive usage. Discourage mass acknowledgement exercises. Mean time to investigate (MTTI) KPI Mean time to investigate identifies the average time it takes for an incident to be triaged. Typically you should compare the current and previous weeks. Goal: Reduce the mean time to investigate Best practices: Work at building incident responder's confidence in alerts. Ensure that valuable alerts are acknowledged. Incentivize response teams to respond quickly to alerts. Prerequisites Before you begin, if you don't have equivalent experience, complete the New Relic University (NRU) Overview Course. Also, make sure you have a basic understanding of: NR1 Alert policy and conditions configuration NR1 incident notification channel webhook configuration NR1 NRQL NR1 alerting best practices NR1 APM & Infrastructure How to baseline data in order to determine anomalies vs. normal behavior. Establish current state As with any continuous improvement process, the first step of AQM is to establish the current state of your KPIs. To do so, perform the following tasks: Install and configure the incident event webhook Install the AQM Dashboard Perform initial AQM orientation and enablement Accumulate AQM data Perform second enablement session Install and configure the incident event webhook The webhook will create New Relic events for each incident as it proceeds through its lifecycle (open, acknowledge, close). To ensure that the AQM process generates accurate and valuable findings, this webhook must be added as a notification channel to every alert policy. The AQM process requires incident, not violation data. This is why you will not be using the default NrAiIncident event, which provides violation data only.  Instead, you will use this webhook to send the required incident data to New Relic. To use the webhook, do the following: Identify your primary production account and each of your accounts that you will be analyzing with the AQM process. Install the incident event webhook into each account that will participate in the AQM process and configure the webhook to report nrAQMIncident events to your primary production account. Assign the webhook as a notification channel to every alert policy in each account. This example shows a webhook notification channel assigned to each alert policy for a New Relic account with multiple sub-accounts. The webhook, AQM dashboard, and detailed installation instructions can be found in the New Relic OMA resource center on GitHub. Install the AQM dashboard The AQM dashboard is the primary asset that drives the AQM process.  You need to install the AQM dashboard into the primary production account you identified in the \"Install and configure incident event webhook\" step you previously performed by doing the following: Download the dashboard definition JSON file from the New Relic OMA resource center GitHub repo. Import the definition into your primary production account. For more details on importing dashboards, see the New Relic Introduction to dashboards documentation Perform initial AQM orientation and enablement During this phase, your incident management team(s) and other stakeholders will learn the goals of the AQM process and the scope of their involvement in it. The most critical portion of this task is educating your team on the importance of acknowledging incident alerts, since that's how the alert's value is determined.  In general, instruct them to follow these guidelines: If you look at an alert and decide to take any sort of further investigative action, acknowledge the alert. If you typically close an alert without doing anything else, do not acknowledge the alert. If the incident alert is always on, do not close or acknowledge it. For further details, see Second Enablement Session. You can use the first session template presentation to communicate this material to your stakeholders. Accumulate AQM data The overall process requires at least two weeks of data before it can proceed.  During this time, you should periodically check the following items: Confirm that incident alert event data is accumulating. Confirm that the webhook is attached to every alert policy. Ensure that incident responders are following the alert acknowledgement guidelines. Perform second enablement session During this phase, you will introduce incident management teams and other stakeholders to the initial AQM data and the ongoing continuous  improvement process you'll be following. The process consists of four activities: Review AQM Dashboard and KPI Trending: Here you and the stakeholders will look at the AQM KPIs and identify their week over week trends.  The team should identify areas where KPIs are not improving and develop strategies to drive improvement. Identify Achievements, Challenges, and Opportunities: Here you and the stakeholders will map the current state of alert quality to business impact, identifying areas where improvement has resulted in better business outcomes and areas where problems are impacting business outcomes. Incident Policy Review: Using the AQM dashboard, you and the stakeholders will identify the noisiest incident policies.  Once identified, those policies should be evaluated as detailed in step 4 below. Alert Policy Recommendations: In this step, you and the stakeholders will review the noisiest policies using the following criteria: Do the alerts have any business impact? Are the policies properly configured? Are they telling us something about the resource that needs to be fixed? Are the policies necessary? Do they have business impact? Are the thresholds set properly? Technical recommendations: Here, you and the stakeholders will review any technical recommendations, including: Are there application / system problems for engineering to review? Are there poorly constructed policies that need to be fixed? Are there instrumentation gaps? You can use the second session template presentation to keep this part of the AQM process organized. Improvement process This is the ongoing phase of the continuous improvement process where you periodically review your accumulated AQM data and make adjustments as needed to alert policies. You should perform this step once a week until your alert volume is acceptable. You can then perform it less frequently. During this phase you should: Report your KPIs each week to upper management to ensure that the stakeholder teams are appropriately prioritizing the work and to show that progress towards the promised business outcomes are being reached. Record and retain your weekly KPIs  over periods of months to years to establish a baseline and to show the rate of improvement. You should keep in mind that this is a continuous improvment process, you will continue to collect and evaluate the KPIs over long periods of time to ensure you are meeting your AQM goals. Value realization Once the AQM process is established, you will see significant reductions in the volume of alerts while reliability and stability remain the same or improve.  In addition, you should see that your alerts have a clear and unambiguous business impact.  Your AQM KPIs will provide quantifiable proof of these improvements. Once you are firmly on the path to AQM's goals, consider moving to other use cases within the Uptime, Performance, and Reliability value stream, such as Service Level Management, or Reliability Engineering.  You can also move to other observability maturity value streams, such as Customer Experience. KPI reference Following are the descriptions of each KPI as well as sample NRQL queries that will extract them from the New Relic platform.  These KPIs are also included in the AQM dashboard that can be downloaded from the New Relic OMA resource center GitHub repo. Incident volume Incident count KPI Incident Count is the number of incidents generated over a period of time. Typically you should compare the current and previous weeks. NRQL: FROM nrAQMIncident SELECT count(*) AS 'Incident Count' WHERE current_state='open' AND severity='CRITICAL' SINCE 1 WEEK AGO COMPARE WITH 1 WEEK AGO Accumulated incident duration KPI Accumulated incident duration is the total sum of minutes that all the incidents accumulated over a period of time. Typically you should compare the current and previous weeks. NRQL: FROM nrAQMIncident SELECT sum(duration)/(1000*60) AS 'Incident Minutes' WHERE current_state='closed' AND severity='CRITICAL' SINCE 1 WEEK AGO COMPARE WITH 1 WEEK AGO Mean time to close (MTTC) KPI Average duration of incidents within the period of time measured.

      "body": "Are you having problems working on a doc in GitHub? Check out the following common issues. GitHub authentication fails If you suddenly find that you can no longer push to your remote branch in GitHub Desktop, you may have developed a problem with SSH. If logging out of GitHub Desktop via Preferences doesn’t seem to help, you can confirm if you have an SSH issue by switching to the command line and trying to push manually. For example: git push --set-upstream origin second-kafka-pr-for-issue-1123 If this command prompts you for a passphrase, your SSH was somehow confused. By entering your passphrase, you should be back in business. If you can’t remember your passphrase, check out this article. My build is failing mysteriously Here’s a few things you can check if your build is failing: Indenting in the nav files Front matter If there's apostrophes and colons in frontmatter fields, surround them with quotes to avoid problems. Missing closed brackets or tags Poorly formatted image links Be careful when renaming images and their filename paths. A mismatch can cause the entire local build to fail. Be especially careful when dealing with image files that are imported. Image filenames Image filenames are case-sensitive. Using the wrong capitalization results in a missing image in the doc. Images with encoded values (like %) in the filename can be especially tricky, try to avoid them. Diagnose markdown errors with yarn-verify If you know which file is causing an error, you can further troubleshoot with the yarn verify-mdx path/to/file.mdx command. This command returns more information about the error than the normal Gatsby output. This includes things such as the specific character and line number causing the error. Example: Troubleshoot with yarn-verify Let's pretend I've made a changes to multiple docs in my branch. When I try to either run the site locally or access the Gatsby Cloud build, I get the following error: Unexpected character = (U+003D) before name, expected a character that can start a name, such as a letter, $, or _/usr/src/app/www/src/content/docs/new-relic-solutions/observability-maturity/uptime-performance-reliability/aqm-implementation-guide.mdx: Unexpected character = (U+003D) before name, expected a character that can start a name, such as a letter, $, or _ Copy The error does tell me that the doc with an error is /docs/new-relic-solutions/observability-maturity/uptime-performance-reliability/aqm-implementation-guide.mdx. Other than that, all I know is that there is a = character messing things up somewhere. Cool, but this is a NRQL doc, there are a dozens of = characters. So, I run yarn verify-mdx src/content/docs/new-relic-solutions/observability-maturity/uptime-performance-reliability/aqm-implementation-guide.mdx. This returns the following: reading src/content/docs/new-relic-solutions/observability-maturity/uptime-performance-reliability/aqm-implementation-guide.mdx { \"message\": \"Unexpected character `=` (U+003D) before name, expected a character that can start a name, such as a letter, `$`, or `_`\", \"name\": \"284:227\", \"reason\": \"Unexpected character `=` (U+003D) before name, expected a character that can start a name, such as a letter, `$`, or `_`\", \"line\": 284, \"column\": 227, \"location\": { \"start\": { \"line\": 284, \"column\": 227, \"offset\": 19129, \"index\": 1 }, \"end\": { \"line\": null, \"column\": null } }, \"source\": \"remark-mdx\", \"ruleId\": \"unexpected-character\", \"fatal\": true } [ Copy In this case, the relvant info is: \"line\": 284, \"column\": 227, Copy and \"source\": \"remark-mdx\", \"ruleId\": \"unexpected-character\", \"fatal\": true Copy This tells me that there is an unexpected character in line 284, column 227. Then I can go to that section of the doc and further troubleshoot, knowing exactly where the error comes from. In this case, I likely just need to wrap a NRQL example in quotes. Issues with the local site If you're running with issues with your local build, try these options: Stop and restart yarn In the terminal, ensure you're in the /docs-website directory. Hit CONTROL+C to interrupt the yarn process, if necessary. Run yarn && yarn start. Ensure the problem isn't with your branch In the terminal, ensure you're in the docs-website directory. Hit CONTROL+C to stop yarn, if necessary. In GitHub Desktop, commit any changes needed on your branch, and then switch to the Develop branch. Back in the terminal, run yarn && yarn start. If the site now builds correctly, the issue is with the changes in your branch. Stop Yarn again, go back to your branch, and troubleshoot. Clean your local cache Run yarn clean to blow away your local cache. This will make your next build slower, so make sure you have time! In the terminal, ensure you're in the docs-website directory. Hit CONTROL+C to stop yarn, if necessary. Begin a new build by running yarn clean && yarn && yarn start. Remove corrupted cache files There may be times when your .cache directory has been corrupted. This directory is ignored by Git, which means that it travels with you from branch to branch. This might be the problem if your local builds are failing regardless of which branch you’re on. To solve this from your /docs-website directory, run rm -rf .cache. Start a build from start Blow away all your node modules, hidden .cache folder, and local cache and start a build from scratch. This takes a long time to run, around 10–20 minutes. In the terminal, ensure you're in the docs-website directory. Hit CONTROL+C to stop yarn, if necessary. Blow away modules and cache and start from scratch by running the kknuke Keyboard Maestro command, or run yarn reboot in your terminal. Important If you use the kknuke Keyboard Maestro command, when everything completes, start the site by running yarn start. Run your local build in private mode Sometimes the local site builds, but pages within the site don't. Running the local build in a private/incognito session may to fix this issue. You can also try clearing out your browser's cache. My redirect throws a 404 error when testing it locally Redirects are a bit strange on local builds. To test them, navigate to the page that is being redirected, wait until it throws a 404, and then wait ~1-2 minutes. It should redirect you after a while. If it doesn’t, ensure you set up the redirect correctly. You can also test the redirects out in the Gatsby build. A check fails in the PR Important The only checks needed to merge a PR are the checks marked as required on the PR. These are run linter, run tests, license/cla, and unpaired translations removed for merges to develop, and build the docs site for merges to main. If a required check fails, the failure must be addressed in order for the PR to be merged. If an optional check fails, reach out in the help channel so that the hero can look into the failure, but feel free to merge the PR since optional checks don't block releases. Rarely, a build or check will fail due to some internal error. You can re-run the check by going to the PR, clicking Details, and then clicking Re-run jobs. If that doesn't fix it, you probably have genuine build errors. Pull down locally and troubleshoot. Reset the 'build the docs site' build check Caution This adds a LOT of time to the build check. There are times when this check fails. If this happens after your local builds have built successfully, you may need to force a rebuild of the cache. In your local repo, find the file gatsby-config.js (use CMD-P to jump to it fast in VSCode). Swap the first and second line of code. It doesn’t matter what order these lines are in, except to make the Gatsby Build check rebuild the cache. const fs = require('fs'); const parse = require('rehype-parse'); Save the file and commit the change to your PR. Re-run the build checks. Wait a LOOOOONG time. Troubleshoot merging conflicts Merge conflicts can seem pretty scary, but it’s ultimately just deciding between two different versions of a doc. Here are some tips on how to get through it. Fix your merge conflict as soon as possible. Especially if you’re working on taxonomy changes. If your branch lingers for a while it can get outdated from develop pretty fast and that can cause some unexpected issues. Check your fix locally to make sure that it looks good there. Ask your PR approver to review your PR after you fix the merge conflict. Here are two options to resolve conflicts: When you see the conflicts in GitHub desktop, click the option to resolve these in VS Code. Use the GitHub website editor (click the Resolve conflict button) to fix these. What’s new related merge conflicts Merge conflicts pop up pretty often with what’s new posts because the whats-new-ids.json file that’s automatically updated when the site builds can get out-of-date pretty fast. If you see changes to this file show up in GitHub Desktop, make sure to discard them, rather than push them up to your branch. This will make it less likely that other people will have to deal with merge conflicts related to this file. Caution Never merge a PR that changes whats-new-ids.json.",

Download the latest version, which contains executable files for Linux, macOS, and Windows. Move the executable for your platform into the location of your application's root directory. Temporarily raise the logging level for the New Relic agent for more accurate troubleshooting. After you change the logging level, restart your application. Run the executable. Recommendation: To scope your troubleshooting more easily, run nrdiag with a task suite (CLI option). The Diagnostics CLI automatically searches its root directory and subdirectories for agent configuration files and other relevant data. Platform-specific procedures To run the Diagnostics CLI, follow the procedures for your platform: Linux Ensure you have the Diagnostics CLI: From the command line, change the directory to your application's root directory and ensure that the nrdiag.zip file is present. OR Manually download the latest version. Unzip nrdiag.zip if necessary. From the nrdiag_1.2.3/linux directory, move nrdiag into the application's root directory. Run nrdiag (along with any CLI options ./nrdiag CLI_OPTIONS Copy The Diagnostics CLI outputs any issues it discovers, and uploads relevant files to your New Relic account if you include an attachment flag. macOS Ensure you have the Diagnostics CLI: From the command line, change directory to the application's root directory and ensure that the nrdiag.zip file is present.

Windows Ensure you have the Diagnostics CLI: From the command line, change directory to the application's root directory, and ensure that the nrdiag.zip file is present. OR Manually download the latest version. Unzip nrdiag.zip if necessary. From the nrdiag_1.2.3/win directory, move nrdiag.exe or nrdiag_x64.exe into the application's root directory. For troubleshooting web applications, ensure you are running the executable from your project's parent directory, or specify your config file location with the -c option. Run the executable (along with any CLI options from the directory you placed the binary. Since some checks require elevated permissions, for best results run from an admin shell. Run via PowerShell if you add any CLI_OPTIONS: ./nrdiag.exe CLI_OPTIONS Copy OR, for x64 systems: ./nrdiag_x64.exe CLI_OPTIONS Copy The Diagnostics CLI outputs any issues it discovers, and uploads relevant files to New Relic account if you include an attachment flag.

Docker container To troubleshoot your New Relic-instrumented application running in a Docker container, use the docker exec command: Download and unzip the nrdiag_latest.zip file. Copy the binary to the container. Replace IMAGE_NAME with the name of your docker container: docker cp nrdiag/linux/nrdiag IMAGE_NAME:/bin Copy Run the nrdiag command in the docker container. Replace IMAGE_NAME as above, and replace APPLICATION_ROOT with the root directory of your application, where you installed the New Relic agent: docker exec -it -w APPLICATION_ROOT IMAGE_NAME nrdiag Copy (Optional) Remove the nrdiag binary when finished: docker exec IMAGE_NAME rm /bin/nrdiag Copy Suites flag (highly recommended CLI option) A suite is a collection of health checks that target specific products or issues. Using a suite can help narrow the scope of troubleshooting and reduce the occurrence of false positives. To review a list of available suites, run the Diagnostics CLI with the -help suites option: ./nrdiag --help suites Copy To run suites with nrdiag, provide the -suites flag and one or more suite names (for example, java) to run as arguments. Linux, macOS: For 32-bit systems: ./nrdiag --suites SUITE NAMES Copy For 64-bit systems: ./nrdiag_x64 --suites SUITE NAMES Copy Windows: To run from PowerShell, add ./ to the start of cmd. For 32-bit systems: nrdiag.exe --suites SUITE NAMES Copy For 64-bit systems: nrdiag_x64.exe --suites SUITE NAMES Copy Upload results to a New Relic account Important If your system is configured to not connect to external IP addresses, this method will not work. Instead, attach the output files in an email to New Relic Support. If there is an issue with your license key you will need to manually upload results to your account. Automatic Account upload To upload your results automatically to a New Relic account when the Diagnostics CLI is executed, use the -attach or -a command line flag. This will validate any New Relic License Keys found in your environment for upload. Uploading your results to an account will automatically upload the contents of the nrdiag-output.json and nrdiag-output.zip. If you want to inspect or modify the file's contents before upload, follow the manual upload procedures. Linux, macOS, synthetic private minion: ./nrdiag -attach Copy Windows: To run from PowerShell, add ./ to the start of cmd. For 32-bit systems: nrdiag.exe -attach Copy For 64-bit systems: nrdiag_x64.exe -attach Copy Manual upload If you have a support ticket, use the permalink functionality to share your results. This will help improve troubleshooting speed. The New Relic diagnostics app has the drag and drop functionality if your results are unable to be automatically uploaded.",

Recommendation: To scope your troubleshooting more easily, run nrdiag with a task suite (CLI option). The Diagnostics CLI automatically searches its root directory and subdirectories for agent configuration files and other relevant data. Platform-specific procedures To run the Diagnostics CLI, follow the procedures for your platform: Linux Ensure you have the Diagnostics CLI: From the command line, change the directory to your application's root directory and ensure that the nrdiag.zip file is present.

Windows Ensure you have the Diagnostics CLI: From the command line, change directory to the application's root directory, and ensure that the nrdiag.zip file is present. OR Manually download the latest version. Unzip nrdiag.zip if necessary. From the nrdiag_1.2.3/win directory, move nrdiag.exe or nrdiag_x64.exe into the application's root directory. For troubleshooting web applications, ensure you are running the executable from your project's parent directory, or specify your config file location with the -c option. Run the executable (along with any CLI options from the directory you placed the binary. Since some checks require elevated permissions, for best results run from an admin shell. Run via PowerShell if you add any CLI_OPTIONS: ./nrdiag.exe CLI_OPTIONS Copy OR, for x64 systems: ./nrdiag_x64.exe CLI_OPTIONS Copy The Diagnostics CLI outputs any issues it discovers, and uploads relevant files to New Relic account if you include an attachment flag.

Docker container To troubleshoot your New Relic-instrumented application running in a Docker container, use the docker exec command: Download and unzip the nrdiag_latest.zip file. Copy the binary to the container. Replace IMAGE_NAME with the name of your docker container: docker cp nrdiag/linux/nrdiag IMAGE_NAME:/bin Copy Run the nrdiag command in the docker container. Replace IMAGE_NAME as above, and replace APPLICATION_ROOT with the root directory of your application, where you installed the New Relic agent: docker exec -it -w APPLICATION_ROOT IMAGE_NAME nrdiag Copy (Optional) Remove the nrdiag binary when finished: docker exec IMAGE_NAME rm /bin/nrdiag Copy Suites flag (highly recommended CLI option) A suite is a collection of health checks that target specific products or issues. Using a suite can help narrow the scope of troubleshooting and reduce the occurrence of false positives. To review a list of available suites, run the Diagnostics CLI with the -help suites option: ./nrdiag --help suites Copy To run suites with nrdiag, provide the -suites flag and one or more suite names (for example, java) to run as arguments.

If the Diagnostics CLI detects a problem, it suggests troubleshooting steps. The Diagnostics CLI can automatically upload troubleshooting data to a New Relic account. The Diagnostics CLI is open source and is located in GitHub. For additional troubleshooting steps for your agent, check out Not seeing data. Here's an example of the Diagnostics CLI running on Ubuntu Linux. The program checks your New Relic agent configurations for issues and generates zipped troubleshooting logs that are ready to be attached to support tickets. Compatibility The Diagnostics CLI is available for Linux, macOS, and Windows. It can detect common configuration issues for: APM: Available for all APM agents except C SDK. For the Go agent, only basic connectivity checks are available. Browser monitoring: Browser agent detection Infrastructure monitoring: Linux and Windows agents Mobile agents: iOS and Android Synthetic monitoring: Containerized private minions (CPM) The Diagnostics CLI does not require superuser or admin permissions to run, although we recommend those permissions for some checks. It will return an error if it does not have permissions to read the files it scans. Get started To use the Diagnostics CLI: Run the Diagnostics CLI, including task suites and command line options as needed. Supply the -attach flag for uploading results to your New Relic account. Optional: Validate your config file settings. Interpret the output. Like any other New Relic tool, the Diagnostics CLI service is designed to protect you and your customers' data privacy.

      "body": "Download latest version To use the Diagnostics CLI: Review the release notes, to make sure you have the latest version. Download the latest version, which contains executable files for Linux, macOS, and Windows. Move the executable for your platform into the location of your application's root directory. Temporarily raise the logging level for the New Relic agent for more accurate troubleshooting. After you change the logging level, restart your application. Run the executable. Recommendation: To scope your troubleshooting more easily, run nrdiag with a task suite (CLI option). The Diagnostics CLI automatically searches its root directory and subdirectories for agent configuration files and other relevant data. Platform-specific procedures To run the Diagnostics CLI, follow the procedures for your platform: Linux Ensure you have the Diagnostics CLI: From the command line, change the directory to your application's root directory and ensure that the nrdiag.zip file is present. OR Manually download the latest version. Unzip nrdiag.zip if necessary. From the nrdiag_1.2.3/linux directory, move nrdiag into the application's root directory. Run nrdiag (along with any CLI options ./nrdiag CLI_OPTIONS Copy The Diagnostics CLI outputs any issues it discovers, and uploads relevant files to your New Relic account if you include an attachment flag. macOS Ensure you have the Diagnostics CLI: From the command line, change directory to the application's root directory and ensure that the nrdiag.zip file is present. OR Manually download the latest version. Unzip nrdiag.zip if necessary. From the nrdiag_1.2.3/mac directory, move nrdiag into the application's root directory. Run nrdiag (along with any CLI options ./nrdiag CLI_OPTIONS Copy The Diagnostics CLI outputs any issues it discovers, and uploads relevant files to your New Relic account if you include an attachment flag. Windows Ensure you have the Diagnostics CLI: From the command line, change directory to the application's root directory, and ensure that the nrdiag.zip file is present. OR Manually download the latest version. Unzip nrdiag.zip if necessary. From the nrdiag_1.2.3/win directory, move nrdiag.exe or nrdiag_x64.exe into the application's root directory. For troubleshooting web applications, ensure you are running the executable from your project's parent directory, or specify your config file location with the -c option. Run the executable (along with any CLI options from the directory you placed the binary. Since some checks require elevated permissions, for best results run from an admin shell. Run via PowerShell if you add any CLI_OPTIONS: ./nrdiag.exe CLI_OPTIONS Copy OR, for x64 systems: ./nrdiag_x64.exe CLI_OPTIONS Copy The Diagnostics CLI outputs any issues it discovers, and uploads relevant files to New Relic account if you include an attachment flag. Browser monitoring Ensure you have the latest version of the Diagnostics CLI. If necessary, manually download the latest version. Unzip nrdiag.zip if necessary. From the nrdiag_1.2.3/OS directory, run nrdiag (along with any CLI options: ./nrdiag -browser-url WEBSITE_URL CLI_OPTIONS Copy The Diagnostics CLI outputs any issues it discovers and uploads relevant files to your New Relic account if you include an attachment flag. Docker container To troubleshoot your New Relic-instrumented application running in a Docker container, use the docker exec command: Download and unzip the nrdiag_latest.zip file. Copy the binary to the container. Replace IMAGE_NAME with the name of your docker container: docker cp nrdiag/linux/nrdiag IMAGE_NAME:/bin Copy Run the nrdiag command in the docker container. Replace IMAGE_NAME as above, and replace APPLICATION_ROOT with the root directory of your application, where you installed the New Relic agent: docker exec -it -w APPLICATION_ROOT IMAGE_NAME nrdiag Copy (Optional) Remove the nrdiag binary when finished: docker exec IMAGE_NAME rm /bin/nrdiag Copy Suites flag (highly recommended CLI option) A suite is a collection of health checks that target specific products or issues. Using a suite can help narrow the scope of troubleshooting and reduce the occurrence of false positives. To review a list of available suites, run the Diagnostics CLI with the -help suites option: ./nrdiag --help suites Copy To run suites with nrdiag, provide the -suites flag and one or more suite names (for example, java) to run as arguments. Linux, macOS: For 32-bit systems: ./nrdiag --suites SUITE NAMES Copy For 64-bit systems: ./nrdiag_x64 --suites SUITE NAMES Copy Windows: To run from PowerShell, add ./ to the start of cmd. For 32-bit systems: nrdiag.exe --suites SUITE NAMES Copy For 64-bit systems: nrdiag_x64.exe --suites SUITE NAMES Copy Upload results to a New Relic account Important If your system is configured to not connect to external IP addresses, this method will not work. Instead, attach the output files in an email to New Relic Support. If there is an issue with your license key you will need to manually upload results to your account. Automatic Account upload To upload your results automatically to a New Relic account when the Diagnostics CLI is executed, use the -attach or -a command line flag. This will validate any New Relic License Keys found in your environment for upload. Uploading your results to an account will automatically upload the contents of the nrdiag-output.json and nrdiag-output.zip. If you want to inspect or modify the file's contents before upload, follow the manual upload procedures. Linux, macOS, synthetic private minion: ./nrdiag -attach Copy Windows: To run from PowerShell, add ./ to the start of cmd. For 32-bit systems: nrdiag.exe -attach Copy For 64-bit systems: nrdiag_x64.exe -attach Copy Manual upload If you have a support ticket, use the permalink functionality to share your results. This will help improve troubleshooting speed. The New Relic diagnostics app has the drag and drop functionality if your results are unable to be automatically uploaded.",

It's free, forever! account dropdown In the upper right of the New Relic UI, the account dropdown gives you access to your account settings. If you're trying to switch between accounts, use the account switcher. account switcher If you have access to more than one account in a multi-account organization, you can use the account switcher to switch between accounts. This is located in the top right of most New Relic UI pages. For more on factors that affect access to accounts, see Factors affecting access. To find account settings, use the account dropdown. administrator A type of user role on a New Relic account. For more information, see Users. agent At New Relic, an agent is a piece of monitoring software that provides integrations with various technologies (for example, web frameworks, host operating systems, or database types). The agents send that data to New Relic, usually on a specific cadence. For more information, see: New Relic Instant Observability Install agents agent API Some New Relic agents have agent APIs that allow you to extend the functionality of an agent. You can use the API to control, customize and extend the functionality of the agent. Here are some agent API docs: APM agents: C SDK API Go agent API Java agent API .NET agent API Node.js agent API PHP agent API Ruby agent API Python agent API Browser agent: Browser agent API Mobile agents: iOS SDK API Android SDK API aggregated metrics Aggregated metric data summarizes calls to specific methods in your application, including how many times each one was called and response times. In the New Relic UI, you see the class and method names along with their aggregate numbers. Metric data aggregation depends on the New Relic tool and your subscription level. For more information, see the documentation about data retention. aggregation delay The length of time in seconds to wait for the aggregation window to fill with data. Required when using CADENCE or EVENT_FLOW aggreation_method types. aggregation function You can use NRQL query functions, such as sum(), average(), or latest() to choose how the data points in an aggregation window should be processed into a single data point. The single aggregated data point is what's passed through the alert evaluation process. aggregation method New Relic aggregates data into windows, and needs to determine when the current window ends and the next one begins. The aggregation_method is the logic that tells us when we have all the data for a given aggregation window. Once the window is closed, the data is aggregated into a single point and evaluated against the threshold. This field is optional. One of the following three values can be specified: EVENT_FLOW: (Default) Each aggregation window will wait until it starts to see timestamps arrive that are past its own delay setting. Once this occurs, the data is published. Relies on the timestamps of arriving data, so wall-clock time is no longer relevant. Works best for sources that come in frequently and with low event spread (high througput metrics) CADENCE: Classic New Relic logic where each evaluation window waits exactly as long as the aggregation_delay setting, using the wall-clock time as a timer. aggregation_delay is required when using this option. Data arriving too late will be dropped, which can cause false alerts. EVENT_TIMER: Each aggregation window has a timer on it, set to the aggregation_timer setting. The Timer starts running as soon as the first data point appears for that aggregation window (based on the data point’s timestamp). The aggregation_timer is reset for each new data point that arrives for that window. Once the aggregation_timer reaches 0, the aggregation window is published. Ideal for sparse and batched data, such as cloud integrations and infrequent error logs. aggregation timer The length of time in seconds to wait after each data point received, to ensure the entire batch is processed. Required when using EVENT_TIMER aggregation_method type. aggregation window Streaming alerts gathers data together into specific amounts of time. These windows of time are customizable. Data points are collected together based their timestamps and reported as a batch. The customizable aggregation window provides greater flexibility and fewer false violations when alerting on irregular or less frequent data points. alert An alert communicates an event or incident that designated personnel can track through Alerts. For an explanation of how basic alerts concepts are related, see Concepts and workflow. alert condition An alert condition (or condition), identified by its unique numeric condition_id, contains the criteria for creating a violation. The condition includes the threshold that is set for a metric timeslice or a custom metric over time on a chosen target. For an explanation of how a condition relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. alert evaluation Streaming data is assessed on a set of aggregation windows to determine if an alert condition is violating or recovering. The aggregation window time is how long we'll collect data before running the NRQL query condition. The offset evaluation time is how long you want us to wait for late data before assessing it. If a window doesn't have any data points, it's treated as a gap for loss of signal. alert policy A collection of one or more conditions, one or more notification channels, and an Incident preference setting. If a condition contained within the policy opens a violation, an incident may be opened depending on the Incident preference setting. Notifications will then be sent to all channels attached to the policy. For an explanation of how a policy relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. apdex Apdex is an industry-standard way to measure users' satisfaction with the response time of an application or service. New Relic rates each response as Satisfied, Tolerated, or Frustrated, and uses these ratings to calculate an overall user satisfaction score. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. apdex_f The response time above which a transaction are rated frustrating. Defaults to four times apdex_t. Requests that complete in less than apdex_t are rated satisfied. Requests that take longer than apdex_t, but less than four times apdex_t (apdex_f), are tolerated. Any requests that take longer than apdex_f are rated frustrating. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. apdex_t The response time above which a transaction is considered tolerable. The default value is 0.5 seconds, but you can change this in your Apdex settings. Requests that complete in less than apdex_t are rated satisfied. Requests that take more than apdex_t, but less than apdex_f, are tolerated. Any requests that take longer than apdex_f are rated frustrating. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. API (application programming interface) New Relic offers a variety of APIs and SDKs. For more information, see the introduction to New Relic's APIs. APM New Relic's APM (application performance monitoring) provides monitoring of your web or non-web application's performance. APM supports apps using several programming languages. application For New Relic purposes, any program instrumented by New Relic. application ID Some New Relic solutions assign a monitored application a unique application ID, often shortened to app ID. When present, this ID is available in the UI. It is also reported as an attribute and can be queried. For how to determine this, see Find app ID. application name The name that New Relic combines with your license key to uniquely identify a particular app. For more information, see Name your application. Applied Intelligence (AI) Applied Intelligence (AI) helps you find, troubleshoot, and resolve problems more quickly. Specifically, it’s a hybrid machine learning engine that reduces alert noise, correlates incidents, and automatically detects anomalies. Applied Intelligence includes Alerts, Incident Intelligence, and Proactive Detection. attribute Attributes are key-value pairs attached to data objects reported to New Relic. Attributes add detail, and they're similar to tags or labels in other SaaS software. You can explore this data by querying or searching via the UI or by using the data dictionary. Examples: APM reports a Transaction event. This includes timing data for the transaction in a duration attribute, which might have a value of .002. Our Infrastructure Monitoring reports a ProcessSample event. This includes a variety of CPU usage attributes, including a cpuSystemPercent attribute, which might have a value of .01. Our Telemetry SDK reports a Metric data type for storing metrics, with attached attributes like metricName and newrelic.source. Some New Relic tools allow you to report custom attributes to enhance your monitoring. For more information about attributes in APM, see Agent attributes. availability monitoring See Types of Synthetics monitors. browser The New Relic UI supports most browsers. For more information, see Supported browsers. For our end-user browser monitoring tool, see Browser Monitoring. Browser monitoring A Real User Monitoring (RUM) solution that measures the speed and performance of your end users as they navigate to your site from different web browsers, devices, operating systems, and networks. background external See web external. child account See parent account. cloud-based integration New Relic offers cloud-based integrations with providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform. collector The component that collects data from New Relic agents running on an app server, mobile device, or end-user browser. While the agent is installed on a user's app server, the collectors are centrally located in New Relic's data center. In order to contact the collector, the agent must be able to reach New Relic's domains and IP addresses. (The exact domain or IP depends on the New Relic monitoring tool.) The collector receives and interprets this data, and stores it in a database. The data is then retrieved and presented in the New Relic UI and by our various REST APIs. Command line interface (CLI) Our command line interface (CLI) is a tool you can use to build a New Relic application. This is the same tool our own engineers use. Go here for quick start instructions. Go to our Developer site for sample apps and guides. compute unit (CU) A unit of measurement that determines your pricing for some New Relic products governed by our original product-based pricing model. For more information, see Compute unit pricing. condition_id See alert condition. CPM (calls per minute) The number of calls your application receives each minute. This usually corresponds to the number of page views or external connections, and is usually the same as RPM (requests per minute). CPU burn The time consumed by code minus the wait time for a transaction. This is the time actually spent processing the transaction. It appears in the New Relic UI at the top of the transaction view for the agents that provide it (Ruby and PHP only). custom attribute A key-value pair added to a transaction or event in order to gain additional information about it. For more information, see custom attributes. custom dashboard A customizable dashboard with charts and tables that includes data from multiple New Relic data sources. For more information, see dashboards. custom event An event, in New Relic terms, is a data object with attached attributes. New Relic reports default event types, like Transaction and TransactionError. You can also create your own events. Events can be queried, and are used in some other features. You can generate custom events with APM agents, the browser monitoring agent, the mobile monitoring agents, and via the Event API. Alternatively, you can add custom attributes to some existing default New Relic events. custom instrumentation Custom instrumentation allows you to extend New Relic's monitoring to instrument code elements New Relic doesn't automatically instrument. Custom instrumentation is useful when your framework is not supported by New Relic, or when New Relic fails to pick up some element of your program. You can also use custom instrumentation to block a transaction from being reported entirely. For more information, see Custom instrumentation. custom metric Metric timeslice data that is manually recorded via an API call. Custom metrics allow you to record arbitrary metrics; for example, timing or computer resource data. All custom metric names must be prefixed with Custom/. For more information, see Custom metrics. Not to be confused with custom instrumentation data. data collector See collector. data explorer Use the data explorer to access, query and customize your data, create visualizations, and make connections between your services in a consistent and curated experience. For more on using the data explorer, see Introduction to the data explorer. degradation period When a data source enters a violating state, a degradation period of time begins. The degradation period is set in the condition's threshold. A violation will open if the source stays in a violating state for the entire degradation period. In addition: If the data source enters a non-violating state before the entire time has elapsed, the degradation period countdown is reset, and a violation does not open. If your alert condition threshold is configured as at least once in, the degradation period always lasts a single minute. dimensional metric A dimensional metric is a metric that has multiple attributes, also known as dimensions. At New Relic, we report dimensional metrics using the Metric data type. For more on other metric data types, see Metric data. Docker An open platform for distributed applications, which allows you to assemble multi-container portable apps. Infrastructure Monitoring includes integrated Docker monitoring. For more information about Docker, see the Docker website. downtime The period of time when customers cannot access your site and your app is not reporting to New Relic. For more information, see Synthetic Monitoring and Types of synthetic monitors. entity In New Relic, an entity is anything we can identify that has data you can monitor. An entity can be something you monitor directly, like applications and microservices, or indirectly, like data centers. You can identify one or more entities to be targets for alert conditions. In the Alerts API, the entity being monitored is identified with an entity_id. For more on this, see What are entities? event The word event is a general term that can have many meanings. At New Relic, event can have several meanings: At New Relic, event data is one of our core data types. Event data represents a record of a single event at a particular moment in time. Events can vary by type (for example, Transaction or Mobile, and will have associated attributes (for example, timestamp or transactionName). For more details, see Event data. For our infrastructure monitoring, the word event can be used to refer to important system and host activity. For example, a configuration change for a monitored host would be registered on Infrastructure's Events UI page. For alerts, the Events UI page displays a list of alerts-related incidents for your monitored entities. Events are reported for a violation opening and for closing. In some contexts, event can refer to any NRQL-queryable data type. For example, when you run a NRQL query, you will see a count of inspected events: this refers to a count of all data types queried. expected error An expected error is a common error that you don't want to affect your Apdex score or error rate. For more information, see Manage errors in APM. exporter At New Relic, an exporter is a type of integration that reports telemetry data to New Relic from a third-party (non-New Relic) telemetry tool. For examples, see Exporters, or search our integration quickstarts in New Relic I/O. Flex New Relic Flex is an application-agnostic, all-in-one infrastructure integration. With it, you can build your own integration that collects metric data from a wide variety of services, and that can instrument any app that exposes metrics over a standard protocol (HTTP, file, shell) in a standard format (for example, JSON or plain text) to the terminal. It's a recommended way to create a custom integration, because it doesn't require coding skills. framework A framework is a structured collection of pre-defined functions, into which an application builder inserts their own code to build their application. A framework is not the same as a library. While a library is a collection of functions you can call as needed, a framework is a skeleton for your application. The functions in that framework then call your functions. For more about the distinction between a framework and a library, see What is the difference between a framework and a library?. New Relic automatically instruments many common frameworks. For more about the frameworks New Relic supports, see the agent-specific documentation: C SDK supported frameworks Go supported frameworks Java supported frameworks .NET supported frameworks Node.js supported frameworks PHP supported frameworks Python supported frameworks Ruby supported frameworks harvest cycle The period of time between each connection from a New Relic agent to the collector. Between harvest cycles, an agent collects and caches data. At the end of the cycle an agent reports those data to the collector, then begins a new harvest cycle. health status indicator Some New Relic UI pages have a health status indicator appearing next to an index of monitored entities. This is a colored bar (generally green, yellow, red, or gray) indicating the status of your app or other entity monitored by New Relic. It also indicates whether the entity has any alert policies assigned to it and whether there are any policy violations. In general, the colored bar will be green, yellow, red, or gray to indicate the health status. Exceptions: Our REST API (v2) uses orange instead of yellow for the application's health and reporting status. Service maps use different criteria for reporting the health of a connection between an app and an external service not monitored by New Relic (for example, a third party API). host At New Relic, a host means one of the following: A physical machine is a hardware-based device with dedicated physical resources, including memory, processing, and storage. Each machine has its own OS which applications run on. A virtual machine (VM) is the software implementation of a physical machine that executes programs like a physical machine. One or more virtual machines can run on a physical machine. Each virtual machine has its own OS and allocated virtual machine resources such as RAM and CPU. A cloud instance is a type of virtual machine that is run in the public cloud. In this context, virtual machines and cloud instances are different from Java Virtual Machines (JVMs) and containers. host ID Each host identified by APM is assigned a host ID. This ID is used to uniquely identify it, and to retrieve data about that host via the REST API. For more information, see List host ID. ignored error An error that you have told the APM agent not to report to the collector. For more information, see Manage errors in APM. incident An incident is a collection of one or more violations of the conditions defined in an alert policy. An incident record includes all of the open and close time stamps for each violation, as well as chart snapshots of the data being evaluated around the time of each violation. You can view detailed information from the Incidents pages in the user interface. You can also select your preference for how we roll up violations into the incident. For an explanation of how an incident relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. Infrastructure monitoring By connecting changes in host performance to changes in your configuration, infrastructure monitoring provides real-time metrics and powerful analytics that reduce your mean-time-to-resolution (MTTR). Infrastructure is specifically designed for complex environments that need flexible, dynamic server monitoring, from a physical datacenter to thousands of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances and other types of integrations. Insights Insights was the name for the New Relic product that previously governed the reporting of custom events, as well as the ability to query and chart your New Relic data. These features are now a fundamental part of the New Relic One platform and are no longer governed by the Insights product or name. To learn more about these features: Event API for reporting custom events Query and chart data For historical reasons, the word \"Insights\" is still used in some places. For example: Some APM agents still have Insights language in their codebase. For example, the Java agent custom_insights_events configuration. For New Relic organizations on our original pricing model, Insights Pro is still the product name governing custom event data ingest and retention. There is an API key called the Insights insert key. instance ID Each instance identified by New Relic is assigned a unique instance ID. Instance IDs are most commonly found for JVMs (Java Virtual Machines), but can exist for each agent. This ID is used to uniquely identify it, and to retrieve data about that instance via the REST API. For more information, see List instance IDs. instrumentation The collection of data from an application or host. When New Relic instruments a framework, it detects the methods and calls used by that framework, and intelligently groups them together. integration At New Relic, an integration refers to a solution that integrates with a specific technology (like a web framework or a type of database). All our integrations can be found as quickstarts in New Relic Instant Observability. interaction In our mobile monitoring, an interaction is a specific code path initiated by a user interaction (usually a button press). An interaction is the mobile equivalent of a transaction, and like a transaction an interaction can be traced and monitored. You can see much of the data included in an interaction in the BrowserInteraction event. interaction trace An interaction trace is a complete picture of a single interaction. With interaction traces, New Relic gives you much deeper visibility into a single slow interaction, which can help you understand a broader problem. Interaction traces are the mobile equivalent of a transaction trace. For more information, see Creating interactions (iOS) and Creating interactions (Android). inventory data Inventory data is information about the status or configuration of a service or host. Examples of inventory data include: Configuration settings Name of the host the service is on Amazon AWS region Port being used For more information, see Understand and use data. key transaction A web transaction that the user has marked as particularly important; for example, key business events (such as signups or purchase confirmations), or transactions with a high performance impact (such as searches). Key transactions have their own pages in the UI and other customized values. For more information, see Key transactions. launcher A launcher is a specific piece of code you can include when you create a New Relic One app. It creates the tile on the homepage that you click to launch the app. For more information, see the documentation about core UI components. log A log is a message about a system used to understand the activity of the system and to diagnose problems. For more information on how we use log data, see Log management. Log monitoring Our log management and monitoring features give you the tools to collect, process, explore, visualize, and alert on your log data using your existing log forwarder. With all of your log data in one place, you'll be able to make better decisions, detect and resolve problems more quickly, and see your logs in context to troubleshoot faster. Logs Our Logs feature is a scalable log management platform that allows you to connect your log data with the rest of your telemetry data. Pre-built plugins with some of the most common open-source logging tools make it simple to send your data from anywhere to New Relic. Logs in context Logs in context makes it easy to link to your log data with related data across the rest of our platform. Bringing all of this data together in a single tool allows you to quickly get to the root cause of an issue and find the log lines that you need to identify and resolve a problem. master account See parent account. metric A metric is a numeric measurement. Metric data is a broad category because there are several ways to make and report measurements. For more about how metrics are reported at New Relic, see New Relic data types. metric timeslice New Relic reports metrics in several ways. One variety of metric data is called metric timeslice data; this is the type of data used to generate many of the charts in APM, mobile monitoring, and browser monitoring (for more details, see metric timeslice data). Over time, metric timeslice data is aggregated into longer timeslice data records for more efficient storage. For more about how we aggregate this type of data, see Data aggregation. For how to query this type of data, see Query metric timeslice data. metric grouping issue A metric grouping issue occurs when an account sends too many differently named metric timeslice data points to New Relic, and those individual web transactions are not properly aggregated. For example, rather than a single /user/controlpanel/ metric name, you might see /user/controlpanel/alice, /user/controlpanel/bob, and /user/controlpanel/carol. For more information, see Metric grouping issues. minion The software that accepts monitor jobs from a private location. A minion is a packaged virtual appliance that runs in your hypervisor. For more information, see Private locations overview and install and configure private minions. Mobile monitoring Mobile monitoring allows you to monitor and manage the performance of your mobile apps on Android, iOS, tvOS, and other systems. Mobile monitoring provides end-to-end details, including crashes, throughput, HTTP requests, error traces, and more. Not to be confused with New Relic's own mobile apps for Android, iPhone, and iPad. monitor For our Synthetic Monitoring, a monitor ensures your website or API endpoint is available. For more information, see Adding and editing monitors. NerdGraph NerdGraph is our GraphQL API, an efficient and flexible query language that lets you request exactly the data you need, without over-fetching or under-fetching. NerdGraph calls get all the data you need in a single request. NerdGraph also makes it easier to evolve APIs over time and enables powerful developer tools. You can use our NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer to explore the schema and find definitions. With valid New Relic API key, you can try it out yourself at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Nerdlet A Nerdlet is a component of a New Relic One application. It's a specific UI view, represented by a React JavaScript package. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. Nerdpack A Nerdpack is a component of a New Relic One application. It's the package containing all the files needed by that application. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. New Relic Edge with Infinite Tracing New Relic Edge with Infinite Tracing is a fully managed, distributed tracing service that observes 100% of your application traces, then provides actionable data so you can solve issues faster. For more information, see /docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/get-started/how-new-relic-distributed-tracing-works. New Relic One For more information, see Introduction to New Relic One. New Relic One catalog Our catalog is a collection of applications built on the New Relic One platform. The catalog includes custom apps we've built, public open source apps, and any apps that you buid. You can browse the catalog on New Relic One. NRQL (New Relic query language) NRQL is a query language, similar in form to SQL, that allows you to query the data stored in your New Relic account. non-web transaction APM identifies transactions as either web or non-web. When New Relic does not detect a transaction was initiated by a web request, this is called a non-web transaction. For more information, see Background processes and other non-web transactions. notification The message sent when an incident opens, is acknowledged, or closes. The type of notification is defined by the alert policy's notification channel. For an explanation of how notifications relate to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. notification channel Where we send a notification when an incident opens, is acknowledged, or closes. Available channels include email, mobile push notifications, webhooks, and more. on-host integration On-host integrations refer to integrations that reside on your own servers or hosts and that communicate with our infrastructure agent. For more information, see Introduction to on-host integrations. owner For accounts on our original pricing model, this is a type of user role: the user who initially created the account. For more information, see Users. page load timing With page load timing, New Relic monitors the full load time for end-user browsers. New Relic's application agents dynamically inject JavaScript into the page, then capture the following key load points: Navigation start: The user initiates the transaction. First byte: The browser receives the requested page. DOM ready: The browser has finished parsing DOM. Page ready: Page loading is complete. Page load timing is sometimes referred to as RUM, or real user monitoring. Unlike standard RUM, page load timing also captures JavaScript errors and AJAX requests. For more information, see Page load timing process. parameter Deprecated term; see attribute. parent account New Relic organizations can have a parent/child account structure. This structure was much more important for organizations on our original user model, but is still used for some features for organizations on the New Relic One user model. Learn more about account structure. Parent accounts were previously referred to as \"master accounts\", and child accounts were previously referred to as \"sub-accounts\". permalink A unique URL that links to a view of your application at a specific point in time. Permalinks are useful for troubleshooting and for sharing interesting time windows with colleagues. pinger The component of New Relic that connects to your website to verify your website is accessible. New Relic has pingers in Europe, Asia, and the United States. Each pinger attempts to contact your website at least once every two minutes. If enough pingers are unable to reach your website, your application will be considered down. For in-depth scriptable testing, including real browser tests and tests of API endpoints, see Synthetic Monitoring. Synthetic Monitoring includes free ping monitoring, which allows you to monitor your website from locations around the world. For more information, see Types of Synthetic monitors. polling interval (AWS) Our Amazon integrations query your AWS services according to a polling interval, which varies depending on the integration. Each polling interval occurs for every AWS entity. For example, if you have thirteen Elastic Load Balancers (ELB), each one will be polled every five minutes. Depending on the AWS integration, there may be delays in the timing between the API request and the metric data returned. If you notice unusual delays, follow the integration troubleshooting procedures. PPM (pages per minute) The number of pages per minute your application serves. private location A Synthetic monitor feature that allows you to run Synthetic monitors from within your own systems by creating private minions. Private locations allow you to extend your Synthetic coverage to new geographical locations, and to monitor websites behind your firewall such as an intranet site. For more information, see Private locations overview. recovery period A recovery period of time begins when a data source enters a non-violating state after being in a violating state. The recovery period is set in the condition's threshold. A violation will close when a source remains in a non-violating state and the recovery period time has elapsed. If the data source enters a violating state before the time has elapsed, the recovery period clock will reset and the violation won't close. response time The duration of time between a request for service and a response. For more information, see Response time. restricted user A type of user role on a New Relic account. For more information, see Users. rollup Using the same application name for multiple applications. This allows you to combine data in APM, either from multiple applications, or from multiple instances of an application. For more information, see Rolling up app data. root span For distributed tracing, the root span is the first span in a trace. In many cases, the root span duration will represent the duration of the entire trace, or be very close to it. However, for more complex, modern systems that use a lot of asynchronous, non-blocking processes, this will not be true. For those systems, the root span’s duration may be significantly less than the duration of the trace. RPM The term RPM usually refers to the number of requests per minute your application receives from users. This is usually the same as CPM (calls per minute). Historically, some New Relic monitoring solutions, like APM and Browser Monitoring, used to contain RPM in the URL; for example, https://rpm.newrelic.com. This language use originally referred to Rails performance management because the first iteration of our product monitored Ruby on Rails applications. We monitor many more languages and systems than Ruby now. RUM (real user monitoring) See page load timing. runbook A runbook contains standard procedures and operations typically used by system administrators, network operations staff, and other personnel to handle outages, alert incidents, and other situations. If your organization stores runbook instructions as URLs, you can link this information to an alerts policy so your personnel has easy access to this information when an incident violates the defined policy thresholds. SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) SAML is an XML-based data format for sharing authentication data between two parties. New Relic accounts must obtain a SAML certificate in order to enable Single Sign On for their users. For more information, see SAML service providers. Selenium Selenium is an open-source browser testing suite. Synthetics uses Selenium to test monitored websites with real browsers. For more information, see monitor types. service A service is a cluster of runtime server processes that accomplish a particular task, usually service requests. Unlike an application, a service is not usually invoked by a human. New Relic offers a variety of integrations that allow you to report data from your services. signal The stream of telemetry data that's watched and alerted on. You use NRQL queries to define a signal. signal filter When we receive data and it's routed to the streaming alerts platform, your NRQL WHERE clause will filter the data coming in. The filtered streaming data is what's evaluated for loss of signal violations, for example. span In a distributed trace, a span is a \"named, timed operation representing a contiguous segment of work in that trace\" (from OpenTracing.io definition). For distributed tracing, spans are displayed in the distributed tracing UI, and the data type Span is available to be queried. See also root span. SSL certificate SSL certificates encrypt data that is being transmitted. While New Relic refers to security certificates as SSL because it is a more commonly used term, all certificates adhere to industry standards for secure encryption in transit. SSO (single sign on) SSO (single sign on) allows you to manage user authentication in New Relic using an external SSO provider. For more information, see Setting up SSO. streaming algorithm This is what determines when the data in an aggregation window is processed. The streaming algorithm uses your server's clock time and the aggregation window size to trigger the alert evaluation process. sub-accounts See master account. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic monitoring allows you to monitor your website or API endpoint via automated, scriptable tools. Use free ping monitor to ensure your website is accessible, or expand your monitoring with browser monitors, which test your website with real browsers. Go further with scripting, to script browsers or API monitors for sophisticated testing. target A target is a resource or component monitored by a New Relic monitoring tool that has been identified in an alert condition. When the data source for that target crosses the defined critical threshold, we will open a violation. Depending on your policy's Incident preference setting, Alerts may create an incident record and send notifications through the defined channels. See also entity. tag Tags are key:value metadata added to monitored apps, hosts, dashboards, and other entities to help you organize your data at a high level. For details, see Tags. thresholds Thresholds are alert condition settings that define a violation. Threshold values include the value a data source must pass to trigger a violation and the time-related settings that define a violation; for example: Passing a certain value for at least x minutes Passing a certain value only once in x minutes While the data source passes a certain value, a degradation period starts. Likewise, when that data source stops passing a certain value, a recovery period starts. The durations of these two time periods are defined in the alert condition threshold settings. Thresholds have a required critical (red) threshold and an optional warning (yellow) threshold. In the UI, the entity's health status indicator will change to yellow or red when a threshold has been crossed and a violation will open. For more information, see Define thresholds. For an explanation of how thresholds relate to other basic Alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. throughput Throughput is a measurement of user activity for a monitored application. APM throughput and Browser Monitoring throughput are measured in different ways: APM: requests per minute (RPM) Browser: page views per minute (PPM) tier A tier can refer to how New Relic categorizes or visualizes the various agent language ecosystems that we support. For example: In APM, the color-coded categories that appear on your app's main Overview chart show response time spent in various functions, processes, or agents as tiers; for example, request queuing, garbage collection, Middleware, JVMs, etc. In New Relic labels, TIER can be used to define or classify the client-server architecture; for example, front-end and back-end tiers. \"Tier\" may sometimes be used to refer to our pricing editions. time picker By default the New Relic UI shows data for the past 30 minutes, ending now. To change the time window, use the time picker. time range A time range can refer to a length of time selected in the New Relic UI. New Relic displays a time range depending on the range you select using the time picker. timeslice data See metric timeslice data. trace A trace is a description of how a request travels through a system. Trace data helps you understand the performance of your system and diagnose problems. For more information on how we use trace data, see New Relic data types. traffic light See health status. transaction A transaction is defined as one logical unit of work in an application. This term primarily refers to server-side transactions monitored by APM. For more information, see documentation about web transactions and non-web transactions. The term transaction is also sometimes used in Browser Monitoring. In that case, it primarily refers to activity beginning with a browser-side web request and ending with a complete page load. transaction trace A transaction trace is a complete picture of a single transaction, down to the database queries and exact invocation patterns. With transaction traces, New Relic gives you much deeper visibility into a single slow transaction, which can help you understand a broader problem. For more information, see Transaction traces. UI The New Relic user interface. For more information, see Standard page functions. user A user can refer to a specific user role in a New Relic account. For more information, see Users. UTC Universal Time Coordinated (UTC), or Coordinated Universal Time, is a standard timestamp for synchronizing time around the world. value function (metrics) The numeric value obtained from metric timeslice data; for example, an average, minimum, maximum, total, sample size, etc. violation A violation occurs when the entity monitored by an alert condition reports a value that crosses the thresholds defined in that condition. For an explanation of how violations relate to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. You can view a summary of the violations for a selected incident's page. You can also view the violations for a specific entity from the product's UI. web external Web external is the term applied to the portion of time spent in transactions to external applications from within the code of the application you are monitoring. That time can be a call to a third party company (a payment provider, for example) or it could be a call to another microservice within your own company. Web external demonstrates how performance is impacted by your code executing outside the application you are measuring. web transaction A transaction is defined as one logical unit of work in an application. This term primarily refers to server-side transactions monitored by APM. Web transactions are initiated with an HTTP request. For most organizations, these represent customer-centric interactions and thus are the most important transactions to monitor. For more information, see Web transactions and Non-web transactions. WebDriverJS WebDriver is a Selenium component, used to control Synthetics scripted browsers. Specifically, Synthetics uses WebDriverJS, a Node.js-based flavor of Selenium. For more information, see Writing scripted browsers and Scripted browser examples. workload A workload represents a group of entities that work together to provide a digital service. For more information, see Workloads.",

      "body": "New Relic's global data hosting structure consists of two regions: the European Union (EU) region and the United States (US) region. Selecting your preferred region during the account setup process allows you to specify the region where your performance monitoring data will be hosted. You can also create accounts in each region. Requirements Access to the New Relic EU region requires the latest agent version. For new customers: Install the most recent agent version. For existing customers: Update to the most recent agent version. Minimum agent version required: C SDK 1.0.0 or higher Go 2.0.0 or higher Java 4.0.0 or higher .NET 8.0.0 or higher Node.js 3.0.0 or higher PHP 8.0.0.204 or higher Python 3.0.0.89 or higher Ruby 5.0.0.342 or higher Regions and availability Your choice of data center is not limited by your geographic location. You can choose to create an account with data hosted in either the EU or US region, regardless of where you or your systems reside. You can also create accounts in each region. New Relic offers almost all the same active products, features, support offerings, and performance levels in the EU region as what is offered in the US region. Exceptions: The following are not supported with an EU region account: Infinite Tracing is not available. APM's weekly performance reports are not available. Errors inbox is not available. Log patterns Deprecated products and features are not available. New Relic's Incident Intelligence service operates solely in the US whether you store your data in New Relic’s US region data center or New Relic’s EU region data center, by using New Relic Incident Intelligence, you consent that New Relic may move and store your data in the US region. New Relic CodeStream operates solely in the US. Whether you have selected New Relic's US or EU region data center during setup of your New Relic account, when using New Relic CodeStream, you consent that your New Relic CodeStream data will get stored in the US. Regions and account hierarchy You can create accounts in each region. If your data is currently being hosted in the US region, you must create a new account to store data in the EU region. You cannot view EU data from a US account, or US data from an EU account. The data collected remains separate. The data cannot be aggregated or migrated between accounts. For organizations that have a parent/child account structure, you can only have one parent account. For more, see Manage apps or users with child accounts. For partnership accounts, no changes to the partnership owner account are required. However, data cannot be shared across regions, so a partnership requires a parent account for each region. Hierarchy example for partnership accounts With partnership accounts, a new parent account must be created for any data to be host in the EU region. This hierarchy illustrates how global accounts are structured with partnership owner accounts. Data is not aggregated beyond the parent account. Example hierarchy for partnership organizations. Because data cannot be shared across regions, a partnership will require a parent account for each region. Create an EU region account To create a New Relic account in the EU region: Go to the New Relic signup page. OR If you have a specific offer from a New Relic partner, follow that link directly. Follow the online steps to create your account. From the Select your region dropdown, select European Union. Agree to the Terms of Service. When you receive an email confirmation message, select the link to confirm your account and sign in to New Relic. Then install or update to the most recent agent version. API endpoints for EU region accounts If you have an EU region account, use the appropriate endpoints to access the following New Relic APIs: API EU endpoint Browser source maps API sourcemaps.service. eu .newrelic.com Copy Infrastructure Alert API infra-api. eu .newrelic.com Copy Dashboard API rpm. eu .newrelic.com/api/explore/dashboards/list Copy Insert API insights-collector. eu01 .nr-data.net Copy Insights Query API insights-api. eu .newrelic.com Copy Mobile apps rpm. eu .newrelic.com/mobile Copy NerdGraph GraphiQL API api. eu .newrelic.com/graphiql Copy Partner API The partner API is a global API with no regional data differences. Use this endpoint for both EU and US accounts: rpm.newrelic.com/api/v2/partners/ Copy REST API api. eu .newrelic.com Copy Synthetics API synthetics. eu .newrelic.com/synthetics/api Copy Trace API trace-api. eu .newrelic.com/trace/v1 Copy Metric API metric-api. eu .newrelic.com/metric/v1 Copy Log API log-api. eu .newrelic.com/log/v1 Copy Access New Relic One If your accounts report data to the EU data center, use the following link to go to New Relic One: one.eu.newrelic.com. Billing and pricing New Relic's account billing process and pricing options are the same for both the EU and US regions. Operational access and processing Customer Data is hosted in the region selected during account creation. Systems Operations Data is stored in the US region. All other information, including account information (such as license subscription information, billing, and internal monitoring) is hosted in the US region and replicated in the EU region. New Relic may access and process Customer Data in the United States and such other jurisdictions where New Relic has affiliates and subsidiaries, including as may be necessary to maintain, secure, or perform the services, to provide technical support, or as necessary to comply with law or a binding order of a government body. Customer Data from existing New Relic accounts cannot be transferred or shared across regions, and new data generated cannot be shared with existing accounts, even in partnership accounts. Verify your account is based in EU region Use either of these options to verify whether your account data is hosted in the EU region's data center: In APM, mouse over the application name to view the URL. If it begins with rpm.eu.newrelic.com/, it is an EU-based account. Check your New Relic license key. If it begins with EU, it is an EU-based account.",

Solution You should start seeing data within a few minutes after installing a New Relic agent and generating traffic for your app. If you don't see data, you can use the New Relic Diagnostics utility to automatically identify common issues. For additional troubleshooting tips, see the agent-specific docs.  APM agents Follow the troubleshooting procedures for your APM agent: C SDK Go Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby In addition, you can try these troubleshooting steps that apply to all APM agents: Deleted or renamed applications in APM An app needs to stop reporting data for at least an hour before you can reuse that name. It also needs to reconnect with the New Relic collector (be restarted) before new data will be accepted. The app remains in the collector's cache for an hour before it is flushed. During that time it is marked as \"deleted,\" so no new data is accepted. Also, the data is associated with an executing app that has been deleted until the agent is restarted. For more information, see: Name your application Use multiple names for an app No connection to collector Your app will not be affected if the New Relic agent cannot connect to the collector. Data continues to be collected, and it is uploaded as soon as the connection is restored. While the network is down or the collector unavailable, you may see gaps where data is missing in the APM CPU and memory charts. The agent will continue attempting to reconnect, and when it succeeds, you will again see data appearing in the UI. During the time the agent is unable to communicate with the collector, it is still collecting data. Once it is able to connect again, it will upload the data and fill in the missing segment so there will not be any confusion about whether your application was down or just not reporting data. To save memory, the data will be aggregated and averaged over the period, so you will see flat bars and charts over the period when it was unable to communicate with the collector.

      "body": "Problem For our APM, browser monitoring, and mobile monitoring features, there can be cases when an account or application is sending many individual metrics that could be better managed by grouping them together. We use the term metric grouping issue or MGI to describe this situation. When this occurs, the agent is sending unnecessarily large amounts of data to New Relic, which reduces the effectiveness of New Relic charts, tables, and reports. Metric grouping issues occur most commonly with web transactions, especially if the name is based on URLs. They can also happen with other metrics reported by your application. For example: If your application is crawling the Internet and each external call goes to a different domain If your software dynamically generates temporary database tables every time you receive a request If you are using custom instrumentation that includes UUIDs, article names, or similar unique components Any situation where a potentially infinite list of metrics can be created, rather than metrics being grouped effectively (as with controllers, permanent database tables, or specific external services) can become a metric grouping issue. Solution By understanding what metric grouping is and how issues can arise, you can better understand how New Relic works with your application to group metrics effectively and help prevent metric grouping issues from occurring. Here is a \"before\" and \"after\" example of how metric grouping can help organize transactions, to help you more easily identify patterns with performance problems. To help prevent metric grouping issues from occurring in your app: Check the New Relic release notes to verify you're running the most current version of the New Relic agent. If needed, upgrade your APM/mobile/browser agent to the most current version. Wait a few minutes, then look at new data in the New Relic UI. If the problem persists, follow the procedures for your agent: Agent Preventing MGIs All agents Review the information about what causes metric grouping issues. Browser Add URL groupings. C SDK Avoid using URLs to name your transactions. Instead, follow the procedures to instrument your app with the C SDK. Go Rename your Go transactions. Java See Java metric grouping issues. .NET Rename metrics with SetTransactionName. For more information about using XML to add details, see Name transactions. Node.js Rename transactions with Request API calls. PHP Rename your PHP transactions. Python Rename your Python transactions with set_transaction_name. Ruby Rename your Ruby transactions. Cause Metric grouping issues occur when the granularity of metric names (most often web transaction names) is too fine, resulting in hundreds or thousands of different web transaction names for just a small number of code paths. A few major code paths may generate many different full URL paths to unique documents, articles, or page, etc., and if the unique element of the URL path is included in the transaction name, each of these common paths will have its own unique name. MGI example In this example, you have an application that lets users write articles on any subject and post them for other users to see. Your application has three main functions: add an article, search for an article, and display an article. In order to improve search engine optimization (SEO), the \"view article\" code generates a unique URL to refer to each article. For example, the following URLs each refer to different articles in the example website: http://example.com/article/view/How_to_Install_New_Relic http://example.com/article/view/How_New_Relic_Saved_the_Day http://example.com/article/view/Where_do_I_get_New_Relic Copy All three articles are different; they contain different content and their URLs are different. However, the code path that generates each article is the same: they all use the \"view article\" function. Many web frameworks use this technique. They have a controller or route (in this case named article/view) as part of the URL. New Relic works to automatically identify these patterns and group similar routes together, to prevent metric grouping issues from occurring. Without mechanisms for detecting controllers, the example application would send metrics for each individual URL requested by visitors to your site. If you have a million articles and your site is popular, in each minute there could be several thousand unique URLs visited. This produces a significant amount of additional data to be sent to New Relic for each harvest cycle, and the APM Transactions page would attempt to list thousands of unique URLs, resulting in metric grouping issues. To monitor and improve your application performance, it's much more useful to know the average performance for a function (for example, viewing articles on your site) than how quickly each individual article is displayed. To prevent metric grouping issues, New Relic will normally show a single entry for that function (for example, /article/view/*) on the APM Transactions page. This grouping gives you a much better idea of how much time was spent viewing articles, and allows you to easily spot any performance problems related to viewing articles. If these statistics were spread across hundreds or thousands of transactions, detecting trends, regressions, or performance improvements would be extremely difficult. Each APM agent has distinct ways of detecting controllers and frameworks. Most are automatic, but a few require you to enable or disable options in a config file. You can also follow our recommendations to help prevent metric grouping issues from occurring.",

      "body": "Problem For our APM, browser monitoring, and mobile monitoring features, there can be cases when an account or application is sending many individual metrics that could be better managed by grouping them together. We use the term metric grouping issue or MGI to describe this situation. When this occurs, the agent is sending unnecessarily large amounts of data to New Relic, which reduces the effectiveness of New Relic charts, tables, and reports. Metric grouping issues occur most commonly with web transactions, especially if the name is based on URLs. They can also happen with other metrics reported by your application. For example: If your application is crawling the Internet and each external call goes to a different domain If your software dynamically generates temporary database tables every time you receive a request If you are using custom instrumentation that includes UUIDs, article names, or similar unique components Any situation where a potentially infinite list of metrics can be created, rather than metrics being grouped effectively (as with controllers, permanent database tables, or specific external services) can become a metric grouping issue. Solution By understanding what metric grouping is and how issues can arise, you can better understand how New Relic works with your application to group metrics effectively and help prevent metric grouping issues from occurring. Here is a \"before\" and \"after\" example of how metric grouping can help organize transactions, to help you more easily identify patterns with performance problems. To help prevent metric grouping issues from occurring in your app: Check the New Relic release notes to verify you're running the most current version of the New Relic agent. If needed, upgrade your APM/mobile/browser agent to the most current version. Wait a few minutes, then look at new data in the New Relic UI. If the problem persists, follow the procedures for your agent: Agent Preventing MGIs All agents Review the information about what causes metric grouping issues. Browser Add URL groupings. C SDK Avoid using URLs to name your transactions. Instead, follow the procedures to instrument your app with the C SDK. Go Rename your Go transactions. Java See Java metric grouping issues. .NET Rename metrics with SetTransactionName. For more information about using XML to add details, see Name transactions. Node.js Rename transactions with Request API calls. PHP Rename your PHP transactions. Python Rename your Python transactions with set_transaction_name. Ruby Rename your Ruby transactions. Cause Metric grouping issues occur when the granularity of metric names (most often web transaction names) is too fine, resulting in hundreds or thousands of different web transaction names for just a small number of code paths. A few major code paths may generate many different full URL paths to unique documents, articles, or page, etc., and if the unique element of the URL path is included in the transaction name, each of these common paths will have its own unique name. MGI example In this example, you have an application that lets users write articles on any subject and post them for other users to see. Your application has three main functions: add an article, search for an article, and display an article. In order to improve search engine optimization (SEO), the \"view article\" code generates a unique URL to refer to each article. For example, the following URLs each refer to different articles in the example website: http://example.com/article/view/How_to_Install_New_Relic http://example.com/article/view/How_New_Relic_Saved_the_Day http://example.com/article/view/Where_do_I_get_New_Relic Copy All three articles are different; they contain different content and their URLs are different. However, the code path that generates each article is the same: they all use the \"view article\" function. Many web frameworks use this technique. They have a controller or route (in this case named article/view) as part of the URL. New Relic works to automatically identify these patterns and group similar routes together, to prevent metric grouping issues from occurring. Without mechanisms for detecting controllers, the example application would send metrics for each individual URL requested by visitors to your site. If you have a million articles and your site is popular, in each minute there could be several thousand unique URLs visited. This produces a significant amount of additional data to be sent to New Relic for each harvest cycle, and the APM Transactions page would attempt to list thousands of unique URLs, resulting in metric grouping issues. To monitor and improve your application performance, it's much more useful to know the average performance for a function (for example, viewing articles on your site) than how quickly each individual article is displayed. To prevent metric grouping issues, New Relic will normally show a single entry for that function (for example, /article/view/*) on the APM Transactions page. This grouping gives you a much better idea of how much time was spent viewing articles, and allows you to easily spot any performance problems related to viewing articles. If these statistics were spread across hundreds or thousands of transactions, detecting trends, regressions, or performance improvements would be extremely difficult. Each APM agent has distinct ways of detecting controllers and frameworks. Most are automatic, but a few require you to enable or disable options in a config file. You can also follow our recommendations to help prevent metric grouping issues from occurring.",

Solution You should start seeing data within a few minutes after installing a New Relic agent and generating traffic for your app. If you don't see data, you can use the New Relic Diagnostics utility to automatically identify common issues. For additional troubleshooting tips, see the agent-specific docs.  APM agents Follow the troubleshooting procedures for your APM agent: C SDK Go Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby In addition, you can try these troubleshooting steps that apply to all APM agents: Deleted or renamed applications in APM An app needs to stop reporting data for at least an hour before you can reuse that name. It also needs to reconnect with the New Relic collector (be restarted) before new data will be accepted. The app remains in the collector's cache for an hour before it is flushed. During that time it is marked as \"deleted,\" so no new data is accepted. Also, the data is associated with an executing app that has been deleted until the agent is restarted. For more information, see: Name your application Use multiple names for an app No connection to collector Your app will not be affected if the New Relic agent cannot connect to the collector. Data continues to be collected, and it is uploaded as soon as the connection is restored. While the network is down or the collector unavailable, you may see gaps where data is missing in the APM CPU and memory charts. The agent will continue attempting to reconnect, and when it succeeds, you will again see data appearing in the UI. During the time the agent is unable to communicate with the collector, it is still collecting data. Once it is able to connect again, it will upload the data and fill in the missing segment so there will not be any confusion about whether your application was down or just not reporting data. To save memory, the data will be aggregated and averaged over the period, so you will see flat bars and charts over the period when it was unable to communicate with the collector.

      "body": "Problem For our APM, browser monitoring, and mobile monitoring features, there can be cases when an account or application is sending many individual metrics that could be better managed by grouping them together. We use the term metric grouping issue or MGI to describe this situation. When this occurs, the agent is sending unnecessarily large amounts of data to New Relic, which reduces the effectiveness of New Relic charts, tables, and reports. Metric grouping issues occur most commonly with web transactions, especially if the name is based on URLs. They can also happen with other metrics reported by your application. For example: If your application is crawling the Internet and each external call goes to a different domain If your software dynamically generates temporary database tables every time you receive a request If you are using custom instrumentation that includes UUIDs, article names, or similar unique components Any situation where a potentially infinite list of metrics can be created, rather than metrics being grouped effectively (as with controllers, permanent database tables, or specific external services) can become a metric grouping issue. Solution By understanding what metric grouping is and how issues can arise, you can better understand how New Relic works with your application to group metrics effectively and help prevent metric grouping issues from occurring. Here is a \"before\" and \"after\" example of how metric grouping can help organize transactions, to help you more easily identify patterns with performance problems. To help prevent metric grouping issues from occurring in your app: Check the New Relic release notes to verify you're running the most current version of the New Relic agent. If needed, upgrade your APM/mobile/browser agent to the most current version. Wait a few minutes, then look at new data in the New Relic UI. If the problem persists, follow the procedures for your agent: Agent Preventing MGIs All agents Review the information about what causes metric grouping issues. Browser Add URL groupings. C SDK Avoid using URLs to name your transactions. Instead, follow the procedures to instrument your app with the C SDK. Go Rename your Go transactions. Java See Java metric grouping issues. .NET Rename metrics with SetTransactionName. For more information about using XML to add details, see Name transactions. Node.js Rename transactions with Request API calls. PHP Rename your PHP transactions. Python Rename your Python transactions with set_transaction_name. Ruby Rename your Ruby transactions. Cause Metric grouping issues occur when the granularity of metric names (most often web transaction names) is too fine, resulting in hundreds or thousands of different web transaction names for just a small number of code paths. A few major code paths may generate many different full URL paths to unique documents, articles, or page, etc., and if the unique element of the URL path is included in the transaction name, each of these common paths will have its own unique name. MGI example In this example, you have an application that lets users write articles on any subject and post them for other users to see. Your application has three main functions: add an article, search for an article, and display an article. In order to improve search engine optimization (SEO), the \"view article\" code generates a unique URL to refer to each article. For example, the following URLs each refer to different articles in the example website: http://example.com/article/view/How_to_Install_New_Relic http://example.com/article/view/How_New_Relic_Saved_the_Day http://example.com/article/view/Where_do_I_get_New_Relic Copy All three articles are different; they contain different content and their URLs are different. However, the code path that generates each article is the same: they all use the \"view article\" function. Many web frameworks use this technique. They have a controller or route (in this case named article/view) as part of the URL. New Relic works to automatically identify these patterns and group similar routes together, to prevent metric grouping issues from occurring. Without mechanisms for detecting controllers, the example application would send metrics for each individual URL requested by visitors to your site. If you have a million articles and your site is popular, in each minute there could be several thousand unique URLs visited. This produces a significant amount of additional data to be sent to New Relic for each harvest cycle, and the APM Transactions page would attempt to list thousands of unique URLs, resulting in metric grouping issues. To monitor and improve your application performance, it's much more useful to know the average performance for a function (for example, viewing articles on your site) than how quickly each individual article is displayed. To prevent metric grouping issues, New Relic will normally show a single entry for that function (for example, /article/view/*) on the APM Transactions page. This grouping gives you a much better idea of how much time was spent viewing articles, and allows you to easily spot any performance problems related to viewing articles. If these statistics were spread across hundreds or thousands of transactions, detecting trends, regressions, or performance improvements would be extremely difficult. Each APM agent has distinct ways of detecting controllers and frameworks. Most are automatic, but a few require you to enable or disable options in a config file. You can also follow our recommendations to help prevent metric grouping issues from occurring.",

In New Relic One dashboards, for NRQL queries containing a FACET clause and meeting other chart-type requirements, you can set up the faceted attributes to filter the current dashboard or a related, linked dashboard. By letting you quickly filter your dashboards, and link to pre-filtered dashboards, your dashboards are more interactive and easy to use. This feature is available when adding a new chart to a dashboard or when editing a chart on an existing dashboard. To see this feature in action, see the example use case. Requirements Requirements to use this feature: Must be in New Relic One dashboards. Will not work on a standalone chart in the query builder. NRQL query must contain a FACET clause. Available only for bar charts, heat maps, pie charts, and tables. Example use of facet filtering Let's say you create the following facet-containing NRQL query for an existing dashboard in New Relic One: one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: For queries containing a FACET clause and meeting chart-type requirements, you can set those attributes to be used as an easy dashboard filter. You can set the attribute to filter the current dashboard you're on, or filter a related dashboard that you select. If you select Filter the current dashboard, that chart will be used to filter the current dashboard by the available userAgentName attributes. Here's a view of selecting one of those attributes to filter that dashboard. Notice that the chosen attribute appears as a filter in the search bar at the top. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: When you select an attribute you've set up for facet filtering, it filters the current dashboard. For more about this feature, see the Explorers Hub post on facet filtering. Facet linking with the FACET CASES clause FACET CASES is a NRQL function that allows to group facets based on conditions. We support multiple cases in the same facet. Let's say you want to query some data and put the responses into mnemonic categories for a dashboard or report. This syntax will allow you to query based on transaction duration and put the results into two categories: ACCEPTABLE and UNACCEPTABLE. This can be really useful for making dashboards more human readable and actionable. SELECT filter(count(*), WHERE duration > 1) as 'UNACCEPTABLE', filter(count(*), WHERE duration <=1) as 'ACCEPTABLE' FROM Transaction FACET appName LIMIT 5 since 5 minutes ago Copy By using FACET CASES, we can more efficiently use multiple complex conditions to generate a set of custom facets. Building on the previous example, let's say we want to include a compound condition which excludes errors from our duration data and adds them into a third category: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (where duration > 1 and error is NULL as 'UNACCEPTABLE', where duration <= 1 and error is NULL as 'ACCEPTABLE', where error is not NULL as 'ERROR') since 5 minutes ago Copy Then, using facet linking, you can filter your dashboards by those facets.",

Global Performance data sets data are useful for: Existing New Relic customers who want to gain general monitoring and troubleshooting insights from a curated collection of aggregated, real-world data. Newcomers who want to get a feel for New Relic’s dashboards and data tools and view real data visualizations in order to make informed decisions about how to add their own data to New Relic. This resource provides information about the Global Performance data sets, how they work, what they do, and current options for accessing Global Performance data. Public API Performance dashboard Important Please note: Global Performance data sets are presented as-is. Global Performance data sets represent an aggregate of samples across a range of sources, and New Relic makes no effort to attempt to confirm the correctness, completeness, or veracity of the data. This data should not be relied on as the sole source of information for any purpose you may use it, and New Relic is not responsible for decisions made in reliance on this data. Global Performance data sets should not be viewed as either an endorsement or a recommendation by New Relic of the technologies represented in the data sets. Access valuable data and try out New Relic Our first Global Performance data set, Public API Performance, offers a large body of real-world, real-time data about the performance of public APIs including AWS, Google, and more as experienced by New Relic customers (as authorized). Because this data is already flowing through New Relic, you can access it within seconds of activating your account, and test drive New Relic dashboarding and querying capabilities in the process. There’s no need to connect your own data sources to New Relic first, although we recommend you do so because adding your own data is easy, free, and the best way to understand how New Relic can serve your business needs. Get started with the Public API Performance dashboard To help you get started using Public API Performance data, we've created a Public API Performance dashboard. This dashboard provides both actionable general insights and analytics and also an example of how you might apply dashboarding capabilities to your own data. Both new and existing customers should be able to view Global Performance data in the Public API Performance dashboard quickly and easliy. To start using this dashboard, see Explore the Public API Performance dashboard.",

      "body": "Access any of your New Relic One dashboards to create or manage your charts directly from the chart menu, customize your dashboard's layout, adjust display modes, or export your data. Once you have customized your dashboard and built your charts, use our advanced visualization features and tools for data exploration to correlate and analyze your data. Customize your dashboard Dashboards are highly flexible: you can tailor your dashboard layout and arrange chart sizes to optimize how you see your data. Tip Click the icon to access the See metadata and manage tags modal. There you can see the dashboard's GUID, account ID, and App ID, and manage all the tags that have been added to the dashboard. Dashboards features include: Edit your dashboard Use the edit button to: Copy the dashboard's permalink. Rename your dashboard. Names are searchable, so we recommend giving it a meaningful name. Create new content by clicking the Add widget button. Add a new chart using the query builder, or add text, images, or links using our markdown editor. Resize and rearrange charts. You can move any chart and put it anywhere in the dashboard so the layout you set fits your preferences: place your more relevant charts on top, or drop less used charts in a corner. You can set up to 12 columns of charts. Settings menu Use the settings menu on the upper right corner: To change the name of the dashboard. Names are searchable, so we recommend giving it a meaningful name that will help you locate your dashboard easily. To modify the dashboard's permissions. At the settings menu you can also see when the dashboard was created and the account it belongs to. These values cannot be modified. TV mode You can enable a full-screen TV mode that optimizes the dashboard for display on a television screen. There are two ways to turn on TV mode: When viewing a dashboard in New Relic One, select the icon at the top right. Add this parameter to a dashboard page URL: &platform[tvMode]=true To configure TV mode, from a dashboard, select the icon. Options include: Dashboard name display. Turning off the dashboard name gives the dashboard charts more space on the screen. Page cycle. For dashboards with multiple pages, this automatically cycles from page to page. Dark mode High-contrast mode is available in dashboards. Select the icon from the upper right menu bar. Copy your dashboard as JSON You can copy your dashboard as JSON and add it to the clipboard by clicking on the < / > icon on the right corner. Export your dashboard You can export your dashboard as a pdf file clicking the icon. Duplicate your dashboard You can duplicate your dashboard clicking the duplicate icon regardless of your permission levels. The dashboard is automatically copied and the duplicate is added to the index. The duplicate has Public - Read and write permissions. Access the new, duplicated dashboard by clicking on the message that pops up on your screen. The duplicated dashboard is named like the original dashboard followed by the word “copy”. For example, if you duplicate a dashboard named This is my dashboard, the duplicate is called This is my dashboard copy. You can change the name when you duplicate it. You can edit the name and other properties of the dashboard, such as permissions, any time. Tip You can use the search feature at any time to search data across New Relic One. Add new content to your dashboard There are multiple ways to add new content to your dashboard: From the data explorer and query builder features. Use the + Add to your dashboard button (accessible from the main dashboard page or in the edit mode) to access the query builder, or to add content (such as text, links, or images) using our Markdown editor. Copy an existing chart from any dashboard. If you experience issues adding new content, check our error messages. Add custom content using the markdown editor The Markdown editor contains a Markdown pane, where you enter your content, as well as a Preview pane, where you can view it. For more information about Markdown syntax options, see the Commonmark website. You can also edit existing content by clicking the ellipses icon on any markdown widget and selecting Edit. Organize your dashboards with pages You can use multiple pages to organize your dashboard data in different views. When you add more pages to that dashboard, you can access these pages using the tabs at the top of the dashboard UI. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: This is an example of a dashboard in New Relic One with multiple pages, represented by the tabs at the top of the dashboard. You can add pages to dashboards, copy existing pages, and drag and drop the page tabs to new positions. You can use this feature to group together related dashboard views. This is valuable when you're aggregating a lot of data and charts related to a specific project, team, or subject. For example, a mobile app team might build a dashboard focused on app performance by country. The first dashboard page might be an overview of performance across all countries, with other pages focused on specific countries. We offer other features to connect dashboards: Create widgets containing markdown text to add direct links to specific UI pages or dashboards. Use facet filtering to create links that automatically link to and filter other dashboards. Use the dashboard search to find similarly named dashboards. To take advantage of this, you can add team- or project-specific words/phrases to dashboard names. In New Relic Insights, this feature was called data apps. For more about switching from Insights to New Relic One, see our transition guide. Add and edit pages to a dashboard To add or edit a page in a dashboard: From a new or existing dashboard, enter edit mode by selecting the icon. Add a new page: Select Add a page to add a blank page. Clone an existing page by clicking the dropdown next to a dashboard name, and selecting Duplicate. While in edit mode, you can add widgets to the new page, drag and drop page tabs to new locations, and do other dashboard editing tasks. When finished, select Done editing. Manage your charts and markdown content From any markdown element, access the menu on the upper right corner to edit or delete it. From any chart, access the chart action menu on the upper right corner to: Expand your chart to full screen. Share your chart as an image or with a link. Copy the chart to any dashboard. For table charts only, export as a .csv file. You can import this file into other apps like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets to do further analysis. Create an alert condition. Open the NRQL console to see or edit the query associated to the chart. Duplicate the chart. Delete the chart. Important You cannot edit the query of a chart if you have Read only permissions to the dashboard. Learn more about how to use your charts. Filter and refine your charts You can narrow down the information on display using the filtering function, which is a visual representation of query conditions: Use the filter bar to select the values or attributes you want to see, and remove the rest of the elements from the charts. Open the advanced filter bar to access the boolean operators (such as =, !=, CONTAINS, EXCLUDES, etc.) and add compound and complex conditions for filtering data. After applying the filter, your dashboard will only show the data associated to the elements you selected. A small counter indicates how many filters are being applied at a time. To return to the default view, click on the small cross by the filter to remove it. Filter using the chart legend Click on a legend in any chart with legends to see that series only and remove the rest of them from the chart. This helps you isolate the data you want to analyze. Use CMD (in a Mac) or CTRL (in Windows) for the opposite behavior: removing the selected series and keeping the rest. Filter dashboards using facets If a chart's NRQL query contains a FACET clause, you can use the faceted attributes to filter the current dashboard or another related dashboard. For details, see Filter by facets. Use the time picker to adjust time settings By default, each chart in the dashboard will show data for the time period specified when they were created in the query builder. However, you can use the time picker to change the time range of the data on display and set the same range for all charts. This is particularly useful while troubleshooting incidents, if you need to narrow down your data to observe what happened in a specific time period. The refresh rate depends on the duration of the time window you are viewing. For more information and examples, see Chart refresh intervals. To change the time range: Select one of the available options from the dropdown menu (ranging from Last 30 minutes to Last 7 days). Customize the time range with specific start and end timestamps using the custom menu. Important In dashboards, unlike Insights, the time zone is independent from your laptop's time. You can set the time zone you want to use in your user preferences, easily accessible from the custom menu in the time picker. Export and share your data It is very easy to export dashboard and chart data and share it within your company and beyond: You can export any dashboard as a PDF file, using the Export dashboard as PDF button located in the upper right menu bar. You can also share your charts either as a PNG image or as a link. Go to the chart menu and select either the Get as image or Get chart link options.",

      "body": "The Insights Dashboard API is deprecated, but you can use NerdGraph (our GraphQL API) to create and configure dashboards. If you're not migrating from the old Insights API, you can skip this doc and go to the new Dashboards API. Why a new dashboards API? Our Insights product, which was a way to query data and create charts and dashboards, has been deprecated and its set of features moved over to be a core part of the New Relic One platform. To learn more about this transition and new features, see the Insights to New Relic One migration guide. The Insights Dashboard API will be deprecated in July of 2021. Until then, if you're using the Insights Dashboard API, you should attempt to switch over to using NerdGraph. (The Insights query API will not be deprecated but NerdGraph is preferred.) Keep reading to learn how to get started with NerdGraph and learn about equivalent operations. Get started with NerdGraph NerdGraph is the preferred API for making NRQL queries of your New Relic data. Every user who uses NerdGraph needs their own user key. When using NerdGraph, it helps to understand that our dashboards are entities that report data from other entities, such as monitored apps, hosts and services. If you're new to NerdGraph and GraphQL, you may want to first read our Introduction to NerdGraph and some of Create dashboards with NerdGraph. The NerdGraph API explorer is located at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Operations mapping table The table below maps every Insights API operation to the new dashboards API. Insights API operation NerdGraph API query/mutation Notes List (GET) entitySearch() View a paginated list of dashboards that match the filter.

By using the NerdGraph API explorer, you can discover GraphQL types and fields, along with a brief explanation. We want to facilitate your migration from the Insights API to the new New Relic One dashboards API. Find below some examples that illustrate how the old REST endpoints map to the new GraphQL queries or mutations. List (GET) -> entitySearch query Dashboards in New Relic One embrace the concept of entity. They are now another entity in New Relic’s entity ecosystem. Try it out using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. List all dashboard entities you have access to { actor { entitySearch(queryBuilder: {type: DASHBOARD}) { results { entities { ... on DashboardEntityOutline { guid name accountId } } } } } } Copy List all dashboards by name { actor { entitySearch(queryBuilder: {name: \"My dashboard\"}) { results { entities { ... on DashboardEntityOutline { guid name accountId } } } } } } Copy List all dashboards by creator’s email { actor { entitySearch(queryBuilder: {type: DASHBOARD, tags: {key: \"createdBy\", value: \"email@domain.com\"}}) { results { entities { ... on DashboardEntityOutline { guid name accountId } } } } } } Copy List all dashboards by creator’s user id { actor { entitySearch(query: \"type ='DASHBOARD' and ownerId = '2357322'\") { results { entities { ... on DashboardEntityOutline { guid name accountId } } } } } } Copy Show (GET) -> entity query In order to get information on a dashboard, all you need is to provide its unique entity identifier or entity guid. Then you can access all the dashboard properties that you are interested in by adding them in the GraphQL query. Try it out using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Get dashboard info given its entity guid { actor { entity(guid: \"MY_DASHBOARD_GUID\") { ... on DashboardEntity { guid accountId name createdAt updatedAt permissions description owner { email userId } pages { guid name createdAt updatedAt description owner { email userId } widgets { id visualization { id } title layout { row column height width } rawConfiguration linkedEntities { guid } } } } } } } Copy Create (POST) -> dashboardCreate mutation Operations that mutate the state of the system are mutations in GraphQL APIs. You can create a dashboard by providing the required input for the dashboardCreate mutation. Although GraphQL APIs aim to be self-explanatory, Nerdgraph docs can help you with some information about the fields, like the doc about how to build dashboard widgets. Try it out using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Create dashboard with two pages and two widgets per page mutation { dashboardCreate(accountId: 1, dashboard: { name: \"My awesome dashboard\", permissions: PUBLIC_READ_WRITE, pages: [{ name: \"My first page\", widgets: [{ visualization: { id: \"viz.markdown\" }, title: \"My markdown widget\", layout: { row: 1, column: 1, width: 4, height: 3 }, rawConfiguration: { text: \"#My markdown\" } }, { visualization: { id: \"viz.line\" }, title: \"My line widget\", layout: { row: 1, column: 5, width: 4, height: 3 }, rawConfiguration: { nrqlQueries: [{ accountId: 1, query: \"SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET appName TIMESERIES\" }] } }] }, { name: \"My second page\", widgets: [{ visualization: { id: \"viz.billboard\" }, title: \"My billboard widget with thresholds\", layout: { row: 1, column: 1, width: 4, height: 3 }, rawConfiguration: { nrqlQueries: [{ accountId: 1, query: \"SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction\" }], thresholds: [{ alertSeverity: WARNING, value: 650 }, { alertSeverity: CRITICAL, value: 1500 }] } }, { visualization: { id: \"viz.table\" }, title: \"My table widget\", layout: { row: 1, column: 5, width: 4, height: 3 }, rawConfiguration: { nrqlQueries: [{ query: \"SELECT * FROM Transaction\", accountId: 1 }] } }] }] }) { errors { description type } entityResult { guid accountId name createdAt updatedAt permissions description owner { email userId } pages { guid name createdAt updatedAt description owner { email userId } widgets { id visualization { id } title layout { row column height width } rawConfiguration linkedEntities { guid } } } } } } Copy Update (PUT) -> dashboardUpdate mutation The dashboardUpdate mutation allows you to update an existing dashboard by providing the existing dashboard guid and the new configuration. Similarly to creating a dashboard, the mutation tries to be self-explanatory, but you can look up the doc about how to build dashboard widgets. Try it out using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Update previously created dashboard to 1 page and 1 widget per page mutation { dashboardUpdate(guid: \"MY_DASHBOARD_GUID\" dashboard: { name: \"My awesome dashboard\", permissions: PUBLIC_READ_WRITE, pages: [{ name: \"My first page\", widgets: [{ visualization: { id: \"viz.line\" }, title: \"My line widget\", layout: { row: 1, column: 1, width: 4, height: 3 }, rawConfiguration: { nrqlQueries: [{ accountId: 1, query: \"SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET appName TIMESERIES\" }] } }] }, { name: \"My second page\", widgets: [{ visualization: { id: \"viz.table\" }, title: \"My table widget\", layout: { row: 1, column: 1, width: 4, height: 3 }, rawConfiguration: { nrqlQueries: [{ query: \"SELECT * FROM Transaction\", accountId: 1 }] } }] }] }) { errors { description type } entityResult { guid accountId name createdAt updatedAt permissions description owner { email userId } pages { guid name createdAt updatedAt description owner { email userId } widgets { id visualization { id } title layout { row column height width } rawConfiguration linkedEntities { guid } } } } } } Copy Delete (DELETE) -> dashboardDelete mutation The dashboardDelete mutation allows you to delete an existing dashboard by providing its entity guid. Try it out using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Delete previously created dashboard mutation { dashboardDelete(guid:\"MY_DASHBOARD_GUID\") { status errors { type description } } } Copy",

      "body": "Do not use the Insights Dashboards API. Instead, use the New Relic One Dashboards API with NerdGraph, our GraphQL API. End of life notice The Insights Dashboard API reaches end of life in 2021. As of July 28, 2021, the CREATE and UPDATE endpoints are not available. As of August 30, 2021, the GET and DELETE endpoints are not available. To make the transition from the Insights Dashboard API to the New Relic One Dashboards API, see our migration guide. For more information, see the NerdGraph dashboards tutorial and Explorers Hub post. Requirements If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you're using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. Overview The Insights Dashboard API allows you to list, create, read, update, and delete new or existing dashboards. New Relic's API Explorer includes the cURL request format, available parameters, response status codes, and JSON response structure for available API calls. Example use cases The Insights Dashboard API is a flexible solution for many different use cases. Here are a few examples of how you can leverage the Dashboard API to solve problems: Automatically create dashboards for new teams or services pre-populated with standard organization metrics and charts. Use the API to view dashboard schemas, and save them in a central repository for source control and backups. Create widget and dashboard templates to allow teams to self-service. Account and data security The Dashboard API includes safeguards to help ensure account and data security. Requirements Comments User key and permissions Required: This API requires a user key. You cannot use your account-level REST API key to manage dashboards. Cross-account widgets You can view cross-account widgets on a dashboard by using the Insights or New Relic One dashboards UI. However, the ability to view cross-account widgets when using the Dashboard API has these restrictions: To view the list of widgets on a specific dashboard with the Dashboard API, you must use the SHOW endpoint. To view a widget in the API payload, the widget's account ID must be the same as the account ID for the payload. If the account ID is not the same, the widget's details will not be listed. Instead, the widget's payload will show: \"visualization\": \"inaccessible\" Copy Use the API Explorer To view the Dashboard API options in the API Explorer: Log in to your New Relic account. Go to rpm.newrelic.com/api/explore. From the API Explorer's Select an account and key dropdown, select a user key. Select Dashboards, then select the API function. To use API functions with existing dashboards, include the dashboard id. To find the dashboard id, select the LIST endpoint, and apply filtering options. View Dashboard API video Follow along with this step-by-step tutorial to learn how to find your API keys, create new dashboards, view and update existing dashboards via the REST API. For a step-by-step guide to using the New Relic API Explorer to manage Insights dashboards, watch this video (approximately 6 minutes). Or, go directly to the full online course about New Relic APIs. Use API endpoints The API supports the following functions for Insights dashboards only. The API does not support these functions for data apps (collections of linked dashboards). API endpoints Comments CREATE POST /v2/dashboards Create a new dashboard. The API permits a maximum of 300 widgets when creating or updating a dashboard. Attempting to POST more than 300 widgets will produce an error. To add more widgets to the dashboard, use the Insights UI. UPDATE PUT /v2/dashboards/:id: Update an existing dashboard for the dashboard id. The API permits a maximum of 300 widgets when creating or updating a dashboard. Attempting to PUT more than 300 widgets will produce an error. To add more or edit existing widgets on the dashboard, use the Insights UI. SHOW GET /v2/dashboards/:id: View an existing dashboard and all accessible widgets for the dashboard id. To help ensure data security, the SHOW function returns only the dashboard widgets that the user has permission to view. If a dashboard includes widgets that the user is not authorized to view, the API will provide a placeholder with the visualization field set to inaccessible. LIST GET /v2/dashboards?page=:page:&per_page=:count: View a paginated list of dashboards. The list shows filterable dashboard metadata only; no widgets will appear in the list. Search options include: filter[title] as substring search filter[category] (all / favorites / mine} filter[created_after] as ISO date filter[created_before] as ISO date filter[updated_after] as ISO date filter[updated_before] as ISO date Sort options include: name recently_viewed last_edited If no sort option is provided, results will be ordered by id. Pagination options include the page and per_page fields. The per_page field controls the number of results per page with a default and maximum of 100 results. The response will include a pagination Link header, which provides next page and last page links. DELETE DELETE /v2/dashboards/:id: Delete an existing dashboard indicated by the dashboard id. Dashboard API schema JSON is the only supported format. When using API functions, be sure to add .json to the end of the request URL, as shown in the API Explorer. Important Widgets have a size limit of 3x3 (height and width may not exceed 3). Caution The Dashboard API 3-column restriction also applies to the dashboards you upload to New Relic One dashboards. If you update a dashboard with a different layout using the API, the uploaded dashboard will revert to the 3-column configuration.

      "body": "You can filter your New Relic One dashboards by faceted attributes, making your dashboards more interactive and easy to use. Why use facet filtering? In New Relic One dashboards, for NRQL queries containing a FACET clause and meeting other chart-type requirements, you can set up the faceted attributes to filter the current dashboard or a related, linked dashboard. By letting you quickly filter your dashboards, and link to pre-filtered dashboards, your dashboards are more interactive and easy to use. This feature is available when adding a new chart to a dashboard or when editing a chart on an existing dashboard. To see this feature in action, see the example use case. Requirements Requirements to use this feature: Must be in New Relic One dashboards. Will not work on a standalone chart in the query builder. NRQL query must contain a FACET clause. Available only for bar charts, heat maps, pie charts, and tables. Example use of facet filtering Let's say you create the following facet-containing NRQL query for an existing dashboard in New Relic One: one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: For queries containing a FACET clause and meeting chart-type requirements, you can set those attributes to be used as an easy dashboard filter. You can set the attribute to filter the current dashboard you're on, or filter a related dashboard that you select. If you select Filter the current dashboard, that chart will be used to filter the current dashboard by the available userAgentName attributes. Here's a view of selecting one of those attributes to filter that dashboard. Notice that the chosen attribute appears as a filter in the search bar at the top. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: When you select an attribute you've set up for facet filtering, it filters the current dashboard. For more about this feature, see the Explorers Hub post on facet filtering. Facet linking with the FACET CASES clause FACET CASES is a NRQL function that allows to group facets based on conditions. We support multiple cases in the same facet. Let's say you want to query some data and put the responses into mnemonic categories for a dashboard or report. This syntax will allow you to query based on transaction duration and put the results into two categories: ACCEPTABLE and UNACCEPTABLE. This can be really useful for making dashboards more human readable and actionable. SELECT filter(count(*), WHERE duration > 1) as 'UNACCEPTABLE', filter(count(*), WHERE duration <=1) as 'ACCEPTABLE' FROM Transaction FACET appName LIMIT 5 since 5 minutes ago Copy By using FACET CASES, we can more efficiently use multiple complex conditions to generate a set of custom facets. Building on the previous example, let's say we want to include a compound condition which excludes errors from our duration data and adds them into a third category: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (where duration > 1 and error is NULL as 'UNACCEPTABLE', where duration <= 1 and error is NULL as 'ACCEPTABLE', where error is not NULL as 'ERROR') since 5 minutes ago Copy Then, using facet linking, you can filter your dashboards by those facets.",

Once you have customized your dashboard and built your charts, use our advanced visualization features and tools for data exploration to correlate and analyze your data. Customize your dashboard Dashboards are highly flexible: you can tailor your dashboard layout and arrange chart sizes to optimize how you see your data. Tip Click the icon to access the See metadata and manage tags modal. There you can see the dashboard's GUID, account ID, and App ID, and manage all the tags that have been added to the dashboard. Dashboards features include: Edit your dashboard Use the edit button to: Copy the dashboard's permalink. Rename your dashboard. Names are searchable, so we recommend giving it a meaningful name. Create new content by clicking the Add widget button. Add a new chart using the query builder, or add text, images, or links using our markdown editor. Resize and rearrange charts. You can move any chart and put it anywhere in the dashboard so the layout you set fits your preferences: place your more relevant charts on top, or drop less used charts in a corner. You can set up to 12 columns of charts. Settings menu Use the settings menu on the upper right corner: To change the name of the dashboard. Names are searchable, so we recommend giving it a meaningful name that will help you locate your dashboard easily. To modify the dashboard's permissions. At the settings menu you can also see when the dashboard was created and the account it belongs to. These values cannot be modified. TV mode You can enable a full-screen TV mode that optimizes the dashboard for display on a television screen. There are two ways to turn on TV mode: When viewing a dashboard in New Relic One, select the icon at the top right. Add this parameter to a dashboard page URL: &platform[tvMode]=true To configure TV mode, from a dashboard, select the icon. Options include: Dashboard name display. Turning off the dashboard name gives the dashboard charts more space on the screen. Page cycle. For dashboards with multiple pages, this automatically cycles from page to page. Dark mode High-contrast mode is available in dashboards. Select the icon from the upper right menu bar. Copy your dashboard as JSON You can copy your dashboard as JSON and add it to the clipboard by clicking on the < / > icon on the right corner. Export your dashboard You can export your dashboard as a pdf file clicking the icon. Duplicate your dashboard You can duplicate your dashboard clicking the duplicate icon regardless of your permission levels. The dashboard is automatically copied and the duplicate is added to the index. The duplicate has Public - Read and write permissions. Access the new, duplicated dashboard by clicking on the message that pops up on your screen. The duplicated dashboard is named like the original dashboard followed by the word “copy”. For example, if you duplicate a dashboard named This is my dashboard, the duplicate is called This is my dashboard copy. You can change the name when you duplicate it. You can edit the name and other properties of the dashboard, such as permissions, any time. Tip You can use the search feature at any time to search data across New Relic One. Add new content to your dashboard There are multiple ways to add new content to your dashboard: From the data explorer and query builder features. Use the + Add to your dashboard button (accessible from the main dashboard page or in the edit mode) to access the query builder, or to add content (such as text, links, or images) using our Markdown editor. Copy an existing chart from any dashboard. If you experience issues adding new content, check our error messages. Add custom content using the markdown editor The Markdown editor contains a Markdown pane, where you enter your content, as well as a Preview pane, where you can view it. For more information about Markdown syntax options, see the Commonmark website. You can also edit existing content by clicking the ellipses icon on any markdown widget and selecting Edit. Organize your dashboards with pages You can use multiple pages to organize your dashboard data in different views. When you add more pages to that dashboard, you can access these pages using the tabs at the top of the dashboard UI. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: This is an example of a dashboard in New Relic One with multiple pages, represented by the tabs at the top of the dashboard. You can add pages to dashboards, copy existing pages, and drag and drop the page tabs to new positions. You can use this feature to group together related dashboard views. This is valuable when you're aggregating a lot of data and charts related to a specific project, team, or subject. For example, a mobile app team might build a dashboard focused on app performance by country. The first dashboard page might be an overview of performance across all countries, with other pages focused on specific countries. We offer other features to connect dashboards: Create widgets containing markdown text to add direct links to specific UI pages or dashboards. Use facet filtering to create links that automatically link to and filter other dashboards. Use the dashboard search to find similarly named dashboards. To take advantage of this, you can add team- or project-specific words/phrases to dashboard names. In New Relic Insights, this feature was called data apps. For more about switching from Insights to New Relic One, see our transition guide. Add and edit pages to a dashboard To add or edit a page in a dashboard: From a new or existing dashboard, enter edit mode by selecting the icon. Add a new page: Select Add a page to add a blank page. Clone an existing page by clicking the dropdown next to a dashboard name, and selecting Duplicate. While in edit mode, you can add widgets to the new page, drag and drop page tabs to new locations, and do other dashboard editing tasks. When finished, select Done editing. Manage your charts and markdown content From any markdown element, access the menu on the upper right corner to edit or delete it. From any chart, access the chart action menu on the upper right corner to: Expand your chart to full screen. Share your chart as an image or with a link. Copy the chart to any dashboard. For table charts only, export as a .csv file. You can import this file into other apps like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets to do further analysis. Create an alert condition. Open the NRQL console to see or edit the query associated to the chart. Duplicate the chart. Delete the chart. Important You cannot edit the query of a chart if you have Read only permissions to the dashboard. Learn more about how to use your charts. Filter and refine your charts You can narrow down the information on display using the filtering function, which is a visual representation of query conditions: Use the filter bar to select the values or attributes you want to see, and remove the rest of the elements from the charts. Open the advanced filter bar to access the boolean operators (such as =, !=, CONTAINS, EXCLUDES, etc.) and add compound and complex conditions for filtering data. After applying the filter, your dashboard will only show the data associated to the elements you selected. A small counter indicates how many filters are being applied at a time. To return to the default view, click on the small cross by the filter to remove it. Filter using the chart legend Click on a legend in any chart with legends to see that series only and remove the rest of them from the chart. This helps you isolate the data you want to analyze. Use CMD (in a Mac) or CTRL (in Windows) for the opposite behavior: removing the selected series and keeping the rest. Filter dashboards using facets If a chart's NRQL query contains a FACET clause, you can use the faceted attributes to filter the current dashboard or another related dashboard. For details, see Filter by facets. Use the time picker to adjust time settings By default, each chart in the dashboard will show data for the time period specified when they were created in the query builder. However, you can use the time picker to change the time range of the data on display and set the same range for all charts. This is particularly useful while troubleshooting incidents, if you need to narrow down your data to observe what happened in a specific time period. The refresh rate depends on the duration of the time window you are viewing. For more information and examples, see Chart refresh intervals. To change the time range: Select one of the available options from the dropdown menu (ranging from Last 30 minutes to Last 7 days). Customize the time range with specific start and end timestamps using the custom menu. Important In dashboards, unlike Insights, the time zone is independent from your laptop's time. You can set the time zone you want to use in your user preferences, easily accessible from the custom menu in the time picker. Export and share your data It is very easy to export dashboard and chart data and share it within your company and beyond: You can export any dashboard as a PDF file, using the Export dashboard as PDF button located in the upper right menu bar. You can also share your charts either as a PNG image or as a link. Go to the chart menu and select either the Get as image or Get chart link options.",

      "body": "You can filter your New Relic One dashboards by faceted attributes, making your dashboards more interactive and easy to use. Why use facet filtering? In New Relic One dashboards, for NRQL queries containing a FACET clause and meeting other chart-type requirements, you can set up the faceted attributes to filter the current dashboard or a related, linked dashboard. By letting you quickly filter your dashboards, and link to pre-filtered dashboards, your dashboards are more interactive and easy to use. This feature is available when adding a new chart to a dashboard or when editing a chart on an existing dashboard. To see this feature in action, see the example use case. Requirements Requirements to use this feature: Must be in New Relic One dashboards. Will not work on a standalone chart in the query builder. NRQL query must contain a FACET clause. Available only for bar charts, heat maps, pie charts, and tables. Example use of facet filtering Let's say you create the following facet-containing NRQL query for an existing dashboard in New Relic One: one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: For queries containing a FACET clause and meeting chart-type requirements, you can set those attributes to be used as an easy dashboard filter. You can set the attribute to filter the current dashboard you're on, or filter a related dashboard that you select. If you select Filter the current dashboard, that chart will be used to filter the current dashboard by the available userAgentName attributes. Here's a view of selecting one of those attributes to filter that dashboard. Notice that the chosen attribute appears as a filter in the search bar at the top. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: When you select an attribute you've set up for facet filtering, it filters the current dashboard. For more about this feature, see the Explorers Hub post on facet filtering. Facet linking with the FACET CASES clause FACET CASES is a NRQL function that allows to group facets based on conditions. We support multiple cases in the same facet. Let's say you want to query some data and put the responses into mnemonic categories for a dashboard or report. This syntax will allow you to query based on transaction duration and put the results into two categories: ACCEPTABLE and UNACCEPTABLE. This can be really useful for making dashboards more human readable and actionable. SELECT filter(count(*), WHERE duration > 1) as 'UNACCEPTABLE', filter(count(*), WHERE duration <=1) as 'ACCEPTABLE' FROM Transaction FACET appName LIMIT 5 since 5 minutes ago Copy By using FACET CASES, we can more efficiently use multiple complex conditions to generate a set of custom facets. Building on the previous example, let's say we want to include a compound condition which excludes errors from our duration data and adds them into a third category: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (where duration > 1 and error is NULL as 'UNACCEPTABLE', where duration <= 1 and error is NULL as 'ACCEPTABLE', where error is not NULL as 'ERROR') since 5 minutes ago Copy Then, using facet linking, you can filter your dashboards by those facets.",

      "body": "Access any of your New Relic One dashboards to create or manage your charts directly from the chart menu, customize your dashboard's layout, adjust display modes, or export your data. Once you have customized your dashboard and built your charts, use our advanced visualization features and tools for data exploration to correlate and analyze your data. Customize your dashboard Dashboards are highly flexible: you can tailor your dashboard layout and arrange chart sizes to optimize how you see your data. Tip Click the icon to access the See metadata and manage tags modal. There you can see the dashboard's GUID, account ID, and App ID, and manage all the tags that have been added to the dashboard. Dashboards features include: Edit your dashboard Use the edit button to: Copy the dashboard's permalink. Rename your dashboard. Names are searchable, so we recommend giving it a meaningful name. Create new content by clicking the Add widget button. Add a new chart using the query builder, or add text, images, or links using our markdown editor. Resize and rearrange charts. You can move any chart and put it anywhere in the dashboard so the layout you set fits your preferences: place your more relevant charts on top, or drop less used charts in a corner. You can set up to 12 columns of charts. Settings menu Use the settings menu on the upper right corner: To change the name of the dashboard. Names are searchable, so we recommend giving it a meaningful name that will help you locate your dashboard easily. To modify the dashboard's permissions. At the settings menu you can also see when the dashboard was created and the account it belongs to. These values cannot be modified. TV mode You can enable a full-screen TV mode that optimizes the dashboard for display on a television screen. There are two ways to turn on TV mode: When viewing a dashboard in New Relic One, select the icon at the top right. Add this parameter to a dashboard page URL: &platform[tvMode]=true To configure TV mode, from a dashboard, select the icon. Options include: Dashboard name display. Turning off the dashboard name gives the dashboard charts more space on the screen. Page cycle. For dashboards with multiple pages, this automatically cycles from page to page. Dark mode High-contrast mode is available in dashboards. Select the icon from the upper right menu bar. Copy your dashboard as JSON You can copy your dashboard as JSON and add it to the clipboard by clicking on the < / > icon on the right corner. Export your dashboard You can export your dashboard as a pdf file clicking the icon. Duplicate your dashboard You can duplicate your dashboard clicking the duplicate icon regardless of your permission levels. The dashboard is automatically copied and the duplicate is added to the index. The duplicate has Public - Read and write permissions. Access the new, duplicated dashboard by clicking on the message that pops up on your screen. The duplicated dashboard is named like the original dashboard followed by the word “copy”. For example, if you duplicate a dashboard named This is my dashboard, the duplicate is called This is my dashboard copy. You can change the name when you duplicate it. You can edit the name and other properties of the dashboard, such as permissions, any time. Tip You can use the search feature at any time to search data across New Relic One. Add new content to your dashboard There are multiple ways to add new content to your dashboard: From the data explorer and query builder features. Use the + Add to your dashboard button (accessible from the main dashboard page or in the edit mode) to access the query builder, or to add content (such as text, links, or images) using our Markdown editor. Copy an existing chart from any dashboard. If you experience issues adding new content, check our error messages. Add custom content using the markdown editor The Markdown editor contains a Markdown pane, where you enter your content, as well as a Preview pane, where you can view it. For more information about Markdown syntax options, see the Commonmark website. You can also edit existing content by clicking the ellipses icon on any markdown widget and selecting Edit. Organize your dashboards with pages You can use multiple pages to organize your dashboard data in different views. When you add more pages to that dashboard, you can access these pages using the tabs at the top of the dashboard UI. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: This is an example of a dashboard in New Relic One with multiple pages, represented by the tabs at the top of the dashboard. You can add pages to dashboards, copy existing pages, and drag and drop the page tabs to new positions. You can use this feature to group together related dashboard views. This is valuable when you're aggregating a lot of data and charts related to a specific project, team, or subject. For example, a mobile app team might build a dashboard focused on app performance by country. The first dashboard page might be an overview of performance across all countries, with other pages focused on specific countries. We offer other features to connect dashboards: Create widgets containing markdown text to add direct links to specific UI pages or dashboards. Use facet filtering to create links that automatically link to and filter other dashboards. Use the dashboard search to find similarly named dashboards. To take advantage of this, you can add team- or project-specific words/phrases to dashboard names. In New Relic Insights, this feature was called data apps. For more about switching from Insights to New Relic One, see our transition guide. Add and edit pages to a dashboard To add or edit a page in a dashboard: From a new or existing dashboard, enter edit mode by selecting the icon. Add a new page: Select Add a page to add a blank page. Clone an existing page by clicking the dropdown next to a dashboard name, and selecting Duplicate. While in edit mode, you can add widgets to the new page, drag and drop page tabs to new locations, and do other dashboard editing tasks. When finished, select Done editing. Manage your charts and markdown content From any markdown element, access the menu on the upper right corner to edit or delete it. From any chart, access the chart action menu on the upper right corner to: Expand your chart to full screen. Share your chart as an image or with a link. Copy the chart to any dashboard. For table charts only, export as a .csv file. You can import this file into other apps like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets to do further analysis. Create an alert condition. Open the NRQL console to see or edit the query associated to the chart. Duplicate the chart. Delete the chart. Important You cannot edit the query of a chart if you have Read only permissions to the dashboard. Learn more about how to use your charts. Filter and refine your charts You can narrow down the information on display using the filtering function, which is a visual representation of query conditions: Use the filter bar to select the values or attributes you want to see, and remove the rest of the elements from the charts. Open the advanced filter bar to access the boolean operators (such as =, !=, CONTAINS, EXCLUDES, etc.) and add compound and complex conditions for filtering data. After applying the filter, your dashboard will only show the data associated to the elements you selected. A small counter indicates how many filters are being applied at a time. To return to the default view, click on the small cross by the filter to remove it. Filter using the chart legend Click on a legend in any chart with legends to see that series only and remove the rest of them from the chart. This helps you isolate the data you want to analyze. Use CMD (in a Mac) or CTRL (in Windows) for the opposite behavior: removing the selected series and keeping the rest. Filter dashboards using facets If a chart's NRQL query contains a FACET clause, you can use the faceted attributes to filter the current dashboard or another related dashboard. For details, see Filter by facets. Use the time picker to adjust time settings By default, each chart in the dashboard will show data for the time period specified when they were created in the query builder. However, you can use the time picker to change the time range of the data on display and set the same range for all charts. This is particularly useful while troubleshooting incidents, if you need to narrow down your data to observe what happened in a specific time period. The refresh rate depends on the duration of the time window you are viewing. For more information and examples, see Chart refresh intervals. To change the time range: Select one of the available options from the dropdown menu (ranging from Last 30 minutes to Last 7 days). Customize the time range with specific start and end timestamps using the custom menu. Important In dashboards, unlike Insights, the time zone is independent from your laptop's time. You can set the time zone you want to use in your user preferences, easily accessible from the custom menu in the time picker. Export and share your data It is very easy to export dashboard and chart data and share it within your company and beyond: You can export any dashboard as a PDF file, using the Export dashboard as PDF button located in the upper right menu bar. You can also share your charts either as a PNG image or as a link. Go to the chart menu and select either the Get as image or Get chart link options.",

      "body": "You can filter your New Relic One dashboards by faceted attributes, making your dashboards more interactive and easy to use. Why use facet filtering? In New Relic One dashboards, for NRQL queries containing a FACET clause and meeting other chart-type requirements, you can set up the faceted attributes to filter the current dashboard or a related, linked dashboard. By letting you quickly filter your dashboards, and link to pre-filtered dashboards, your dashboards are more interactive and easy to use. This feature is available when adding a new chart to a dashboard or when editing a chart on an existing dashboard. To see this feature in action, see the example use case. Requirements Requirements to use this feature: Must be in New Relic One dashboards. Will not work on a standalone chart in the query builder. NRQL query must contain a FACET clause. Available only for bar charts, heat maps, pie charts, and tables. Example use of facet filtering Let's say you create the following facet-containing NRQL query for an existing dashboard in New Relic One: one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: For queries containing a FACET clause and meeting chart-type requirements, you can set those attributes to be used as an easy dashboard filter. You can set the attribute to filter the current dashboard you're on, or filter a related dashboard that you select. If you select Filter the current dashboard, that chart will be used to filter the current dashboard by the available userAgentName attributes. Here's a view of selecting one of those attributes to filter that dashboard. Notice that the chosen attribute appears as a filter in the search bar at the top. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: When you select an attribute you've set up for facet filtering, it filters the current dashboard. For more about this feature, see the Explorers Hub post on facet filtering. Facet linking with the FACET CASES clause FACET CASES is a NRQL function that allows to group facets based on conditions. We support multiple cases in the same facet. Let's say you want to query some data and put the responses into mnemonic categories for a dashboard or report. This syntax will allow you to query based on transaction duration and put the results into two categories: ACCEPTABLE and UNACCEPTABLE. This can be really useful for making dashboards more human readable and actionable. SELECT filter(count(*), WHERE duration > 1) as 'UNACCEPTABLE', filter(count(*), WHERE duration <=1) as 'ACCEPTABLE' FROM Transaction FACET appName LIMIT 5 since 5 minutes ago Copy By using FACET CASES, we can more efficiently use multiple complex conditions to generate a set of custom facets. Building on the previous example, let's say we want to include a compound condition which excludes errors from our duration data and adds them into a third category: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (where duration > 1 and error is NULL as 'UNACCEPTABLE', where duration <= 1 and error is NULL as 'ACCEPTABLE', where error is not NULL as 'ERROR') since 5 minutes ago Copy Then, using facet linking, you can filter your dashboards by those facets.",

      "body": "You can filter your New Relic One dashboards by faceted attributes, making your dashboards more interactive and easy to use. Why use facet filtering? In New Relic One dashboards, for NRQL queries containing a FACET clause and meeting other chart-type requirements, you can set up the faceted attributes to filter the current dashboard or a related, linked dashboard. By letting you quickly filter your dashboards, and link to pre-filtered dashboards, your dashboards are more interactive and easy to use. This feature is available when adding a new chart to a dashboard or when editing a chart on an existing dashboard. To see this feature in action, see the example use case. Requirements Requirements to use this feature: Must be in New Relic One dashboards. Will not work on a standalone chart in the query builder. NRQL query must contain a FACET clause. Available only for bar charts, heat maps, pie charts, and tables. Example use of facet filtering Let's say you create the following facet-containing NRQL query for an existing dashboard in New Relic One: one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: For queries containing a FACET clause and meeting chart-type requirements, you can set those attributes to be used as an easy dashboard filter. You can set the attribute to filter the current dashboard you're on, or filter a related dashboard that you select. If you select Filter the current dashboard, that chart will be used to filter the current dashboard by the available userAgentName attributes. Here's a view of selecting one of those attributes to filter that dashboard. Notice that the chosen attribute appears as a filter in the search bar at the top. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: When you select an attribute you've set up for facet filtering, it filters the current dashboard. For more about this feature, see the Explorers Hub post on facet filtering. Facet linking with the FACET CASES clause FACET CASES is a NRQL function that allows to group facets based on conditions. We support multiple cases in the same facet. Let's say you want to query some data and put the responses into mnemonic categories for a dashboard or report. This syntax will allow you to query based on transaction duration and put the results into two categories: ACCEPTABLE and UNACCEPTABLE. This can be really useful for making dashboards more human readable and actionable. SELECT filter(count(*), WHERE duration > 1) as 'UNACCEPTABLE', filter(count(*), WHERE duration <=1) as 'ACCEPTABLE' FROM Transaction FACET appName LIMIT 5 since 5 minutes ago Copy By using FACET CASES, we can more efficiently use multiple complex conditions to generate a set of custom facets. Building on the previous example, let's say we want to include a compound condition which excludes errors from our duration data and adds them into a third category: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (where duration > 1 and error is NULL as 'UNACCEPTABLE', where duration <= 1 and error is NULL as 'ACCEPTABLE', where error is not NULL as 'ERROR') since 5 minutes ago Copy Then, using facet linking, you can filter your dashboards by those facets.",

Global Performance data sets data are useful for: Existing New Relic customers who want to gain general monitoring and troubleshooting insights from a curated collection of aggregated, real-world data. Newcomers who want to get a feel for New Relic’s dashboards and data tools and view real data visualizations in order to make informed decisions about how to add their own data to New Relic. This resource provides information about the Global Performance data sets, how they work, what they do, and current options for accessing Global Performance data. Public API Performance dashboard Important Please note: Global Performance data sets are presented as-is. Global Performance data sets represent an aggregate of samples across a range of sources, and New Relic makes no effort to attempt to confirm the correctness, completeness, or veracity of the data. This data should not be relied on as the sole source of information for any purpose you may use it, and New Relic is not responsible for decisions made in reliance on this data. Global Performance data sets should not be viewed as either an endorsement or a recommendation by New Relic of the technologies represented in the data sets. Access valuable data and try out New Relic Our first Global Performance data set, Public API Performance, offers a large body of real-world, real-time data about the performance of public APIs including AWS, Google, and more as experienced by New Relic customers (as authorized). Because this data is already flowing through New Relic, you can access it within seconds of activating your account, and test drive New Relic dashboarding and querying capabilities in the process. There’s no need to connect your own data sources to New Relic first, although we recommend you do so because adding your own data is easy, free, and the best way to understand how New Relic can serve your business needs. Get started with the Public API Performance dashboard To help you get started using Public API Performance data, we've created a Public API Performance dashboard. This dashboard provides both actionable general insights and analytics and also an example of how you might apply dashboarding capabilities to your own data.

      "body": "Access any of your New Relic One dashboards to create or manage your charts directly from the chart menu, customize your dashboard's layout, adjust display modes, or export your data. Once you have customized your dashboard and built your charts, use our advanced visualization features and tools for data exploration to correlate and analyze your data. Customize your dashboard Dashboards are highly flexible: you can tailor your dashboard layout and arrange chart sizes to optimize how you see your data. Tip Click the icon to access the See metadata and manage tags modal. There you can see the dashboard's GUID, account ID, and App ID, and manage all the tags that have been added to the dashboard. Dashboards features include: Edit your dashboard Use the edit button to: Copy the dashboard's permalink. Rename your dashboard. Names are searchable, so we recommend giving it a meaningful name. Create new content by clicking the Add widget button. Add a new chart using the query builder, or add text, images, or links using our markdown editor. Resize and rearrange charts. You can move any chart and put it anywhere in the dashboard so the layout you set fits your preferences: place your more relevant charts on top, or drop less used charts in a corner. You can set up to 12 columns of charts. Settings menu Use the settings menu on the upper right corner: To change the name of the dashboard. Names are searchable, so we recommend giving it a meaningful name that will help you locate your dashboard easily. To modify the dashboard's permissions. At the settings menu you can also see when the dashboard was created and the account it belongs to. These values cannot be modified. TV mode You can enable a full-screen TV mode that optimizes the dashboard for display on a television screen. There are two ways to turn on TV mode: When viewing a dashboard in New Relic One, select the icon at the top right. Add this parameter to a dashboard page URL: &platform[tvMode]=true To configure TV mode, from a dashboard, select the icon. Options include: Dashboard name display. Turning off the dashboard name gives the dashboard charts more space on the screen. Page cycle. For dashboards with multiple pages, this automatically cycles from page to page. Dark mode High-contrast mode is available in dashboards. Select the icon from the upper right menu bar. Copy your dashboard as JSON You can copy your dashboard as JSON and add it to the clipboard by clicking on the < / > icon on the right corner. Export your dashboard You can export your dashboard as a pdf file clicking the icon. Duplicate your dashboard You can duplicate your dashboard clicking the duplicate icon regardless of your permission levels. The dashboard is automatically copied and the duplicate is added to the index. The duplicate has Public - Read and write permissions. Access the new, duplicated dashboard by clicking on the message that pops up on your screen. The duplicated dashboard is named like the original dashboard followed by the word “copy”. For example, if you duplicate a dashboard named This is my dashboard, the duplicate is called This is my dashboard copy. You can change the name when you duplicate it. You can edit the name and other properties of the dashboard, such as permissions, any time. Tip You can use the search feature at any time to search data across New Relic One. Add new content to your dashboard There are multiple ways to add new content to your dashboard: From the data explorer and query builder features. Use the + Add to your dashboard button (accessible from the main dashboard page or in the edit mode) to access the query builder, or to add content (such as text, links, or images) using our Markdown editor. Copy an existing chart from any dashboard. If you experience issues adding new content, check our error messages. Add custom content using the markdown editor The Markdown editor contains a Markdown pane, where you enter your content, as well as a Preview pane, where you can view it. For more information about Markdown syntax options, see the Commonmark website. You can also edit existing content by clicking the ellipses icon on any markdown widget and selecting Edit. Organize your dashboards with pages You can use multiple pages to organize your dashboard data in different views. When you add more pages to that dashboard, you can access these pages using the tabs at the top of the dashboard UI. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: This is an example of a dashboard in New Relic One with multiple pages, represented by the tabs at the top of the dashboard. You can add pages to dashboards, copy existing pages, and drag and drop the page tabs to new positions. You can use this feature to group together related dashboard views. This is valuable when you're aggregating a lot of data and charts related to a specific project, team, or subject. For example, a mobile app team might build a dashboard focused on app performance by country. The first dashboard page might be an overview of performance across all countries, with other pages focused on specific countries. We offer other features to connect dashboards: Create widgets containing markdown text to add direct links to specific UI pages or dashboards. Use facet filtering to create links that automatically link to and filter other dashboards. Use the dashboard search to find similarly named dashboards. To take advantage of this, you can add team- or project-specific words/phrases to dashboard names. In New Relic Insights, this feature was called data apps. For more about switching from Insights to New Relic One, see our transition guide. Add and edit pages to a dashboard To add or edit a page in a dashboard: From a new or existing dashboard, enter edit mode by selecting the icon. Add a new page: Select Add a page to add a blank page. Clone an existing page by clicking the dropdown next to a dashboard name, and selecting Duplicate. While in edit mode, you can add widgets to the new page, drag and drop page tabs to new locations, and do other dashboard editing tasks. When finished, select Done editing. Manage your charts and markdown content From any markdown element, access the menu on the upper right corner to edit or delete it. From any chart, access the chart action menu on the upper right corner to: Expand your chart to full screen. Share your chart as an image or with a link. Copy the chart to any dashboard. For table charts only, export as a .csv file. You can import this file into other apps like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets to do further analysis. Create an alert condition. Open the NRQL console to see or edit the query associated to the chart. Duplicate the chart. Delete the chart. Important You cannot edit the query of a chart if you have Read only permissions to the dashboard. Learn more about how to use your charts. Filter and refine your charts You can narrow down the information on display using the filtering function, which is a visual representation of query conditions: Use the filter bar to select the values or attributes you want to see, and remove the rest of the elements from the charts. Open the advanced filter bar to access the boolean operators (such as =, !=, CONTAINS, EXCLUDES, etc.) and add compound and complex conditions for filtering data. After applying the filter, your dashboard will only show the data associated to the elements you selected. A small counter indicates how many filters are being applied at a time. To return to the default view, click on the small cross by the filter to remove it. Filter using the chart legend Click on a legend in any chart with legends to see that series only and remove the rest of them from the chart. This helps you isolate the data you want to analyze. Use CMD (in a Mac) or CTRL (in Windows) for the opposite behavior: removing the selected series and keeping the rest. Filter dashboards using facets If a chart's NRQL query contains a FACET clause, you can use the faceted attributes to filter the current dashboard or another related dashboard. For details, see Filter by facets. Use the time picker to adjust time settings By default, each chart in the dashboard will show data for the time period specified when they were created in the query builder. However, you can use the time picker to change the time range of the data on display and set the same range for all charts. This is particularly useful while troubleshooting incidents, if you need to narrow down your data to observe what happened in a specific time period. The refresh rate depends on the duration of the time window you are viewing. For more information and examples, see Chart refresh intervals. To change the time range: Select one of the available options from the dropdown menu (ranging from Last 30 minutes to Last 7 days). Customize the time range with specific start and end timestamps using the custom menu. Important In dashboards, unlike Insights, the time zone is independent from your laptop's time. You can set the time zone you want to use in your user preferences, easily accessible from the custom menu in the time picker. Export and share your data It is very easy to export dashboard and chart data and share it within your company and beyond: You can export any dashboard as a PDF file, using the Export dashboard as PDF button located in the upper right menu bar. You can also share your charts either as a PNG image or as a link. Go to the chart menu and select either the Get as image or Get chart link options.",

      "body": "The New Relic platform is built around the four fundamental telemetry data types we believe are necessary for complete and effective system monitoring: metrics, events, logs, and traces. After you sign up for a free New Relic account and install any of our monitoring services, you can start working with your data. Get started This doc will give you a fairly technical explanation of our core data types, their structure, and how they're used in our features. You can use most of our features without needing to understand the underlying data structure. But having a better understanding of this can help you get data into New Relic, understand the data you see in our UI, and query your data. For a simpler explanation of these data types using real-world examples, see Introduction to essential telemetry data types. Another good way to understand your data is to just start querying it. Tip Access your data easily on one.newrelic.com: Click the Browse data dropdown menu and select the data type (metrics, events, logs, and traces) you want to explore. Metrics First, we’ll explain the definition of metrics from a monitoring industry perspective, and then we’ll explain how New Relic handles metrics. For a list of the metrics we collect, see our documentation on metrics. Metrics in the monitoring industry In the software monitoring industry, a metric means a numeric measurement of an application or system. Metrics are typically reported on a regular schedule. Two major types of metrics are: Aggregated data. For example: a count of events over one minute’s time, or the rate of some event per minute. A numeric status at a moment in time. For example: a CPU temperature reading, or a “CPU% used” status. Metrics are relatively easy to report and store because a single record can represent a range of time. They can also be aggregated more and more over time. For example, per-minute data may be “rolled up” to per-hour aggregations after some amount of time, and eventually may be rolled up to a per-day aggregation. This approach is efficient for long-term data storage. Metrics are a strong solution for storing data long-term, and understanding trends over time. One potential downside is that it can be difficult to do detailed analysis of older data that has been aggregated over time; when high detail is required about specific important actions, event data can be used. Metrics at New Relic Conceptually, \"metrics\" is a broad, general category. There are various ways New Relic measures and reports metrics but, in practice, when using the New Relic UI, you usually won't have to understand how exactly this happens. In our documentation, we typically will just refer to \"metrics,\" regardless of how that data is reported, unless there's a reason you need to know more (like understanding how to query your data). Here are some of the ways metrics are reported and stored across the New Relic platform: Dimensional metrics (used by Metric API and many integrations) In the monitoring industry, \"dimensional\" metrics refer to metric data that has a variety of attributes (dimensions) attached, such as duration-related attributes (start time, end time), entity ID, region, host, etc. This amount of detail allows for in-depth analysis and querying. At New Relic, this metric data is attached to the Metric data type and is sent from several sources: Some open-source integrations, such as the Prometheus exporter. Our Telemetry SDKs Infrastructure services The Metric API (the underlying API used by the above tools) The events-to-metrics service To query this data and see its attributes (\"dimensions\"), you could use a NRQL query like: Select * from Metric Copy As time passes, these metrics are increasingly aggregated into larger time buckets. This is done to optimize your ability to query data over a long period of time. For more details about the metric data type, see our docs. To learn how this data is ingested and stored, see the Metric API documentation. For tips on querying, see Metric query examples. Metric timeslice data (used by APM, browser, mobile) New Relic's APM, browser, and mobile report and display metrics in a simple data format that we refer to as metric timeslice data. A metric timeslice consists of three parts: a metric name, the segment of time the metric represents (the \"timeslice\"), and a numeric value (the measurement). For example: an APM metric timeslice for time spent in a particular transaction is named WebTransaction/URI/foo, and might have a response time of 0.793 for a one-minute time slice from 10:20am to 10:21am. These metrics usually follow a pattern like <category>/<class>/<method>. Our agents (APM, browser, and mobile) can collect thousands of metric timeslices per minute for a variety of performance metrics. For example: error rate, bandwidth usage, and garbage collection time. You also have the ability to create custom metrics. Metric timeslice data is a lightweight data type and lacks the detail that dimensional metrics have. Ways to explore and query metric timeslice data: For APM: metric timeslice data is converted to dimensional metrics and can be queried via NRQL Use the REST API If you want to learn more about the structure of metric timeslice data and see some examples, expand the collapser below. Metric timeslice examples Here are some common metric timeslice data examples, with a focus on common ones used by Ruby applications. ActiveMerchant New Relic tracks a variety of metrics on ActiveMerchant transactions which can be used for business analytics as well as performance monitoring. The metrics are summarized by operation as well as by gateway. regex sample metric legend name ActiveMerchant/. * ActiveMerchant/PayJunctionGateway ActiveMerchant/gateway/. * ActiveMerchant/gateway/PayJunctionGateway/purchase PayJunctionGateway ActiveMerchant/operation/. * ActiveMerchant/operation/purchase purchase For more information, see the ActiveMerchant website. ActiveRecord ActiveRecord is the Object-Relational Mapping API used by Ruby on Rails applications. The metrics shown here measure the performance of ActiveRecord's find and save methods. regex sample metric legend name ActiveRecord/. * /find ActiveRecord/User/find User#find ActiveRecord/. * /save ActiveRecord/Product/save Product#save For more information, see the API documentation for ActiveRecord. Apdex Apdex is a measure of user satisfaction with page load times. Controller In Ruby on Rails applications, HTTP requests are handled by Controller actions. A Rails application has many controllers, each of which has one or more actions. When your rails application receives an http request, that request is routed to the appropriate controller and action, based on the URL of that request. That action then does whatever processing is neccesary to generate an http response, which is most often a web page, but could also be a page fragment, an xml document, or any other kind of data that is requested by the client. The following metrics track the performance of controller actions, regardless of routing, and without taking into account any network or web server effects. regex sample metric legend name Controller/. * Controller/Users/show /Users/show Controller/. * /(?! \\ (other \\ )). * Controller/Users/show /Users/show Controller$ Controller All Controller Actions ControllerCPU/ ControllerCPU/Users/Show /Users/show For more information, see the API documentation for ActionController. Errors This metric tracks the number of errors or exceptions raised while processing requests. regex sample metric legend name Errors/all Errors/all External services External service instrumentation captures calls to out-of-process services such as web services, resources in the cloud and any other network calls. It does not include other first class back-end components such as MemCache and the database. In Ruby applications we instrument the Net::Http library to capture all HTTP services. regex sample metric legend name External/ [ ^/]+/all$ External/service.example.com/all All service.example.com calls External/ External/host.aws.com/Net::Http : :POST Net::Http : :POST [ host.aws.com] External/all$ External/all External Services External/ [ ^/]+/(?!all)/ External/service.example.com/all All service.example.com calls HTTP dispatcher This metric represents a summary of the throughput and response time of all web requests. regex sample metric legend name ^HttpDispatcher$ HttpDispatcher HttpDispatcher MemCache MemCache is a popular technology that enables applications to access shared memory provided by any number of physical machines as a global cache. Applications that heavily use the database often use MemCache for performance and scalability benefits. These metrics measure the frequency and response time of calls to MemCache to read and write data from the cache. Response times should be low (less than 5 ms) for a well performing MemCache deployment. regex sample metric legend name MemCache/. * MemCache/read MemCache read operations MemCache/read MemCache/read MemCache read operations MemCache/write MemCache/write MemCache write operations Mongrel This metric measures the length of the mongrel queue, which holds pending http requests to be processed by mongrel. The HTTP Activity graph overlays the maximimum queue length for a given period. The value is zero if mongrel is processing a request but has no other requests waiting in its queue. When looking at this value across an aggregate cluster of mongrels, the queue lengths of all mongrels is added together, showing the sum of all queue lengths. A mongrel queue length should be at or near zero; if it is consistently at a higher level, then it indicates that your rails application is having trouble keeping up with its load requirements. regex sample metric legend name Mongrel/Queue Length Mongrel/Queue Length Queue Length View ActionView is a package in Rails that is used to render the output that is the response to an http request, such as an html page or an xml document. The View is rendered by the controller that is handling the request. If View metrics represent a large portion of your controller's response time, it could mean you are doing a lot of database operations inside the view template itself. regex sample metric legend name View/. * View/Users/ _ child.html.erb/Partial Users/ _ child.html.erb View/. * /Partial View/Users/ _ child.html.erb/Partial Users/ _ child.html.erb View/. * /Rendering View/Users/show.html.erb/Rendering Users/show.html.erb For more information, see the API documentation for ActionView. Metrics attached to events (used by Infrastructure, other products) Because event-type data can have any type of key-value pair data attached to it, one way metrics can be reported is as attributes attached to an event. A couple examples of this at New Relic: Our infrastructure monitoring reports many metrics that are attached to events. For example, we report a ProcessSample event, which has various sample-based metrics attached to it, like CPU percentage. To learn more about infrastructure monitoring data, see Infrastructure data. In APM, the Transaction event has several metrics attached to it, including databaseDuration. To learn more about this data and how to query it, see Events. Metrics as a computation of events (used in some charts and queries) Metrics can be formed by counting New Relic events, or doing some other mathematical calculation on those events. For example, if you wanted to measure the total number of Transaction events over the last half hour, you might run this NRQL query: Select count(*) from Transaction since 30 minutes ago Copy Another example: if you wanted to compute the average response time for your service, you might run a query like: FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) SINCE 30 minutes ago Copy Some New Relic charts are generated with these kinds of queries. The downside of this approach is that there are limits on how many events a monitoring system (including ours) can report. This means that sometimes, for high-throughput systems, the count may not accurately represent the total activity on that system. To learn more about how this can be addressed, see Event limits and sampling. Want to report custom metrics? See Get data into New Relic. Event data First, we’ll explain the definition of events from a monitoring industry perspective, and then we’ll explain some specifics about how New Relic handles event data. Events in the monitoring industry In the software industry, events can be thought of as simply “things that occur in a system.” For example, a server setting being changed would be an event. Another example: a website user clicking a mouse. Some events will generate a stored record, and that record is typically also called an event. Event data represents discrete occurrences and typically will have a high level of detail, so event data is suited for detailed analysis and querying. The downside to the use of event data is that there are typically so many events reported that it can become difficult to query that large dataset over longer time ranges. Events at New Relic At New Relic, we report events to data objects also called events. These events have multiple attributes (key-value pairs) attached. Event data is used in some UI charts and tables, and you can also query it. How long event data remains available is determined by data retention rules. One example of an event: APM reports an event type named Transaction, which represents a logical unit of work in an application. To see the attributes attached to this event, you could use a NRQL query like: Select * from Transaction Copy For examples of querying event data, see Introduction to NRQL. Other details about New Relic event data: Events can have any type of attributes attached. Some events have attributes that report metric data. You can report custom events. To increase the availability of your event data for querying/charting, you can turn events into metrics. Some systems generate a large number of events that exceeds collection limits and results in incomplete query results. For more on this, see Event sampling. Because event is a general term, in some New Relic contexts it will refer to any data type that can be queried via NRQL. For example, when you run a NRQL query, it returns a count of inspected events: this is a count of all data types queried. Log data First, we’ll explain the definition of logs from a monitoring industry perspective, and then we’ll explain some specifics about how New Relic handles log reporting. Logs in the monitoring industry A log is a message about a system used to understand the activity of the system and to diagnose problems. Logs at New Relic New Relic's Logs gives you a centralized log management platform that connects your log data with other New Relic-monitored data. For example, you can see logs alongside your APM data. In New Relic, log data is reported with multiple attributes (key-value data) attached. To query your log data, you could use a NRQL query like: Select * from Log Copy To report custom log data, see the Log API. Trace data First, we’ll explain the definition of traces from a monitoring industry perspective, and then we’ll explain some specifics about how New Relic handles tracing. Tracing in the monitoring industry In the application/infrastructure-monitoring world, tracing is a general term used to refer to various ways to report information about how a program or system is operating. For example, a stack trace provides in-depth information about a program’s subroutines. For large modern systems, which are often distributed across many services and micro-services, “tracing” often refers to distributed tracing, which is a way to monitor requests as they propagate through a complex, distributed environment. Tracing at New Relic New Relic offers a distributed tracing feature that tracks requests across a distributed system, and provides a dedicated UI for understanding and analyzing your traces. In New Relic, trace data is reported as Span objects, with multiple attributes (key-value pairs) attached. To query your tracing data, you could use a NRQL query like: Select * from Span Copy To learn more about how distributed tracing works, see Understand distributed tracing. To report custom distributed tracing data, see the Trace API.

Metric types The metric type determines how the data is aggregated over longer time windows. It also determines which functions you can use to query the data. Metric types Description Available query functions count Measures the number of occurrences of an event. The count should be reset to 0 every time the metric is reported. Examples include cache hits per reporting interval and the number of threads created per reporting interval. You must specify a value for interval.ms when reporting the count metric type using the Metric API. The value must be a positive double. Generally, you want to take the rate of the sum: From Metric select rate(sum(myMetric), 1 minute) . . . sum distribution Tracks the statistical distribution on a numeric attribute. This metric is re-aggregatable. For example, 1-minute data points from 60 minutes can be aggregated into a 1-hour data point, without degradation on accuracy. This type: Supports statistical functions like percentile and histogram, and all functions supported by the summary type. Uses the same algorithm as the percentile function. percentile histogram min max sum count average gauge Represents a value that can increase or decrease with time.

In New Relic One dashboards, for NRQL queries containing a FACET clause and meeting other chart-type requirements, you can set up the faceted attributes to filter the current dashboard or a related, linked dashboard. By letting you quickly filter your dashboards, and link to pre-filtered dashboards, your dashboards are more interactive and easy to use. This feature is available when adding a new chart to a dashboard or when editing a chart on an existing dashboard. To see this feature in action, see the example use case. Requirements Requirements to use this feature: Must be in New Relic One dashboards. Will not work on a standalone chart in the query builder. NRQL query must contain a FACET clause. Available only for bar charts, heat maps, pie charts, and tables. Example use of facet filtering Let's say you create the following facet-containing NRQL query for an existing dashboard in New Relic One: one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: For queries containing a FACET clause and meeting chart-type requirements, you can set those attributes to be used as an easy dashboard filter. You can set the attribute to filter the current dashboard you're on, or filter a related dashboard that you select. If you select Filter the current dashboard, that chart will be used to filter the current dashboard by the available userAgentName attributes. Here's a view of selecting one of those attributes to filter that dashboard. Notice that the chosen attribute appears as a filter in the search bar at the top. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: When you select an attribute you've set up for facet filtering, it filters the current dashboard. For more about this feature, see the Explorers Hub post on facet filtering. Facet linking with the FACET CASES clause FACET CASES is a NRQL function that allows to group facets based on conditions. We support multiple cases in the same facet. Let's say you want to query some data and put the responses into mnemonic categories for a dashboard or report. This syntax will allow you to query based on transaction duration and put the results into two categories: ACCEPTABLE and UNACCEPTABLE. This can be really useful for making dashboards more human readable and actionable. SELECT filter(count(*), WHERE duration > 1) as 'UNACCEPTABLE', filter(count(*), WHERE duration <=1) as 'ACCEPTABLE' FROM Transaction FACET appName LIMIT 5 since 5 minutes ago Copy By using FACET CASES, we can more efficiently use multiple complex conditions to generate a set of custom facets. Building on the previous example, let's say we want to include a compound condition which excludes errors from our duration data and adds them into a third category: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (where duration > 1 and error is NULL as 'UNACCEPTABLE', where duration <= 1 and error is NULL as 'ACCEPTABLE', where error is not NULL as 'ERROR') since 5 minutes ago Copy Then, using facet linking, you can filter your dashboards by those facets.",

The query builder comes with three working modes: basic query-less mode, advanced (NRQL) mode, and advanced PromQL-style mode, which takes PromQL queries as an input for accessing metrics and building charts. Use the query builder in PromQL-style mode You can access the query builder advanced PromQL-style mode by going to one.newrelic.com and clicking on Query your data at the top right corner. Go to the query builder tab on the left, then click PromQL-style on the right. Tip We support the Prometheus query language (PromQL) through our PromQL-style query mode. We do our best to automatically translate PromQL syntax queries into the closest NRQL approximation. For more information on how this works and differences you may observe between Prometheus and New Relic, see Supported PromQL features. Go to one.newrelic.com, press CTRL+E to open our Query Builder, then click PromQL-style to write a PromQL-style query. Build your PromQL-style query with the following parameters: Account: Select the account you want to query. PromQL-style prompt: Write you query here. You can view the list of valid options of the metrics and functions in the account. Step and range: Select the step and range for the query, or click on instant. Run the query to obtain the chart with the results. You can name the chart, change the type of chart, or add it to a dashboard. Tip Click NRQL to see how your PromQL-style query is translated into NRQL. PromQL-style and the query builder The query builder in advanced PromQL-style mode translates your PromQL query to NRQL before running the query. The results may be different from how Prometheus executes the query. If you would like to learn more about New Relic's PromQL-style query language and how it behaves, including troubleshooting information for translated queries, see Supported PromQL features.",

      "body": "Access any of your New Relic One dashboards to create or manage your charts directly from the chart menu, customize your dashboard's layout, adjust display modes, or export your data. Once you have customized your dashboard and built your charts, use our advanced visualization features and tools for data exploration to correlate and analyze your data. Customize your dashboard Dashboards are highly flexible: you can tailor your dashboard layout and arrange chart sizes to optimize how you see your data. Tip Click the icon to access the See metadata and manage tags modal. There you can see the dashboard's GUID, account ID, and App ID, and manage all the tags that have been added to the dashboard. Dashboards features include: Edit your dashboard Use the edit button to: Copy the dashboard's permalink. Rename your dashboard. Names are searchable, so we recommend giving it a meaningful name. Create new content by clicking the Add widget button. Add a new chart using the query builder, or add text, images, or links using our markdown editor. Resize and rearrange charts. You can move any chart and put it anywhere in the dashboard so the layout you set fits your preferences: place your more relevant charts on top, or drop less used charts in a corner. You can set up to 12 columns of charts. Settings menu Use the settings menu on the upper right corner: To change the name of the dashboard. Names are searchable, so we recommend giving it a meaningful name that will help you locate your dashboard easily. To modify the dashboard's permissions. At the settings menu you can also see when the dashboard was created and the account it belongs to. These values cannot be modified. TV mode You can enable a full-screen TV mode that optimizes the dashboard for display on a television screen. There are two ways to turn on TV mode: When viewing a dashboard in New Relic One, select the icon at the top right. Add this parameter to a dashboard page URL: &platform[tvMode]=true To configure TV mode, from a dashboard, select the icon. Options include: Dashboard name display. Turning off the dashboard name gives the dashboard charts more space on the screen. Page cycle. For dashboards with multiple pages, this automatically cycles from page to page. Dark mode High-contrast mode is available in dashboards. Select the icon from the upper right menu bar. Copy your dashboard as JSON You can copy your dashboard as JSON and add it to the clipboard by clicking on the < / > icon on the right corner. Export your dashboard You can export your dashboard as a pdf file clicking the icon. Duplicate your dashboard You can duplicate your dashboard clicking the duplicate icon regardless of your permission levels. The dashboard is automatically copied and the duplicate is added to the index. The duplicate has Public - Read and write permissions. Access the new, duplicated dashboard by clicking on the message that pops up on your screen. The duplicated dashboard is named like the original dashboard followed by the word “copy”. For example, if you duplicate a dashboard named This is my dashboard, the duplicate is called This is my dashboard copy. You can change the name when you duplicate it. You can edit the name and other properties of the dashboard, such as permissions, any time. Tip You can use the search feature at any time to search data across New Relic One. Add new content to your dashboard There are multiple ways to add new content to your dashboard: From the data explorer and query builder features. Use the + Add to your dashboard button (accessible from the main dashboard page or in the edit mode) to access the query builder, or to add content (such as text, links, or images) using our Markdown editor. Copy an existing chart from any dashboard. If you experience issues adding new content, check our error messages. Add custom content using the markdown editor The Markdown editor contains a Markdown pane, where you enter your content, as well as a Preview pane, where you can view it. For more information about Markdown syntax options, see the Commonmark website. You can also edit existing content by clicking the ellipses icon on any markdown widget and selecting Edit. Organize your dashboards with pages You can use multiple pages to organize your dashboard data in different views. When you add more pages to that dashboard, you can access these pages using the tabs at the top of the dashboard UI. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: This is an example of a dashboard in New Relic One with multiple pages, represented by the tabs at the top of the dashboard. You can add pages to dashboards, copy existing pages, and drag and drop the page tabs to new positions. You can use this feature to group together related dashboard views. This is valuable when you're aggregating a lot of data and charts related to a specific project, team, or subject. For example, a mobile app team might build a dashboard focused on app performance by country. The first dashboard page might be an overview of performance across all countries, with other pages focused on specific countries. We offer other features to connect dashboards: Create widgets containing markdown text to add direct links to specific UI pages or dashboards. Use facet filtering to create links that automatically link to and filter other dashboards. Use the dashboard search to find similarly named dashboards. To take advantage of this, you can add team- or project-specific words/phrases to dashboard names. In New Relic Insights, this feature was called data apps. For more about switching from Insights to New Relic One, see our transition guide. Add and edit pages to a dashboard To add or edit a page in a dashboard: From a new or existing dashboard, enter edit mode by selecting the icon. Add a new page: Select Add a page to add a blank page. Clone an existing page by clicking the dropdown next to a dashboard name, and selecting Duplicate. While in edit mode, you can add widgets to the new page, drag and drop page tabs to new locations, and do other dashboard editing tasks. When finished, select Done editing. Manage your charts and markdown content From any markdown element, access the menu on the upper right corner to edit or delete it. From any chart, access the chart action menu on the upper right corner to: Expand your chart to full screen. Share your chart as an image or with a link. Copy the chart to any dashboard. For table charts only, export as a .csv file. You can import this file into other apps like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets to do further analysis. Create an alert condition. Open the NRQL console to see or edit the query associated to the chart. Duplicate the chart. Delete the chart. Important You cannot edit the query of a chart if you have Read only permissions to the dashboard. Learn more about how to use your charts. Filter and refine your charts You can narrow down the information on display using the filtering function, which is a visual representation of query conditions: Use the filter bar to select the values or attributes you want to see, and remove the rest of the elements from the charts. Open the advanced filter bar to access the boolean operators (such as =, !=, CONTAINS, EXCLUDES, etc.) and add compound and complex conditions for filtering data. After applying the filter, your dashboard will only show the data associated to the elements you selected. A small counter indicates how many filters are being applied at a time. To return to the default view, click on the small cross by the filter to remove it. Filter using the chart legend Click on a legend in any chart with legends to see that series only and remove the rest of them from the chart. This helps you isolate the data you want to analyze. Use CMD (in a Mac) or CTRL (in Windows) for the opposite behavior: removing the selected series and keeping the rest. Filter dashboards using facets If a chart's NRQL query contains a FACET clause, you can use the faceted attributes to filter the current dashboard or another related dashboard. For details, see Filter by facets. Use the time picker to adjust time settings By default, each chart in the dashboard will show data for the time period specified when they were created in the query builder. However, you can use the time picker to change the time range of the data on display and set the same range for all charts. This is particularly useful while troubleshooting incidents, if you need to narrow down your data to observe what happened in a specific time period. The refresh rate depends on the duration of the time window you are viewing. For more information and examples, see Chart refresh intervals. To change the time range: Select one of the available options from the dropdown menu (ranging from Last 30 minutes to Last 7 days). Customize the time range with specific start and end timestamps using the custom menu. Important In dashboards, unlike Insights, the time zone is independent from your laptop's time. You can set the time zone you want to use in your user preferences, easily accessible from the custom menu in the time picker. Export and share your data It is very easy to export dashboard and chart data and share it within your company and beyond: You can export any dashboard as a PDF file, using the Export dashboard as PDF button located in the upper right menu bar. You can also share your charts either as a PNG image or as a link. Go to the chart menu and select either the Get as image or Get chart link options.",

      "body": "Access any of your New Relic One dashboards to create or manage your charts directly from the chart menu, customize your dashboard's layout, adjust display modes, or export your data. Once you have customized your dashboard and built your charts, use our advanced visualization features and tools for data exploration to correlate and analyze your data. Customize your dashboard Dashboards are highly flexible: you can tailor your dashboard layout and arrange chart sizes to optimize how you see your data. Tip Click the icon to access the See metadata and manage tags modal. There you can see the dashboard's GUID, account ID, and App ID, and manage all the tags that have been added to the dashboard. Dashboards features include: Edit your dashboard Use the edit button to: Copy the dashboard's permalink. Rename your dashboard. Names are searchable, so we recommend giving it a meaningful name. Create new content by clicking the Add widget button. Add a new chart using the query builder, or add text, images, or links using our markdown editor. Resize and rearrange charts. You can move any chart and put it anywhere in the dashboard so the layout you set fits your preferences: place your more relevant charts on top, or drop less used charts in a corner. You can set up to 12 columns of charts. Settings menu Use the settings menu on the upper right corner: To change the name of the dashboard. Names are searchable, so we recommend giving it a meaningful name that will help you locate your dashboard easily. To modify the dashboard's permissions. At the settings menu you can also see when the dashboard was created and the account it belongs to. These values cannot be modified. TV mode You can enable a full-screen TV mode that optimizes the dashboard for display on a television screen. There are two ways to turn on TV mode: When viewing a dashboard in New Relic One, select the icon at the top right. Add this parameter to a dashboard page URL: &platform[tvMode]=true To configure TV mode, from a dashboard, select the icon. Options include: Dashboard name display. Turning off the dashboard name gives the dashboard charts more space on the screen. Page cycle. For dashboards with multiple pages, this automatically cycles from page to page. Dark mode High-contrast mode is available in dashboards. Select the icon from the upper right menu bar. Copy your dashboard as JSON You can copy your dashboard as JSON and add it to the clipboard by clicking on the < / > icon on the right corner. Export your dashboard You can export your dashboard as a pdf file clicking the icon. Duplicate your dashboard You can duplicate your dashboard clicking the duplicate icon regardless of your permission levels. The dashboard is automatically copied and the duplicate is added to the index. The duplicate has Public - Read and write permissions. Access the new, duplicated dashboard by clicking on the message that pops up on your screen. The duplicated dashboard is named like the original dashboard followed by the word “copy”. For example, if you duplicate a dashboard named This is my dashboard, the duplicate is called This is my dashboard copy. You can change the name when you duplicate it. You can edit the name and other properties of the dashboard, such as permissions, any time. Tip You can use the search feature at any time to search data across New Relic One. Add new content to your dashboard There are multiple ways to add new content to your dashboard: From the data explorer and query builder features. Use the + Add to your dashboard button (accessible from the main dashboard page or in the edit mode) to access the query builder, or to add content (such as text, links, or images) using our Markdown editor. Copy an existing chart from any dashboard. If you experience issues adding new content, check our error messages. Add custom content using the markdown editor The Markdown editor contains a Markdown pane, where you enter your content, as well as a Preview pane, where you can view it. For more information about Markdown syntax options, see the Commonmark website. You can also edit existing content by clicking the ellipses icon on any markdown widget and selecting Edit. Organize your dashboards with pages You can use multiple pages to organize your dashboard data in different views. When you add more pages to that dashboard, you can access these pages using the tabs at the top of the dashboard UI. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: This is an example of a dashboard in New Relic One with multiple pages, represented by the tabs at the top of the dashboard. You can add pages to dashboards, copy existing pages, and drag and drop the page tabs to new positions. You can use this feature to group together related dashboard views. This is valuable when you're aggregating a lot of data and charts related to a specific project, team, or subject. For example, a mobile app team might build a dashboard focused on app performance by country. The first dashboard page might be an overview of performance across all countries, with other pages focused on specific countries. We offer other features to connect dashboards: Create widgets containing markdown text to add direct links to specific UI pages or dashboards. Use facet filtering to create links that automatically link to and filter other dashboards. Use the dashboard search to find similarly named dashboards. To take advantage of this, you can add team- or project-specific words/phrases to dashboard names. In New Relic Insights, this feature was called data apps. For more about switching from Insights to New Relic One, see our transition guide. Add and edit pages to a dashboard To add or edit a page in a dashboard: From a new or existing dashboard, enter edit mode by selecting the icon. Add a new page: Select Add a page to add a blank page. Clone an existing page by clicking the dropdown next to a dashboard name, and selecting Duplicate. While in edit mode, you can add widgets to the new page, drag and drop page tabs to new locations, and do other dashboard editing tasks. When finished, select Done editing. Manage your charts and markdown content From any markdown element, access the menu on the upper right corner to edit or delete it. From any chart, access the chart action menu on the upper right corner to: Expand your chart to full screen. Share your chart as an image or with a link. Copy the chart to any dashboard. For table charts only, export as a .csv file. You can import this file into other apps like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets to do further analysis. Create an alert condition. Open the NRQL console to see or edit the query associated to the chart. Duplicate the chart. Delete the chart. Important You cannot edit the query of a chart if you have Read only permissions to the dashboard. Learn more about how to use your charts. Filter and refine your charts You can narrow down the information on display using the filtering function, which is a visual representation of query conditions: Use the filter bar to select the values or attributes you want to see, and remove the rest of the elements from the charts. Open the advanced filter bar to access the boolean operators (such as =, !=, CONTAINS, EXCLUDES, etc.) and add compound and complex conditions for filtering data. After applying the filter, your dashboard will only show the data associated to the elements you selected. A small counter indicates how many filters are being applied at a time. To return to the default view, click on the small cross by the filter to remove it. Filter using the chart legend Click on a legend in any chart with legends to see that series only and remove the rest of them from the chart. This helps you isolate the data you want to analyze. Use CMD (in a Mac) or CTRL (in Windows) for the opposite behavior: removing the selected series and keeping the rest. Filter dashboards using facets If a chart's NRQL query contains a FACET clause, you can use the faceted attributes to filter the current dashboard or another related dashboard. For details, see Filter by facets. Use the time picker to adjust time settings By default, each chart in the dashboard will show data for the time period specified when they were created in the query builder. However, you can use the time picker to change the time range of the data on display and set the same range for all charts. This is particularly useful while troubleshooting incidents, if you need to narrow down your data to observe what happened in a specific time period. The refresh rate depends on the duration of the time window you are viewing. For more information and examples, see Chart refresh intervals. To change the time range: Select one of the available options from the dropdown menu (ranging from Last 30 minutes to Last 7 days). Customize the time range with specific start and end timestamps using the custom menu. Important In dashboards, unlike Insights, the time zone is independent from your laptop's time. You can set the time zone you want to use in your user preferences, easily accessible from the custom menu in the time picker. Export and share your data It is very easy to export dashboard and chart data and share it within your company and beyond: You can export any dashboard as a PDF file, using the Export dashboard as PDF button located in the upper right menu bar. You can also share your charts either as a PNG image or as a link. Go to the chart menu and select either the Get as image or Get chart link options.",

      "body": "You can filter your New Relic One dashboards by faceted attributes, making your dashboards more interactive and easy to use. Why use facet filtering? In New Relic One dashboards, for NRQL queries containing a FACET clause and meeting other chart-type requirements, you can set up the faceted attributes to filter the current dashboard or a related, linked dashboard. By letting you quickly filter your dashboards, and link to pre-filtered dashboards, your dashboards are more interactive and easy to use. This feature is available when adding a new chart to a dashboard or when editing a chart on an existing dashboard. To see this feature in action, see the example use case. Requirements Requirements to use this feature: Must be in New Relic One dashboards. Will not work on a standalone chart in the query builder. NRQL query must contain a FACET clause. Available only for bar charts, heat maps, pie charts, and tables. Example use of facet filtering Let's say you create the following facet-containing NRQL query for an existing dashboard in New Relic One: one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: For queries containing a FACET clause and meeting chart-type requirements, you can set those attributes to be used as an easy dashboard filter. You can set the attribute to filter the current dashboard you're on, or filter a related dashboard that you select. If you select Filter the current dashboard, that chart will be used to filter the current dashboard by the available userAgentName attributes. Here's a view of selecting one of those attributes to filter that dashboard. Notice that the chosen attribute appears as a filter in the search bar at the top. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: When you select an attribute you've set up for facet filtering, it filters the current dashboard. For more about this feature, see the Explorers Hub post on facet filtering. Facet linking with the FACET CASES clause FACET CASES is a NRQL function that allows to group facets based on conditions. We support multiple cases in the same facet. Let's say you want to query some data and put the responses into mnemonic categories for a dashboard or report. This syntax will allow you to query based on transaction duration and put the results into two categories: ACCEPTABLE and UNACCEPTABLE. This can be really useful for making dashboards more human readable and actionable. SELECT filter(count(*), WHERE duration > 1) as 'UNACCEPTABLE', filter(count(*), WHERE duration <=1) as 'ACCEPTABLE' FROM Transaction FACET appName LIMIT 5 since 5 minutes ago Copy By using FACET CASES, we can more efficiently use multiple complex conditions to generate a set of custom facets. Building on the previous example, let's say we want to include a compound condition which excludes errors from our duration data and adds them into a third category: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (where duration > 1 and error is NULL as 'UNACCEPTABLE', where duration <= 1 and error is NULL as 'ACCEPTABLE', where error is not NULL as 'ERROR') since 5 minutes ago Copy Then, using facet linking, you can filter your dashboards by those facets.",

There are two ways to turn on TV mode: When viewing a dashboard in New Relic One, select the icon at the top right. Add this parameter to a dashboard page URL: &platform[tvMode]=true To configure TV mode, from a dashboard, select the icon. Options include: Dashboard name display. Turning off the dashboard name gives the dashboard charts more space on the screen. Page cycle. For dashboards with multiple pages, this automatically cycles from page to page. Dark mode High-contrast mode is available in dashboards. Select the icon from the upper right menu bar. Copy your dashboard as JSON You can copy your dashboard as JSON and add it to the clipboard by clicking on the < / > icon on the right corner. Export your dashboard You can export your dashboard as a pdf file clicking the icon. Duplicate your dashboard You can duplicate your dashboard clicking the duplicate icon regardless of your permission levels. The dashboard is automatically copied and the duplicate is added to the index. The duplicate has Public - Read and write permissions. Access the new, duplicated dashboard by clicking on the message that pops up on your screen. The duplicated dashboard is named like the original dashboard followed by the word “copy”. For example, if you duplicate a dashboard named This is my dashboard, the duplicate is called This is my dashboard copy. You can change the name when you duplicate it. You can edit the name and other properties of the dashboard, such as permissions, any time. Tip You can use the search feature at any time to search data across New Relic One. Add new content to your dashboard There are multiple ways to add new content to your dashboard: From the data explorer and query builder features. Use the + Add to your dashboard button (accessible from the main dashboard page or in the edit mode) to access the query builder, or to add content (such as text, links, or images) using our Markdown editor. Copy an existing chart from any dashboard. If you experience issues adding new content, check our error messages. Add custom content using the markdown editor The Markdown editor contains a Markdown pane, where you enter your content, as well as a Preview pane, where you can view it. For more information about Markdown syntax options, see the Commonmark website. You can also edit existing content by clicking the ellipses icon on any markdown widget and selecting Edit. Organize your dashboards with pages You can use multiple pages to organize your dashboard data in different views. When you add more pages to that dashboard, you can access these pages using the tabs at the top of the dashboard UI. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: This is an example of a dashboard in New Relic One with multiple pages, represented by the tabs at the top of the dashboard. You can add pages to dashboards, copy existing pages, and drag and drop the page tabs to new positions. You can use this feature to group together related dashboard views. This is valuable when you're aggregating a lot of data and charts related to a specific project, team, or subject. For example, a mobile app team might build a dashboard focused on app performance by country. The first dashboard page might be an overview of performance across all countries, with other pages focused on specific countries. We offer other features to connect dashboards: Create widgets containing markdown text to add direct links to specific UI pages or dashboards. Use facet filtering to create links that automatically link to and filter other dashboards. Use the dashboard search to find similarly named dashboards. To take advantage of this, you can add team- or project-specific words/phrases to dashboard names. In New Relic Insights, this feature was called data apps. For more about switching from Insights to New Relic One, see our transition guide. Add and edit pages to a dashboard To add or edit a page in a dashboard: From a new or existing dashboard, enter edit mode by selecting the icon. Add a new page: Select Add a page to add a blank page. Clone an existing page by clicking the dropdown next to a dashboard name, and selecting Duplicate. While in edit mode, you can add widgets to the new page, drag and drop page tabs to new locations, and do other dashboard editing tasks. When finished, select Done editing. Manage your charts and markdown content From any markdown element, access the menu on the upper right corner to edit or delete it. From any chart, access the chart action menu on the upper right corner to: Expand your chart to full screen. Share your chart as an image or with a link. Copy the chart to any dashboard. For table charts only, export as a .csv file. You can import this file into other apps like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets to do further analysis. Create an alert condition. Open the NRQL console to see or edit the query associated to the chart. Duplicate the chart. Delete the chart. Important You cannot edit the query of a chart if you have Read only permissions to the dashboard. Learn more about how to use your charts. Filter and refine your charts You can narrow down the information on display using the filtering function, which is a visual representation of query conditions: Use the filter bar to select the values or attributes you want to see, and remove the rest of the elements from the charts. Open the advanced filter bar to access the boolean operators (such as =, !=, CONTAINS, EXCLUDES, etc.) and add compound and complex conditions for filtering data. After applying the filter, your dashboard will only show the data associated to the elements you selected. A small counter indicates how many filters are being applied at a time. To return to the default view, click on the small cross by the filter to remove it. Filter using the chart legend Click on a legend in any chart with legends to see that series only and remove the rest of them from the chart. This helps you isolate the data you want to analyze. Use CMD (in a Mac) or CTRL (in Windows) for the opposite behavior: removing the selected series and keeping the rest. Filter dashboards using facets If a chart's NRQL query contains a FACET clause, you can use the faceted attributes to filter the current dashboard or another related dashboard. For details, see Filter by facets. Use the time picker to adjust time settings By default, each chart in the dashboard will show data for the time period specified when they were created in the query builder. However, you can use the time picker to change the time range of the data on display and set the same range for all charts. This is particularly useful while troubleshooting incidents, if you need to narrow down your data to observe what happened in a specific time period. The refresh rate depends on the duration of the time window you are viewing. For more information and examples, see Chart refresh intervals. To change the time range: Select one of the available options from the dropdown menu (ranging from Last 30 minutes to Last 7 days). Customize the time range with specific start and end timestamps using the custom menu. Important In dashboards, unlike Insights, the time zone is independent from your laptop's time. You can set the time zone you want to use in your user preferences, easily accessible from the custom menu in the time picker. Export and share your data It is very easy to export dashboard and chart data and share it within your company and beyond: You can export any dashboard as a PDF file, using the Export dashboard as PDF button located in the upper right menu bar. You can also share your charts either as a PNG image or as a link. Go to the chart menu and select either the Get as image or Get chart link options.",

      "body": "You can filter your New Relic One dashboards by faceted attributes, making your dashboards more interactive and easy to use. Why use facet filtering? In New Relic One dashboards, for NRQL queries containing a FACET clause and meeting other chart-type requirements, you can set up the faceted attributes to filter the current dashboard or a related, linked dashboard. By letting you quickly filter your dashboards, and link to pre-filtered dashboards, your dashboards are more interactive and easy to use. This feature is available when adding a new chart to a dashboard or when editing a chart on an existing dashboard. To see this feature in action, see the example use case. Requirements Requirements to use this feature: Must be in New Relic One dashboards. Will not work on a standalone chart in the query builder. NRQL query must contain a FACET clause. Available only for bar charts, heat maps, pie charts, and tables. Example use of facet filtering Let's say you create the following facet-containing NRQL query for an existing dashboard in New Relic One: one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: For queries containing a FACET clause and meeting chart-type requirements, you can set those attributes to be used as an easy dashboard filter. You can set the attribute to filter the current dashboard you're on, or filter a related dashboard that you select. If you select Filter the current dashboard, that chart will be used to filter the current dashboard by the available userAgentName attributes. Here's a view of selecting one of those attributes to filter that dashboard. Notice that the chosen attribute appears as a filter in the search bar at the top. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: When you select an attribute you've set up for facet filtering, it filters the current dashboard. For more about this feature, see the Explorers Hub post on facet filtering. Facet linking with the FACET CASES clause FACET CASES is a NRQL function that allows to group facets based on conditions. We support multiple cases in the same facet. Let's say you want to query some data and put the responses into mnemonic categories for a dashboard or report. This syntax will allow you to query based on transaction duration and put the results into two categories: ACCEPTABLE and UNACCEPTABLE. This can be really useful for making dashboards more human readable and actionable. SELECT filter(count(*), WHERE duration > 1) as 'UNACCEPTABLE', filter(count(*), WHERE duration <=1) as 'ACCEPTABLE' FROM Transaction FACET appName LIMIT 5 since 5 minutes ago Copy By using FACET CASES, we can more efficiently use multiple complex conditions to generate a set of custom facets. Building on the previous example, let's say we want to include a compound condition which excludes errors from our duration data and adds them into a third category: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (where duration > 1 and error is NULL as 'UNACCEPTABLE', where duration <= 1 and error is NULL as 'ACCEPTABLE', where error is not NULL as 'ERROR') since 5 minutes ago Copy Then, using facet linking, you can filter your dashboards by those facets.",

Go to the query builder tab on the left, then click PromQL-style on the right. Tip We support the Prometheus query language (PromQL) through our PromQL-style query mode. We do our best to automatically translate PromQL syntax queries into the closest NRQL approximation. For more information on how this works and differences you may observe between Prometheus and New Relic, see Supported PromQL features. Go to one.newrelic.com, press CTRL+E to open our Query Builder, then click PromQL-style to write a PromQL-style query. Build your PromQL-style query with the following parameters: Account: Select the account you want to query. PromQL-style prompt: Write you query here. You can view the list of valid options of the metrics and functions in the account. Step and range: Select the step and range for the query, or click on instant. Run the query to obtain the chart with the results. You can name the chart, change the type of chart, or add it to a dashboard. Tip Click NRQL to see how your PromQL-style query is translated into NRQL. PromQL-style and the query builder The query builder in advanced PromQL-style mode translates your PromQL query to NRQL before running the query.

      "body": "You can filter your New Relic One dashboards by faceted attributes, making your dashboards more interactive and easy to use. Why use facet filtering? In New Relic One dashboards, for NRQL queries containing a FACET clause and meeting other chart-type requirements, you can set up the faceted attributes to filter the current dashboard or a related, linked dashboard. By letting you quickly filter your dashboards, and link to pre-filtered dashboards, your dashboards are more interactive and easy to use. This feature is available when adding a new chart to a dashboard or when editing a chart on an existing dashboard. To see this feature in action, see the example use case. Requirements Requirements to use this feature: Must be in New Relic One dashboards. Will not work on a standalone chart in the query builder. NRQL query must contain a FACET clause. Available only for bar charts, heat maps, pie charts, and tables. Example use of facet filtering Let's say you create the following facet-containing NRQL query for an existing dashboard in New Relic One: one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: For queries containing a FACET clause and meeting chart-type requirements, you can set those attributes to be used as an easy dashboard filter. You can set the attribute to filter the current dashboard you're on, or filter a related dashboard that you select. If you select Filter the current dashboard, that chart will be used to filter the current dashboard by the available userAgentName attributes. Here's a view of selecting one of those attributes to filter that dashboard. Notice that the chosen attribute appears as a filter in the search bar at the top. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: When you select an attribute you've set up for facet filtering, it filters the current dashboard. For more about this feature, see the Explorers Hub post on facet filtering. Facet linking with the FACET CASES clause FACET CASES is a NRQL function that allows to group facets based on conditions. We support multiple cases in the same facet. Let's say you want to query some data and put the responses into mnemonic categories for a dashboard or report. This syntax will allow you to query based on transaction duration and put the results into two categories: ACCEPTABLE and UNACCEPTABLE. This can be really useful for making dashboards more human readable and actionable. SELECT filter(count(*), WHERE duration > 1) as 'UNACCEPTABLE', filter(count(*), WHERE duration <=1) as 'ACCEPTABLE' FROM Transaction FACET appName LIMIT 5 since 5 minutes ago Copy By using FACET CASES, we can more efficiently use multiple complex conditions to generate a set of custom facets. Building on the previous example, let's say we want to include a compound condition which excludes errors from our duration data and adds them into a third category: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (where duration > 1 and error is NULL as 'UNACCEPTABLE', where duration <= 1 and error is NULL as 'ACCEPTABLE', where error is not NULL as 'ERROR') since 5 minutes ago Copy Then, using facet linking, you can filter your dashboards by those facets.",

      "body": "Access any of your New Relic One dashboards to create or manage your charts directly from the chart menu, customize your dashboard's layout, adjust display modes, or export your data. Once you have customized your dashboard and built your charts, use our advanced visualization features and tools for data exploration to correlate and analyze your data. Customize your dashboard Dashboards are highly flexible: you can tailor your dashboard layout and arrange chart sizes to optimize how you see your data. Tip Click the icon to access the See metadata and manage tags modal. There you can see the dashboard's GUID, account ID, and App ID, and manage all the tags that have been added to the dashboard. Dashboards features include: Edit your dashboard Use the edit button to: Copy the dashboard's permalink. Rename your dashboard. Names are searchable, so we recommend giving it a meaningful name. Create new content by clicking the Add widget button. Add a new chart using the query builder, or add text, images, or links using our markdown editor. Resize and rearrange charts. You can move any chart and put it anywhere in the dashboard so the layout you set fits your preferences: place your more relevant charts on top, or drop less used charts in a corner. You can set up to 12 columns of charts. Settings menu Use the settings menu on the upper right corner: To change the name of the dashboard. Names are searchable, so we recommend giving it a meaningful name that will help you locate your dashboard easily. To modify the dashboard's permissions. At the settings menu you can also see when the dashboard was created and the account it belongs to. These values cannot be modified. TV mode You can enable a full-screen TV mode that optimizes the dashboard for display on a television screen. There are two ways to turn on TV mode: When viewing a dashboard in New Relic One, select the icon at the top right. Add this parameter to a dashboard page URL: &platform[tvMode]=true To configure TV mode, from a dashboard, select the icon. Options include: Dashboard name display. Turning off the dashboard name gives the dashboard charts more space on the screen. Page cycle. For dashboards with multiple pages, this automatically cycles from page to page. Dark mode High-contrast mode is available in dashboards. Select the icon from the upper right menu bar. Copy your dashboard as JSON You can copy your dashboard as JSON and add it to the clipboard by clicking on the < / > icon on the right corner. Export your dashboard You can export your dashboard as a pdf file clicking the icon. Duplicate your dashboard You can duplicate your dashboard clicking the duplicate icon regardless of your permission levels. The dashboard is automatically copied and the duplicate is added to the index. The duplicate has Public - Read and write permissions. Access the new, duplicated dashboard by clicking on the message that pops up on your screen. The duplicated dashboard is named like the original dashboard followed by the word “copy”. For example, if you duplicate a dashboard named This is my dashboard, the duplicate is called This is my dashboard copy. You can change the name when you duplicate it. You can edit the name and other properties of the dashboard, such as permissions, any time. Tip You can use the search feature at any time to search data across New Relic One. Add new content to your dashboard There are multiple ways to add new content to your dashboard: From the data explorer and query builder features. Use the + Add to your dashboard button (accessible from the main dashboard page or in the edit mode) to access the query builder, or to add content (such as text, links, or images) using our Markdown editor. Copy an existing chart from any dashboard. If you experience issues adding new content, check our error messages. Add custom content using the markdown editor The Markdown editor contains a Markdown pane, where you enter your content, as well as a Preview pane, where you can view it. For more information about Markdown syntax options, see the Commonmark website. You can also edit existing content by clicking the ellipses icon on any markdown widget and selecting Edit. Organize your dashboards with pages You can use multiple pages to organize your dashboard data in different views. When you add more pages to that dashboard, you can access these pages using the tabs at the top of the dashboard UI. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: This is an example of a dashboard in New Relic One with multiple pages, represented by the tabs at the top of the dashboard. You can add pages to dashboards, copy existing pages, and drag and drop the page tabs to new positions. You can use this feature to group together related dashboard views. This is valuable when you're aggregating a lot of data and charts related to a specific project, team, or subject. For example, a mobile app team might build a dashboard focused on app performance by country. The first dashboard page might be an overview of performance across all countries, with other pages focused on specific countries. We offer other features to connect dashboards: Create widgets containing markdown text to add direct links to specific UI pages or dashboards. Use facet filtering to create links that automatically link to and filter other dashboards. Use the dashboard search to find similarly named dashboards. To take advantage of this, you can add team- or project-specific words/phrases to dashboard names. In New Relic Insights, this feature was called data apps. For more about switching from Insights to New Relic One, see our transition guide. Add and edit pages to a dashboard To add or edit a page in a dashboard: From a new or existing dashboard, enter edit mode by selecting the icon. Add a new page: Select Add a page to add a blank page. Clone an existing page by clicking the dropdown next to a dashboard name, and selecting Duplicate. While in edit mode, you can add widgets to the new page, drag and drop page tabs to new locations, and do other dashboard editing tasks. When finished, select Done editing. Manage your charts and markdown content From any markdown element, access the menu on the upper right corner to edit or delete it. From any chart, access the chart action menu on the upper right corner to: Expand your chart to full screen. Share your chart as an image or with a link. Copy the chart to any dashboard. For table charts only, export as a .csv file. You can import this file into other apps like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets to do further analysis. Create an alert condition. Open the NRQL console to see or edit the query associated to the chart. Duplicate the chart. Delete the chart. Important You cannot edit the query of a chart if you have Read only permissions to the dashboard. Learn more about how to use your charts. Filter and refine your charts You can narrow down the information on display using the filtering function, which is a visual representation of query conditions: Use the filter bar to select the values or attributes you want to see, and remove the rest of the elements from the charts. Open the advanced filter bar to access the boolean operators (such as =, !=, CONTAINS, EXCLUDES, etc.) and add compound and complex conditions for filtering data. After applying the filter, your dashboard will only show the data associated to the elements you selected. A small counter indicates how many filters are being applied at a time. To return to the default view, click on the small cross by the filter to remove it. Filter using the chart legend Click on a legend in any chart with legends to see that series only and remove the rest of them from the chart. This helps you isolate the data you want to analyze. Use CMD (in a Mac) or CTRL (in Windows) for the opposite behavior: removing the selected series and keeping the rest. Filter dashboards using facets If a chart's NRQL query contains a FACET clause, you can use the faceted attributes to filter the current dashboard or another related dashboard. For details, see Filter by facets. Use the time picker to adjust time settings By default, each chart in the dashboard will show data for the time period specified when they were created in the query builder. However, you can use the time picker to change the time range of the data on display and set the same range for all charts. This is particularly useful while troubleshooting incidents, if you need to narrow down your data to observe what happened in a specific time period. The refresh rate depends on the duration of the time window you are viewing. For more information and examples, see Chart refresh intervals. To change the time range: Select one of the available options from the dropdown menu (ranging from Last 30 minutes to Last 7 days). Customize the time range with specific start and end timestamps using the custom menu. Important In dashboards, unlike Insights, the time zone is independent from your laptop's time. You can set the time zone you want to use in your user preferences, easily accessible from the custom menu in the time picker. Export and share your data It is very easy to export dashboard and chart data and share it within your company and beyond: You can export any dashboard as a PDF file, using the Export dashboard as PDF button located in the upper right menu bar. You can also share your charts either as a PNG image or as a link. Go to the chart menu and select either the Get as image or Get chart link options.",

      "body": "Use the New Relic One query builder in basic mode to create a chart without having to use NRQL, our querying language. The basic mode helps guides you through a query-creation process. You can choose the source of the raw data, apply filters, and use other techniques to narrow the scope of the data in the chart. Important As of September 1, 2021, we are discontinuing support of the query builder's basic mode. Instead, you can use our data explorer's user-friendly and intuitive functionality in New Relic One. For more details, including how you can easily prepare for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. Data type The query builder basic mode has a Data type selector with two options: Events: In this context, this refers to all our non-Metric-type data, including events, logs, and trace data. Metrics: This refers to our dimensional Metric data type. You can also use this to query some types of metric timeslice data. For more on other types of metrics, see Data types. Example of using basic mode This example shows how to create a chart in basic mode. Step 1: Select the source of the data for a chart Begin by specifying what data you want to view in your chart. Click in the View a chart with box to select the event type, an attribute, and a function to perform on the attribute. You can use the event data dictionary to view information about an event type and its attributes on a single page. To see a tooltip with information about an event or attribute, hover over any term that has a dotted line underneath it. Here are the results of using the event data dictionary to specify the data: Event type. The Transaction event type measures a variety of data that describes what happens while a user is on a website, such as that user clicking on a button on a page. Attribute. The name attribute stores information on all transactions. Function. Select the unique_count function to get a count of all the transactions that occurred during the time frame. Basic mode now shows the selection: one.newrelic.com > Query builder > Basic > (event and attribute specified) As you specify data, the chart updates to show you the results from the data you specified. Based on the information specified so far, you can see a chart that shows the total number of transactions during the default time frame of 30 minutes. This total includes all transactions, whether the transaction was completed successfully or had errors. one.newrelic.com > Query builder > Basic > (event and attribute specified) Step 2: Filter the data Your next step is to determine which of those transactions got a 404 page not found error. If you look in the data dictionary for the Transaction event, you'll find this event also includes an attribute called httpResponseCode. Narrow the results to show only those transactions where a page not found error occurred. Use the Narrow results to box to create this filter: httpResponseCode = 404 . Because you want to be able to see the names of the apps that are resulting in the 404 errors, you use the Facet by box to see the results by appName (which is also an attribute for the Transaction event type). Faceting by appName updates the chart to break down the total number of 404 errors by the application names. This lets you know which apps are experiencing 404 errors. Your chart now shows the line chart with a line for each app, each with its own color. one.newrelic.com > Query builder > Basic > (event and attribute specified) > (filters and facets applied) Step 3: Adjust time range and limits You decide to focus on the five apps with the most page not found errors. The default value for the Limit field is 10, meaning that your chart will show the ten most relevant returns. You change that value to 5. Customer support told you that they had been getting calls about these errors for a little over two hours. You decide to change the time range from the last 30 minutes to the last three hours so that you can view the errors during the time when the customers were calling support. Now that you have the data set so that you are seeing exactly what you need, you can turn your attention to the appearance of the chart. Step 4: Customize the chart Because you are more interested in the total number of errors than a timeline view, you change the chart type to a bar chart. one.newrelic.com > Query builder > Basic > (event and attribute specified) > (filters and facets applied) > (time range and limit customized) > (chart type customized) When you're finished with your chart, you can add it to a dashboard or share it. This table contains notes about using basic mode. Item Description Prompts You can start typing directly in an empty box; a list of items that match the information you type will display. You can also click on an empty box to view a list of all of the items that are appropriate for the field, based on your earlier choices. Saving a basic mode data specification Every time you run a query, that query is saved in the My recent queries dropdown in advanced (NRQL) mode. Events Basic mode only supports data for one event and attribute. If you want to use more than one event and/or attribute, use the SELECT statement in advanced (NRQL) mode. Shortcuts Basic mode contains shortcuts that can display more complex events and attributes that aren't generally supported, as in this example (which shows the tooltip for the shortcut). Example of the Response time histogram shortcut, showing a tooltip. Tooltips Any time you see a dotted line under a term, you can hover over that term to see a tooltip with an explanation of the term. Narrow by You can use more than one Narrow by definition in basic mode filter; the conditions will be joined by AND. The WHERE clause in advanced (NRQL) allows OR in addition to AND. Important If your query was started using basic mode and if you make changes to that query using advanced (NRQL) mode, you cannot return to basic mode to edit that query. Any additional changes may only be made in advanced (NRQL) mode.",

      "body": "With real time streaming, your APM event data is sent to New Relic every five seconds. You can query and visualize your data for transactions, errors, and custom events in near real time. The smaller payloads result in faster chart refreshes and faster queries of data that is the most important to you. No configuration is needed to take advantage of real time streaming. All you need to do is ensure your APM agent version is up to date. Why it matters Real time streaming doesn't result in more events being sent. The combination of more frequent posts, with a smaller number of events per post, results in approximately the same number of events per minute as there would be without real time streaming. The following image shows a comparison between data sent to New Relic with and without real time streaming. Note that 10,000 is an example number of events; some agents have lower default limits. The overall limits on how many events can be sent per minute haven't changed. Also, non-event data (spans, traces, and metrics) are unaffected; they're still sent every minute. Use real time streaming to quickly understand the impact when something has changed, such as deploying a new app version. Examine key performance indicators (throughput, error rates, charting, etc.) in near real time. Respond quickly to failure conditions and anomalies. Get the most out of New Relic One dashboards. Reduce mean time to detection with APM events reporting every five seconds. Agent version to automatically enable To enable real time streaming, update to the latest APM agent. You don't need to configure anything to enable real time streaming; it will automatically report faster! Real time streaming is supported by all APM agents. Here are the minimum agent versions: C SDK: v1.3.0 or higher Go: v2.8.0 or higher Java: v5.5.0 or higher .NET: v8.23.107.0 or higher Node.js: v5.13.0 or higher PHP: v9.5.0.252 or higher Python: v5.2.0.127 or higher Ruby: v6.7.0.359 or higher Caution If Transaction event reporting is disabled, this can affect some UI elements throughout New Relic. You may see some empty charts on some UI pages that rely on this data. Query real time streaming data When building charts, include the following in your NRQL query: NRQL clause Comments SINCE 5 minutes ago Be sure to add a SINCE 5 minutes ago clause to your NRQL query in order to take advantage of the 5 second chart refresh interval. This is because the chart's refresh interval is based on the time window. TIMESERIES bucket To set the refresh interval for time series charts, you can also specify the bucket size as an optional argument to the TIMESERIES clause. For example, SINCE 30 minutes ago TIMESERIES 5 seconds will display a 30 minute window at a 5 second resolution. You can have a maximum of 366 buckets. Create real time streaming charts You can visualize the results of your NRQL query in New Relic One: Go to one.newrelic.com, and at the top of the page, select Query your data. Use the data explorer to start building a chart. Select the advanced (NRQL) mode to refine your query. In your NRQL query, adjust the SINCE and TIMESERIES clauses to take advantage of the 5 second refresh intervals.",

Requirements Requirements include: Android 8.0 (Oreo) or higher Screen size of 7 inches or less Install New Relic's mobile app You can install the New Relic Android app from the Google Play Store or learn more from the New Relic website.

See below for details on how to use specific features of the app: New Relic product details The New Relic Android app includes data about these features: APM metrics, both real-time and historical data, including health maps. Select the transaction icon to see detailed transaction metrics, or an Overview chart to view summary charts of your top five transactions. Select the icon to filter by labels and categories. Browser monitoring metrics, including average page load time, Apdex, average throughput, and more. Infrastructure monitoring. Mobile monitoring, including crash reports, network errors, API calls, and active user count. Event notifications, including mobile alerts wherever you are, plus deployment notifications and notes. New Relic's Android app does not have the full feature set of the New Relic web interface. For more detailed analysis, sign in to your New Relic account with a web browser. Synthetics data You can use the Android app to view your synthetic monitoring data, including charts of your monitor's availability, load times, and load sizes. To view more detailed charts, select the caret icon. You can mute or disable your monitor, and view details of any recent errors. For scripted monitors, you can view and search the script log. Alerts When you log in to your New Relic account from the Android app, your device is automatically associated with your user channel. Then, you can add your user channel to your target policy to receive alerts. For Android alerts, notifications appear on your lock screen. To view them, tap the alert event. You can select any alert to view error details or acknowledge the alert. New Relic also sends a push notification when a colleague acknowledges an open event. Then, New Relic sends a final, closing notification when all Critical events end.

Mobile monitoring includes network errors, API calls, and number of active users. You can also view detailed individual crash reports for a deeper understanding of a particular crash incident. Details on setting time range When viewing an application or host, you can change the visible time frame with the time picker. To move back and forth across the timeline, scrub the New Relic charts. To change the duration of the visible time slice, select the clock icon. To specify an end time other than now, slide the toggle from Ending Now to Custom Date. To save your changes and refresh the chart data, select the clock icon again.
