Usually used after manually ending a transaction with newrelic_end_transaction(), for example when separating tasks in a job queue manager. When instrumenting this new transaction, the agent performs the same operations as when the script first started. Parameters Parameter Description $appname string Required.

Requirements Agent version 3.0.5.95 or higher. Description Start a new transaction manually. Usually used after manually ending a transaction with newrelic_end_transaction(), for example when separating tasks in a job queue manager. When instrumenting this new transaction, the agent performs the same operations as when the script first started. Parameters Parameter Description $appname string Required. The application name to associate with data from this transaction. Uses the same format as newrelic.appname and can set multiple application names by separating each with a semicolon ;. While this option is required, you can read the app name from newrelic.ini with ini_get(\"newrelic.appname\"). $license string Optional. Defaults to the license key set in the New Relic agent's newrelic.ini file. Provide a different license key if you want the transaction to report to a different New Relic account. If set, this license will supersede all per-directory and global default licenses configured in INI files. Return values This function will return true if the transaction was successfully started. Examples Stop a transaction, then start another For task queue managers, you can use newrelic_end_transaction() and newrelic_start_transaction() together to manually separate transactions. This example uses ini_get to read the application name from the config file. function example() { ... // queuing logic if (extension_loaded('newrelic')) { // Ensure PHP agent is available newrelic_end_transaction(); // stop recording the current transaction newrelic_start_transaction(ini_get(\"newrelic.appname\")); // start recording a new transaction } ... // more queuing logic } Copy Start a new transaction with a new license key This example manually specifies the app name and the license key: function example() { if (extension_loaded('newrelic')) { // Ensure PHP agent is available newrelic_start_transaction(\"App1\", \"01234567890abcde01234567890abcde01234567890\"); } ... } Copy",

Analyze business data Use the PHP agent to organize, query, and visualize your data to answer key questions about application performance and customer experience. Use default transaction attributes or add your own Query your data using NRQL Send your own event data Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards Architecture The PHP agent has two binaries that work together to forward data to New Relic: The agent handles automatic and API instrumentation of your PHP code. The daemon acts as a proxy between the agent and the New Relic platform. You can connect up to 500 applications/agents to one daemon. The daemon imposes sampling when the harvest cycle limits are reached, so consider this when deciding how many applications/agents to connect to a single daemon. Tip The number of applications/agents per daemon may be lower when running in separate Docker containers, depending on the capacity of the connection between containers. The flow of data from your PHP applications to New Relic. The workflow between your application and New Relic must occur in this order: The agent establishes a socket connection with the daemon by sending the first payload of instrumentation data. The daemon establishes an HTTPS link with the New Relic platform. The daemon must be invoked before your instrumented application is invoked. This is called agent mode and is the default. To avoid losing reported data, make sure your instrumented application doesn't send transactions before both connections are established. Install the agent Before you install the PHP agent, ensure your system meets the system requirements. The PHP agent supports many of the most common PHP frameworks, databases, and libraries. You can also use the agent in a Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment. Tip If you are installing the agent on a shared hosting service, ensure you have root permissions to install the agent or contact your hosting provider for technical assistance. To install the agent, sign up for New Relic first. Once logged in, use our launcher, or see the instructions for specific installations. Add PHP data For standard installations, see: PHP agent installation overview (the basic installation steps for the most common setups). Installing on RedHat or CentOS Installing on Ubuntu or Debian Installing with tar archive (generic method to use on any supported systems such as Linux variants, OpenSolaris, SmartOS, FreeBSD, macOS, etc) The newrelic-install script (how to use the interactive script that automates some installation tasks) For other types of PHP installations and advanced installation topics, see: PHP agent installation: Non-standard PHP Starting the PHP daemon (a standard New Relic installation starts the daemon automatically, but you can also start the daemon manually) Silent mode for the install script Google App Engine (GAE) flex environment installation for New Relic's PHP agent Configure the agent The agent includes a variety of configuration options to further customize and fine-tune your installation. Tip The most important part of agent configuration is to give your app a descriptive name. New Relic uses this app name to aggregate metrics when you have multiple apps or hosts. After changing any agent configuration options, restart your web server. Extend agent instrumentation After installing the agent, go further and extend the agent's instrumentation: Page load timing: Integrate the PHP agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user activity. Custom instrumentation: Instrument transactions not captured as part of our framework instrumentation. Agent API: Use the agent API to customize the agent's behavior. For example, you can collect custom metrics, flag an error, or ignore a particular transaction entirely. Agent attributes: Customize the attributes attached to transactions. Customizing attributes allows you to avoid sending sensitive attributes, or to collect additional attributes for deeper visibility into your transactions. Troubleshoot your installation If you encounter issues with the PHP agent, see our full list of troubleshooting documentation. Common installation issues include: No data appears (PHP) Determining permissions requirements INI settings not taking effect immediately Why and when to restart your web server (PHP)",

Please contact http://support.newrelic.com and report the above error. We have also created a tar file with log files and other system info that can help solve the problem.

This is true for the newrelic-install script and for manual installations. Caution This is not an endorsement for disabling SIP in general. Be sure to verify that this does not violate the security policies of your organization. Follow this general procedure: Boot into recovery mode. Disable SIP and reboot. Install the New Relic PHP agent. Boot into recovery mode. Re-enable SIP and reboot. There are many articles available on the web that describe SIP and the steps for disabling, re-enabling, and checking the status. Cause PHP agent installation requires the daemon program to be installed in /usr/bin and the extension module in /usr/lib. However, those directories have R-X permissions, which means the daemon cannot be installed by normal means. Apple's System Integrity Protection, SIP, prevents the modification of permissions on these directories even when logged in as root, admin, or via a sudo privileged account. This also applies in situations where the PHP bin is self-contained (for example, MAMP).",

      "body": "Logs in context for the PHP agent connects your logs and APM data in New Relic. Bringing all of this data together in a single tool helps you quickly get to the root cause of an issue and find the log lines that you need to identify and resolve a problem. Set up your PHP app To enable logs in context for APM apps monitored by PHP: Make sure you have already set up logging in New Relic. This includes configuring a supported log forwarder that collects your application logs and extends the metadata that is forwarded to New Relic. Install or update to the latest PHP agent version, and enable distributed tracing. Use PHP agent version 9.13.0.270 or higher for logs in context. Install Monolog version 1 or 2, or use a compatible log forwarding plugin if you are not using the built-in Monolog Handler for New Relic. Configure logs in context for PHP using the Monolog extension, if used. PHP configuration with Monolog You must install the Monolog log enricher package before you can configure Monolog for New Relic logs in context. This is done by using Composer to install the newrelic/monolog-enricher package. In most cases, use the Processor and Handler classes provided by the log enricher package in conjunction with Monolog's built-in BufferHandler. The Processor adds the contextual metadata required for New Relic logs in context to operate. The Handler sends the log records to New Relic Logs. The BufferHandler ensures that the logs are delivered with as little overhead as possible. At the point where you create the Monolog\\Logger object, add the following pushProcessor and pushHandler calls to add the Processor and Handler: <?php use Monolog\\Handler\\BufferHandler; use Monolog\\Logger; use NewRelic\\Monolog\\Enricher\\{Handler, Processor}; $log = new Logger('log'); $log->pushProcessor(new Processor); $log->pushHandler(new BufferHandler(new Handler)); Copy Tip You can use the Processor and Handler in conjunction with any existing Monolog setup. You do not need to remove your existing processors and handlers. PHP configuration with other log forwarders If you use Monolog to send logs to a compatible log forwarder, and if you have already configured that tool to send logs to New Relic, you can use the Processor and Formatter solely for that tool. This option prevents additional overhead of sending logs directly to New Relic with the Handler. You will need to be using a handler that supports the setFormatter() method, and your logging tool must be able to ingest JSON logs. Here's an example of configuring Monolog to handle other log forwarders: <?php use Monolog\\Handler\\StreamHandler; use Monolog\\Logger; use NewRelic\\Monolog\\Enricher\\{Formatter, Processor}; $log = new Logger('log'); $log->pushProcessor(new Processor); $handler = new StreamHandler('php://stderr'); $handler->setFormatter(new Formatter); $log->pushHandler($handler); Copy To verify that you have configured the log appender correctly, run your application, then check your logs data in New Relic One using the query operator has:span.id has:trace.id. If everything is configured correctly and your data is being forwarded to New Relic with the enriched metadata, your logs should now be emitted as JSON and contain trace.id and span.id fields. If you don't see log data in the UI, follow the troubleshooting procedures. If the logs from your application do not include fields like trace.id and span.id, there may be a problem with the configuration of the Monolog log enricher. In this situation: Check that the PHP agent for your app has been installed and is configured to enable distributed tracing. Check that your application is using the Monolog logger object when sending log records, not syslog(). Check that another Monolog handler is not preventing the log record from bubbling. What's next? After you set up APM logs in context, make the most of your logging data: Explore the logging data across your platform with our Logs UI. View your logs in context data in distributed tracing. Note that for PHP, logs in context data doesn't appear in the Logs tab of the APM UI. Get deeper visibility into both your application and your platform performance data by forwarding your logs with our infrastructure monitoring agent. Review your infrastructure logs in the UI. Set up alerts. Query your data and create dashboards.",

There are many articles available on the web that describe SIP and the steps for disabling, re-enabling, and checking the status. Cause PHP agent installation requires the daemon program to be installed in /usr/bin and the extension module in /usr/lib. However, those directories have R-X permissions, which means the daemon cannot be installed by normal means. Apple's System Integrity Protection, SIP, prevents the modification of permissions on these directories even when logged in as root, admin, or via a sudo privileged account. This also applies in situations where the PHP bin is self-contained (for example, MAMP).",

Bringing all of this data together in a single tool helps you quickly get to the root cause of an issue and find the log lines that you need to identify and resolve a problem. Set up your PHP app To enable logs in context for APM apps monitored by PHP: Make sure you have already set up logging in New Relic. This includes configuring a supported log forwarder that collects your application logs and extends the metadata that is forwarded to New Relic. Install or update to the latest PHP agent version, and enable distributed tracing. Use PHP agent version 9.13.0.270 or higher for logs in context. Install Monolog version 1 or 2, or use a compatible log forwarding plugin if you are not using the built-in Monolog Handler for New Relic. Configure logs in context for PHP using the Monolog extension, if used. PHP configuration with Monolog You must install the Monolog log enricher package before you can configure Monolog for New Relic logs in context. This is done by using Composer to install the newrelic/monolog-enricher package. In most cases, use the Processor and Handler classes provided by the log enricher package in conjunction with Monolog's built-in BufferHandler. The Processor adds the contextual metadata required for New Relic logs in context to operate. The Handler sends the log records to New Relic Logs. The BufferHandler ensures that the logs are delivered with as little overhead as possible. At the point where you create the Monolog\\Logger object, add the following pushProcessor and pushHandler calls to add the Processor and Handler: <?php use Monolog\\Handler\\BufferHandler; use Monolog\\Logger; use NewRelic\\Monolog\\Enricher\\{Handler, Processor}; $log = new Logger('log'); $log->pushProcessor(new Processor); $log->pushHandler(new BufferHandler(new Handler)); Copy Tip You can use the Processor and Handler in conjunction with any existing Monolog setup. You do not need to remove your existing processors and handlers. PHP configuration with other log forwarders If you use Monolog to send logs to a compatible log forwarder, and if you have already configured that tool to send logs to New Relic, you can use the Processor and Formatter solely for that tool. This option prevents additional overhead of sending logs directly to New Relic with the Handler. You will need to be using a handler that supports the setFormatter() method, and your logging tool must be able to ingest JSON logs. Here's an example of configuring Monolog to handle other log forwarders: <?php use Monolog\\Handler\\StreamHandler; use Monolog\\Logger; use NewRelic\\Monolog\\Enricher\\{Formatter, Processor}; $log = new Logger('log'); $log->pushProcessor(new Processor); $handler = new StreamHandler('php://stderr'); $handler->setFormatter(new Formatter); $log->pushHandler($handler); Copy To verify that you have configured the log appender correctly, run your application, then check your logs data in New Relic One using the query operator has:span.id has:trace.id. If everything is configured correctly and your data is being forwarded to New Relic with the enriched metadata, your logs should now be emitted as JSON and contain trace.id and span.id fields. If you don't see log data in the UI, follow the troubleshooting procedures. If the logs from your application do not include fields like trace.id and span.id, there may be a problem with the configuration of the Monolog log enricher. In this situation: Check that the PHP agent for your app has been installed and is configured to enable distributed tracing. Check that your application is using the Monolog logger object when sending log records, not syslog(). Check that another Monolog handler is not preventing the log record from bubbling. What's next? After you set up APM logs in context, make the most of your logging data: Explore the logging data across your platform with our Logs UI. View your logs in context data in distributed tracing. Note that for PHP, logs in context data doesn't appear in the Logs tab of the APM UI.

Analyze business data Use the PHP agent to organize, query, and visualize your data to answer key questions about application performance and customer experience. Use default transaction attributes or add your own Query your data using NRQL Send your own event data Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards Architecture The PHP agent has two binaries that work together to forward data to New Relic: The agent handles automatic and API instrumentation of your PHP code. The daemon acts as a proxy between the agent and the New Relic platform. You can connect up to 500 applications/agents to one daemon. The daemon imposes sampling when the harvest cycle limits are reached, so consider this when deciding how many applications/agents to connect to a single daemon. Tip The number of applications/agents per daemon may be lower when running in separate Docker containers, depending on the capacity of the connection between containers. The flow of data from your PHP applications to New Relic. The workflow between your application and New Relic must occur in this order: The agent establishes a socket connection with the daemon by sending the first payload of instrumentation data. The daemon establishes an HTTPS link with the New Relic platform. The daemon must be invoked before your instrumented application is invoked. This is called agent mode and is the default. To avoid losing reported data, make sure your instrumented application doesn't send transactions before both connections are established. Install the agent Before you install the PHP agent, ensure your system meets the system requirements. The PHP agent supports many of the most common PHP frameworks, databases, and libraries. You can also use the agent in a Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment. Tip If you are installing the agent on a shared hosting service, ensure you have root permissions to install the agent or contact your hosting provider for technical assistance. To install the agent, sign up for New Relic first. Once logged in, use our launcher, or see the instructions for specific installations. Add PHP data For standard installations, see: PHP agent installation overview (the basic installation steps for the most common setups). Installing on RedHat or CentOS Installing on Ubuntu or Debian Installing with tar archive (generic method to use on any supported systems such as Linux variants, OpenSolaris, SmartOS, FreeBSD, macOS, etc) The newrelic-install script (how to use the interactive script that automates some installation tasks) For other types of PHP installations and advanced installation topics, see: PHP agent installation: Non-standard PHP Starting the PHP daemon (a standard New Relic installation starts the daemon automatically, but you can also start the daemon manually) Silent mode for the install script Google App Engine (GAE) flex environment installation for New Relic's PHP agent Configure the agent The agent includes a variety of configuration options to further customize and fine-tune your installation. Tip The most important part of agent configuration is to give your app a descriptive name. New Relic uses this app name to aggregate metrics when you have multiple apps or hosts. After changing any agent configuration options, restart your web server. Extend agent instrumentation After installing the agent, go further and extend the agent's instrumentation: Page load timing: Integrate the PHP agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user activity. Custom instrumentation: Instrument transactions not captured as part of our framework instrumentation. Agent API: Use the agent API to customize the agent's behavior. For example, you can collect custom metrics, flag an error, or ignore a particular transaction entirely. Agent attributes: Customize the attributes attached to transactions. Customizing attributes allows you to avoid sending sensitive attributes, or to collect additional attributes for deeper visibility into your transactions. Troubleshoot your installation If you encounter issues with the PHP agent, see our full list of troubleshooting documentation. Common installation issues include: No data appears (PHP) Determining permissions requirements INI settings not taking effect immediately Why and when to restart your web server (PHP)",

Analyze business data Use the PHP agent to organize, query, and visualize your data to answer key questions about application performance and customer experience. Use default transaction attributes or add your own Query your data using NRQL Send your own event data Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards Architecture The PHP agent has two binaries that work together to forward data to New Relic: The agent handles automatic and API instrumentation of your PHP code. The daemon acts as a proxy between the agent and the New Relic platform. You can connect up to 500 applications/agents to one daemon. The daemon imposes sampling when the harvest cycle limits are reached, so consider this when deciding how many applications/agents to connect to a single daemon. Tip The number of applications/agents per daemon may be lower when running in separate Docker containers, depending on the capacity of the connection between containers. The flow of data from your PHP applications to New Relic. The workflow between your application and New Relic must occur in this order: The agent establishes a socket connection with the daemon by sending the first payload of instrumentation data. The daemon establishes an HTTPS link with the New Relic platform. The daemon must be invoked before your instrumented application is invoked. This is called agent mode and is the default. To avoid losing reported data, make sure your instrumented application doesn't send transactions before both connections are established. Install the agent Before you install the PHP agent, ensure your system meets the system requirements. The PHP agent supports many of the most common PHP frameworks, databases, and libraries. You can also use the agent in a Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment. Tip If you are installing the agent on a shared hosting service, ensure you have root permissions to install the agent or contact your hosting provider for technical assistance. To install the agent, sign up for New Relic first. Once logged in, use our launcher, or see the instructions for specific installations. Add PHP data For standard installations, see: PHP agent installation overview (the basic installation steps for the most common setups). Installing on RedHat or CentOS Installing on Ubuntu or Debian Installing with tar archive (generic method to use on any supported systems such as Linux variants, OpenSolaris, SmartOS, FreeBSD, macOS, etc) The newrelic-install script (how to use the interactive script that automates some installation tasks) For other types of PHP installations and advanced installation topics, see: PHP agent installation: Non-standard PHP Starting the PHP daemon (a standard New Relic installation starts the daemon automatically, but you can also start the daemon manually) Silent mode for the install script Google App Engine (GAE) flex environment installation for New Relic's PHP agent Configure the agent The agent includes a variety of configuration options to further customize and fine-tune your installation. Tip The most important part of agent configuration is to give your app a descriptive name. New Relic uses this app name to aggregate metrics when you have multiple apps or hosts. After changing any agent configuration options, restart your web server. Extend agent instrumentation After installing the agent, go further and extend the agent's instrumentation: Page load timing: Integrate the PHP agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user activity. Custom instrumentation: Instrument transactions not captured as part of our framework instrumentation. Agent API: Use the agent API to customize the agent's behavior. For example, you can collect custom metrics, flag an error, or ignore a particular transaction entirely. Agent attributes: Customize the attributes attached to transactions. Customizing attributes allows you to avoid sending sensitive attributes, or to collect additional attributes for deeper visibility into your transactions. Troubleshoot your installation If you encounter issues with the PHP agent, see our full list of troubleshooting documentation. Common installation issues include: No data appears (PHP) Determining permissions requirements INI settings not taking effect immediately Why and when to restart your web server (PHP)",

Be sure to verify that this does not violate the security policies of your organization. Follow this general procedure: Boot into recovery mode. Disable SIP and reboot. Install the New Relic PHP agent. Boot into recovery mode. Re-enable SIP and reboot. There are many articles available on the web that describe SIP and the steps for disabling, re-enabling, and checking the status. Cause PHP agent installation requires the daemon program to be installed in /usr/bin and the extension module in /usr/lib. However, those directories have R-X permissions, which means the daemon cannot be installed by normal means. Apple's System Integrity Protection, SIP, prevents the modification of permissions on these directories even when logged in as root, admin, or via a sudo privileged account. This also applies in situations where the PHP bin is self-contained (for example, MAMP).",

      "body": "Logs in context for the PHP agent connects your logs and APM data in New Relic. Bringing all of this data together in a single tool helps you quickly get to the root cause of an issue and find the log lines that you need to identify and resolve a problem. Set up your PHP app To enable logs in context for APM apps monitored by PHP: Make sure you have already set up logging in New Relic. This includes configuring a supported log forwarder that collects your application logs and extends the metadata that is forwarded to New Relic. Install or update to the latest PHP agent version, and enable distributed tracing. Use PHP agent version 9.13.0.270 or higher for logs in context. Install Monolog version 1 or 2, or use a compatible log forwarding plugin if you are not using the built-in Monolog Handler for New Relic. Configure logs in context for PHP using the Monolog extension, if used. PHP configuration with Monolog You must install the Monolog log enricher package before you can configure Monolog for New Relic logs in context. This is done by using Composer to install the newrelic/monolog-enricher package. In most cases, use the Processor and Handler classes provided by the log enricher package in conjunction with Monolog's built-in BufferHandler. The Processor adds the contextual metadata required for New Relic logs in context to operate. The Handler sends the log records to New Relic Logs. The BufferHandler ensures that the logs are delivered with as little overhead as possible. At the point where you create the Monolog\\Logger object, add the following pushProcessor and pushHandler calls to add the Processor and Handler: <?php use Monolog\\Handler\\BufferHandler; use Monolog\\Logger; use NewRelic\\Monolog\\Enricher\\{Handler, Processor}; $log = new Logger('log'); $log->pushProcessor(new Processor); $log->pushHandler(new BufferHandler(new Handler)); Copy Tip You can use the Processor and Handler in conjunction with any existing Monolog setup. You do not need to remove your existing processors and handlers. PHP configuration with other log forwarders If you use Monolog to send logs to a compatible log forwarder, and if you have already configured that tool to send logs to New Relic, you can use the Processor and Formatter solely for that tool. This option prevents additional overhead of sending logs directly to New Relic with the Handler. You will need to be using a handler that supports the setFormatter() method, and your logging tool must be able to ingest JSON logs. Here's an example of configuring Monolog to handle other log forwarders: <?php use Monolog\\Handler\\StreamHandler; use Monolog\\Logger; use NewRelic\\Monolog\\Enricher\\{Formatter, Processor}; $log = new Logger('log'); $log->pushProcessor(new Processor); $handler = new StreamHandler('php://stderr'); $handler->setFormatter(new Formatter); $log->pushHandler($handler); Copy To verify that you have configured the log appender correctly, run your application, then check your logs data in New Relic One using the query operator has:span.id has:trace.id. If everything is configured correctly and your data is being forwarded to New Relic with the enriched metadata, your logs should now be emitted as JSON and contain trace.id and span.id fields. If you don't see log data in the UI, follow the troubleshooting procedures. If the logs from your application do not include fields like trace.id and span.id, there may be a problem with the configuration of the Monolog log enricher. In this situation: Check that the PHP agent for your app has been installed and is configured to enable distributed tracing. Check that your application is using the Monolog logger object when sending log records, not syslog(). Check that another Monolog handler is not preventing the log record from bubbling. What's next? After you set up APM logs in context, make the most of your logging data: Explore the logging data across your platform with our Logs UI. View your logs in context data in distributed tracing. Note that for PHP, logs in context data doesn't appear in the Logs tab of the APM UI. Get deeper visibility into both your application and your platform performance data by forwarding your logs with our infrastructure monitoring agent. Review your infrastructure logs in the UI. Set up alerts. Query your data and create dashboards.",

Cause PHP agent installation requires the daemon program to be installed in /usr/bin and the extension module in /usr/lib. However, those directories have R-X permissions, which means the daemon cannot be installed by normal means. Apple's System Integrity Protection, SIP, prevents the modification of permissions on these directories even when logged in as root, admin, or via a sudo privileged account. This also applies in situations where the PHP bin is self-contained (for example, MAMP).",

      "body": "Logs in context for the PHP agent connects your logs and APM data in New Relic. Bringing all of this data together in a single tool helps you quickly get to the root cause of an issue and find the log lines that you need to identify and resolve a problem. Set up your PHP app To enable logs in context for APM apps monitored by PHP: Make sure you have already set up logging in New Relic. This includes configuring a supported log forwarder that collects your application logs and extends the metadata that is forwarded to New Relic. Install or update to the latest PHP agent version, and enable distributed tracing. Use PHP agent version 9.13.0.270 or higher for logs in context. Install Monolog version 1 or 2, or use a compatible log forwarding plugin if you are not using the built-in Monolog Handler for New Relic. Configure logs in context for PHP using the Monolog extension, if used. PHP configuration with Monolog You must install the Monolog log enricher package before you can configure Monolog for New Relic logs in context. This is done by using Composer to install the newrelic/monolog-enricher package. In most cases, use the Processor and Handler classes provided by the log enricher package in conjunction with Monolog's built-in BufferHandler. The Processor adds the contextual metadata required for New Relic logs in context to operate. The Handler sends the log records to New Relic Logs. The BufferHandler ensures that the logs are delivered with as little overhead as possible. At the point where you create the Monolog\\Logger object, add the following pushProcessor and pushHandler calls to add the Processor and Handler: <?php use Monolog\\Handler\\BufferHandler; use Monolog\\Logger; use NewRelic\\Monolog\\Enricher\\{Handler, Processor}; $log = new Logger('log'); $log->pushProcessor(new Processor); $log->pushHandler(new BufferHandler(new Handler)); Copy Tip You can use the Processor and Handler in conjunction with any existing Monolog setup. You do not need to remove your existing processors and handlers. PHP configuration with other log forwarders If you use Monolog to send logs to a compatible log forwarder, and if you have already configured that tool to send logs to New Relic, you can use the Processor and Formatter solely for that tool. This option prevents additional overhead of sending logs directly to New Relic with the Handler. You will need to be using a handler that supports the setFormatter() method, and your logging tool must be able to ingest JSON logs. Here's an example of configuring Monolog to handle other log forwarders: <?php use Monolog\\Handler\\StreamHandler; use Monolog\\Logger; use NewRelic\\Monolog\\Enricher\\{Formatter, Processor}; $log = new Logger('log'); $log->pushProcessor(new Processor); $handler = new StreamHandler('php://stderr'); $handler->setFormatter(new Formatter); $log->pushHandler($handler); Copy To verify that you have configured the log appender correctly, run your application, then check your logs data in New Relic One using the query operator has:span.id has:trace.id. If everything is configured correctly and your data is being forwarded to New Relic with the enriched metadata, your logs should now be emitted as JSON and contain trace.id and span.id fields. If you don't see log data in the UI, follow the troubleshooting procedures. If the logs from your application do not include fields like trace.id and span.id, there may be a problem with the configuration of the Monolog log enricher. In this situation: Check that the PHP agent for your app has been installed and is configured to enable distributed tracing. Check that your application is using the Monolog logger object when sending log records, not syslog(). Check that another Monolog handler is not preventing the log record from bubbling. What's next? After you set up APM logs in context, make the most of your logging data: Explore the logging data across your platform with our Logs UI. View your logs in context data in distributed tracing. Note that for PHP, logs in context data doesn't appear in the Logs tab of the APM UI. Get deeper visibility into both your application and your platform performance data by forwarding your logs with our infrastructure monitoring agent. Review your infrastructure logs in the UI. Set up alerts. Query your data and create dashboards.",

Analyze business data Use the PHP agent to organize, query, and visualize your data to answer key questions about application performance and customer experience. Use default transaction attributes or add your own Query your data using NRQL Send your own event data Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards Architecture The PHP agent has two binaries that work together to forward data to New Relic: The agent handles automatic and API instrumentation of your PHP code. The daemon acts as a proxy between the agent and the New Relic platform. You can connect up to 500 applications/agents to one daemon. The daemon imposes sampling when the harvest cycle limits are reached, so consider this when deciding how many applications/agents to connect to a single daemon. Tip The number of applications/agents per daemon may be lower when running in separate Docker containers, depending on the capacity of the connection between containers. The flow of data from your PHP applications to New Relic. The workflow between your application and New Relic must occur in this order: The agent establishes a socket connection with the daemon by sending the first payload of instrumentation data. The daemon establishes an HTTPS link with the New Relic platform. The daemon must be invoked before your instrumented application is invoked. This is called agent mode and is the default. To avoid losing reported data, make sure your instrumented application doesn't send transactions before both connections are established. Install the agent Before you install the PHP agent, ensure your system meets the system requirements. The PHP agent supports many of the most common PHP frameworks, databases, and libraries. You can also use the agent in a Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment. Tip If you are installing the agent on a shared hosting service, ensure you have root permissions to install the agent or contact your hosting provider for technical assistance. To install the agent, sign up for New Relic first. Once logged in, use our launcher, or see the instructions for specific installations. Add PHP data For standard installations, see: PHP agent installation overview (the basic installation steps for the most common setups). Installing on RedHat or CentOS Installing on Ubuntu or Debian Installing with tar archive (generic method to use on any supported systems such as Linux variants, OpenSolaris, SmartOS, FreeBSD, macOS, etc) The newrelic-install script (how to use the interactive script that automates some installation tasks) For other types of PHP installations and advanced installation topics, see: PHP agent installation: Non-standard PHP Starting the PHP daemon (a standard New Relic installation starts the daemon automatically, but you can also start the daemon manually) Silent mode for the install script Google App Engine (GAE) flex environment installation for New Relic's PHP agent Configure the agent The agent includes a variety of configuration options to further customize and fine-tune your installation. Tip The most important part of agent configuration is to give your app a descriptive name. New Relic uses this app name to aggregate metrics when you have multiple apps or hosts. After changing any agent configuration options, restart your web server. Extend agent instrumentation After installing the agent, go further and extend the agent's instrumentation: Page load timing: Integrate the PHP agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user activity. Custom instrumentation: Instrument transactions not captured as part of our framework instrumentation. Agent API: Use the agent API to customize the agent's behavior. For example, you can collect custom metrics, flag an error, or ignore a particular transaction entirely. Agent attributes: Customize the attributes attached to transactions. Customizing attributes allows you to avoid sending sensitive attributes, or to collect additional attributes for deeper visibility into your transactions. Troubleshoot your installation If you encounter issues with the PHP agent, see our full list of troubleshooting documentation. Common installation issues include: No data appears (PHP) Determining permissions requirements INI settings not taking effect immediately Why and when to restart your web server (PHP)",

This is true for the newrelic-install script and for manual installations. Caution This is not an endorsement for disabling SIP in general. Be sure to verify that this does not violate the security policies of your organization. Follow this general procedure: Boot into recovery mode. Disable SIP and reboot.

Analyze business data Use the PHP agent to organize, query, and visualize your data to answer key questions about application performance and customer experience. Use default transaction attributes or add your own Query your data using NRQL Send your own event data Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards Architecture The PHP agent has two binaries that work together to forward data to New Relic: The agent handles automatic and API instrumentation of your PHP code. The daemon acts as a proxy between the agent and the New Relic platform. You can connect up to 500 applications/agents to one daemon. The daemon imposes sampling when the harvest cycle limits are reached, so consider this when deciding how many applications/agents to connect to a single daemon. Tip The number of applications/agents per daemon may be lower when running in separate Docker containers, depending on the capacity of the connection between containers. The flow of data from your PHP applications to New Relic. The workflow between your application and New Relic must occur in this order: The agent establishes a socket connection with the daemon by sending the first payload of instrumentation data. The daemon establishes an HTTPS link with the New Relic platform. The daemon must be invoked before your instrumented application is invoked. This is called agent mode and is the default. To avoid losing reported data, make sure your instrumented application doesn't send transactions before both connections are established. Install the agent Before you install the PHP agent, ensure your system meets the system requirements. The PHP agent supports many of the most common PHP frameworks, databases, and libraries. You can also use the agent in a Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment. Tip If you are installing the agent on a shared hosting service, ensure you have root permissions to install the agent or contact your hosting provider for technical assistance. To install the agent, sign up for New Relic first. Once logged in, use our launcher, or see the instructions for specific installations. Add PHP data For standard installations, see: PHP agent installation overview (the basic installation steps for the most common setups). Installing on RedHat or CentOS Installing on Ubuntu or Debian Installing with tar archive (generic method to use on any supported systems such as Linux variants, OpenSolaris, SmartOS, FreeBSD, macOS, etc) The newrelic-install script (how to use the interactive script that automates some installation tasks) For other types of PHP installations and advanced installation topics, see: PHP agent installation: Non-standard PHP Starting the PHP daemon (a standard New Relic installation starts the daemon automatically, but you can also start the daemon manually) Silent mode for the install script Google App Engine (GAE) flex environment installation for New Relic's PHP agent Configure the agent The agent includes a variety of configuration options to further customize and fine-tune your installation. Tip The most important part of agent configuration is to give your app a descriptive name. New Relic uses this app name to aggregate metrics when you have multiple apps or hosts. After changing any agent configuration options, restart your web server. Extend agent instrumentation After installing the agent, go further and extend the agent's instrumentation: Page load timing: Integrate the PHP agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user activity. Custom instrumentation: Instrument transactions not captured as part of our framework instrumentation. Agent API: Use the agent API to customize the agent's behavior. For example, you can collect custom metrics, flag an error, or ignore a particular transaction entirely. Agent attributes: Customize the attributes attached to transactions. Customizing attributes allows you to avoid sending sensitive attributes, or to collect additional attributes for deeper visibility into your transactions. Troubleshoot your installation If you encounter issues with the PHP agent, see our full list of troubleshooting documentation. Common installation issues include: No data appears (PHP) Determining permissions requirements INI settings not taking effect immediately Why and when to restart your web server (PHP)",

      "body": "Logs in context for the PHP agent connects your logs and APM data in New Relic. Bringing all of this data together in a single tool helps you quickly get to the root cause of an issue and find the log lines that you need to identify and resolve a problem. Set up your PHP app To enable logs in context for APM apps monitored by PHP: Make sure you have already set up logging in New Relic. This includes configuring a supported log forwarder that collects your application logs and extends the metadata that is forwarded to New Relic. Install or update to the latest PHP agent version, and enable distributed tracing. Use PHP agent version 9.13.0.270 or higher for logs in context. Install Monolog version 1 or 2, or use a compatible log forwarding plugin if you are not using the built-in Monolog Handler for New Relic. Configure logs in context for PHP using the Monolog extension, if used. PHP configuration with Monolog You must install the Monolog log enricher package before you can configure Monolog for New Relic logs in context. This is done by using Composer to install the newrelic/monolog-enricher package. In most cases, use the Processor and Handler classes provided by the log enricher package in conjunction with Monolog's built-in BufferHandler. The Processor adds the contextual metadata required for New Relic logs in context to operate. The Handler sends the log records to New Relic Logs. The BufferHandler ensures that the logs are delivered with as little overhead as possible. At the point where you create the Monolog\\Logger object, add the following pushProcessor and pushHandler calls to add the Processor and Handler: <?php use Monolog\\Handler\\BufferHandler; use Monolog\\Logger; use NewRelic\\Monolog\\Enricher\\{Handler, Processor}; $log = new Logger('log'); $log->pushProcessor(new Processor); $log->pushHandler(new BufferHandler(new Handler)); Copy Tip You can use the Processor and Handler in conjunction with any existing Monolog setup. You do not need to remove your existing processors and handlers. PHP configuration with other log forwarders If you use Monolog to send logs to a compatible log forwarder, and if you have already configured that tool to send logs to New Relic, you can use the Processor and Formatter solely for that tool. This option prevents additional overhead of sending logs directly to New Relic with the Handler. You will need to be using a handler that supports the setFormatter() method, and your logging tool must be able to ingest JSON logs. Here's an example of configuring Monolog to handle other log forwarders: <?php use Monolog\\Handler\\StreamHandler; use Monolog\\Logger; use NewRelic\\Monolog\\Enricher\\{Formatter, Processor}; $log = new Logger('log'); $log->pushProcessor(new Processor); $handler = new StreamHandler('php://stderr'); $handler->setFormatter(new Formatter); $log->pushHandler($handler); Copy To verify that you have configured the log appender correctly, run your application, then check your logs data in New Relic One using the query operator has:span.id has:trace.id. If everything is configured correctly and your data is being forwarded to New Relic with the enriched metadata, your logs should now be emitted as JSON and contain trace.id and span.id fields. If you don't see log data in the UI, follow the troubleshooting procedures. If the logs from your application do not include fields like trace.id and span.id, there may be a problem with the configuration of the Monolog log enricher. In this situation: Check that the PHP agent for your app has been installed and is configured to enable distributed tracing. Check that your application is using the Monolog logger object when sending log records, not syslog(). Check that another Monolog handler is not preventing the log record from bubbling. What's next? After you set up APM logs in context, make the most of your logging data: Explore the logging data across your platform with our Logs UI. View your logs in context data in distributed tracing. Note that for PHP, logs in context data doesn't appear in the Logs tab of the APM UI. Get deeper visibility into both your application and your platform performance data by forwarding your logs with our infrastructure monitoring agent. Review your infrastructure logs in the UI. Set up alerts. Query your data and create dashboards.",

Bringing all of this data together in a single tool helps you quickly get to the root cause of an issue and find the log lines that you need to identify and resolve a problem. Set up your PHP app To enable logs in context for APM apps monitored by PHP: Make sure you have already set up logging in New Relic. This includes configuring a supported log forwarder that collects your application logs and extends the metadata that is forwarded to New Relic. Install or update to the latest PHP agent version, and enable distributed tracing. Use PHP agent version 9.13.0.270 or higher for logs in context. Install Monolog version 1 or 2, or use a compatible log forwarding plugin if you are not using the built-in Monolog Handler for New Relic. Configure logs in context for PHP using the Monolog extension, if used. PHP configuration with Monolog You must install the Monolog log enricher package before you can configure Monolog for New Relic logs in context. This is done by using Composer to install the newrelic/monolog-enricher package. In most cases, use the Processor and Handler classes provided by the log enricher package in conjunction with Monolog's built-in BufferHandler. The Processor adds the contextual metadata required for New Relic logs in context to operate. The Handler sends the log records to New Relic Logs. The BufferHandler ensures that the logs are delivered with as little overhead as possible. At the point where you create the Monolog\\Logger object, add the following pushProcessor and pushHandler calls to add the Processor and Handler: <?php use Monolog\\Handler\\BufferHandler; use Monolog\\Logger; use NewRelic\\Monolog\\Enricher\\{Handler, Processor}; $log = new Logger('log'); $log->pushProcessor(new Processor); $log->pushHandler(new BufferHandler(new Handler)); Copy Tip You can use the Processor and Handler in conjunction with any existing Monolog setup. You do not need to remove your existing processors and handlers. PHP configuration with other log forwarders If you use Monolog to send logs to a compatible log forwarder, and if you have already configured that tool to send logs to New Relic, you can use the Processor and Formatter solely for that tool. This option prevents additional overhead of sending logs directly to New Relic with the Handler. You will need to be using a handler that supports the setFormatter() method, and your logging tool must be able to ingest JSON logs. Here's an example of configuring Monolog to handle other log forwarders: <?php use Monolog\\Handler\\StreamHandler; use Monolog\\Logger; use NewRelic\\Monolog\\Enricher\\{Formatter, Processor}; $log = new Logger('log'); $log->pushProcessor(new Processor); $handler = new StreamHandler('php://stderr'); $handler->setFormatter(new Formatter); $log->pushHandler($handler); Copy To verify that you have configured the log appender correctly, run your application, then check your logs data in New Relic One using the query operator has:span.id has:trace.id. If everything is configured correctly and your data is being forwarded to New Relic with the enriched metadata, your logs should now be emitted as JSON and contain trace.id and span.id fields. If you don't see log data in the UI, follow the troubleshooting procedures. If the logs from your application do not include fields like trace.id and span.id, there may be a problem with the configuration of the Monolog log enricher. In this situation: Check that the PHP agent for your app has been installed and is configured to enable distributed tracing. Check that your application is using the Monolog logger object when sending log records, not syslog(). Check that another Monolog handler is not preventing the log record from bubbling. What's next? After you set up APM logs in context, make the most of your logging data: Explore the logging data across your platform with our Logs UI. View your logs in context data in distributed tracing. Note that for PHP, logs in context data doesn't appear in the Logs tab of the APM UI. Get deeper visibility into both your application and your platform performance data by forwarding your logs with our infrastructure monitoring agent. Review your infrastructure logs in the UI. Set up alerts. Query your data and create dashboards.",

Use default transaction attributes or add your own Query your data using NRQL Send your own event data Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards Architecture The PHP agent has two binaries that work together to forward data to New Relic: The agent handles automatic and API instrumentation of your PHP code. The daemon acts as a proxy between the agent and the New Relic platform. You can connect up to 500 applications/agents to one daemon. The daemon imposes sampling when the harvest cycle limits are reached, so consider this when deciding how many applications/agents to connect to a single daemon. Tip The number of applications/agents per daemon may be lower when running in separate Docker containers, depending on the capacity of the connection between containers. The flow of data from your PHP applications to New Relic. The workflow between your application and New Relic must occur in this order: The agent establishes a socket connection with the daemon by sending the first payload of instrumentation data. The daemon establishes an HTTPS link with the New Relic platform. The daemon must be invoked before your instrumented application is invoked. This is called agent mode and is the default. To avoid losing reported data, make sure your instrumented application doesn't send transactions before both connections are established. Install the agent Before you install the PHP agent, ensure your system meets the system requirements. The PHP agent supports many of the most common PHP frameworks, databases, and libraries. You can also use the agent in a Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment. Tip If you are installing the agent on a shared hosting service, ensure you have root permissions to install the agent or contact your hosting provider for technical assistance. To install the agent, sign up for New Relic first. Once logged in, use our launcher, or see the instructions for specific installations. Add PHP data For standard installations, see: PHP agent installation overview (the basic installation steps for the most common setups). Installing on RedHat or CentOS Installing on Ubuntu or Debian Installing with tar archive (generic method to use on any supported systems such as Linux variants, OpenSolaris, SmartOS, FreeBSD, macOS, etc) The newrelic-install script (how to use the interactive script that automates some installation tasks) For other types of PHP installations and advanced installation topics, see: PHP agent installation: Non-standard PHP Starting the PHP daemon (a standard New Relic installation starts the daemon automatically, but you can also start the daemon manually) Silent mode for the install script Google App Engine (GAE) flex environment installation for New Relic's PHP agent Configure the agent The agent includes a variety of configuration options to further customize and fine-tune your installation. Tip The most important part of agent configuration is to give your app a descriptive name. New Relic uses this app name to aggregate metrics when you have multiple apps or hosts. After changing any agent configuration options, restart your web server. Extend agent instrumentation After installing the agent, go further and extend the agent's instrumentation: Page load timing: Integrate the PHP agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user activity. Custom instrumentation: Instrument transactions not captured as part of our framework instrumentation. Agent API: Use the agent API to customize the agent's behavior. For example, you can collect custom metrics, flag an error, or ignore a particular transaction entirely. Agent attributes: Customize the attributes attached to transactions. Customizing attributes allows you to avoid sending sensitive attributes, or to collect additional attributes for deeper visibility into your transactions. Troubleshoot your installation If you encounter issues with the PHP agent, see our full list of troubleshooting documentation. Common installation issues include: No data appears (PHP) Determining permissions requirements INI settings not taking effect immediately Why and when to restart your web server (PHP)",

Please contact http://support.newrelic.com and report the above error. We have also created a tar file with log files and other system info that can help solve the problem.

This is true for the newrelic-install script and for manual installations. Caution This is not an endorsement for disabling SIP in general. Be sure to verify that this does not violate the security policies of your organization. Follow this general procedure: Boot into recovery mode. Disable SIP and reboot. Install the New Relic PHP agent. Boot into recovery mode. Re-enable SIP and reboot. There are many articles available on the web that describe SIP and the steps for disabling, re-enabling, and checking the status. Cause PHP agent installation requires the daemon program to be installed in /usr/bin and the extension module in /usr/lib. However, those directories have R-X permissions, which means the daemon cannot be installed by normal means. Apple's System Integrity Protection, SIP, prevents the modification of permissions on these directories even when logged in as root, admin, or via a sudo privileged account. This also applies in situations where the PHP bin is self-contained (for example, MAMP).",

This is true for the newrelic-install script and for manual installations. Caution This is not an endorsement for disabling SIP in general. Be sure to verify that this does not violate the security policies of your organization. Follow this general procedure: Boot into recovery mode. Disable SIP and reboot. Install the New Relic PHP agent. Boot into recovery mode. Re-enable SIP and reboot. There are many articles available on the web that describe SIP and the steps for disabling, re-enabling, and checking the status. Cause PHP agent installation requires the daemon program to be installed in /usr/bin and the extension module in /usr/lib. However, those directories have R-X permissions, which means the daemon cannot be installed by normal means. Apple's System Integrity Protection, SIP, prevents the modification of permissions on these directories even when logged in as root, admin, or via a sudo privileged account. This also applies in situations where the PHP bin is self-contained (for example, MAMP).",

      "body": "Logs in context for the PHP agent connects your logs and APM data in New Relic. Bringing all of this data together in a single tool helps you quickly get to the root cause of an issue and find the log lines that you need to identify and resolve a problem. Set up your PHP app To enable logs in context for APM apps monitored by PHP: Make sure you have already set up logging in New Relic. This includes configuring a supported log forwarder that collects your application logs and extends the metadata that is forwarded to New Relic. Install or update to the latest PHP agent version, and enable distributed tracing. Use PHP agent version 9.13.0.270 or higher for logs in context. Install Monolog version 1 or 2, or use a compatible log forwarding plugin if you are not using the built-in Monolog Handler for New Relic. Configure logs in context for PHP using the Monolog extension, if used. PHP configuration with Monolog You must install the Monolog log enricher package before you can configure Monolog for New Relic logs in context. This is done by using Composer to install the newrelic/monolog-enricher package. In most cases, use the Processor and Handler classes provided by the log enricher package in conjunction with Monolog's built-in BufferHandler. The Processor adds the contextual metadata required for New Relic logs in context to operate. The Handler sends the log records to New Relic Logs. The BufferHandler ensures that the logs are delivered with as little overhead as possible. At the point where you create the Monolog\\Logger object, add the following pushProcessor and pushHandler calls to add the Processor and Handler: <?php use Monolog\\Handler\\BufferHandler; use Monolog\\Logger; use NewRelic\\Monolog\\Enricher\\{Handler, Processor}; $log = new Logger('log'); $log->pushProcessor(new Processor); $log->pushHandler(new BufferHandler(new Handler)); Copy Tip You can use the Processor and Handler in conjunction with any existing Monolog setup. You do not need to remove your existing processors and handlers. PHP configuration with other log forwarders If you use Monolog to send logs to a compatible log forwarder, and if you have already configured that tool to send logs to New Relic, you can use the Processor and Formatter solely for that tool. This option prevents additional overhead of sending logs directly to New Relic with the Handler. You will need to be using a handler that supports the setFormatter() method, and your logging tool must be able to ingest JSON logs. Here's an example of configuring Monolog to handle other log forwarders: <?php use Monolog\\Handler\\StreamHandler; use Monolog\\Logger; use NewRelic\\Monolog\\Enricher\\{Formatter, Processor}; $log = new Logger('log'); $log->pushProcessor(new Processor); $handler = new StreamHandler('php://stderr'); $handler->setFormatter(new Formatter); $log->pushHandler($handler); Copy To verify that you have configured the log appender correctly, run your application, then check your logs data in New Relic One using the query operator has:span.id has:trace.id. If everything is configured correctly and your data is being forwarded to New Relic with the enriched metadata, your logs should now be emitted as JSON and contain trace.id and span.id fields. If you don't see log data in the UI, follow the troubleshooting procedures. If the logs from your application do not include fields like trace.id and span.id, there may be a problem with the configuration of the Monolog log enricher. In this situation: Check that the PHP agent for your app has been installed and is configured to enable distributed tracing. Check that your application is using the Monolog logger object when sending log records, not syslog(). Check that another Monolog handler is not preventing the log record from bubbling. What's next? After you set up APM logs in context, make the most of your logging data: Explore the logging data across your platform with our Logs UI. View your logs in context data in distributed tracing. Note that for PHP, logs in context data doesn't appear in the Logs tab of the APM UI.

Analyze business data Use the PHP agent to organize, query, and visualize your data to answer key questions about application performance and customer experience. Use default transaction attributes or add your own Query your data using NRQL Send your own event data Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards Architecture The PHP agent has two binaries that work together to forward data to New Relic: The agent handles automatic and API instrumentation of your PHP code. The daemon acts as a proxy between the agent and the New Relic platform. You can connect up to 500 applications/agents to one daemon. The daemon imposes sampling when the harvest cycle limits are reached, so consider this when deciding how many applications/agents to connect to a single daemon. Tip The number of applications/agents per daemon may be lower when running in separate Docker containers, depending on the capacity of the connection between containers. The flow of data from your PHP applications to New Relic. The workflow between your application and New Relic must occur in this order: The agent establishes a socket connection with the daemon by sending the first payload of instrumentation data. The daemon establishes an HTTPS link with the New Relic platform. The daemon must be invoked before your instrumented application is invoked. This is called agent mode and is the default. To avoid losing reported data, make sure your instrumented application doesn't send transactions before both connections are established. Install the agent Before you install the PHP agent, ensure your system meets the system requirements. The PHP agent supports many of the most common PHP frameworks, databases, and libraries. You can also use the agent in a Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment. Tip If you are installing the agent on a shared hosting service, ensure you have root permissions to install the agent or contact your hosting provider for technical assistance. To install the agent, sign up for New Relic first. Once logged in, use our launcher, or see the instructions for specific installations. Add PHP data For standard installations, see: PHP agent installation overview (the basic installation steps for the most common setups). Installing on RedHat or CentOS Installing on Ubuntu or Debian Installing with tar archive (generic method to use on any supported systems such as Linux variants, OpenSolaris, SmartOS, FreeBSD, macOS, etc) The newrelic-install script (how to use the interactive script that automates some installation tasks) For other types of PHP installations and advanced installation topics, see: PHP agent installation: Non-standard PHP Starting the PHP daemon (a standard New Relic installation starts the daemon automatically, but you can also start the daemon manually) Silent mode for the install script Google App Engine (GAE) flex environment installation for New Relic's PHP agent Configure the agent The agent includes a variety of configuration options to further customize and fine-tune your installation. Tip The most important part of agent configuration is to give your app a descriptive name. New Relic uses this app name to aggregate metrics when you have multiple apps or hosts. After changing any agent configuration options, restart your web server. Extend agent instrumentation After installing the agent, go further and extend the agent's instrumentation: Page load timing: Integrate the PHP agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user activity. Custom instrumentation: Instrument transactions not captured as part of our framework instrumentation. Agent API: Use the agent API to customize the agent's behavior. For example, you can collect custom metrics, flag an error, or ignore a particular transaction entirely. Agent attributes: Customize the attributes attached to transactions. Customizing attributes allows you to avoid sending sensitive attributes, or to collect additional attributes for deeper visibility into your transactions. Troubleshoot your installation If you encounter issues with the PHP agent, see our full list of troubleshooting documentation. Common installation issues include: No data appears (PHP) Determining permissions requirements INI settings not taking effect immediately Why and when to restart your web server (PHP)",

Analyze business data Use the PHP agent to organize, query, and visualize your data to answer key questions about application performance and customer experience. Use default transaction attributes or add your own Query your data using NRQL Send your own event data Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards Architecture The PHP agent has two binaries that work together to forward data to New Relic: The agent handles automatic and API instrumentation of your PHP code. The daemon acts as a proxy between the agent and the New Relic platform. You can connect up to 500 applications/agents to one daemon. The daemon imposes sampling when the harvest cycle limits are reached, so consider this when deciding how many applications/agents to connect to a single daemon. Tip The number of applications/agents per daemon may be lower when running in separate Docker containers, depending on the capacity of the connection between containers. The flow of data from your PHP applications to New Relic. The workflow between your application and New Relic must occur in this order: The agent establishes a socket connection with the daemon by sending the first payload of instrumentation data. The daemon establishes an HTTPS link with the New Relic platform. The daemon must be invoked before your instrumented application is invoked. This is called agent mode and is the default. To avoid losing reported data, make sure your instrumented application doesn't send transactions before both connections are established. Install the agent Before you install the PHP agent, ensure your system meets the system requirements. The PHP agent supports many of the most common PHP frameworks, databases, and libraries. You can also use the agent in a Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment. Tip If you are installing the agent on a shared hosting service, ensure you have root permissions to install the agent or contact your hosting provider for technical assistance. To install the agent, sign up for New Relic first. Once logged in, use our launcher, or see the instructions for specific installations. Add PHP data For standard installations, see: PHP agent installation overview (the basic installation steps for the most common setups). Installing on RedHat or CentOS Installing on Ubuntu or Debian Installing with tar archive (generic method to use on any supported systems such as Linux variants, OpenSolaris, SmartOS, FreeBSD, macOS, etc) The newrelic-install script (how to use the interactive script that automates some installation tasks) For other types of PHP installations and advanced installation topics, see: PHP agent installation: Non-standard PHP Starting the PHP daemon (a standard New Relic installation starts the daemon automatically, but you can also start the daemon manually) Silent mode for the install script Google App Engine (GAE) flex environment installation for New Relic's PHP agent Configure the agent The agent includes a variety of configuration options to further customize and fine-tune your installation. Tip The most important part of agent configuration is to give your app a descriptive name. New Relic uses this app name to aggregate metrics when you have multiple apps or hosts. After changing any agent configuration options, restart your web server. Extend agent instrumentation After installing the agent, go further and extend the agent's instrumentation: Page load timing: Integrate the PHP agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user activity. Custom instrumentation: Instrument transactions not captured as part of our framework instrumentation. Agent API: Use the agent API to customize the agent's behavior. For example, you can collect custom metrics, flag an error, or ignore a particular transaction entirely. Agent attributes: Customize the attributes attached to transactions. Customizing attributes allows you to avoid sending sensitive attributes, or to collect additional attributes for deeper visibility into your transactions. Troubleshoot your installation If you encounter issues with the PHP agent, see our full list of troubleshooting documentation. Common installation issues include: No data appears (PHP) Determining permissions requirements INI settings not taking effect immediately Why and when to restart your web server (PHP)",

      "body": "Logs in context for the PHP agent connects your logs and APM data in New Relic. Bringing all of this data together in a single tool helps you quickly get to the root cause of an issue and find the log lines that you need to identify and resolve a problem. Set up your PHP app To enable logs in context for APM apps monitored by PHP: Make sure you have already set up logging in New Relic. This includes configuring a supported log forwarder that collects your application logs and extends the metadata that is forwarded to New Relic. Install or update to the latest PHP agent version, and enable distributed tracing. Use PHP agent version 9.13.0.270 or higher for logs in context. Install Monolog version 1 or 2, or use a compatible log forwarding plugin if you are not using the built-in Monolog Handler for New Relic. Configure logs in context for PHP using the Monolog extension, if used. PHP configuration with Monolog You must install the Monolog log enricher package before you can configure Monolog for New Relic logs in context. This is done by using Composer to install the newrelic/monolog-enricher package. In most cases, use the Processor and Handler classes provided by the log enricher package in conjunction with Monolog's built-in BufferHandler. The Processor adds the contextual metadata required for New Relic logs in context to operate. The Handler sends the log records to New Relic Logs. The BufferHandler ensures that the logs are delivered with as little overhead as possible. At the point where you create the Monolog\\Logger object, add the following pushProcessor and pushHandler calls to add the Processor and Handler: <?php use Monolog\\Handler\\BufferHandler; use Monolog\\Logger; use NewRelic\\Monolog\\Enricher\\{Handler, Processor}; $log = new Logger('log'); $log->pushProcessor(new Processor); $log->pushHandler(new BufferHandler(new Handler)); Copy Tip You can use the Processor and Handler in conjunction with any existing Monolog setup. You do not need to remove your existing processors and handlers. PHP configuration with other log forwarders If you use Monolog to send logs to a compatible log forwarder, and if you have already configured that tool to send logs to New Relic, you can use the Processor and Formatter solely for that tool. This option prevents additional overhead of sending logs directly to New Relic with the Handler. You will need to be using a handler that supports the setFormatter() method, and your logging tool must be able to ingest JSON logs. Here's an example of configuring Monolog to handle other log forwarders: <?php use Monolog\\Handler\\StreamHandler; use Monolog\\Logger; use NewRelic\\Monolog\\Enricher\\{Formatter, Processor}; $log = new Logger('log'); $log->pushProcessor(new Processor); $handler = new StreamHandler('php://stderr'); $handler->setFormatter(new Formatter); $log->pushHandler($handler); Copy To verify that you have configured the log appender correctly, run your application, then check your logs data in New Relic One using the query operator has:span.id has:trace.id. If everything is configured correctly and your data is being forwarded to New Relic with the enriched metadata, your logs should now be emitted as JSON and contain trace.id and span.id fields. If you don't see log data in the UI, follow the troubleshooting procedures. If the logs from your application do not include fields like trace.id and span.id, there may be a problem with the configuration of the Monolog log enricher. In this situation: Check that the PHP agent for your app has been installed and is configured to enable distributed tracing. Check that your application is using the Monolog logger object when sending log records, not syslog(). Check that another Monolog handler is not preventing the log record from bubbling. What's next? After you set up APM logs in context, make the most of your logging data: Explore the logging data across your platform with our Logs UI. View your logs in context data in distributed tracing. Note that for PHP, logs in context data doesn't appear in the Logs tab of the APM UI. Get deeper visibility into both your application and your platform performance data by forwarding your logs with our infrastructure monitoring agent. Review your infrastructure logs in the UI. Set up alerts. Query your data and create dashboards.",

This is true for the newrelic-install script and for manual installations. Caution This is not an endorsement for disabling SIP in general. Be sure to verify that this does not violate the security policies of your organization. Follow this general procedure: Boot into recovery mode. Disable SIP and reboot. Install the New Relic PHP agent. Boot into recovery mode. Re-enable SIP and reboot. There are many articles available on the web that describe SIP and the steps for disabling, re-enabling, and checking the status. Cause PHP agent installation requires the daemon program to be installed in /usr/bin and the extension module in /usr/lib. However, those directories have R-X permissions, which means the daemon cannot be installed by normal means. Apple's System Integrity Protection, SIP, prevents the modification of permissions on these directories even when logged in as root, admin, or via a sudo privileged account.

      "body": "Logs in context for the PHP agent connects your logs and APM data in New Relic. Bringing all of this data together in a single tool helps you quickly get to the root cause of an issue and find the log lines that you need to identify and resolve a problem. Set up your PHP app To enable logs in context for APM apps monitored by PHP: Make sure you have already set up logging in New Relic. This includes configuring a supported log forwarder that collects your application logs and extends the metadata that is forwarded to New Relic. Install or update to the latest PHP agent version, and enable distributed tracing. Use PHP agent version 9.13.0.270 or higher for logs in context. Install Monolog version 1 or 2, or use a compatible log forwarding plugin if you are not using the built-in Monolog Handler for New Relic. Configure logs in context for PHP using the Monolog extension, if used. PHP configuration with Monolog You must install the Monolog log enricher package before you can configure Monolog for New Relic logs in context. This is done by using Composer to install the newrelic/monolog-enricher package. In most cases, use the Processor and Handler classes provided by the log enricher package in conjunction with Monolog's built-in BufferHandler. The Processor adds the contextual metadata required for New Relic logs in context to operate. The Handler sends the log records to New Relic Logs. The BufferHandler ensures that the logs are delivered with as little overhead as possible. At the point where you create the Monolog\\Logger object, add the following pushProcessor and pushHandler calls to add the Processor and Handler: <?php use Monolog\\Handler\\BufferHandler; use Monolog\\Logger; use NewRelic\\Monolog\\Enricher\\{Handler, Processor}; $log = new Logger('log'); $log->pushProcessor(new Processor); $log->pushHandler(new BufferHandler(new Handler)); Copy Tip You can use the Processor and Handler in conjunction with any existing Monolog setup. You do not need to remove your existing processors and handlers. PHP configuration with other log forwarders If you use Monolog to send logs to a compatible log forwarder, and if you have already configured that tool to send logs to New Relic, you can use the Processor and Formatter solely for that tool. This option prevents additional overhead of sending logs directly to New Relic with the Handler. You will need to be using a handler that supports the setFormatter() method, and your logging tool must be able to ingest JSON logs. Here's an example of configuring Monolog to handle other log forwarders: <?php use Monolog\\Handler\\StreamHandler; use Monolog\\Logger; use NewRelic\\Monolog\\Enricher\\{Formatter, Processor}; $log = new Logger('log'); $log->pushProcessor(new Processor); $handler = new StreamHandler('php://stderr'); $handler->setFormatter(new Formatter); $log->pushHandler($handler); Copy To verify that you have configured the log appender correctly, run your application, then check your logs data in New Relic One using the query operator has:span.id has:trace.id. If everything is configured correctly and your data is being forwarded to New Relic with the enriched metadata, your logs should now be emitted as JSON and contain trace.id and span.id fields. If you don't see log data in the UI, follow the troubleshooting procedures. If the logs from your application do not include fields like trace.id and span.id, there may be a problem with the configuration of the Monolog log enricher. In this situation: Check that the PHP agent for your app has been installed and is configured to enable distributed tracing. Check that your application is using the Monolog logger object when sending log records, not syslog(). Check that another Monolog handler is not preventing the log record from bubbling. What's next? After you set up APM logs in context, make the most of your logging data: Explore the logging data across your platform with our Logs UI. View your logs in context data in distributed tracing. Note that for PHP, logs in context data doesn't appear in the Logs tab of the APM UI. Get deeper visibility into both your application and your platform performance data by forwarding your logs with our infrastructure monitoring agent. Review your infrastructure logs in the UI. Set up alerts. Query your data and create dashboards.",

Analyze business data Use the PHP agent to organize, query, and visualize your data to answer key questions about application performance and customer experience. Use default transaction attributes or add your own Query your data using NRQL Send your own event data Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards Architecture The PHP agent has two binaries that work together to forward data to New Relic: The agent handles automatic and API instrumentation of your PHP code. The daemon acts as a proxy between the agent and the New Relic platform. You can connect up to 500 applications/agents to one daemon. The daemon imposes sampling when the harvest cycle limits are reached, so consider this when deciding how many applications/agents to connect to a single daemon. Tip The number of applications/agents per daemon may be lower when running in separate Docker containers, depending on the capacity of the connection between containers. The flow of data from your PHP applications to New Relic. The workflow between your application and New Relic must occur in this order: The agent establishes a socket connection with the daemon by sending the first payload of instrumentation data. The daemon establishes an HTTPS link with the New Relic platform. The daemon must be invoked before your instrumented application is invoked. This is called agent mode and is the default. To avoid losing reported data, make sure your instrumented application doesn't send transactions before both connections are established. Install the agent Before you install the PHP agent, ensure your system meets the system requirements. The PHP agent supports many of the most common PHP frameworks, databases, and libraries. You can also use the agent in a Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment. Tip If you are installing the agent on a shared hosting service, ensure you have root permissions to install the agent or contact your hosting provider for technical assistance. To install the agent, sign up for New Relic first. Once logged in, use our launcher, or see the instructions for specific installations. Add PHP data For standard installations, see: PHP agent installation overview (the basic installation steps for the most common setups). Installing on RedHat or CentOS Installing on Ubuntu or Debian Installing with tar archive (generic method to use on any supported systems such as Linux variants, OpenSolaris, SmartOS, FreeBSD, macOS, etc) The newrelic-install script (how to use the interactive script that automates some installation tasks) For other types of PHP installations and advanced installation topics, see: PHP agent installation: Non-standard PHP Starting the PHP daemon (a standard New Relic installation starts the daemon automatically, but you can also start the daemon manually) Silent mode for the install script Google App Engine (GAE) flex environment installation for New Relic's PHP agent Configure the agent The agent includes a variety of configuration options to further customize and fine-tune your installation. Tip The most important part of agent configuration is to give your app a descriptive name. New Relic uses this app name to aggregate metrics when you have multiple apps or hosts. After changing any agent configuration options, restart your web server. Extend agent instrumentation After installing the agent, go further and extend the agent's instrumentation: Page load timing: Integrate the PHP agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user activity. Custom instrumentation: Instrument transactions not captured as part of our framework instrumentation. Agent API: Use the agent API to customize the agent's behavior. For example, you can collect custom metrics, flag an error, or ignore a particular transaction entirely. Agent attributes: Customize the attributes attached to transactions. Customizing attributes allows you to avoid sending sensitive attributes, or to collect additional attributes for deeper visibility into your transactions. Troubleshoot your installation If you encounter issues with the PHP agent, see our full list of troubleshooting documentation. Common installation issues include: No data appears (PHP) Determining permissions requirements INI settings not taking effect immediately Why and when to restart your web server (PHP)",

This is true for the newrelic-install script and for manual installations. Caution This is not an endorsement for disabling SIP in general. Be sure to verify that this does not violate the security policies of your organization. Follow this general procedure: Boot into recovery mode. Disable SIP and reboot. Install the New Relic PHP agent. Boot into recovery mode. Re-enable SIP and reboot. There are many articles available on the web that describe SIP and the steps for disabling, re-enabling, and checking the status. Cause PHP agent installation requires the daemon program to be installed in /usr/bin and the extension module in /usr/lib. However, those directories have R-X permissions, which means the daemon cannot be installed by normal means. Apple's System Integrity Protection, SIP, prevents the modification of permissions on these directories even when logged in as root, admin, or via a sudo privileged account. This also applies in situations where the PHP bin is self-contained (for example, MAMP).",

Tip The number of applications/agents per daemon may be lower when running in separate Docker containers, depending on the capacity of the connection between containers. The flow of data from your PHP applications to New Relic. The workflow between your application and New Relic must occur in this order: The agent establishes a socket connection with the daemon by sending the first payload of instrumentation data. The daemon establishes an HTTPS link with the New Relic platform. The daemon must be invoked before your instrumented application is invoked. This is called agent mode and is the default. To avoid losing reported data, make sure your instrumented application doesn't send transactions before both connections are established. Install the agent Before you install the PHP agent, ensure your system meets the system requirements. The PHP agent supports many of the most common PHP frameworks, databases, and libraries. You can also use the agent in a Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment. Tip If you are installing the agent on a shared hosting service, ensure you have root permissions to install the agent or contact your hosting provider for technical assistance. To install the agent, sign up for New Relic first. Once logged in, use our launcher, or see the instructions for specific installations. Add PHP data For standard installations, see: PHP agent installation overview (the basic installation steps for the most common setups). Installing on RedHat or CentOS Installing on Ubuntu or Debian Installing with tar archive (generic method to use on any supported systems such as Linux variants, OpenSolaris, SmartOS, FreeBSD, macOS, etc) The newrelic-install script (how to use the interactive script that automates some installation tasks) For other types of PHP installations and advanced installation topics, see: PHP agent installation: Non-standard PHP Starting the PHP daemon (a standard New Relic installation starts the daemon automatically, but you can also start the daemon manually) Silent mode for the install script Google App Engine (GAE) flex environment installation for New Relic's PHP agent Configure the agent The agent includes a variety of configuration options to further customize and fine-tune your installation. Tip The most important part of agent configuration is to give your app a descriptive name. New Relic uses this app name to aggregate metrics when you have multiple apps or hosts. After changing any agent configuration options, restart your web server. Extend agent instrumentation After installing the agent, go further and extend the agent's instrumentation: Page load timing: Integrate the PHP agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user activity. Custom instrumentation: Instrument transactions not captured as part of our framework instrumentation. Agent API: Use the agent API to customize the agent's behavior. For example, you can collect custom metrics, flag an error, or ignore a particular transaction entirely. Agent attributes: Customize the attributes attached to transactions. Customizing attributes allows you to avoid sending sensitive attributes, or to collect additional attributes for deeper visibility into your transactions. Troubleshoot your installation If you encounter issues with the PHP agent, see our full list of troubleshooting documentation. Common installation issues include: No data appears (PHP) Determining permissions requirements INI settings not taking effect immediately Why and when to restart your web server (PHP)",

Be sure to verify that this does not violate the security policies of your organization. Follow this general procedure: Boot into recovery mode. Disable SIP and reboot. Install the New Relic PHP agent. Boot into recovery mode. Re-enable SIP and reboot. There are many articles available on the web that describe SIP and the steps for disabling, re-enabling, and checking the status.

However, those directories have R-X permissions, which means the daemon cannot be installed by normal means. Apple's System Integrity Protection, SIP, prevents the modification of permissions on these directories even when logged in as root, admin, or via a sudo privileged account.

      "body": "Logs in context for the PHP agent connects your logs and APM data in New Relic. Bringing all of this data together in a single tool helps you quickly get to the root cause of an issue and find the log lines that you need to identify and resolve a problem. Set up your PHP app To enable logs in context for APM apps monitored by PHP: Make sure you have already set up logging in New Relic. This includes configuring a supported log forwarder that collects your application logs and extends the metadata that is forwarded to New Relic. Install or update to the latest PHP agent version, and enable distributed tracing. Use PHP agent version 9.13.0.270 or higher for logs in context. Install Monolog version 1 or 2, or use a compatible log forwarding plugin if you are not using the built-in Monolog Handler for New Relic. Configure logs in context for PHP using the Monolog extension, if used. PHP configuration with Monolog You must install the Monolog log enricher package before you can configure Monolog for New Relic logs in context. This is done by using Composer to install the newrelic/monolog-enricher package. In most cases, use the Processor and Handler classes provided by the log enricher package in conjunction with Monolog's built-in BufferHandler. The Processor adds the contextual metadata required for New Relic logs in context to operate. The Handler sends the log records to New Relic Logs. The BufferHandler ensures that the logs are delivered with as little overhead as possible. At the point where you create the Monolog\\Logger object, add the following pushProcessor and pushHandler calls to add the Processor and Handler: <?php use Monolog\\Handler\\BufferHandler; use Monolog\\Logger; use NewRelic\\Monolog\\Enricher\\{Handler, Processor}; $log = new Logger('log'); $log->pushProcessor(new Processor); $log->pushHandler(new BufferHandler(new Handler)); Copy Tip You can use the Processor and Handler in conjunction with any existing Monolog setup. You do not need to remove your existing processors and handlers. PHP configuration with other log forwarders If you use Monolog to send logs to a compatible log forwarder, and if you have already configured that tool to send logs to New Relic, you can use the Processor and Formatter solely for that tool. This option prevents additional overhead of sending logs directly to New Relic with the Handler. You will need to be using a handler that supports the setFormatter() method, and your logging tool must be able to ingest JSON logs. Here's an example of configuring Monolog to handle other log forwarders: <?php use Monolog\\Handler\\StreamHandler; use Monolog\\Logger; use NewRelic\\Monolog\\Enricher\\{Formatter, Processor}; $log = new Logger('log'); $log->pushProcessor(new Processor); $handler = new StreamHandler('php://stderr'); $handler->setFormatter(new Formatter); $log->pushHandler($handler); Copy To verify that you have configured the log appender correctly, run your application, then check your logs data in New Relic One using the query operator has:span.id has:trace.id. If everything is configured correctly and your data is being forwarded to New Relic with the enriched metadata, your logs should now be emitted as JSON and contain trace.id and span.id fields. If you don't see log data in the UI, follow the troubleshooting procedures. If the logs from your application do not include fields like trace.id and span.id, there may be a problem with the configuration of the Monolog log enricher. In this situation: Check that the PHP agent for your app has been installed and is configured to enable distributed tracing. Check that your application is using the Monolog logger object when sending log records, not syslog(). Check that another Monolog handler is not preventing the log record from bubbling. What's next? After you set up APM logs in context, make the most of your logging data: Explore the logging data across your platform with our Logs UI. View your logs in context data in distributed tracing. Note that for PHP, logs in context data doesn't appear in the Logs tab of the APM UI. Get deeper visibility into both your application and your platform performance data by forwarding your logs with our infrastructure monitoring agent. Review your infrastructure logs in the UI. Set up alerts. Query your data and create dashboards.",

Configure logs in context for PHP using the Monolog extension, if used. PHP configuration with Monolog You must install the Monolog log enricher package before you can configure Monolog for New Relic logs in context. This is done by using Composer to install the newrelic/monolog-enricher package. In most cases, use the Processor and Handler classes provided by the log enricher package in conjunction with Monolog's built-in BufferHandler. The Processor adds the contextual metadata required for New Relic logs in context to operate. The Handler sends the log records to New Relic Logs. The BufferHandler ensures that the logs are delivered with as little overhead as possible. At the point where you create the Monolog\\Logger object, add the following pushProcessor and pushHandler calls to add the Processor and Handler: <?php use Monolog\\Handler\\BufferHandler; use Monolog\\Logger; use NewRelic\\Monolog\\Enricher\\{Handler, Processor}; $log = new Logger('log'); $log->pushProcessor(new Processor); $log->pushHandler(new BufferHandler(new Handler)); Copy Tip You can use the Processor and Handler in conjunction with any existing Monolog setup. You do not need to remove your existing processors and handlers. PHP configuration with other log forwarders If you use Monolog to send logs to a compatible log forwarder, and if you have already configured that tool to send logs to New Relic, you can use the Processor and Formatter solely for that tool. This option prevents additional overhead of sending logs directly to New Relic with the Handler. You will need to be using a handler that supports the setFormatter() method, and your logging tool must be able to ingest JSON logs. Here's an example of configuring Monolog to handle other log forwarders: <?php use Monolog\\Handler\\StreamHandler; use Monolog\\Logger; use NewRelic\\Monolog\\Enricher\\{Formatter, Processor}; $log = new Logger('log'); $log->pushProcessor(new Processor); $handler = new StreamHandler('php://stderr'); $handler->setFormatter(new Formatter); $log->pushHandler($handler); Copy To verify that you have configured the log appender correctly, run your application, then check your logs data in New Relic One using the query operator has:span.id has:trace.id. If everything is configured correctly and your data is being forwarded to New Relic with the enriched metadata, your logs should now be emitted as JSON and contain trace.id and span.id fields. If you don't see log data in the UI, follow the troubleshooting procedures. If the logs from your application do not include fields like trace.id and span.id, there may be a problem with the configuration of the Monolog log enricher. In this situation: Check that the PHP agent for your app has been installed and is configured to enable distributed tracing. Check that your application is using the Monolog logger object when sending log records, not syslog(). Check that another Monolog handler is not preventing the log record from bubbling. What's next? After you set up APM logs in context, make the most of your logging data: Explore the logging data across your platform with our Logs UI. View your logs in context data in distributed tracing. Note that for PHP, logs in context data doesn't appear in the Logs tab of the APM UI. Get deeper visibility into both your application and your platform performance data by forwarding your logs with our infrastructure monitoring agent. Review your infrastructure logs in the UI. Set up alerts. Query your data and create dashboards.",

Use default transaction attributes or add your own Query your data using NRQL Send your own event data Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards Architecture The PHP agent has two binaries that work together to forward data to New Relic: The agent handles automatic and API instrumentation of your PHP code. The daemon acts as a proxy between the agent and the New Relic platform. You can connect up to 500 applications/agents to one daemon. The daemon imposes sampling when the harvest cycle limits are reached, so consider this when deciding how many applications/agents to connect to a single daemon. Tip The number of applications/agents per daemon may be lower when running in separate Docker containers, depending on the capacity of the connection between containers. The flow of data from your PHP applications to New Relic. The workflow between your application and New Relic must occur in this order: The agent establishes a socket connection with the daemon by sending the first payload of instrumentation data. The daemon establishes an HTTPS link with the New Relic platform. The daemon must be invoked before your instrumented application is invoked. This is called agent mode and is the default. To avoid losing reported data, make sure your instrumented application doesn't send transactions before both connections are established. Install the agent Before you install the PHP agent, ensure your system meets the system requirements. The PHP agent supports many of the most common PHP frameworks, databases, and libraries. You can also use the agent in a Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment. Tip If you are installing the agent on a shared hosting service, ensure you have root permissions to install the agent or contact your hosting provider for technical assistance. To install the agent, sign up for New Relic first. Once logged in, use our launcher, or see the instructions for specific installations. Add PHP data For standard installations, see: PHP agent installation overview (the basic installation steps for the most common setups). Installing on RedHat or CentOS Installing on Ubuntu or Debian Installing with tar archive (generic method to use on any supported systems such as Linux variants, OpenSolaris, SmartOS, FreeBSD, macOS, etc) The newrelic-install script (how to use the interactive script that automates some installation tasks) For other types of PHP installations and advanced installation topics, see: PHP agent installation: Non-standard PHP Starting the PHP daemon (a standard New Relic installation starts the daemon automatically, but you can also start the daemon manually) Silent mode for the install script Google App Engine (GAE) flex environment installation for New Relic's PHP agent Configure the agent The agent includes a variety of configuration options to further customize and fine-tune your installation. Tip The most important part of agent configuration is to give your app a descriptive name. New Relic uses this app name to aggregate metrics when you have multiple apps or hosts. After changing any agent configuration options, restart your web server. Extend agent instrumentation After installing the agent, go further and extend the agent's instrumentation: Page load timing: Integrate the PHP agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user activity. Custom instrumentation: Instrument transactions not captured as part of our framework instrumentation. Agent API: Use the agent API to customize the agent's behavior. For example, you can collect custom metrics, flag an error, or ignore a particular transaction entirely. Agent attributes: Customize the attributes attached to transactions. Customizing attributes allows you to avoid sending sensitive attributes, or to collect additional attributes for deeper visibility into your transactions. Troubleshoot your installation If you encounter issues with the PHP agent, see our full list of troubleshooting documentation. Common installation issues include: No data appears (PHP) Determining permissions requirements INI settings not taking effect immediately Why and when to restart your web server (PHP)",

Please contact http://support.newrelic.com and report the above error. We have also created a tar file with log files and other system info that can help solve the problem.

This is true for the newrelic-install script and for manual installations. Caution This is not an endorsement for disabling SIP in general. Be sure to verify that this does not violate the security policies of your organization. Follow this general procedure: Boot into recovery mode. Disable SIP and reboot. Install the New Relic PHP agent. Boot into recovery mode. Re-enable SIP and reboot. There are many articles available on the web that describe SIP and the steps for disabling, re-enabling, and checking the status. Cause PHP agent installation requires the daemon program to be installed in /usr/bin and the extension module in /usr/lib. However, those directories have R-X permissions, which means the daemon cannot be installed by normal means. Apple's System Integrity Protection, SIP, prevents the modification of permissions on these directories even when logged in as root, admin, or via a sudo privileged account. This also applies in situations where the PHP bin is self-contained (for example, MAMP).",

This is true for the newrelic-install script and for manual installations. Caution This is not an endorsement for disabling SIP in general. Be sure to verify that this does not violate the security policies of your organization. Follow this general procedure: Boot into recovery mode. Disable SIP and reboot. Install the New Relic PHP agent. Boot into recovery mode. Re-enable SIP and reboot. There are many articles available on the web that describe SIP and the steps for disabling, re-enabling, and checking the status. Cause PHP agent installation requires the daemon program to be installed in /usr/bin and the extension module in /usr/lib. However, those directories have R-X permissions, which means the daemon cannot be installed by normal means. Apple's System Integrity Protection, SIP, prevents the modification of permissions on these directories even when logged in as root, admin, or via a sudo privileged account. This also applies in situations where the PHP bin is self-contained (for example, MAMP).",

      "body": "Logs in context for the PHP agent connects your logs and APM data in New Relic. Bringing all of this data together in a single tool helps you quickly get to the root cause of an issue and find the log lines that you need to identify and resolve a problem. Set up your PHP app To enable logs in context for APM apps monitored by PHP: Make sure you have already set up logging in New Relic. This includes configuring a supported log forwarder that collects your application logs and extends the metadata that is forwarded to New Relic. Install or update to the latest PHP agent version, and enable distributed tracing. Use PHP agent version 9.13.0.270 or higher for logs in context. Install Monolog version 1 or 2, or use a compatible log forwarding plugin if you are not using the built-in Monolog Handler for New Relic. Configure logs in context for PHP using the Monolog extension, if used. PHP configuration with Monolog You must install the Monolog log enricher package before you can configure Monolog for New Relic logs in context. This is done by using Composer to install the newrelic/monolog-enricher package. In most cases, use the Processor and Handler classes provided by the log enricher package in conjunction with Monolog's built-in BufferHandler. The Processor adds the contextual metadata required for New Relic logs in context to operate. The Handler sends the log records to New Relic Logs. The BufferHandler ensures that the logs are delivered with as little overhead as possible. At the point where you create the Monolog\\Logger object, add the following pushProcessor and pushHandler calls to add the Processor and Handler: <?php use Monolog\\Handler\\BufferHandler; use Monolog\\Logger; use NewRelic\\Monolog\\Enricher\\{Handler, Processor}; $log = new Logger('log'); $log->pushProcessor(new Processor); $log->pushHandler(new BufferHandler(new Handler)); Copy Tip You can use the Processor and Handler in conjunction with any existing Monolog setup. You do not need to remove your existing processors and handlers. PHP configuration with other log forwarders If you use Monolog to send logs to a compatible log forwarder, and if you have already configured that tool to send logs to New Relic, you can use the Processor and Formatter solely for that tool. This option prevents additional overhead of sending logs directly to New Relic with the Handler. You will need to be using a handler that supports the setFormatter() method, and your logging tool must be able to ingest JSON logs. Here's an example of configuring Monolog to handle other log forwarders: <?php use Monolog\\Handler\\StreamHandler; use Monolog\\Logger; use NewRelic\\Monolog\\Enricher\\{Formatter, Processor}; $log = new Logger('log'); $log->pushProcessor(new Processor); $handler = new StreamHandler('php://stderr'); $handler->setFormatter(new Formatter); $log->pushHandler($handler); Copy To verify that you have configured the log appender correctly, run your application, then check your logs data in New Relic One using the query operator has:span.id has:trace.id. If everything is configured correctly and your data is being forwarded to New Relic with the enriched metadata, your logs should now be emitted as JSON and contain trace.id and span.id fields. If you don't see log data in the UI, follow the troubleshooting procedures. If the logs from your application do not include fields like trace.id and span.id, there may be a problem with the configuration of the Monolog log enricher. In this situation: Check that the PHP agent for your app has been installed and is configured to enable distributed tracing. Check that your application is using the Monolog logger object when sending log records, not syslog(). Check that another Monolog handler is not preventing the log record from bubbling. What's next? After you set up APM logs in context, make the most of your logging data: Explore the logging data across your platform with our Logs UI. View your logs in context data in distributed tracing. Note that for PHP, logs in context data doesn't appear in the Logs tab of the APM UI.

Analyze business data Use the PHP agent to organize, query, and visualize your data to answer key questions about application performance and customer experience. Use default transaction attributes or add your own Query your data using NRQL Send your own event data Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards Architecture The PHP agent has two binaries that work together to forward data to New Relic: The agent handles automatic and API instrumentation of your PHP code. The daemon acts as a proxy between the agent and the New Relic platform. You can connect up to 500 applications/agents to one daemon. The daemon imposes sampling when the harvest cycle limits are reached, so consider this when deciding how many applications/agents to connect to a single daemon. Tip The number of applications/agents per daemon may be lower when running in separate Docker containers, depending on the capacity of the connection between containers. The flow of data from your PHP applications to New Relic. The workflow between your application and New Relic must occur in this order: The agent establishes a socket connection with the daemon by sending the first payload of instrumentation data. The daemon establishes an HTTPS link with the New Relic platform. The daemon must be invoked before your instrumented application is invoked. This is called agent mode and is the default. To avoid losing reported data, make sure your instrumented application doesn't send transactions before both connections are established. Install the agent Before you install the PHP agent, ensure your system meets the system requirements. The PHP agent supports many of the most common PHP frameworks, databases, and libraries. You can also use the agent in a Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment. Tip If you are installing the agent on a shared hosting service, ensure you have root permissions to install the agent or contact your hosting provider for technical assistance. To install the agent, sign up for New Relic first. Once logged in, use our launcher, or see the instructions for specific installations. Add PHP data For standard installations, see: PHP agent installation overview (the basic installation steps for the most common setups). Installing on RedHat or CentOS Installing on Ubuntu or Debian Installing with tar archive (generic method to use on any supported systems such as Linux variants, OpenSolaris, SmartOS, FreeBSD, macOS, etc) The newrelic-install script (how to use the interactive script that automates some installation tasks) For other types of PHP installations and advanced installation topics, see: PHP agent installation: Non-standard PHP Starting the PHP daemon (a standard New Relic installation starts the daemon automatically, but you can also start the daemon manually) Silent mode for the install script Google App Engine (GAE) flex environment installation for New Relic's PHP agent Configure the agent The agent includes a variety of configuration options to further customize and fine-tune your installation. Tip The most important part of agent configuration is to give your app a descriptive name. New Relic uses this app name to aggregate metrics when you have multiple apps or hosts. After changing any agent configuration options, restart your web server. Extend agent instrumentation After installing the agent, go further and extend the agent's instrumentation: Page load timing: Integrate the PHP agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user activity. Custom instrumentation: Instrument transactions not captured as part of our framework instrumentation. Agent API: Use the agent API to customize the agent's behavior. For example, you can collect custom metrics, flag an error, or ignore a particular transaction entirely. Agent attributes: Customize the attributes attached to transactions. Customizing attributes allows you to avoid sending sensitive attributes, or to collect additional attributes for deeper visibility into your transactions. Troubleshoot your installation If you encounter issues with the PHP agent, see our full list of troubleshooting documentation. Common installation issues include: No data appears (PHP) Determining permissions requirements INI settings not taking effect immediately Why and when to restart your web server (PHP)",

Analyze business data Use the PHP agent to organize, query, and visualize your data to answer key questions about application performance and customer experience. Use default transaction attributes or add your own Query your data using NRQL Send your own event data Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards Architecture The PHP agent has two binaries that work together to forward data to New Relic: The agent handles automatic and API instrumentation of your PHP code. The daemon acts as a proxy between the agent and the New Relic platform. You can connect up to 500 applications/agents to one daemon. The daemon imposes sampling when the harvest cycle limits are reached, so consider this when deciding how many applications/agents to connect to a single daemon. Tip The number of applications/agents per daemon may be lower when running in separate Docker containers, depending on the capacity of the connection between containers. The flow of data from your PHP applications to New Relic. The workflow between your application and New Relic must occur in this order: The agent establishes a socket connection with the daemon by sending the first payload of instrumentation data. The daemon establishes an HTTPS link with the New Relic platform. The daemon must be invoked before your instrumented application is invoked. This is called agent mode and is the default. To avoid losing reported data, make sure your instrumented application doesn't send transactions before both connections are established. Install the agent Before you install the PHP agent, ensure your system meets the system requirements. The PHP agent supports many of the most common PHP frameworks, databases, and libraries. You can also use the agent in a Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment. Tip If you are installing the agent on a shared hosting service, ensure you have root permissions to install the agent or contact your hosting provider for technical assistance. To install the agent, sign up for New Relic first. Once logged in, use our launcher, or see the instructions for specific installations. Add PHP data For standard installations, see: PHP agent installation overview (the basic installation steps for the most common setups). Installing on RedHat or CentOS Installing on Ubuntu or Debian Installing with tar archive (generic method to use on any supported systems such as Linux variants, OpenSolaris, SmartOS, FreeBSD, macOS, etc) The newrelic-install script (how to use the interactive script that automates some installation tasks) For other types of PHP installations and advanced installation topics, see: PHP agent installation: Non-standard PHP Starting the PHP daemon (a standard New Relic installation starts the daemon automatically, but you can also start the daemon manually) Silent mode for the install script Google App Engine (GAE) flex environment installation for New Relic's PHP agent Configure the agent The agent includes a variety of configuration options to further customize and fine-tune your installation. Tip The most important part of agent configuration is to give your app a descriptive name. New Relic uses this app name to aggregate metrics when you have multiple apps or hosts. After changing any agent configuration options, restart your web server. Extend agent instrumentation After installing the agent, go further and extend the agent's instrumentation: Page load timing: Integrate the PHP agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user activity. Custom instrumentation: Instrument transactions not captured as part of our framework instrumentation. Agent API: Use the agent API to customize the agent's behavior. For example, you can collect custom metrics, flag an error, or ignore a particular transaction entirely. Agent attributes: Customize the attributes attached to transactions. Customizing attributes allows you to avoid sending sensitive attributes, or to collect additional attributes for deeper visibility into your transactions. Troubleshoot your installation If you encounter issues with the PHP agent, see our full list of troubleshooting documentation. Common installation issues include: No data appears (PHP) Determining permissions requirements INI settings not taking effect immediately Why and when to restart your web server (PHP)",

This is true for the newrelic-install script and for manual installations. Caution This is not an endorsement for disabling SIP in general. Be sure to verify that this does not violate the security policies of your organization. Follow this general procedure: Boot into recovery mode. Disable SIP and reboot. Install the New Relic PHP agent. Boot into recovery mode. Re-enable SIP and reboot. There are many articles available on the web that describe SIP and the steps for disabling, re-enabling, and checking the status. Cause PHP agent installation requires the daemon program to be installed in /usr/bin and the extension module in /usr/lib. However, those directories have R-X permissions, which means the daemon cannot be installed by normal means. Apple's System Integrity Protection, SIP, prevents the modification of permissions on these directories even when logged in as root, admin, or via a sudo privileged account. This also applies in situations where the PHP bin is self-contained (for example, MAMP).",

      "body": "Logs in context for the PHP agent connects your logs and APM data in New Relic. Bringing all of this data together in a single tool helps you quickly get to the root cause of an issue and find the log lines that you need to identify and resolve a problem. Set up your PHP app To enable logs in context for APM apps monitored by PHP: Make sure you have already set up logging in New Relic. This includes configuring a supported log forwarder that collects your application logs and extends the metadata that is forwarded to New Relic. Install or update to the latest PHP agent version, and enable distributed tracing. Use PHP agent version 9.13.0.270 or higher for logs in context. Install Monolog version 1 or 2, or use a compatible log forwarding plugin if you are not using the built-in Monolog Handler for New Relic. Configure logs in context for PHP using the Monolog extension, if used. PHP configuration with Monolog You must install the Monolog log enricher package before you can configure Monolog for New Relic logs in context. This is done by using Composer to install the newrelic/monolog-enricher package. In most cases, use the Processor and Handler classes provided by the log enricher package in conjunction with Monolog's built-in BufferHandler. The Processor adds the contextual metadata required for New Relic logs in context to operate. The Handler sends the log records to New Relic Logs. The BufferHandler ensures that the logs are delivered with as little overhead as possible. At the point where you create the Monolog\\Logger object, add the following pushProcessor and pushHandler calls to add the Processor and Handler: <?php use Monolog\\Handler\\BufferHandler; use Monolog\\Logger; use NewRelic\\Monolog\\Enricher\\{Handler, Processor}; $log = new Logger('log'); $log->pushProcessor(new Processor); $log->pushHandler(new BufferHandler(new Handler)); Copy Tip You can use the Processor and Handler in conjunction with any existing Monolog setup. You do not need to remove your existing processors and handlers. PHP configuration with other log forwarders If you use Monolog to send logs to a compatible log forwarder, and if you have already configured that tool to send logs to New Relic, you can use the Processor and Formatter solely for that tool. This option prevents additional overhead of sending logs directly to New Relic with the Handler. You will need to be using a handler that supports the setFormatter() method, and your logging tool must be able to ingest JSON logs. Here's an example of configuring Monolog to handle other log forwarders: <?php use Monolog\\Handler\\StreamHandler; use Monolog\\Logger; use NewRelic\\Monolog\\Enricher\\{Formatter, Processor}; $log = new Logger('log'); $log->pushProcessor(new Processor); $handler = new StreamHandler('php://stderr'); $handler->setFormatter(new Formatter); $log->pushHandler($handler); Copy To verify that you have configured the log appender correctly, run your application, then check your logs data in New Relic One using the query operator has:span.id has:trace.id. If everything is configured correctly and your data is being forwarded to New Relic with the enriched metadata, your logs should now be emitted as JSON and contain trace.id and span.id fields. If you don't see log data in the UI, follow the troubleshooting procedures. If the logs from your application do not include fields like trace.id and span.id, there may be a problem with the configuration of the Monolog log enricher. In this situation: Check that the PHP agent for your app has been installed and is configured to enable distributed tracing. Check that your application is using the Monolog logger object when sending log records, not syslog(). Check that another Monolog handler is not preventing the log record from bubbling. What's next? After you set up APM logs in context, make the most of your logging data: Explore the logging data across your platform with our Logs UI. View your logs in context data in distributed tracing. Note that for PHP, logs in context data doesn't appear in the Logs tab of the APM UI. Get deeper visibility into both your application and your platform performance data by forwarding your logs with our infrastructure monitoring agent. Review your infrastructure logs in the UI. Set up alerts. Query your data and create dashboards.",

Install the New Relic PHP agent. Boot into recovery mode. Re-enable SIP and reboot. There are many articles available on the web that describe SIP and the steps for disabling, re-enabling, and checking the status. Cause PHP agent installation requires the daemon program to be installed in /usr/bin and the extension module in /usr/lib. However, those directories have R-X permissions, which means the daemon cannot be installed by normal means. Apple's System Integrity Protection, SIP, prevents the modification of permissions on these directories even when logged in as root, admin, or via a sudo privileged account. This also applies in situations where the PHP bin is self-contained (for example, MAMP).",

      "body": "Logs in context for the PHP agent connects your logs and APM data in New Relic. Bringing all of this data together in a single tool helps you quickly get to the root cause of an issue and find the log lines that you need to identify and resolve a problem. Set up your PHP app To enable logs in context for APM apps monitored by PHP: Make sure you have already set up logging in New Relic. This includes configuring a supported log forwarder that collects your application logs and extends the metadata that is forwarded to New Relic. Install or update to the latest PHP agent version, and enable distributed tracing. Use PHP agent version 9.13.0.270 or higher for logs in context. Install Monolog version 1 or 2, or use a compatible log forwarding plugin if you are not using the built-in Monolog Handler for New Relic. Configure logs in context for PHP using the Monolog extension, if used. PHP configuration with Monolog You must install the Monolog log enricher package before you can configure Monolog for New Relic logs in context. This is done by using Composer to install the newrelic/monolog-enricher package. In most cases, use the Processor and Handler classes provided by the log enricher package in conjunction with Monolog's built-in BufferHandler. The Processor adds the contextual metadata required for New Relic logs in context to operate. The Handler sends the log records to New Relic Logs. The BufferHandler ensures that the logs are delivered with as little overhead as possible. At the point where you create the Monolog\\Logger object, add the following pushProcessor and pushHandler calls to add the Processor and Handler: <?php use Monolog\\Handler\\BufferHandler; use Monolog\\Logger; use NewRelic\\Monolog\\Enricher\\{Handler, Processor}; $log = new Logger('log'); $log->pushProcessor(new Processor); $log->pushHandler(new BufferHandler(new Handler)); Copy Tip You can use the Processor and Handler in conjunction with any existing Monolog setup. You do not need to remove your existing processors and handlers. PHP configuration with other log forwarders If you use Monolog to send logs to a compatible log forwarder, and if you have already configured that tool to send logs to New Relic, you can use the Processor and Formatter solely for that tool. This option prevents additional overhead of sending logs directly to New Relic with the Handler. You will need to be using a handler that supports the setFormatter() method, and your logging tool must be able to ingest JSON logs. Here's an example of configuring Monolog to handle other log forwarders: <?php use Monolog\\Handler\\StreamHandler; use Monolog\\Logger; use NewRelic\\Monolog\\Enricher\\{Formatter, Processor}; $log = new Logger('log'); $log->pushProcessor(new Processor); $handler = new StreamHandler('php://stderr'); $handler->setFormatter(new Formatter); $log->pushHandler($handler); Copy To verify that you have configured the log appender correctly, run your application, then check your logs data in New Relic One using the query operator has:span.id has:trace.id. If everything is configured correctly and your data is being forwarded to New Relic with the enriched metadata, your logs should now be emitted as JSON and contain trace.id and span.id fields. If you don't see log data in the UI, follow the troubleshooting procedures. If the logs from your application do not include fields like trace.id and span.id, there may be a problem with the configuration of the Monolog log enricher. In this situation: Check that the PHP agent for your app has been installed and is configured to enable distributed tracing. Check that your application is using the Monolog logger object when sending log records, not syslog(). Check that another Monolog handler is not preventing the log record from bubbling. What's next? After you set up APM logs in context, make the most of your logging data: Explore the logging data across your platform with our Logs UI. View your logs in context data in distributed tracing. Note that for PHP, logs in context data doesn't appear in the Logs tab of the APM UI. Get deeper visibility into both your application and your platform performance data by forwarding your logs with our infrastructure monitoring agent. Review your infrastructure logs in the UI. Set up alerts. Query your data and create dashboards.",

Analyze business data Use the PHP agent to organize, query, and visualize your data to answer key questions about application performance and customer experience. Use default transaction attributes or add your own Query your data using NRQL Send your own event data Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards Architecture The PHP agent has two binaries that work together to forward data to New Relic: The agent handles automatic and API instrumentation of your PHP code. The daemon acts as a proxy between the agent and the New Relic platform. You can connect up to 500 applications/agents to one daemon. The daemon imposes sampling when the harvest cycle limits are reached, so consider this when deciding how many applications/agents to connect to a single daemon. Tip The number of applications/agents per daemon may be lower when running in separate Docker containers, depending on the capacity of the connection between containers. The flow of data from your PHP applications to New Relic. The workflow between your application and New Relic must occur in this order: The agent establishes a socket connection with the daemon by sending the first payload of instrumentation data. The daemon establishes an HTTPS link with the New Relic platform. The daemon must be invoked before your instrumented application is invoked. This is called agent mode and is the default. To avoid losing reported data, make sure your instrumented application doesn't send transactions before both connections are established. Install the agent Before you install the PHP agent, ensure your system meets the system requirements. The PHP agent supports many of the most common PHP frameworks, databases, and libraries. You can also use the agent in a Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment. Tip If you are installing the agent on a shared hosting service, ensure you have root permissions to install the agent or contact your hosting provider for technical assistance. To install the agent, sign up for New Relic first. Once logged in, use our launcher, or see the instructions for specific installations. Add PHP data For standard installations, see: PHP agent installation overview (the basic installation steps for the most common setups). Installing on RedHat or CentOS Installing on Ubuntu or Debian Installing with tar archive (generic method to use on any supported systems such as Linux variants, OpenSolaris, SmartOS, FreeBSD, macOS, etc) The newrelic-install script (how to use the interactive script that automates some installation tasks) For other types of PHP installations and advanced installation topics, see: PHP agent installation: Non-standard PHP Starting the PHP daemon (a standard New Relic installation starts the daemon automatically, but you can also start the daemon manually) Silent mode for the install script Google App Engine (GAE) flex environment installation for New Relic's PHP agent Configure the agent The agent includes a variety of configuration options to further customize and fine-tune your installation. Tip The most important part of agent configuration is to give your app a descriptive name. New Relic uses this app name to aggregate metrics when you have multiple apps or hosts. After changing any agent configuration options, restart your web server. Extend agent instrumentation After installing the agent, go further and extend the agent's instrumentation: Page load timing: Integrate the PHP agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user activity. Custom instrumentation: Instrument transactions not captured as part of our framework instrumentation. Agent API: Use the agent API to customize the agent's behavior. For example, you can collect custom metrics, flag an error, or ignore a particular transaction entirely. Agent attributes: Customize the attributes attached to transactions. Customizing attributes allows you to avoid sending sensitive attributes, or to collect additional attributes for deeper visibility into your transactions. Troubleshoot your installation If you encounter issues with the PHP agent, see our full list of troubleshooting documentation. Common installation issues include: No data appears (PHP) Determining permissions requirements INI settings not taking effect immediately Why and when to restart your web server (PHP)",

      "body": "Our Python agent monitors your Python application to help you identify and solve performance issues. You can also extend your performance monitoring to collect and analyze business data to help you improve the customer experience and make data-driven business decisions. With flexible options for custom instrumentation and APIs, The Python agent offers multiple building blocks to customize the data you need from your app. Our Python works with a wide variety of web frameworks and hosting mechanisms, including Django, Gunicorn, WSGI, CherryPy, uWSGI, and more. You can also install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Monitor app performance After you install the Python agent, it begins to collect data about your app. You can view the data as charts and tables in New Relic One. View the big picture of your app. Monitor your app's Apdex (user satisfaction). Get a high-level summary of your app with Summary page. Enable distributed tracing to see activity across an architecture having many services. Install Infrastructure monitoring and view detailed server/host data for your app. Find errors and problems quickly. Track key transactions specific to your business. Create custom dashboards for important metrics. Alert your team when an error or problem occurs before it affects your users. View performance after a deployment. Drill down into performance details. Examine code-level transaction traces. Examine database query traces. Examine error traces. Use thread profiler sessions to see detailed stack traces of sampled threads View logs for your APM and infrastructure data Bring your logs and application's data together to make troubleshooting easier and faster. No need to switch to another UI page in New Relic One. With logs in context, you can see log messages related to your errors and traces directly in your app's UI. You can also see logs in context of your infrastructure data, such as Kubernetes clusters. Extend agent instrumentation Other helpful tools include: Tools Description Browser monitoring Integrate the Python agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user browser activity. Simple scripts and background tasks Monitor job-based or task queuing systems, like Celery, or other standalone non-web functions. Business data analysis with data exploration. Use the Python agent with our data explorer to organize, query, and visualize your data to answer key questions about application performance and customer experience. Use default transaction attributes, or add your own. Query your data using the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). Send your own event data. Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards. Install the Python agent Before you install the Python agent, make sure your system meets the system requirements. You must also create a New Relic account. We support a number of web frameworks and libraries right out of the box, including Django, WSGI, and Gunicorn. If you use one of the supported web frameworks, installation is easy. If you use an unsupported framework, the process will involve some additions to your app code and/or web server files. For a quick and simple install process that will work for the majority of setups, follow these simple steps: Download and install the Python package. Create config file. Integrate the Python agent with your application. Read the Quick Start guide Add Python data Monitor non-web scripts, background tasks, and functions The Python agent also lets you monitor non-web scripts, worker processes, tasks, and functions. The installation process for these non-web transactions is similar to the one used for a web app, with one major difference: instead of going through the standard integration process described in the install instructions, you would manually \"wrap\" any function you want to monitor. For more information, see Non-web tasks and processes. For instructions on monitoring Celery tasks, see Celery background tasks. What's next after installation? Once you get the agent up and running, some suggested next steps are: Explore your data in and get comfortable with the user interface. Read our docs on our other observability solutions and the APM page. Change your application's name, or other configuration options. Learn about setting up custom instrumentation for application activity not monitored by default. Consider the Python Telemetry SDK. Troubleshooting After you complete the install process, your data should appear in the APM UI within five minutes. If it does not, use these troubleshooting resources: If no data appears, follow these troubleshooting steps. If you experience issues when installing or running the Python agent on a new host, test that the package is installed correctly and that it can contact New Relic's data collector service. For other problems, see the full list of troubleshooting documentation. Check the source code The Python agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "The Python agent API allows you to customize and extend your monitoring. Use the Python agent API to: Manually instrument an unsupported framework or third-party system. Add instrumentation to supplement the agent's default monitoring. This document describes some of the available Python API calls. For a description of all our available APIs, see Introduction to APIs. Custom instrumentation or API If your goal is custom instrumentation, consider using the configuration file method, which allows you to add functions and class methods to the config file that will be auto-instrumented by the agent. The benefit of the config-file method is that it does not require you to change your application code. However, the Python agent API is much more powerful and is best for setting up more complex and tailored instrumentation. To ensure you have access to the full API functionality, update to the latest Python agent. Monitor transactions and segments The Python agent is compatible with most of the common WSGI web frameworks. If the agent supports your framework, web requests automatically will be captured as transactions and displayed in the New Relic One UI. A transaction can also have function-level segments that are captured as part of a transaction trace. Use these methods to monitor web transactions, non-web transactions, and transaction segments: If you want to... Do this... Monitor WSGI web transactions The Python agent automatically captures web transactions for supported frameworks. If you do not have a supported framework, you can use the wsgi_application function to monitor your WSGI entry point. Monitor non-web transactions The Python agent classifies non-web transactions as background tasks. To capture non-web transactions, use background_task. Capture more details about a transaction If your transaction traces do not have the level of detail you want: Use function_trace to capture more function-level detail in transactions. Use datastore_trace to capture more detail about datastore calls. Ignore a transaction Use any of these options: To ignore a transaction altogether, use ignore_transaction. To prevent a transaction from producing a transaction trace, use suppress_transaction_trace. To end a transaction before the agent would end it automatically, use end_of_transaction. Add and edit transaction metadata Sometimes the code you target is visible in our UI, but some details of the method are not useful. For example: The default name is not helpful, or it is causing a metric grouping issue. You want to add custom attributes to your transactions so you can filter them when querying. Use these calls when you want to change the metadata of an existing transaction: If you want to... Do this... Get reference to current transaction To return an object representing the current transaction, use current_transaction. This is required by some other Python agent API calls. Change the name of a transaction Use set_transaction_name. Add metadata (such as a customer's subscription level) to transactions Add custom attributes to your transactions using add_custom_parameter, or use other API calls to report custom data. Mark a transaction as a background job To convert a web transaction into a background task so that it appears as a non-web transaction in the UI, use set_background_task. Prevent a transaction from affecting your Apdex score Use suppress_apdex_metric. See related logs To see logs directly within the context of your application's errors and traces, use the get_linking_metadata API call to annotate your logs. For more information about correlating log data with other telemetry data, see our logs in context documentation. Report custom events and custom metric data The agent reports data in two primary forms: Metric data measures numeric, time-based values; for example, connections per minute. Event data captures discrete event information. Events have key-value attributes attached to them. You can analyze and query event data. Use these methods to create new event data and new metric data: If you want to... Do this... Send data about an event for use when querying your data. Use record_custom_event. Report time-based metrics on application performance To report a single metric, use record_custom_metric. To report a set of metrics, use record_custom_metrics. Report an exception as an error By default, the Python agent only reports unhandled exceptions. To report a Python exception as an error, use notice_error. Report query string parameters For security reasons, query string parameters associated with web transactions are disabled by default. Use capture_request_params to enable them. Tag events with metadata To add attributes to events for more detailed analysis in Insights or error analytics, use add_custom_parameter. Generate metrics from data sources and data factories To generate metrics with a pull-style API rather than the push-style API implemented by record_custom_metric(), use these API calls: register_data_source data_source_generator data_source_factory Message-related calls These API calls allow you to collect performance data on your message-passing architecture or service; for example, RabbitMQ. To use these calls, make sure you have Python agent version 2.88.0.72 or higher. If you want to... Do this... Report messages as a transaction Use message_transaction. Report message details as transaction trace segments Use message_trace. Implement distributed tracing These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. Services and applications monitored by our agents will automatically pass distributed tracing context to each other when using a supported framework. When not using a supported framework, you will need to use the distributed tracing APIs to manually accept this context. Supported web frameworks (for example, Flask, Django, Tornado) will automatically call accept_distributed_trace_payload when creating a transaction. Supported external web services libraries will automatically call create_distributed_trace_payload before making an external HTTP call. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. If you want to... Do this... Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Use create_distributed_trace_payload. Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace Use accept_distributed_trace_payload. Agent configuration, initialization, shutdown These calls help you manage Python agent behavior, such as initializing and integrating the agent, and referencing or changing configuration settings: If you want to... Do this... Initialize the agent To initialize the Python agent with a specific configuration file as part of advanced integration process, use initialize. Get a reference to the application object The application object represents an agent-monitored application and is used by some Python agent API calls. Get a reference to configuration settings To control the Python agent's behavior, you can use configuration settings. To get a reference to config file and environment variable settings and make changes to them, use global_settings. To get a reference to all settings, including server-side configuration from our UI, use application_settings. Shut down the agent To forcibly shut down the agent instead of allowing it to make the standard final attempt to upload data, use shutdown_agent. Control the Browser monitoring agent You can install the browser monitoring agent by automatically adding it to your pages or by deploying it on specific pages by copying and pasting the browser agent JavaScript snippet. You can also control the browser agent by using APM agent API calls. For more information, see Browser agent and the Python agent. If you want to... Do this... Monitor specific page views To inject the browser agent header and footer JavaScript snippets into views you want to monitor, use both get_browser_timing_header and get_browser_timing_footer. Disable monitoring of specific page views To disable browser monitoring for specific page views, use disable_browser_autorum.",

Use default transaction attributes, or add your own. Query your data using the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). Send your own event data. Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards. Install the Python agent Before you install the Python agent, make sure your system meets the system requirements. You must also create a New Relic account. We support a number of web frameworks and libraries right out of the box, including Django, WSGI, and Gunicorn. If you use one of the supported web frameworks, installation is easy. If you use an unsupported framework, the process will involve some additions to your app code and/or web server files. For a quick and simple install process that will work for the majority of setups, follow these simple steps: Download and install the Python package. Create config file. Integrate the Python agent with your application. Read the Quick Start guide Add Python data Monitor non-web scripts, background tasks, and functions The Python agent also lets you monitor non-web scripts, worker processes, tasks, and functions. The installation process for these non-web transactions is similar to the one used for a web app, with one major difference: instead of going through the standard integration process described in the install instructions, you would manually \"wrap\" any function you want to monitor. For more information, see Non-web tasks and processes. For instructions on monitoring Celery tasks, see Celery background tasks. What's next after installation? Once you get the agent up and running, some suggested next steps are: Explore your data in and get comfortable with the user interface. Read our docs on our other observability solutions and the APM page. Change your application's name, or other configuration options. Learn about setting up custom instrumentation for application activity not monitored by default. Consider the Python Telemetry SDK. Troubleshooting After you complete the install process, your data should appear in the APM UI within five minutes. If it does not, use these troubleshooting resources: If no data appears, follow these troubleshooting steps. If you experience issues when installing or running the Python agent on a new host, test that the package is installed correctly and that it can contact New Relic's data collector service. For other problems, see the full list of troubleshooting documentation. Check the source code The Python agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "The Python agent API allows you to customize and extend your monitoring. Use the Python agent API to: Manually instrument an unsupported framework or third-party system. Add instrumentation to supplement the agent's default monitoring. This document describes some of the available Python API calls. For a description of all our available APIs, see Introduction to APIs. Custom instrumentation or API If your goal is custom instrumentation, consider using the configuration file method, which allows you to add functions and class methods to the config file that will be auto-instrumented by the agent. The benefit of the config-file method is that it does not require you to change your application code. However, the Python agent API is much more powerful and is best for setting up more complex and tailored instrumentation. To ensure you have access to the full API functionality, update to the latest Python agent. Monitor transactions and segments The Python agent is compatible with most of the common WSGI web frameworks. If the agent supports your framework, web requests automatically will be captured as transactions and displayed in the New Relic One UI. A transaction can also have function-level segments that are captured as part of a transaction trace. Use these methods to monitor web transactions, non-web transactions, and transaction segments: If you want to... Do this... Monitor WSGI web transactions The Python agent automatically captures web transactions for supported frameworks. If you do not have a supported framework, you can use the wsgi_application function to monitor your WSGI entry point. Monitor non-web transactions The Python agent classifies non-web transactions as background tasks. To capture non-web transactions, use background_task. Capture more details about a transaction If your transaction traces do not have the level of detail you want: Use function_trace to capture more function-level detail in transactions. Use datastore_trace to capture more detail about datastore calls. Ignore a transaction Use any of these options: To ignore a transaction altogether, use ignore_transaction. To prevent a transaction from producing a transaction trace, use suppress_transaction_trace. To end a transaction before the agent would end it automatically, use end_of_transaction. Add and edit transaction metadata Sometimes the code you target is visible in our UI, but some details of the method are not useful. For example: The default name is not helpful, or it is causing a metric grouping issue. You want to add custom attributes to your transactions so you can filter them when querying. Use these calls when you want to change the metadata of an existing transaction: If you want to... Do this... Get reference to current transaction To return an object representing the current transaction, use current_transaction. This is required by some other Python agent API calls. Change the name of a transaction Use set_transaction_name. Add metadata (such as a customer's subscription level) to transactions Add custom attributes to your transactions using add_custom_parameter, or use other API calls to report custom data. Mark a transaction as a background job To convert a web transaction into a background task so that it appears as a non-web transaction in the UI, use set_background_task. Prevent a transaction from affecting your Apdex score Use suppress_apdex_metric. See related logs To see logs directly within the context of your application's errors and traces, use the get_linking_metadata API call to annotate your logs. For more information about correlating log data with other telemetry data, see our logs in context documentation. Report custom events and custom metric data The agent reports data in two primary forms: Metric data measures numeric, time-based values; for example, connections per minute. Event data captures discrete event information. Events have key-value attributes attached to them. You can analyze and query event data. Use these methods to create new event data and new metric data: If you want to... Do this... Send data about an event for use when querying your data. Use record_custom_event. Report time-based metrics on application performance To report a single metric, use record_custom_metric. To report a set of metrics, use record_custom_metrics. Report an exception as an error By default, the Python agent only reports unhandled exceptions. To report a Python exception as an error, use notice_error. Report query string parameters For security reasons, query string parameters associated with web transactions are disabled by default. Use capture_request_params to enable them. Tag events with metadata To add attributes to events for more detailed analysis in Insights or error analytics, use add_custom_parameter. Generate metrics from data sources and data factories To generate metrics with a pull-style API rather than the push-style API implemented by record_custom_metric(), use these API calls: register_data_source data_source_generator data_source_factory Message-related calls These API calls allow you to collect performance data on your message-passing architecture or service; for example, RabbitMQ. To use these calls, make sure you have Python agent version 2.88.0.72 or higher. If you want to... Do this... Report messages as a transaction Use message_transaction. Report message details as transaction trace segments Use message_trace. Implement distributed tracing These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. Services and applications monitored by our agents will automatically pass distributed tracing context to each other when using a supported framework. When not using a supported framework, you will need to use the distributed tracing APIs to manually accept this context. Supported web frameworks (for example, Flask, Django, Tornado) will automatically call accept_distributed_trace_payload when creating a transaction. Supported external web services libraries will automatically call create_distributed_trace_payload before making an external HTTP call. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. If you want to... Do this... Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Use create_distributed_trace_payload. Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace Use accept_distributed_trace_payload. Agent configuration, initialization, shutdown These calls help you manage Python agent behavior, such as initializing and integrating the agent, and referencing or changing configuration settings: If you want to... Do this... Initialize the agent To initialize the Python agent with a specific configuration file as part of advanced integration process, use initialize. Get a reference to the application object The application object represents an agent-monitored application and is used by some Python agent API calls. Get a reference to configuration settings To control the Python agent's behavior, you can use configuration settings. To get a reference to config file and environment variable settings and make changes to them, use global_settings. To get a reference to all settings, including server-side configuration from our UI, use application_settings. Shut down the agent To forcibly shut down the agent instead of allowing it to make the standard final attempt to upload data, use shutdown_agent. Control the Browser monitoring agent You can install the browser monitoring agent by automatically adding it to your pages or by deploying it on specific pages by copying and pasting the browser agent JavaScript snippet. You can also control the browser agent by using APM agent API calls. For more information, see Browser agent and the Python agent. If you want to... Do this... Monitor specific page views To inject the browser agent header and footer JavaScript snippets into views you want to monitor, use both get_browser_timing_header and get_browser_timing_footer. Disable monitoring of specific page views To disable browser monitoring for specific page views, use disable_browser_autorum.",

Report message details as transaction trace segments Use message_trace. Implement distributed tracing These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. Services and applications monitored by our agents will automatically pass distributed tracing context to each other when using a supported framework. When not using a supported framework, you will need to use the distributed tracing APIs to manually accept this context. Supported web frameworks (for example, Flask, Django, Tornado) will automatically call accept_distributed_trace_payload when creating a transaction. Supported external web services libraries will automatically call create_distributed_trace_payload before making an external HTTP call. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. If you want to... Do this... Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Use create_distributed_trace_payload. Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace Use accept_distributed_trace_payload. Agent configuration, initialization, shutdown These calls help you manage Python agent behavior, such as initializing and integrating the agent, and referencing or changing configuration settings: If you want to... Do this... Initialize the agent To initialize the Python agent with a specific configuration file as part of advanced integration process, use initialize. Get a reference to the application object The application object represents an agent-monitored application and is used by some Python agent API calls. Get a reference to configuration settings To control the Python agent's behavior, you can use configuration settings. To get a reference to config file and environment variable settings and make changes to them, use global_settings. To get a reference to all settings, including server-side configuration from our UI, use application_settings. Shut down the agent To forcibly shut down the agent instead of allowing it to make the standard final attempt to upload data, use shutdown_agent. Control the Browser monitoring agent You can install the browser monitoring agent by automatically adding it to your pages or by deploying it on specific pages by copying and pasting the browser agent JavaScript snippet. You can also control the browser agent by using APM agent API calls. For more information, see Browser agent and the Python agent. If you want to... Do this... Monitor specific page views To inject the browser agent header and footer JavaScript snippets into views you want to monitor, use both get_browser_timing_header and get_browser_timing_footer. Disable monitoring of specific page views To disable browser monitoring for specific page views, use disable_browser_autorum.",

      "body": "Our Python agent monitors your Python application to help you identify and solve performance issues. You can also extend your performance monitoring to collect and analyze business data to help you improve the customer experience and make data-driven business decisions. With flexible options for custom instrumentation and APIs, The Python agent offers multiple building blocks to customize the data you need from your app. Our Python works with a wide variety of web frameworks and hosting mechanisms, including Django, Gunicorn, WSGI, CherryPy, uWSGI, and more. You can also install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Monitor app performance After you install the Python agent, it begins to collect data about your app. You can view the data as charts and tables in New Relic One. View the big picture of your app. Monitor your app's Apdex (user satisfaction). Get a high-level summary of your app with Summary page. Enable distributed tracing to see activity across an architecture having many services. Install Infrastructure monitoring and view detailed server/host data for your app. Find errors and problems quickly. Track key transactions specific to your business. Create custom dashboards for important metrics. Alert your team when an error or problem occurs before it affects your users. View performance after a deployment. Drill down into performance details. Examine code-level transaction traces. Examine database query traces. Examine error traces. Use thread profiler sessions to see detailed stack traces of sampled threads View logs for your APM and infrastructure data Bring your logs and application's data together to make troubleshooting easier and faster. No need to switch to another UI page in New Relic One. With logs in context, you can see log messages related to your errors and traces directly in your app's UI. You can also see logs in context of your infrastructure data, such as Kubernetes clusters. Extend agent instrumentation Other helpful tools include: Tools Description Browser monitoring Integrate the Python agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user browser activity. Simple scripts and background tasks Monitor job-based or task queuing systems, like Celery, or other standalone non-web functions. Business data analysis with data exploration. Use the Python agent with our data explorer to organize, query, and visualize your data to answer key questions about application performance and customer experience. Use default transaction attributes, or add your own. Query your data using the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). Send your own event data. Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards. Install the Python agent Before you install the Python agent, make sure your system meets the system requirements. You must also create a New Relic account. We support a number of web frameworks and libraries right out of the box, including Django, WSGI, and Gunicorn. If you use one of the supported web frameworks, installation is easy. If you use an unsupported framework, the process will involve some additions to your app code and/or web server files. For a quick and simple install process that will work for the majority of setups, follow these simple steps: Download and install the Python package. Create config file. Integrate the Python agent with your application. Read the Quick Start guide Add Python data Monitor non-web scripts, background tasks, and functions The Python agent also lets you monitor non-web scripts, worker processes, tasks, and functions. The installation process for these non-web transactions is similar to the one used for a web app, with one major difference: instead of going through the standard integration process described in the install instructions, you would manually \"wrap\" any function you want to monitor. For more information, see Non-web tasks and processes. For instructions on monitoring Celery tasks, see Celery background tasks. What's next after installation? Once you get the agent up and running, some suggested next steps are: Explore your data in and get comfortable with the user interface. Read our docs on our other observability solutions and the APM page. Change your application's name, or other configuration options. Learn about setting up custom instrumentation for application activity not monitored by default. Consider the Python Telemetry SDK. Troubleshooting After you complete the install process, your data should appear in the APM UI within five minutes. If it does not, use these troubleshooting resources: If no data appears, follow these troubleshooting steps. If you experience issues when installing or running the Python agent on a new host, test that the package is installed correctly and that it can contact New Relic's data collector service. For other problems, see the full list of troubleshooting documentation. Check the source code The Python agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "Before you install New Relic's Python agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Basic requirements The Python agent supports many of the most common Python web frameworks. Additional configuration may be required depending on your specific hosting mechanism, hosting service, web framework, or back-end services. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Resource Requirements Operating systems UNIX-like operating systems including Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and macOS. The Python agent does not support Windows environments. Python Python (CPython/PyPy) versions supported: 2.7, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, and 3.10. Recommendation: Use Python version 3.6 or higher with our agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3 are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. Python version 3.4 is supported only by Python agent versions 4.20.0.120 or lower. Python version 3.5 is supported only by Python agent versions 5.24.0.153 or lower. Python versions 2.7 and 3.6 follow our end of life (EOL) support requirements. Supported web frameworks Supported web frameworks include: Aiohttp Bottle CherryPy Django Falcon FastAPI Flask GraphQL gRPC Pylons Pyramid Sanic Starlette Tornado 6 Web2Py Unsupported frameworks Some WSGI servers, frameworks, and apps have special requirements. Although a specific Python WSGI web framework may not be supported, you can still use the agent. For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333). For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule. The version support policy does not replace our general end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Python agent with support 3.10 October 04, 2021 October 12, 2021 3.11 October 03, 2022 November 2022 End of support for Python releases reaching EOL The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Python agent dropping support 3.6 December 2021 Python agent versions released after March 2022 will not support Python 3.6. For more information, see our Python agent release notes. 2.7 January 1, 2020 TBD Connect the agent to other capabilities The Python agent integrates with other capabilities to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Python agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Python agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure monitoring and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure monitoring UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

You can also extend your performance monitoring to collect and analyze business data to help you improve the customer experience and make data-driven business decisions. With flexible options for custom instrumentation and APIs, The Python agent offers multiple building blocks to customize the data you need from your app. Our Python works with a wide variety of web frameworks and hosting mechanisms, including Django, Gunicorn, WSGI, CherryPy, uWSGI, and more. You can also install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Monitor app performance After you install the Python agent, it begins to collect data about your app. You can view the data as charts and tables in New Relic One. View the big picture of your app. Monitor your app's Apdex (user satisfaction). Get a high-level summary of your app with Summary page. Enable distributed tracing to see activity across an architecture having many services. Install Infrastructure monitoring and view detailed server/host data for your app. Find errors and problems quickly. Track key transactions specific to your business. Create custom dashboards for important metrics. Alert your team when an error or problem occurs before it affects your users. View performance after a deployment. Drill down into performance details. Examine code-level transaction traces. Examine database query traces. Examine error traces. Use thread profiler sessions to see detailed stack traces of sampled threads View logs for your APM and infrastructure data Bring your logs and application's data together to make troubleshooting easier and faster. No need to switch to another UI page in New Relic One. With logs in context, you can see log messages related to your errors and traces directly in your app's UI. You can also see logs in context of your infrastructure data, such as Kubernetes clusters. Extend agent instrumentation Other helpful tools include: Tools Description Browser monitoring Integrate the Python agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user browser activity. Simple scripts and background tasks Monitor job-based or task queuing systems, like Celery, or other standalone non-web functions. Business data analysis with data exploration. Use the Python agent with our data explorer to organize, query, and visualize your data to answer key questions about application performance and customer experience. Use default transaction attributes, or add your own. Query your data using the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). Send your own event data. Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards. Install the Python agent Before you install the Python agent, make sure your system meets the system requirements. You must also create a New Relic account. We support a number of web frameworks and libraries right out of the box, including Django, WSGI, and Gunicorn. If you use one of the supported web frameworks, installation is easy. If you use an unsupported framework, the process will involve some additions to your app code and/or web server files. For a quick and simple install process that will work for the majority of setups, follow these simple steps: Download and install the Python package. Create config file. Integrate the Python agent with your application. Read the Quick Start guide Add Python data Monitor non-web scripts, background tasks, and functions The Python agent also lets you monitor non-web scripts, worker processes, tasks, and functions. The installation process for these non-web transactions is similar to the one used for a web app, with one major difference: instead of going through the standard integration process described in the install instructions, you would manually \"wrap\" any function you want to monitor. For more information, see Non-web tasks and processes. For instructions on monitoring Celery tasks, see Celery background tasks. What's next after installation? Once you get the agent up and running, some suggested next steps are: Explore your data in and get comfortable with the user interface. Read our docs on our other observability solutions and the APM page. Change your application's name, or other configuration options. Learn about setting up custom instrumentation for application activity not monitored by default. Consider the Python Telemetry SDK. Troubleshooting After you complete the install process, your data should appear in the APM UI within five minutes. If it does not, use these troubleshooting resources: If no data appears, follow these troubleshooting steps. If you experience issues when installing or running the Python agent on a new host, test that the package is installed correctly and that it can contact New Relic's data collector service. For other problems, see the full list of troubleshooting documentation. Check the source code The Python agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "The Python agent API allows you to customize and extend your monitoring. Use the Python agent API to: Manually instrument an unsupported framework or third-party system. Add instrumentation to supplement the agent's default monitoring. This document describes some of the available Python API calls. For a description of all our available APIs, see Introduction to APIs. Custom instrumentation or API If your goal is custom instrumentation, consider using the configuration file method, which allows you to add functions and class methods to the config file that will be auto-instrumented by the agent. The benefit of the config-file method is that it does not require you to change your application code. However, the Python agent API is much more powerful and is best for setting up more complex and tailored instrumentation. To ensure you have access to the full API functionality, update to the latest Python agent. Monitor transactions and segments The Python agent is compatible with most of the common WSGI web frameworks. If the agent supports your framework, web requests automatically will be captured as transactions and displayed in the New Relic One UI. A transaction can also have function-level segments that are captured as part of a transaction trace. Use these methods to monitor web transactions, non-web transactions, and transaction segments: If you want to... Do this... Monitor WSGI web transactions The Python agent automatically captures web transactions for supported frameworks. If you do not have a supported framework, you can use the wsgi_application function to monitor your WSGI entry point. Monitor non-web transactions The Python agent classifies non-web transactions as background tasks. To capture non-web transactions, use background_task. Capture more details about a transaction If your transaction traces do not have the level of detail you want: Use function_trace to capture more function-level detail in transactions. Use datastore_trace to capture more detail about datastore calls. Ignore a transaction Use any of these options: To ignore a transaction altogether, use ignore_transaction. To prevent a transaction from producing a transaction trace, use suppress_transaction_trace. To end a transaction before the agent would end it automatically, use end_of_transaction. Add and edit transaction metadata Sometimes the code you target is visible in our UI, but some details of the method are not useful. For example: The default name is not helpful, or it is causing a metric grouping issue. You want to add custom attributes to your transactions so you can filter them when querying. Use these calls when you want to change the metadata of an existing transaction: If you want to... Do this... Get reference to current transaction To return an object representing the current transaction, use current_transaction. This is required by some other Python agent API calls. Change the name of a transaction Use set_transaction_name. Add metadata (such as a customer's subscription level) to transactions Add custom attributes to your transactions using add_custom_parameter, or use other API calls to report custom data. Mark a transaction as a background job To convert a web transaction into a background task so that it appears as a non-web transaction in the UI, use set_background_task. Prevent a transaction from affecting your Apdex score Use suppress_apdex_metric. See related logs To see logs directly within the context of your application's errors and traces, use the get_linking_metadata API call to annotate your logs. For more information about correlating log data with other telemetry data, see our logs in context documentation. Report custom events and custom metric data The agent reports data in two primary forms: Metric data measures numeric, time-based values; for example, connections per minute. Event data captures discrete event information. Events have key-value attributes attached to them. You can analyze and query event data. Use these methods to create new event data and new metric data: If you want to... Do this... Send data about an event for use when querying your data. Use record_custom_event. Report time-based metrics on application performance To report a single metric, use record_custom_metric. To report a set of metrics, use record_custom_metrics. Report an exception as an error By default, the Python agent only reports unhandled exceptions. To report a Python exception as an error, use notice_error. Report query string parameters For security reasons, query string parameters associated with web transactions are disabled by default. Use capture_request_params to enable them. Tag events with metadata To add attributes to events for more detailed analysis in Insights or error analytics, use add_custom_parameter. Generate metrics from data sources and data factories To generate metrics with a pull-style API rather than the push-style API implemented by record_custom_metric(), use these API calls: register_data_source data_source_generator data_source_factory Message-related calls These API calls allow you to collect performance data on your message-passing architecture or service; for example, RabbitMQ. To use these calls, make sure you have Python agent version 2.88.0.72 or higher. If you want to... Do this... Report messages as a transaction Use message_transaction. Report message details as transaction trace segments Use message_trace. Implement distributed tracing These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. Services and applications monitored by our agents will automatically pass distributed tracing context to each other when using a supported framework. When not using a supported framework, you will need to use the distributed tracing APIs to manually accept this context. Supported web frameworks (for example, Flask, Django, Tornado) will automatically call accept_distributed_trace_payload when creating a transaction. Supported external web services libraries will automatically call create_distributed_trace_payload before making an external HTTP call. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. If you want to... Do this... Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Use create_distributed_trace_payload. Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace Use accept_distributed_trace_payload. Agent configuration, initialization, shutdown These calls help you manage Python agent behavior, such as initializing and integrating the agent, and referencing or changing configuration settings: If you want to... Do this... Initialize the agent To initialize the Python agent with a specific configuration file as part of advanced integration process, use initialize. Get a reference to the application object The application object represents an agent-monitored application and is used by some Python agent API calls. Get a reference to configuration settings To control the Python agent's behavior, you can use configuration settings. To get a reference to config file and environment variable settings and make changes to them, use global_settings. To get a reference to all settings, including server-side configuration from our UI, use application_settings. Shut down the agent To forcibly shut down the agent instead of allowing it to make the standard final attempt to upload data, use shutdown_agent. Control the Browser monitoring agent You can install the browser monitoring agent by automatically adding it to your pages or by deploying it on specific pages by copying and pasting the browser agent JavaScript snippet. You can also control the browser agent by using APM agent API calls. For more information, see Browser agent and the Python agent. If you want to... Do this... Monitor specific page views To inject the browser agent header and footer JavaScript snippets into views you want to monitor, use both get_browser_timing_header and get_browser_timing_footer. Disable monitoring of specific page views To disable browser monitoring for specific page views, use disable_browser_autorum.",

      "body": "Our Python agent monitors your Python application to help you identify and solve performance issues. You can also extend your performance monitoring to collect and analyze business data to help you improve the customer experience and make data-driven business decisions. With flexible options for custom instrumentation and APIs, The Python agent offers multiple building blocks to customize the data you need from your app. Our Python works with a wide variety of web frameworks and hosting mechanisms, including Django, Gunicorn, WSGI, CherryPy, uWSGI, and more. You can also install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Monitor app performance After you install the Python agent, it begins to collect data about your app. You can view the data as charts and tables in New Relic One. View the big picture of your app. Monitor your app's Apdex (user satisfaction). Get a high-level summary of your app with Summary page. Enable distributed tracing to see activity across an architecture having many services. Install Infrastructure monitoring and view detailed server/host data for your app. Find errors and problems quickly. Track key transactions specific to your business. Create custom dashboards for important metrics. Alert your team when an error or problem occurs before it affects your users. View performance after a deployment. Drill down into performance details. Examine code-level transaction traces. Examine database query traces. Examine error traces. Use thread profiler sessions to see detailed stack traces of sampled threads View logs for your APM and infrastructure data Bring your logs and application's data together to make troubleshooting easier and faster. No need to switch to another UI page in New Relic One. With logs in context, you can see log messages related to your errors and traces directly in your app's UI. You can also see logs in context of your infrastructure data, such as Kubernetes clusters. Extend agent instrumentation Other helpful tools include: Tools Description Browser monitoring Integrate the Python agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user browser activity. Simple scripts and background tasks Monitor job-based or task queuing systems, like Celery, or other standalone non-web functions. Business data analysis with data exploration. Use the Python agent with our data explorer to organize, query, and visualize your data to answer key questions about application performance and customer experience. Use default transaction attributes, or add your own. Query your data using the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). Send your own event data. Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards. Install the Python agent Before you install the Python agent, make sure your system meets the system requirements. You must also create a New Relic account. We support a number of web frameworks and libraries right out of the box, including Django, WSGI, and Gunicorn. If you use one of the supported web frameworks, installation is easy. If you use an unsupported framework, the process will involve some additions to your app code and/or web server files. For a quick and simple install process that will work for the majority of setups, follow these simple steps: Download and install the Python package. Create config file. Integrate the Python agent with your application. Read the Quick Start guide Add Python data Monitor non-web scripts, background tasks, and functions The Python agent also lets you monitor non-web scripts, worker processes, tasks, and functions. The installation process for these non-web transactions is similar to the one used for a web app, with one major difference: instead of going through the standard integration process described in the install instructions, you would manually \"wrap\" any function you want to monitor. For more information, see Non-web tasks and processes. For instructions on monitoring Celery tasks, see Celery background tasks. What's next after installation? Once you get the agent up and running, some suggested next steps are: Explore your data in and get comfortable with the user interface. Read our docs on our other observability solutions and the APM page. Change your application's name, or other configuration options. Learn about setting up custom instrumentation for application activity not monitored by default. Consider the Python Telemetry SDK. Troubleshooting After you complete the install process, your data should appear in the APM UI within five minutes. If it does not, use these troubleshooting resources: If no data appears, follow these troubleshooting steps. If you experience issues when installing or running the Python agent on a new host, test that the package is installed correctly and that it can contact New Relic's data collector service. For other problems, see the full list of troubleshooting documentation. Check the source code The Python agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "The Python agent API allows you to customize and extend your monitoring. Use the Python agent API to: Manually instrument an unsupported framework or third-party system. Add instrumentation to supplement the agent's default monitoring. This document describes some of the available Python API calls. For a description of all our available APIs, see Introduction to APIs. Custom instrumentation or API If your goal is custom instrumentation, consider using the configuration file method, which allows you to add functions and class methods to the config file that will be auto-instrumented by the agent. The benefit of the config-file method is that it does not require you to change your application code. However, the Python agent API is much more powerful and is best for setting up more complex and tailored instrumentation. To ensure you have access to the full API functionality, update to the latest Python agent. Monitor transactions and segments The Python agent is compatible with most of the common WSGI web frameworks. If the agent supports your framework, web requests automatically will be captured as transactions and displayed in the New Relic One UI. A transaction can also have function-level segments that are captured as part of a transaction trace. Use these methods to monitor web transactions, non-web transactions, and transaction segments: If you want to... Do this... Monitor WSGI web transactions The Python agent automatically captures web transactions for supported frameworks. If you do not have a supported framework, you can use the wsgi_application function to monitor your WSGI entry point. Monitor non-web transactions The Python agent classifies non-web transactions as background tasks. To capture non-web transactions, use background_task. Capture more details about a transaction If your transaction traces do not have the level of detail you want: Use function_trace to capture more function-level detail in transactions. Use datastore_trace to capture more detail about datastore calls. Ignore a transaction Use any of these options: To ignore a transaction altogether, use ignore_transaction. To prevent a transaction from producing a transaction trace, use suppress_transaction_trace. To end a transaction before the agent would end it automatically, use end_of_transaction. Add and edit transaction metadata Sometimes the code you target is visible in our UI, but some details of the method are not useful. For example: The default name is not helpful, or it is causing a metric grouping issue. You want to add custom attributes to your transactions so you can filter them when querying. Use these calls when you want to change the metadata of an existing transaction: If you want to... Do this... Get reference to current transaction To return an object representing the current transaction, use current_transaction. This is required by some other Python agent API calls. Change the name of a transaction Use set_transaction_name. Add metadata (such as a customer's subscription level) to transactions Add custom attributes to your transactions using add_custom_parameter, or use other API calls to report custom data. Mark a transaction as a background job To convert a web transaction into a background task so that it appears as a non-web transaction in the UI, use set_background_task. Prevent a transaction from affecting your Apdex score Use suppress_apdex_metric. See related logs To see logs directly within the context of your application's errors and traces, use the get_linking_metadata API call to annotate your logs. For more information about correlating log data with other telemetry data, see our logs in context documentation. Report custom events and custom metric data The agent reports data in two primary forms: Metric data measures numeric, time-based values; for example, connections per minute. Event data captures discrete event information. Events have key-value attributes attached to them. You can analyze and query event data. Use these methods to create new event data and new metric data: If you want to... Do this... Send data about an event for use when querying your data. Use record_custom_event. Report time-based metrics on application performance To report a single metric, use record_custom_metric. To report a set of metrics, use record_custom_metrics. Report an exception as an error By default, the Python agent only reports unhandled exceptions. To report a Python exception as an error, use notice_error. Report query string parameters For security reasons, query string parameters associated with web transactions are disabled by default. Use capture_request_params to enable them. Tag events with metadata To add attributes to events for more detailed analysis in Insights or error analytics, use add_custom_parameter. Generate metrics from data sources and data factories To generate metrics with a pull-style API rather than the push-style API implemented by record_custom_metric(), use these API calls: register_data_source data_source_generator data_source_factory Message-related calls These API calls allow you to collect performance data on your message-passing architecture or service; for example, RabbitMQ. To use these calls, make sure you have Python agent version 2.88.0.72 or higher. If you want to... Do this... Report messages as a transaction Use message_transaction. Report message details as transaction trace segments Use message_trace. Implement distributed tracing These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. Services and applications monitored by our agents will automatically pass distributed tracing context to each other when using a supported framework. When not using a supported framework, you will need to use the distributed tracing APIs to manually accept this context. Supported web frameworks (for example, Flask, Django, Tornado) will automatically call accept_distributed_trace_payload when creating a transaction. Supported external web services libraries will automatically call create_distributed_trace_payload before making an external HTTP call. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. If you want to... Do this... Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Use create_distributed_trace_payload. Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace Use accept_distributed_trace_payload. Agent configuration, initialization, shutdown These calls help you manage Python agent behavior, such as initializing and integrating the agent, and referencing or changing configuration settings: If you want to... Do this... Initialize the agent To initialize the Python agent with a specific configuration file as part of advanced integration process, use initialize. Get a reference to the application object The application object represents an agent-monitored application and is used by some Python agent API calls. Get a reference to configuration settings To control the Python agent's behavior, you can use configuration settings. To get a reference to config file and environment variable settings and make changes to them, use global_settings. To get a reference to all settings, including server-side configuration from our UI, use application_settings. Shut down the agent To forcibly shut down the agent instead of allowing it to make the standard final attempt to upload data, use shutdown_agent. Control the Browser monitoring agent You can install the browser monitoring agent by automatically adding it to your pages or by deploying it on specific pages by copying and pasting the browser agent JavaScript snippet. You can also control the browser agent by using APM agent API calls. For more information, see Browser agent and the Python agent. If you want to... Do this... Monitor specific page views To inject the browser agent header and footer JavaScript snippets into views you want to monitor, use both get_browser_timing_header and get_browser_timing_footer. Disable monitoring of specific page views To disable browser monitoring for specific page views, use disable_browser_autorum.",

      "body": "The Python agent API allows you to customize and extend your monitoring. Use the Python agent API to: Manually instrument an unsupported framework or third-party system. Add instrumentation to supplement the agent's default monitoring. This document describes some of the available Python API calls. For a description of all our available APIs, see Introduction to APIs. Custom instrumentation or API If your goal is custom instrumentation, consider using the configuration file method, which allows you to add functions and class methods to the config file that will be auto-instrumented by the agent. The benefit of the config-file method is that it does not require you to change your application code. However, the Python agent API is much more powerful and is best for setting up more complex and tailored instrumentation. To ensure you have access to the full API functionality, update to the latest Python agent. Monitor transactions and segments The Python agent is compatible with most of the common WSGI web frameworks. If the agent supports your framework, web requests automatically will be captured as transactions and displayed in the New Relic One UI. A transaction can also have function-level segments that are captured as part of a transaction trace. Use these methods to monitor web transactions, non-web transactions, and transaction segments: If you want to... Do this... Monitor WSGI web transactions The Python agent automatically captures web transactions for supported frameworks. If you do not have a supported framework, you can use the wsgi_application function to monitor your WSGI entry point. Monitor non-web transactions The Python agent classifies non-web transactions as background tasks. To capture non-web transactions, use background_task. Capture more details about a transaction If your transaction traces do not have the level of detail you want: Use function_trace to capture more function-level detail in transactions. Use datastore_trace to capture more detail about datastore calls. Ignore a transaction Use any of these options: To ignore a transaction altogether, use ignore_transaction. To prevent a transaction from producing a transaction trace, use suppress_transaction_trace. To end a transaction before the agent would end it automatically, use end_of_transaction. Add and edit transaction metadata Sometimes the code you target is visible in our UI, but some details of the method are not useful. For example: The default name is not helpful, or it is causing a metric grouping issue. You want to add custom attributes to your transactions so you can filter them when querying. Use these calls when you want to change the metadata of an existing transaction: If you want to... Do this... Get reference to current transaction To return an object representing the current transaction, use current_transaction. This is required by some other Python agent API calls. Change the name of a transaction Use set_transaction_name. Add metadata (such as a customer's subscription level) to transactions Add custom attributes to your transactions using add_custom_parameter, or use other API calls to report custom data. Mark a transaction as a background job To convert a web transaction into a background task so that it appears as a non-web transaction in the UI, use set_background_task. Prevent a transaction from affecting your Apdex score Use suppress_apdex_metric. See related logs To see logs directly within the context of your application's errors and traces, use the get_linking_metadata API call to annotate your logs. For more information about correlating log data with other telemetry data, see our logs in context documentation. Report custom events and custom metric data The agent reports data in two primary forms: Metric data measures numeric, time-based values; for example, connections per minute. Event data captures discrete event information. Events have key-value attributes attached to them. You can analyze and query event data. Use these methods to create new event data and new metric data: If you want to... Do this... Send data about an event for use when querying your data. Use record_custom_event. Report time-based metrics on application performance To report a single metric, use record_custom_metric. To report a set of metrics, use record_custom_metrics. Report an exception as an error By default, the Python agent only reports unhandled exceptions. To report a Python exception as an error, use notice_error. Report query string parameters For security reasons, query string parameters associated with web transactions are disabled by default. Use capture_request_params to enable them. Tag events with metadata To add attributes to events for more detailed analysis in Insights or error analytics, use add_custom_parameter. Generate metrics from data sources and data factories To generate metrics with a pull-style API rather than the push-style API implemented by record_custom_metric(), use these API calls: register_data_source data_source_generator data_source_factory Message-related calls These API calls allow you to collect performance data on your message-passing architecture or service; for example, RabbitMQ. To use these calls, make sure you have Python agent version 2.88.0.72 or higher. If you want to... Do this... Report messages as a transaction Use message_transaction. Report message details as transaction trace segments Use message_trace. Implement distributed tracing These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. Services and applications monitored by our agents will automatically pass distributed tracing context to each other when using a supported framework. When not using a supported framework, you will need to use the distributed tracing APIs to manually accept this context. Supported web frameworks (for example, Flask, Django, Tornado) will automatically call accept_distributed_trace_payload when creating a transaction. Supported external web services libraries will automatically call create_distributed_trace_payload before making an external HTTP call. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. If you want to... Do this... Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Use create_distributed_trace_payload. Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace Use accept_distributed_trace_payload. Agent configuration, initialization, shutdown These calls help you manage Python agent behavior, such as initializing and integrating the agent, and referencing or changing configuration settings: If you want to... Do this... Initialize the agent To initialize the Python agent with a specific configuration file as part of advanced integration process, use initialize. Get a reference to the application object The application object represents an agent-monitored application and is used by some Python agent API calls. Get a reference to configuration settings To control the Python agent's behavior, you can use configuration settings. To get a reference to config file and environment variable settings and make changes to them, use global_settings. To get a reference to all settings, including server-side configuration from our UI, use application_settings. Shut down the agent To forcibly shut down the agent instead of allowing it to make the standard final attempt to upload data, use shutdown_agent. Control the Browser monitoring agent You can install the browser monitoring agent by automatically adding it to your pages or by deploying it on specific pages by copying and pasting the browser agent JavaScript snippet. You can also control the browser agent by using APM agent API calls. For more information, see Browser agent and the Python agent. If you want to... Do this... Monitor specific page views To inject the browser agent header and footer JavaScript snippets into views you want to monitor, use both get_browser_timing_header and get_browser_timing_footer. Disable monitoring of specific page views To disable browser monitoring for specific page views, use disable_browser_autorum.",

      "body": "You can extend the Python agent's monitoring to trace time spent in additional functions or methods of classes by modifying your configuration file. This form of custom instrumentation is simpler to implement than API calls, and does not require you to modify your code. However, for more complex needs, you may need to implement Python instrumentation by API. Listing functions in the configuration file To extend instrumentation to designated functions and class methods, add them to the transaction_tracer.function_trace setting within the newrelic section of the agent configuration file. The identifier for a function should have the form module:function and that of a class method module:class.function. Using dumbdbm In this example, you use the Python dumbdbm module and want to instrument the time it took to open a database, and then to write that database back to a file. In this case you would use: transaction_tracer.function_trace = dumbdbm:open dumbdbm:_Database._commit Copy To list more than one item, use either of these methods: One line: Separate each item with a space. Multiple lines: Follow the ini file convention to indent the subsequent lines. When data is reported for the instrumented function, the metric will have a name in the form Function/module:function or Function/module:class.function. In the performance breakdown for a transaction, the category will show as Function and the segment will be module:function or module:class.function. For slow transaction traces, only the segment name appears. Note that where a function is actually returning a generator, only the time spent in returning the generator will be recorded and not the consumption of the values from the generator. Restrictions on wrapping extension APIs When wrapping functions by listing them in the agent configuration file, you cannot designate class methods this way when the method is a member of a class which is implemented in C code by a C extension module. This is because it is not possible to modify the method table of a type implemented using the Python C API. Overriding the reported function name When using the transaction_tracer.function_trace setting in the agent configuration file, the name of the function will be used in the metric name, with it being classified as a Function. If it is necessary to override what function name may be used in the metric name or classify it differently, then an alternate means of defining the function trace in the configuration file can be used. The equivalent for: transaction_tracer.function_trace = dumbdbm:open dumbdbm:_Database._commit Copy would be to create two new configuration sections in the agent configuration file, one for each function to be traced: [function-trace:dumbdbm-1] enabled = true function = dumbdbm:open name = dumbdbm:open group = Function [function-trace:dumbdbm-2] enabled = true function = dumbdbm:_Database._commit name = dumbdbm:_Database._commit group = Function Copy The ini file section name should start with function-trace:. The name component that follows that prefix can be anything but should be unique across all function trace sections in the configuration file. The group and name settings can be overridden as necessary to arrive at the desired metric name. The enabled setting defaults to false and needs to be set to true to enable the function trace. Instrument with the API For simple custom instrumentation purposes, the config file method works well. For more precise and customized instrumentation and agent behavior adjustments, you will want to use the Python agent API.",

Python version 3.5 is supported only by Python agent versions 5.24.0.153 or lower. Python versions 2.7 and 3.6 follow our end of life (EOL) support requirements. Supported web frameworks Supported web frameworks include: Aiohttp Bottle CherryPy Django Falcon FastAPI Flask GraphQL gRPC Pylons Pyramid Sanic Starlette Tornado 6 Web2Py Unsupported frameworks Some WSGI servers, frameworks, and apps have special requirements. Although a specific Python WSGI web framework may not be supported, you can still use the agent. For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333). For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule. The version support policy does not replace our general end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Python agent with support 3.10 October 04, 2021 October 12, 2021 3.11 October 03, 2022 November 2022 End of support for Python releases reaching EOL The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Python agent dropping support 3.6 December 2021 Python agent versions released after March 2022 will not support Python 3.6. For more information, see our Python agent release notes. 2.7 January 1, 2020 TBD Connect the agent to other capabilities The Python agent integrates with other capabilities to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Python agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Python agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure monitoring and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure monitoring UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

      "body": "Our Python agent monitors your Python application to help you identify and solve performance issues. You can also extend your performance monitoring to collect and analyze business data to help you improve the customer experience and make data-driven business decisions. With flexible options for custom instrumentation and APIs, The Python agent offers multiple building blocks to customize the data you need from your app. Our Python works with a wide variety of web frameworks and hosting mechanisms, including Django, Gunicorn, WSGI, CherryPy, uWSGI, and more. You can also install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Monitor app performance After you install the Python agent, it begins to collect data about your app. You can view the data as charts and tables in New Relic One. View the big picture of your app. Monitor your app's Apdex (user satisfaction). Get a high-level summary of your app with Summary page. Enable distributed tracing to see activity across an architecture having many services. Install Infrastructure monitoring and view detailed server/host data for your app. Find errors and problems quickly. Track key transactions specific to your business. Create custom dashboards for important metrics. Alert your team when an error or problem occurs before it affects your users. View performance after a deployment. Drill down into performance details. Examine code-level transaction traces. Examine database query traces. Examine error traces. Use thread profiler sessions to see detailed stack traces of sampled threads View logs for your APM and infrastructure data Bring your logs and application's data together to make troubleshooting easier and faster. No need to switch to another UI page in New Relic One. With logs in context, you can see log messages related to your errors and traces directly in your app's UI. You can also see logs in context of your infrastructure data, such as Kubernetes clusters. Extend agent instrumentation Other helpful tools include: Tools Description Browser monitoring Integrate the Python agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user browser activity. Simple scripts and background tasks Monitor job-based or task queuing systems, like Celery, or other standalone non-web functions. Business data analysis with data exploration. Use the Python agent with our data explorer to organize, query, and visualize your data to answer key questions about application performance and customer experience. Use default transaction attributes, or add your own. Query your data using the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). Send your own event data. Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards. Install the Python agent Before you install the Python agent, make sure your system meets the system requirements. You must also create a New Relic account. We support a number of web frameworks and libraries right out of the box, including Django, WSGI, and Gunicorn. If you use one of the supported web frameworks, installation is easy. If you use an unsupported framework, the process will involve some additions to your app code and/or web server files. For a quick and simple install process that will work for the majority of setups, follow these simple steps: Download and install the Python package. Create config file. Integrate the Python agent with your application. Read the Quick Start guide Add Python data Monitor non-web scripts, background tasks, and functions The Python agent also lets you monitor non-web scripts, worker processes, tasks, and functions. The installation process for these non-web transactions is similar to the one used for a web app, with one major difference: instead of going through the standard integration process described in the install instructions, you would manually \"wrap\" any function you want to monitor. For more information, see Non-web tasks and processes. For instructions on monitoring Celery tasks, see Celery background tasks. What's next after installation? Once you get the agent up and running, some suggested next steps are: Explore your data in and get comfortable with the user interface. Read our docs on our other observability solutions and the APM page. Change your application's name, or other configuration options. Learn about setting up custom instrumentation for application activity not monitored by default. Consider the Python Telemetry SDK. Troubleshooting After you complete the install process, your data should appear in the APM UI within five minutes. If it does not, use these troubleshooting resources: If no data appears, follow these troubleshooting steps. If you experience issues when installing or running the Python agent on a new host, test that the package is installed correctly and that it can contact New Relic's data collector service. For other problems, see the full list of troubleshooting documentation. Check the source code The Python agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

No need to switch to another UI page in New Relic One. With logs in context, you can see log messages related to your errors and traces directly in your app's UI. You can also see logs in context of your infrastructure data, such as Kubernetes clusters. Analyze business data Use the PHP agent to organize, query, and visualize your data to answer key questions about application performance and customer experience. Use default transaction attributes or add your own Query your data using NRQL Send your own event data Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards Architecture The PHP agent has two binaries that work together to forward data to New Relic: The agent handles automatic and API instrumentation of your PHP code. The daemon acts as a proxy between the agent and the New Relic platform. You can connect up to 500 applications/agents to one daemon. The daemon imposes sampling when the harvest cycle limits are reached, so consider this when deciding how many applications/agents to connect to a single daemon. Tip The number of applications/agents per daemon may be lower when running in separate Docker containers, depending on the capacity of the connection between containers. The flow of data from your PHP applications to New Relic. The workflow between your application and New Relic must occur in this order: The agent establishes a socket connection with the daemon by sending the first payload of instrumentation data. The daemon establishes an HTTPS link with the New Relic platform. The daemon must be invoked before your instrumented application is invoked. This is called agent mode and is the default. To avoid losing reported data, make sure your instrumented application doesn't send transactions before both connections are established. Install the agent Before you install the PHP agent, ensure your system meets the system requirements. The PHP agent supports many of the most common PHP frameworks, databases, and libraries. You can also use the agent in a Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment. Tip If you are installing the agent on a shared hosting service, ensure you have root permissions to install the agent or contact your hosting provider for technical assistance. To install the agent, sign up for New Relic first. Once logged in, use our launcher, or see the instructions for specific installations. Add PHP data For standard installations, see: PHP agent installation overview (the basic installation steps for the most common setups). Installing on RedHat or CentOS Installing on Ubuntu or Debian Installing with tar archive (generic method to use on any supported systems such as Linux variants, OpenSolaris, SmartOS, FreeBSD, macOS, etc) The newrelic-install script (how to use the interactive script that automates some installation tasks) For other types of PHP installations and advanced installation topics, see: PHP agent installation: Non-standard PHP Starting the PHP daemon (a standard New Relic installation starts the daemon automatically, but you can also start the daemon manually) Silent mode for the install script Google App Engine (GAE) flex environment installation for New Relic's PHP agent Configure the agent The agent includes a variety of configuration options to further customize and fine-tune your installation. Tip The most important part of agent configuration is to give your app a descriptive name. New Relic uses this app name to aggregate metrics when you have multiple apps or hosts. After changing any agent configuration options, restart your web server. Extend agent instrumentation After installing the agent, go further and extend the agent's instrumentation: Page load timing: Integrate the PHP agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user activity. Custom instrumentation: Instrument transactions not captured as part of our framework instrumentation. Agent API: Use the agent API to customize the agent's behavior. For example, you can collect custom metrics, flag an error, or ignore a particular transaction entirely. Agent attributes: Customize the attributes attached to transactions. Customizing attributes allows you to avoid sending sensitive attributes, or to collect additional attributes for deeper visibility into your transactions. Troubleshoot your installation If you encounter issues with the PHP agent, see our full list of troubleshooting documentation. Common installation issues include: No data appears (PHP) Determining permissions requirements INI settings not taking effect immediately Why and when to restart your web server (PHP)",

Extend agent instrumentation Other helpful tools include: Tools Description Browser monitoring Integrate the Python agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user browser activity. Simple scripts and background tasks Monitor job-based or task queuing systems, like Celery, or other standalone non-web functions. Business data analysis with data exploration. Use the Python agent with our data explorer to organize, query, and visualize your data to answer key questions about application performance and customer experience. Use default transaction attributes, or add your own. Query your data using the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). Send your own event data. Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards. Install the Python agent Before you install the Python agent, make sure your system meets the system requirements. You must also create a New Relic account. We support a number of web frameworks and libraries right out of the box, including Django, WSGI, and Gunicorn. If you use one of the supported web frameworks, installation is easy. If you use an unsupported framework, the process will involve some additions to your app code and/or web server files. For a quick and simple install process that will work for the majority of setups, follow these simple steps: Download and install the Python package. Create config file. Integrate the Python agent with your application. Read the Quick Start guide Add Python data Monitor non-web scripts, background tasks, and functions The Python agent also lets you monitor non-web scripts, worker processes, tasks, and functions. The installation process for these non-web transactions is similar to the one used for a web app, with one major difference: instead of going through the standard integration process described in the install instructions, you would manually \"wrap\" any function you want to monitor. For more information, see Non-web tasks and processes. For instructions on monitoring Celery tasks, see Celery background tasks. What's next after installation? Once you get the agent up and running, some suggested next steps are: Explore your data in and get comfortable with the user interface. Read our docs on our other observability solutions and the APM page. Change your application's name, or other configuration options. Learn about setting up custom instrumentation for application activity not monitored by default. Consider the Python Telemetry SDK. Troubleshooting After you complete the install process, your data should appear in the APM UI within five minutes. If it does not, use these troubleshooting resources: If no data appears, follow these troubleshooting steps. If you experience issues when installing or running the Python agent on a new host, test that the package is installed correctly and that it can contact New Relic's data collector service. For other problems, see the full list of troubleshooting documentation. Check the source code The Python agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "Before you install New Relic's Python agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Basic requirements The Python agent supports many of the most common Python web frameworks. Additional configuration may be required depending on your specific hosting mechanism, hosting service, web framework, or back-end services. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Resource Requirements Operating systems UNIX-like operating systems including Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and macOS. The Python agent does not support Windows environments. Python Python (CPython/PyPy) versions supported: 2.7, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, and 3.10. Recommendation: Use Python version 3.6 or higher with our agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3 are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. Python version 3.4 is supported only by Python agent versions 4.20.0.120 or lower. Python version 3.5 is supported only by Python agent versions 5.24.0.153 or lower. Python versions 2.7 and 3.6 follow our end of life (EOL) support requirements. Supported web frameworks Supported web frameworks include: Aiohttp Bottle CherryPy Django Falcon FastAPI Flask GraphQL gRPC Pylons Pyramid Sanic Starlette Tornado 6 Web2Py Unsupported frameworks Some WSGI servers, frameworks, and apps have special requirements. Although a specific Python WSGI web framework may not be supported, you can still use the agent. For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333). For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule. The version support policy does not replace our general end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Python agent with support 3.10 October 04, 2021 October 12, 2021 3.11 October 03, 2022 November 2022 End of support for Python releases reaching EOL The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Python agent dropping support 3.6 December 2021 Python agent versions released after March 2022 will not support Python 3.6. For more information, see our Python agent release notes. 2.7 January 1, 2020 TBD Connect the agent to other capabilities The Python agent integrates with other capabilities to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Python agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation.

Capability Integration Browser monitoring The Ruby agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see the browser and Ruby agent documentation. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in infrastructure monitoring. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from Synthetics monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

      "body": "Before you install New Relic's Python agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Basic requirements The Python agent supports many of the most common Python web frameworks. Additional configuration may be required depending on your specific hosting mechanism, hosting service, web framework, or back-end services. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Resource Requirements Operating systems UNIX-like operating systems including Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and macOS. The Python agent does not support Windows environments. Python Python (CPython/PyPy) versions supported: 2.7, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, and 3.10. Recommendation: Use Python version 3.6 or higher with our agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3 are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. Python version 3.4 is supported only by Python agent versions 4.20.0.120 or lower. Python version 3.5 is supported only by Python agent versions 5.24.0.153 or lower. Python versions 2.7 and 3.6 follow our end of life (EOL) support requirements. Supported web frameworks Supported web frameworks include: Aiohttp Bottle CherryPy Django Falcon FastAPI Flask GraphQL gRPC Pylons Pyramid Sanic Starlette Tornado 6 Web2Py Unsupported frameworks Some WSGI servers, frameworks, and apps have special requirements. Although a specific Python WSGI web framework may not be supported, you can still use the agent. For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333). For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule. The version support policy does not replace our general end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Python agent with support 3.10 October 04, 2021 October 12, 2021 3.11 October 03, 2022 November 2022 End of support for Python releases reaching EOL The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Python agent dropping support 3.6 December 2021 Python agent versions released after March 2022 will not support Python 3.6. For more information, see our Python agent release notes. 2.7 January 1, 2020 TBD Connect the agent to other capabilities The Python agent integrates with other capabilities to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Python agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Python agent.

No need to switch to another UI page in New Relic One. With logs in context, you can see log messages related to your errors and traces directly in your app's UI. You can also see logs in context of your infrastructure data, such as Kubernetes clusters. Analyze business data Use the PHP agent to organize, query, and visualize your data to answer key questions about application performance and customer experience. Use default transaction attributes or add your own Query your data using NRQL Send your own event data Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards Architecture The PHP agent has two binaries that work together to forward data to New Relic: The agent handles automatic and API instrumentation of your PHP code. The daemon acts as a proxy between the agent and the New Relic platform. You can connect up to 500 applications/agents to one daemon. The daemon imposes sampling when the harvest cycle limits are reached, so consider this when deciding how many applications/agents to connect to a single daemon. Tip The number of applications/agents per daemon may be lower when running in separate Docker containers, depending on the capacity of the connection between containers. The flow of data from your PHP applications to New Relic. The workflow between your application and New Relic must occur in this order: The agent establishes a socket connection with the daemon by sending the first payload of instrumentation data. The daemon establishes an HTTPS link with the New Relic platform. The daemon must be invoked before your instrumented application is invoked. This is called agent mode and is the default. To avoid losing reported data, make sure your instrumented application doesn't send transactions before both connections are established. Install the agent Before you install the PHP agent, ensure your system meets the system requirements. The PHP agent supports many of the most common PHP frameworks, databases, and libraries. You can also use the agent in a Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment. Tip If you are installing the agent on a shared hosting service, ensure you have root permissions to install the agent or contact your hosting provider for technical assistance. To install the agent, sign up for New Relic first. Once logged in, use our launcher, or see the instructions for specific installations. Add PHP data For standard installations, see: PHP agent installation overview (the basic installation steps for the most common setups). Installing on RedHat or CentOS Installing on Ubuntu or Debian Installing with tar archive (generic method to use on any supported systems such as Linux variants, OpenSolaris, SmartOS, FreeBSD, macOS, etc) The newrelic-install script (how to use the interactive script that automates some installation tasks) For other types of PHP installations and advanced installation topics, see: PHP agent installation: Non-standard PHP Starting the PHP daemon (a standard New Relic installation starts the daemon automatically, but you can also start the daemon manually) Silent mode for the install script Google App Engine (GAE) flex environment installation for New Relic's PHP agent Configure the agent The agent includes a variety of configuration options to further customize and fine-tune your installation. Tip The most important part of agent configuration is to give your app a descriptive name. New Relic uses this app name to aggregate metrics when you have multiple apps or hosts. After changing any agent configuration options, restart your web server. Extend agent instrumentation After installing the agent, go further and extend the agent's instrumentation: Page load timing: Integrate the PHP agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user activity. Custom instrumentation: Instrument transactions not captured as part of our framework instrumentation. Agent API: Use the agent API to customize the agent's behavior. For example, you can collect custom metrics, flag an error, or ignore a particular transaction entirely. Agent attributes: Customize the attributes attached to transactions. Customizing attributes allows you to avoid sending sensitive attributes, or to collect additional attributes for deeper visibility into your transactions. Troubleshoot your installation If you encounter issues with the PHP agent, see our full list of troubleshooting documentation. Common installation issues include: No data appears (PHP) Determining permissions requirements INI settings not taking effect immediately Why and when to restart your web server (PHP)",

Use default transaction attributes, or add your own. Query your data using the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). Send your own event data. Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards. Install the Python agent Before you install the Python agent, make sure your system meets the system requirements. You must also create a New Relic account. We support a number of web frameworks and libraries right out of the box, including Django, WSGI, and Gunicorn. If you use one of the supported web frameworks, installation is easy. If you use an unsupported framework, the process will involve some additions to your app code and/or web server files. For a quick and simple install process that will work for the majority of setups, follow these simple steps: Download and install the Python package. Create config file. Integrate the Python agent with your application. Read the Quick Start guide Add Python data Monitor non-web scripts, background tasks, and functions The Python agent also lets you monitor non-web scripts, worker processes, tasks, and functions. The installation process for these non-web transactions is similar to the one used for a web app, with one major difference: instead of going through the standard integration process described in the install instructions, you would manually \"wrap\" any function you want to monitor. For more information, see Non-web tasks and processes. For instructions on monitoring Celery tasks, see Celery background tasks. What's next after installation? Once you get the agent up and running, some suggested next steps are: Explore your data in and get comfortable with the user interface. Read our docs on our other observability solutions and the APM page. Change your application's name, or other configuration options. Learn about setting up custom instrumentation for application activity not monitored by default. Consider the Python Telemetry SDK. Troubleshooting After you complete the install process, your data should appear in the APM UI within five minutes. If it does not, use these troubleshooting resources: If no data appears, follow these troubleshooting steps. If you experience issues when installing or running the Python agent on a new host, test that the package is installed correctly and that it can contact New Relic's data collector service. For other problems, see the full list of troubleshooting documentation. Check the source code The Python agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "Heroku is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) solution for hosting web applications in various agent languages, including Python. With the agent, you can extend Heroku with metrics from New Relic One. This document describes special considerations for using Heroku as a hosting service with Python agent. Contents Install the New Relic add-on After deploying your Python app on Heroku, install the Python agent: Via the Heroku website To install the New Relic add-on through the Heroku website, you must be logged in to Heroku: From Heroku's Add-on page for New Relic, select a subscription plan. From Select an app, select your New Relic app. Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='Your Application Name' Copy Restart your dyno. Generate some traffic to your app. Via Heroku toolbelt To install the Python agent add-on with Heroku the toolbelt: Run the following command, where $planlevel is the appropriate subscription plan: heroku addons:create newrelic:$planlevel Copy Give your application a descriptive name with this toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='Your Application Name' Copy Restart your dyno. Generate some traffic to your app. Installing the add-on automatically creates a private New Relic account and configures access for Heroku hosts. The agent will begin monitoring application performance, end user experience, and host performance collected after the add-on is installed. Within a few minutes, data should start appearing in your APM Summary page. Upgrade from an existing agent installation If an agent is already installed, reinstall the add-on using the Heroku toolbelt command. heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='Your Application Name' Copy Install the Python agent To install a third party Python package such as our Python agent on Heroku, use pip. Heroku automatically looks for a requirements.txt file in the root directory of your project. It installs anything listed in that file when you push your project to Heroku. Create or edit the requirements.txt file, adding the line: newrelic Copy Django users: Modify the web entry of your Procfile, prefixing the value with newrelic-admin run-program. For example: web: newrelic-admin run-program gunicorn mysite.wsgi Copy Push your project up to Heroku. This will install the the Python agent package with the latest version listed on the Python Package Index (PyPi). Update the Python agent Heroku caches packages and does not detect when a newer version of the Python agent is available. To force an upgrade: Edit the requirements.txt file by including the specific Python agent version (n.n.n.n) with the package name: newrelic==n.n.n.n Copy Push your project up to Heroku. Verify the New Relic add-on To verify that the New Relic add-on has been enabled, run: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC Copy This generates a list of New Relic-specific environment variables in Heroku. The Python agent uses these to determine which New Relic account and application data to use for reporting data. At a minimum, you should see: NEW_RELIC_LOG=stdout NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=Your app name Copy The license key is unique to your New Relic account. Troubleshoot your installation Within a few minutes of installing and configuring the agent, data should start appearing in your app's APM Summary page. If no data appears, test that environment variables are being detected properly by running: heroku run newrelic-admin validate-config - stdout Copy This will create a connection and report test transaction data under the application Python Agent Test. Capture the output from running the test, and use the data to troubleshoot the issue. If you need further assistance, follow the Python agent troubleshooting procedures. Initialize the Python agent To initialize the Python agent: From the root of your project, find the Procfile. Modify the web entry in your Procfile to define what to do to start up your Python web application. Refer to the following examples to insert newrelic-admin run-program at the start of the command. Run your Python web application under the control of the the Python agent's admin script. Hosting mechanism Example web entry Flask with the built-in development host web: newrelic-admin run-program python hello.py Copy Flask with gunicorn web: newrelic-admin run-program gunicorn -b \"0.0.0.0:$PORT\" -w 3 hello:app Copy Django with gunicorn listed in INSTALLED_APPS web: newrelic-admin run-program python hellodjango/manage.py run_gunicorn -b \"0.0.0.0:$PORT\" -w 3 Copy Caution Avoid using the built-in development hosts of any web framework prior to Python version 2.7.4 or prior to Django 1.4. Instead, use gunicorn or uWSGI. The WSGI host using the wsgiref module was not fully WSGI compliant for development hosts prior to Python version 2.7.4. This prevented the Python agent from being able to report correct data. WSGI application wrapping The agent provides automatic wrapping of the the WSGI application point for these web frameworks: Bottle Django Flask If you are using any of these Python web frameworks, no additional steps are required. For others, you must modify the Python code file with your WSGI application entry point to wrap the WSGI application object with a WSGI application wrapper. This will initiate the timing for the web requests received by your application. If the entry point is this... Do this... Entry point is a function Wrap it in a decorator: import newrelic.agent @newrelic.agent.wsgi_application() def application(environ, start_response): ... Copy Entry point is a function or object imported from a different module Wrap it in pre decorator style: import myapp application = myapp.WSGIHandler() application = newrelic.agent.WSGIApplicationWrapper(application) Copy Track Celery tasks To record execution time for Celery tasks as background tasks against your web application, wrap the startup of the Celery host with the newrelic-admin command. Prefix the existing startup command defined by the worker entry in your Procfile: worker: newrelic-admin run-program python hellodjango/manage.py celeryd -E -B --loglevel=INFO Copy Debug the Python agent To begin debugging, collect the log output from the Python agent. Heroku sends Python agent output to standard output and captures it in the web server log. To get access to the web server log for Heroku, run: heroku logs Copy By default the Python agent will log at info level. If New Relic Support requests an alternate level of logging, you must manually add a config variable. For example, to set logging output to debug, run: heroku config:add NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=debug Copy Your application automatically restarts when you change the log level. Caution The debug log level produces large quantities of output. Be sure to remove this setting as soon as it is no longer required, by running: heroku config:remove NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Copy Edit the agent configuration file When using Heroku's add-on with New Relic, this automatically sets key environment variables for the Python agent. You can also customize additional settings with the agent configuration file, or use server-side configuration. Do not add core settings such as the license key, application name, etc. to the configuration file. Heroku automatically adds these settings. To customize other settings, use the Python agent configuration file with Heroku: Add the newrelic.ini agent configuration file to the root directory of your project repository that you are pushing up to Heroku: In the [newrelic] section, include the specific configuration setting; for example: [newrelic] transaction_tracer.function_trace = mydbm:connect Copy Commit the configuration file to your repository, and push the change up to Heroku. Use the heroku config:add command to set the NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE environment variable for your deployed application: heroku config:add NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini Copy If you are using the newrelic-admin wrapper program to launch your WSGI host, the settings for your license key, application name, etc., will be picked up from the environment variables set by Heroku. Any additional settings you set in the agent configuration file will also be applied. Then, when the agent registers with New Relic, any server-side configuration will also be merged to create the final configuration the agent will use.",

      "body": "OpenShift is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) solution capable of hosting web applications using various languages, including the Python agent. Prepare your application Before installing the Python agent, make sure your Python web application is installed and running under OpenShift using one of the available Python cartridges. See the OpenShift developer guides for more information. Install the APM Python agent OpenShift support two different ways of installing third party Python packages. You can either list the package as a dependency in the setup.py for your web application, or in the requirements.txt file used by pip. If you are using a setup.py file, install the agent by adding newrelic to the list of third party modules passed to install_requires: from setuptools import setup setup(name='YourAppName', version='1.0', description='OpenShift App', author='Your Name', author_email='example@example.com', url='https://www.python.org/community/sigs/current/distutils-sig', install_requires=['Flask>=0.7.2', 'MarkupSafe', 'newrelic'], ) Copy If you are using pip, add the following line to requirements.txt: newrelic Copy When you push your project up to OpenShift, this will install the Python agent package. It will use the latest version of the Python agent from the OpenShift mirror of the Python Package Index (PyPi). Updates to the OpenShift mirror of PyPi can be delayed, so you may have to wait up to a day before a new release on PyPi is available on OpenShift. Update the Python agent OpenShift will cache packages and will not detect when a newer version of the Python agent is available. To force an upgrade to a newer version, explicitly list the version against the package name in the setup.py or requirements.txt file and push your application. Use this syntax: newrelic==A.B.C.D Copy Replace A.B.C.D with the version of the the Python agent you wish to install. Use Python agent environment variables In order for the Python agent to report data to the correct account, you need to tell it the license key for your New Relic account. For OpenShift, the most secure way to provide the license key is using an environment variable configured in your application configuration using the rhc env set command. This avoids storing sensitive information in your GIT repository and also works if you are using a scaled web application which is hosted on multiple physical hosts. rhc env set NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=YOUR_LICENSE_KEY -a YOUR_APP_NAME Copy While specifying your license key, also tell the Python agent where to record log messages: rhc env set NEW_RELIC_LOG=stderr -a YOUR_APP_NAME Copy To verify that the environment variables are being set, run: rhc env list -a YOUR_APP_NAME Copy Although set, these will only take effect the next time the web application gears are restarted. Test the agent installation To test that the Python agent package has been installed correctly and that the agent environment variables are being set correctly, you can ssh into the main gear of your application and run: newrelic-admin validate-config - stdout Copy This admin script will create a connection and report test transaction data under the application Python Agent Test in your account. Data can take up to five minutes to appear in the UI. If it doesn't appear after some time, capture the output from running the test and use the data to troubleshoot the issue. If you need further assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com. Initialize the Python agent The OpenShift Python cartridges provide two ways of running a WSGI application. The first method uses a preconfigured Apache/mod_wsgi installation. In this case your WSGI application entry point must be defined in the wsgi.py file. The second method relies on you to provide a standalone Python web application script called app.py. This will typically start an embedded Python WSGI server, with the WSGI application entry point being specified within the app.py file, or be imported from a separate Python code file, such as the wsgi.py file. For either method, OpenShift controls the startup of the WSGI server. You must manually integrate the Python agent into your WSGI application. You cannot use the newrelic-admin wrapper script around the startup of the WSGI server. If you are using the Apache/mod_wsgi approach, add the following code at the very start of the wsgi.py file: import newrelic.agent newrelic.agent.initialize() Copy Make sure this precedes any other Python module imports appearing in the wsgi.py file. You do not need to provide any arguments to the initialize() call, because the license key information and destination for logging are read from the environment variables. If you are using an embedded Python WSGI server from app.py, place these lines at the very top of the app.py file, even if you import the WSGI application entry point from a wsgi.py file. When using app.py with wsgi.py, do not add these lines to wsgi.py. Avoid using the built-in development servers of any web framework. Also, do not use the OpenShift Python 2.6 cartridge or older Django versions. This is because these development servers are often based on the WSGI server from the wsgiref module from the Python standard library. The WSGI server from the wsgiref module had a bug, which meant it was not fully WSGI-compliant, and this would cause the Python agent to report incorrect data. This issue with the wsgiref module is only fixed in Python 2.7.4. The built-in WSGI server in older versions of Django prior to Django 1.4 had a similar problem. Wrap the WSGI application If you are using a Python web framework for which the agent provides automatic wrapping of the WSGI application entry point, this is all that needs to be done. Python web frameworks with automatic wrapping include Django, Flask, and Bottle. For others, you must modify the Python code file with your WSGI application entry point to wrap the WSGI application object with a WSGI application wrapper. This will initiate the timing for the web requests received by your application. Entry point Example code Enty point is a function Wrap it in a decorator. import newrelic.agent @newrelic.agent.wsgi_application() def application(environ, start_response): ... Copy Enty point is a function or object imported from a different module. Wrap it in pre decorator style. import myapp application = myapp.WSGIHandler() application = newrelic.agent.WSGIApplicationWrapper(application) Copy Override the application name By default, your data is recorded under the app name Python Application. To change the display name, use the APM user interface. However, from the agent side, we highly recommends keeping this as a unique, unchanging value, independent of changes to the display name in the UI. This is required if you intend to run multiple distinct sites under the one New Relic account and want to have the data reported separately. To override the application name, use the rhc env set command: rhc env set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='Web Site (Production)' -a yourappname Copy To verify that the configuration has been updated, run: rhc env list -a yourappname Copy Then look for: NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=Web Site (Production) Copy Changes to environment variables only take effect the next time you restart your web application gears. Debug the Python agent To begin debugging, collect the log output from the Python agent. When the NEW_RELIC_LOG environment variable is set to stderr, the log messages from the Python agent will be captured within the standard Python web application logs. To tail the web application logs under OpenShift, run: rhc tail -a YOUR_APP_NAME Copy To get the complete log, copy back from each of your web applications the log file: $OPENSHIFT_PYTHON_LOG_DIR/python.log Copy By default the Python agent will log at info level. If the agent requires an alternate level of logging, you will need to manually add an additional environment variable. For example, to set logging output to debug, run: rhc env set NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=debug -a YOUR_APP_NAME Copy Environment variables do not take effect immediately, so be sure to restart your web application gears. Run debug logging only when requested and only for the time required. Debug logging can produce a lot of output and will bloat your log files. Remove this setting as soon as it is no longer required by running the following command, and then restart your web application gears: rhc env unset NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL -a YOUR_APP_NAME Copy Use the logfile to troubleshoot the issue. If you need further assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com Update agent configuration file With OpenShift, the preferred way of specifying your account license key and defining where logging should go is to use environment variables. This means it is not necessary to use an agent configuration file to get the agent working. However, without the agent configuration file, it is not possible to customize other agent settings. If you enable server-side configuration for your application, you do not need an agent configuration file. This is done from the Application settings in the APM user interface application. Using server-side configuration you can override core settings for the agent. When a change is made to a setting via the UI, the agent running within each of your web application processes will be notified, and it will pick up the changed settings. However, some agent features are incompatible with server-side configuration. In these cases, use an agent configuration file pushed up with your web application to OpenShift. To add and enable an agent configuration file with OpenShift: Add the agent configuration file newrelic.ini to the root directory of your project repository that you are pushing up to OpenShift. This should contain a [newrelic] section along with just the specific configuration setting you need to set. For example: [newrelic] transaction_tracer.function_trace = mydbm:connect Copy Do not use the agent configuration file for core settings such as the license key or app name, as doing so will override the environment variable settings. You also likely do not want the license key as part of your GIT repository, especially if the project source code is publicly available. Also note that if server-side configuration is enabled at the same time, any setting that can be set via server-side configuration will always override the local setting. Therefore only use this for settings that cannot be set using server-side configuration if server-side configuration is enabled. Now modify the wsgi.py or app.py file where you added the code to initialize the Python agent. Change the code you had already added to: import os import newrelic.agent repo_dir = os.environ['OPENSHIFT_REPO_DIR'] config_file = os.path.join(repo_dir, 'newrelic.ini') newrelic.agent.initialize(config_file) Copy Commit the configuration file to your repository and push the change up to OpenShift.",

Install the Python agent Before you install the Python agent, make sure your system meets the system requirements. You must also create a New Relic account. We support a number of web frameworks and libraries right out of the box, including Django, WSGI, and Gunicorn. If you use one of the supported web frameworks, installation is easy. If you use an unsupported framework, the process will involve some additions to your app code and/or web server files. For a quick and simple install process that will work for the majority of setups, follow these simple steps: Download and install the Python package. Create config file. Integrate the Python agent with your application. Read the Quick Start guide Add Python data Monitor non-web scripts, background tasks, and functions The Python agent also lets you monitor non-web scripts, worker processes, tasks, and functions. The installation process for these non-web transactions is similar to the one used for a web app, with one major difference: instead of going through the standard integration process described in the install instructions, you would manually \"wrap\" any function you want to monitor. For more information, see Non-web tasks and processes. For instructions on monitoring Celery tasks, see Celery background tasks. What's next after installation? Once you get the agent up and running, some suggested next steps are: Explore your data in and get comfortable with the user interface. Read our docs on our other observability solutions and the APM page. Change your application's name, or other configuration options. Learn about setting up custom instrumentation for application activity not monitored by default. Consider the Python Telemetry SDK. Troubleshooting After you complete the install process, your data should appear in the APM UI within five minutes. If it does not, use these troubleshooting resources: If no data appears, follow these troubleshooting steps. If you experience issues when installing or running the Python agent on a new host, test that the package is installed correctly and that it can contact New Relic's data collector service. For other problems, see the full list of troubleshooting documentation. Check the source code The Python agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "OpenShift is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) solution capable of hosting web applications using various languages, including the Python agent. Prepare your application Before installing the Python agent, make sure your Python web application is installed and running under OpenShift using one of the available Python cartridges. See the OpenShift developer guides for more information. Install the APM Python agent OpenShift support two different ways of installing third party Python packages. You can either list the package as a dependency in the setup.py for your web application, or in the requirements.txt file used by pip. If you are using a setup.py file, install the agent by adding newrelic to the list of third party modules passed to install_requires: from setuptools import setup setup(name='YourAppName', version='1.0', description='OpenShift App', author='Your Name', author_email='example@example.com', url='https://www.python.org/community/sigs/current/distutils-sig', install_requires=['Flask>=0.7.2', 'MarkupSafe', 'newrelic'], ) Copy If you are using pip, add the following line to requirements.txt: newrelic Copy When you push your project up to OpenShift, this will install the Python agent package. It will use the latest version of the Python agent from the OpenShift mirror of the Python Package Index (PyPi). Updates to the OpenShift mirror of PyPi can be delayed, so you may have to wait up to a day before a new release on PyPi is available on OpenShift. Update the Python agent OpenShift will cache packages and will not detect when a newer version of the Python agent is available. To force an upgrade to a newer version, explicitly list the version against the package name in the setup.py or requirements.txt file and push your application. Use this syntax: newrelic==A.B.C.D Copy Replace A.B.C.D with the version of the the Python agent you wish to install. Use Python agent environment variables In order for the Python agent to report data to the correct account, you need to tell it the license key for your New Relic account. For OpenShift, the most secure way to provide the license key is using an environment variable configured in your application configuration using the rhc env set command. This avoids storing sensitive information in your GIT repository and also works if you are using a scaled web application which is hosted on multiple physical hosts. rhc env set NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=YOUR_LICENSE_KEY -a YOUR_APP_NAME Copy While specifying your license key, also tell the Python agent where to record log messages: rhc env set NEW_RELIC_LOG=stderr -a YOUR_APP_NAME Copy To verify that the environment variables are being set, run: rhc env list -a YOUR_APP_NAME Copy Although set, these will only take effect the next time the web application gears are restarted. Test the agent installation To test that the Python agent package has been installed correctly and that the agent environment variables are being set correctly, you can ssh into the main gear of your application and run: newrelic-admin validate-config - stdout Copy This admin script will create a connection and report test transaction data under the application Python Agent Test in your account. Data can take up to five minutes to appear in the UI. If it doesn't appear after some time, capture the output from running the test and use the data to troubleshoot the issue. If you need further assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com. Initialize the Python agent The OpenShift Python cartridges provide two ways of running a WSGI application. The first method uses a preconfigured Apache/mod_wsgi installation. In this case your WSGI application entry point must be defined in the wsgi.py file. The second method relies on you to provide a standalone Python web application script called app.py. This will typically start an embedded Python WSGI server, with the WSGI application entry point being specified within the app.py file, or be imported from a separate Python code file, such as the wsgi.py file. For either method, OpenShift controls the startup of the WSGI server. You must manually integrate the Python agent into your WSGI application. You cannot use the newrelic-admin wrapper script around the startup of the WSGI server. If you are using the Apache/mod_wsgi approach, add the following code at the very start of the wsgi.py file: import newrelic.agent newrelic.agent.initialize() Copy Make sure this precedes any other Python module imports appearing in the wsgi.py file. You do not need to provide any arguments to the initialize() call, because the license key information and destination for logging are read from the environment variables. If you are using an embedded Python WSGI server from app.py, place these lines at the very top of the app.py file, even if you import the WSGI application entry point from a wsgi.py file. When using app.py with wsgi.py, do not add these lines to wsgi.py. Avoid using the built-in development servers of any web framework. Also, do not use the OpenShift Python 2.6 cartridge or older Django versions. This is because these development servers are often based on the WSGI server from the wsgiref module from the Python standard library. The WSGI server from the wsgiref module had a bug, which meant it was not fully WSGI-compliant, and this would cause the Python agent to report incorrect data. This issue with the wsgiref module is only fixed in Python 2.7.4. The built-in WSGI server in older versions of Django prior to Django 1.4 had a similar problem. Wrap the WSGI application If you are using a Python web framework for which the agent provides automatic wrapping of the WSGI application entry point, this is all that needs to be done. Python web frameworks with automatic wrapping include Django, Flask, and Bottle. For others, you must modify the Python code file with your WSGI application entry point to wrap the WSGI application object with a WSGI application wrapper. This will initiate the timing for the web requests received by your application. Entry point Example code Enty point is a function Wrap it in a decorator. import newrelic.agent @newrelic.agent.wsgi_application() def application(environ, start_response): ... Copy Enty point is a function or object imported from a different module. Wrap it in pre decorator style. import myapp application = myapp.WSGIHandler() application = newrelic.agent.WSGIApplicationWrapper(application) Copy Override the application name By default, your data is recorded under the app name Python Application. To change the display name, use the APM user interface. However, from the agent side, we highly recommends keeping this as a unique, unchanging value, independent of changes to the display name in the UI. This is required if you intend to run multiple distinct sites under the one New Relic account and want to have the data reported separately. To override the application name, use the rhc env set command: rhc env set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='Web Site (Production)' -a yourappname Copy To verify that the configuration has been updated, run: rhc env list -a yourappname Copy Then look for: NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=Web Site (Production) Copy Changes to environment variables only take effect the next time you restart your web application gears. Debug the Python agent To begin debugging, collect the log output from the Python agent. When the NEW_RELIC_LOG environment variable is set to stderr, the log messages from the Python agent will be captured within the standard Python web application logs. To tail the web application logs under OpenShift, run: rhc tail -a YOUR_APP_NAME Copy To get the complete log, copy back from each of your web applications the log file: $OPENSHIFT_PYTHON_LOG_DIR/python.log Copy By default the Python agent will log at info level. If the agent requires an alternate level of logging, you will need to manually add an additional environment variable. For example, to set logging output to debug, run: rhc env set NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=debug -a YOUR_APP_NAME Copy Environment variables do not take effect immediately, so be sure to restart your web application gears. Run debug logging only when requested and only for the time required. Debug logging can produce a lot of output and will bloat your log files. Remove this setting as soon as it is no longer required by running the following command, and then restart your web application gears: rhc env unset NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL -a YOUR_APP_NAME Copy Use the logfile to troubleshoot the issue. If you need further assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com Update agent configuration file With OpenShift, the preferred way of specifying your account license key and defining where logging should go is to use environment variables. This means it is not necessary to use an agent configuration file to get the agent working. However, without the agent configuration file, it is not possible to customize other agent settings. If you enable server-side configuration for your application, you do not need an agent configuration file. This is done from the Application settings in the APM user interface application. Using server-side configuration you can override core settings for the agent. When a change is made to a setting via the UI, the agent running within each of your web application processes will be notified, and it will pick up the changed settings. However, some agent features are incompatible with server-side configuration. In these cases, use an agent configuration file pushed up with your web application to OpenShift. To add and enable an agent configuration file with OpenShift: Add the agent configuration file newrelic.ini to the root directory of your project repository that you are pushing up to OpenShift. This should contain a [newrelic] section along with just the specific configuration setting you need to set. For example: [newrelic] transaction_tracer.function_trace = mydbm:connect Copy Do not use the agent configuration file for core settings such as the license key or app name, as doing so will override the environment variable settings. You also likely do not want the license key as part of your GIT repository, especially if the project source code is publicly available. Also note that if server-side configuration is enabled at the same time, any setting that can be set via server-side configuration will always override the local setting. Therefore only use this for settings that cannot be set using server-side configuration if server-side configuration is enabled. Now modify the wsgi.py or app.py file where you added the code to initialize the Python agent. Change the code you had already added to: import os import newrelic.agent repo_dir = os.environ['OPENSHIFT_REPO_DIR'] config_file = os.path.join(repo_dir, 'newrelic.ini') newrelic.agent.initialize(config_file) Copy Commit the configuration file to your repository and push the change up to OpenShift.",

The instructions here require you to use version 0.6 or higher of the Stackato VM image. If you use an older version of the Stackato VM image you will need to upgrade. Contents Package installation ActiveState hosts a copy of the Python agent package in their PyPM package repository. To install the Python package for the agent, add newrelic into the requirements.txt file on a line by itself: newrelic Copy You would then perform the update command using the Stackato client. The PyPM package repository updates daily. If you need to use a newer version of the Python agent than is available from the PyPM package repository, you will instead need to fallback to using pip and source packages from PyPI. In this case you will need to create in addition to the requirements.txt file used by PyPM, a requirements.pip file as input for pip. In the requirements.pip file you should list the newrelic package. Agent configuration file You will need to generate the Python agent configuration on your local system as described in Python agent installation and add that to the directory you push to your Stackato instance. The option in the agent configuration file for specifying where the agent log file output should go, should be set to: log_file = stderr Copy Python agent initialization Although you can manually include code for initializing the Python agent into the Python module containing your WSGI application entry point, as per instructions for integration with your Python application, a simplified startup method is also available by using the newrelic-admin script. In the case where you do it manually, such changes would typically be made to the wsgi.py file which includes your Python web application. Since the agent configuration file would be in the same directory, the change to the wsgi.py file would be to add: import newrelic.agent config_file = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), 'newrelic.ini') newrelic.agent.initialize(config_file) Copy Because the directory in the filesystem where the application is installed can change, the location of the agent configuration is calculated relative to the location of the wsgi.py file automatically. The alternative to adding code to perform initialization of the agent manually is to use the newrelic-admin script. If you are explicitly defining in the stackato.yml file how to startup your web application by setting the web entry in the processes section: processes: web: python app.py Copy You would replace web so it reads: processes: web: newrelic-admin run-program python app.py Copy In other words, you are prefixing the existing command with newrelic-admin run-program. At the same time, you should also add an env section to the stackato.yml file with: env: NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE: newrelic.ini Copy If you aren't overriding the web entry already and instead are relying on the default of the Stackato stack running uWSGI for you the process is a bit different. In this case you will need to add a web entry to stackato.yml as: processes: web: newrelic-admin run-program $PROCESSES_WEB Copy The env section is also again required. If PROCESSES_WEB is not defined and this does not work it indicates you are using an older VM image and should upgrade. Whether the manual or more automated method is used, if necessary for the Python web framework being used, the WSGI application entry point object will also need to be wrapped appropriately.",

With the agent, you can extend Heroku with metrics from New Relic One. This document describes special considerations for using Heroku as a hosting service with Python agent. Contents Install the New Relic add-on After deploying your Python app on Heroku, install the Python agent: Via the Heroku website To install the New Relic add-on through the Heroku website, you must be logged in to Heroku: From Heroku's Add-on page for New Relic, select a subscription plan. From Select an app, select your New Relic app. Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='Your Application Name' Copy Restart your dyno. Generate some traffic to your app. Via Heroku toolbelt To install the Python agent add-on with Heroku the toolbelt: Run the following command, where $planlevel is the appropriate subscription plan: heroku addons:create newrelic:$planlevel Copy Give your application a descriptive name with this toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='Your Application Name' Copy Restart your dyno. Generate some traffic to your app. Installing the add-on automatically creates a private New Relic account and configures access for Heroku hosts. The agent will begin monitoring application performance, end user experience, and host performance collected after the add-on is installed. Within a few minutes, data should start appearing in your APM Summary page. Upgrade from an existing agent installation If an agent is already installed, reinstall the add-on using the Heroku toolbelt command. heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='Your Application Name' Copy Install the Python agent To install a third party Python package such as our Python agent on Heroku, use pip. Heroku automatically looks for a requirements.txt file in the root directory of your project. It installs anything listed in that file when you push your project to Heroku. Create or edit the requirements.txt file, adding the line: newrelic Copy Django users: Modify the web entry of your Procfile, prefixing the value with newrelic-admin run-program. For example: web: newrelic-admin run-program gunicorn mysite.wsgi Copy Push your project up to Heroku. This will install the the Python agent package with the latest version listed on the Python Package Index (PyPi). Update the Python agent Heroku caches packages and does not detect when a newer version of the Python agent is available. To force an upgrade: Edit the requirements.txt file by including the specific Python agent version (n.n.n.n) with the package name: newrelic==n.n.n.n Copy Push your project up to Heroku. Verify the New Relic add-on To verify that the New Relic add-on has been enabled, run: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC Copy This generates a list of New Relic-specific environment variables in Heroku. The Python agent uses these to determine which New Relic account and application data to use for reporting data. At a minimum, you should see: NEW_RELIC_LOG=stdout NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=Your app name Copy The license key is unique to your New Relic account. Troubleshoot your installation Within a few minutes of installing and configuring the agent, data should start appearing in your app's APM Summary page. If no data appears, test that environment variables are being detected properly by running: heroku run newrelic-admin validate-config - stdout Copy This will create a connection and report test transaction data under the application Python Agent Test. Capture the output from running the test, and use the data to troubleshoot the issue. If you need further assistance, follow the Python agent troubleshooting procedures. Initialize the Python agent To initialize the Python agent: From the root of your project, find the Procfile. Modify the web entry in your Procfile to define what to do to start up your Python web application. Refer to the following examples to insert newrelic-admin run-program at the start of the command. Run your Python web application under the control of the the Python agent's admin script. Hosting mechanism Example web entry Flask with the built-in development host web: newrelic-admin run-program python hello.py Copy Flask with gunicorn web: newrelic-admin run-program gunicorn -b \"0.0.0.0:$PORT\" -w 3 hello:app Copy Django with gunicorn listed in INSTALLED_APPS web: newrelic-admin run-program python hellodjango/manage.py run_gunicorn -b \"0.0.0.0:$PORT\" -w 3 Copy Caution Avoid using the built-in development hosts of any web framework prior to Python version 2.7.4 or prior to Django 1.4. Instead, use gunicorn or uWSGI. The WSGI host using the wsgiref module was not fully WSGI compliant for development hosts prior to Python version 2.7.4. This prevented the Python agent from being able to report correct data. WSGI application wrapping The agent provides automatic wrapping of the the WSGI application point for these web frameworks: Bottle Django Flask If you are using any of these Python web frameworks, no additional steps are required. For others, you must modify the Python code file with your WSGI application entry point to wrap the WSGI application object with a WSGI application wrapper. This will initiate the timing for the web requests received by your application. If the entry point is this... Do this... Entry point is a function Wrap it in a decorator: import newrelic.agent @newrelic.agent.wsgi_application() def application(environ, start_response): ... Copy Entry point is a function or object imported from a different module Wrap it in pre decorator style: import myapp application = myapp.WSGIHandler() application = newrelic.agent.WSGIApplicationWrapper(application) Copy Track Celery tasks To record execution time for Celery tasks as background tasks against your web application, wrap the startup of the Celery host with the newrelic-admin command. Prefix the existing startup command defined by the worker entry in your Procfile: worker: newrelic-admin run-program python hellodjango/manage.py celeryd -E -B --loglevel=INFO Copy Debug the Python agent To begin debugging, collect the log output from the Python agent. Heroku sends Python agent output to standard output and captures it in the web server log. To get access to the web server log for Heroku, run: heroku logs Copy By default the Python agent will log at info level. If New Relic Support requests an alternate level of logging, you must manually add a config variable. For example, to set logging output to debug, run: heroku config:add NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=debug Copy Your application automatically restarts when you change the log level. Caution The debug log level produces large quantities of output. Be sure to remove this setting as soon as it is no longer required, by running: heroku config:remove NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Copy Edit the agent configuration file When using Heroku's add-on with New Relic, this automatically sets key environment variables for the Python agent. You can also customize additional settings with the agent configuration file, or use server-side configuration. Do not add core settings such as the license key, application name, etc. to the configuration file. Heroku automatically adds these settings. To customize other settings, use the Python agent configuration file with Heroku: Add the newrelic.ini agent configuration file to the root directory of your project repository that you are pushing up to Heroku: In the [newrelic] section, include the specific configuration setting; for example: [newrelic] transaction_tracer.function_trace = mydbm:connect Copy Commit the configuration file to your repository, and push the change up to Heroku. Use the heroku config:add command to set the NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE environment variable for your deployed application: heroku config:add NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini Copy If you are using the newrelic-admin wrapper program to launch your WSGI host, the settings for your license key, application name, etc., will be picked up from the environment variables set by Heroku. Any additional settings you set in the agent configuration file will also be applied. Then, when the agent registers with New Relic, any server-side configuration will also be merged to create the final configuration the agent will use.",

      "body": "Stackato is a private PaaS solution developed by ActiveState. The Python agent can be used in conjunction with Stackato by following the steps outlined below. The instructions here require you to use version 0.6 or higher of the Stackato VM image. If you use an older version of the Stackato VM image you will need to upgrade. Contents Package installation ActiveState hosts a copy of the Python agent package in their PyPM package repository. To install the Python package for the agent, add newrelic into the requirements.txt file on a line by itself: newrelic Copy You would then perform the update command using the Stackato client. The PyPM package repository updates daily. If you need to use a newer version of the Python agent than is available from the PyPM package repository, you will instead need to fallback to using pip and source packages from PyPI. In this case you will need to create in addition to the requirements.txt file used by PyPM, a requirements.pip file as input for pip. In the requirements.pip file you should list the newrelic package. Agent configuration file You will need to generate the Python agent configuration on your local system as described in Python agent installation and add that to the directory you push to your Stackato instance. The option in the agent configuration file for specifying where the agent log file output should go, should be set to: log_file = stderr Copy Python agent initialization Although you can manually include code for initializing the Python agent into the Python module containing your WSGI application entry point, as per instructions for integration with your Python application, a simplified startup method is also available by using the newrelic-admin script. In the case where you do it manually, such changes would typically be made to the wsgi.py file which includes your Python web application. Since the agent configuration file would be in the same directory, the change to the wsgi.py file would be to add: import newrelic.agent config_file = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), 'newrelic.ini') newrelic.agent.initialize(config_file) Copy Because the directory in the filesystem where the application is installed can change, the location of the agent configuration is calculated relative to the location of the wsgi.py file automatically. The alternative to adding code to perform initialization of the agent manually is to use the newrelic-admin script. If you are explicitly defining in the stackato.yml file how to startup your web application by setting the web entry in the processes section: processes: web: python app.py Copy You would replace web so it reads: processes: web: newrelic-admin run-program python app.py Copy In other words, you are prefixing the existing command with newrelic-admin run-program. At the same time, you should also add an env section to the stackato.yml file with: env: NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE: newrelic.ini Copy If you aren't overriding the web entry already and instead are relying on the default of the Stackato stack running uWSGI for you the process is a bit different. In this case you will need to add a web entry to stackato.yml as: processes: web: newrelic-admin run-program $PROCESSES_WEB Copy The env section is also again required. If PROCESSES_WEB is not defined and this does not work it indicates you are using an older VM image and should upgrade. Whether the manual or more automated method is used, if necessary for the Python web framework being used, the WSGI application entry point object will also need to be wrapped appropriately.",

      "body": "Our Python agent monitors your Python application to help you identify and solve performance issues. You can also extend your performance monitoring to collect and analyze business data to help you improve the customer experience and make data-driven business decisions. With flexible options for custom instrumentation and APIs, The Python agent offers multiple building blocks to customize the data you need from your app. Our Python works with a wide variety of web frameworks and hosting mechanisms, including Django, Gunicorn, WSGI, CherryPy, uWSGI, and more. You can also install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Monitor app performance After you install the Python agent, it begins to collect data about your app. You can view the data as charts and tables in New Relic One. View the big picture of your app. Monitor your app's Apdex (user satisfaction). Get a high-level summary of your app with Summary page. Enable distributed tracing to see activity across an architecture having many services. Install Infrastructure monitoring and view detailed server/host data for your app. Find errors and problems quickly. Track key transactions specific to your business. Create custom dashboards for important metrics. Alert your team when an error or problem occurs before it affects your users. View performance after a deployment. Drill down into performance details. Examine code-level transaction traces. Examine database query traces. Examine error traces. Use thread profiler sessions to see detailed stack traces of sampled threads View logs for your APM and infrastructure data Bring your logs and application's data together to make troubleshooting easier and faster. No need to switch to another UI page in New Relic One. With logs in context, you can see log messages related to your errors and traces directly in your app's UI. You can also see logs in context of your infrastructure data, such as Kubernetes clusters. Extend agent instrumentation Other helpful tools include: Tools Description Browser monitoring Integrate the Python agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user browser activity. Simple scripts and background tasks Monitor job-based or task queuing systems, like Celery, or other standalone non-web functions. Business data analysis with data exploration. Use the Python agent with our data explorer to organize, query, and visualize your data to answer key questions about application performance and customer experience. Use default transaction attributes, or add your own. Query your data using the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). Send your own event data. Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards. Install the Python agent Before you install the Python agent, make sure your system meets the system requirements. You must also create a New Relic account. We support a number of web frameworks and libraries right out of the box, including Django, WSGI, and Gunicorn. If you use one of the supported web frameworks, installation is easy. If you use an unsupported framework, the process will involve some additions to your app code and/or web server files. For a quick and simple install process that will work for the majority of setups, follow these simple steps: Download and install the Python package. Create config file. Integrate the Python agent with your application. Read the Quick Start guide Add Python data Monitor non-web scripts, background tasks, and functions The Python agent also lets you monitor non-web scripts, worker processes, tasks, and functions. The installation process for these non-web transactions is similar to the one used for a web app, with one major difference: instead of going through the standard integration process described in the install instructions, you would manually \"wrap\" any function you want to monitor. For more information, see Non-web tasks and processes. For instructions on monitoring Celery tasks, see Celery background tasks. What's next after installation? Once you get the agent up and running, some suggested next steps are: Explore your data in and get comfortable with the user interface. Read our docs on our other observability solutions and the APM page. Change your application's name, or other configuration options. Learn about setting up custom instrumentation for application activity not monitored by default. Consider the Python Telemetry SDK. Troubleshooting After you complete the install process, your data should appear in the APM UI within five minutes. If it does not, use these troubleshooting resources: If no data appears, follow these troubleshooting steps. If you experience issues when installing or running the Python agent on a new host, test that the package is installed correctly and that it can contact New Relic's data collector service. For other problems, see the full list of troubleshooting documentation. Check the source code The Python agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

Copy Entry point is a function or object imported from a different module Wrap it in pre decorator style: import myapp application = myapp.WSGIHandler() application = newrelic.agent.WSGIApplicationWrapper(application) Copy Track Celery tasks To record execution time for Celery tasks as background tasks against your web application, wrap the startup of the Celery host with the newrelic-admin command. Prefix the existing startup command defined by the worker entry in your Procfile: worker: newrelic-admin run-program python hellodjango/manage.py celeryd -E -B --loglevel=INFO Copy Debug the Python agent To begin debugging, collect the log output from the Python agent. Heroku sends Python agent output to standard output and captures it in the web server log. To get access to the web server log for Heroku, run: heroku logs Copy By default the Python agent will log at info level. If New Relic Support requests an alternate level of logging, you must manually add a config variable. For example, to set logging output to debug, run: heroku config:add NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=debug Copy Your application automatically restarts when you change the log level. Caution The debug log level produces large quantities of output. Be sure to remove this setting as soon as it is no longer required, by running: heroku config:remove NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Copy Edit the agent configuration file When using Heroku's add-on with New Relic, this automatically sets key environment variables for the Python agent. You can also customize additional settings with the agent configuration file, or use server-side configuration. Do not add core settings such as the license key, application name, etc. to the configuration file. Heroku automatically adds these settings. To customize other settings, use the Python agent configuration file with Heroku: Add the newrelic.ini agent configuration file to the root directory of your project repository that you are pushing up to Heroku: In the [newrelic] section, include the specific configuration setting; for example: [newrelic] transaction_tracer.function_trace = mydbm:connect Copy Commit the configuration file to your repository, and push the change up to Heroku. Use the heroku config:add command to set the NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE environment variable for your deployed application: heroku config:add NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini Copy If you are using the newrelic-admin wrapper program to launch your WSGI host, the settings for your license key, application name, etc., will be picked up from the environment variables set by Heroku. Any additional settings you set in the agent configuration file will also be applied. Then, when the agent registers with New Relic, any server-side configuration will also be merged to create the final configuration the agent will use.",

      "body": "OpenShift is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) solution capable of hosting web applications using various languages, including the Python agent. Prepare your application Before installing the Python agent, make sure your Python web application is installed and running under OpenShift using one of the available Python cartridges. See the OpenShift developer guides for more information. Install the APM Python agent OpenShift support two different ways of installing third party Python packages. You can either list the package as a dependency in the setup.py for your web application, or in the requirements.txt file used by pip. If you are using a setup.py file, install the agent by adding newrelic to the list of third party modules passed to install_requires: from setuptools import setup setup(name='YourAppName', version='1.0', description='OpenShift App', author='Your Name', author_email='example@example.com', url='https://www.python.org/community/sigs/current/distutils-sig', install_requires=['Flask>=0.7.2', 'MarkupSafe', 'newrelic'], ) Copy If you are using pip, add the following line to requirements.txt: newrelic Copy When you push your project up to OpenShift, this will install the Python agent package. It will use the latest version of the Python agent from the OpenShift mirror of the Python Package Index (PyPi). Updates to the OpenShift mirror of PyPi can be delayed, so you may have to wait up to a day before a new release on PyPi is available on OpenShift. Update the Python agent OpenShift will cache packages and will not detect when a newer version of the Python agent is available. To force an upgrade to a newer version, explicitly list the version against the package name in the setup.py or requirements.txt file and push your application. Use this syntax: newrelic==A.B.C.D Copy Replace A.B.C.D with the version of the the Python agent you wish to install. Use Python agent environment variables In order for the Python agent to report data to the correct account, you need to tell it the license key for your New Relic account. For OpenShift, the most secure way to provide the license key is using an environment variable configured in your application configuration using the rhc env set command. This avoids storing sensitive information in your GIT repository and also works if you are using a scaled web application which is hosted on multiple physical hosts. rhc env set NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=YOUR_LICENSE_KEY -a YOUR_APP_NAME Copy While specifying your license key, also tell the Python agent where to record log messages: rhc env set NEW_RELIC_LOG=stderr -a YOUR_APP_NAME Copy To verify that the environment variables are being set, run: rhc env list -a YOUR_APP_NAME Copy Although set, these will only take effect the next time the web application gears are restarted. Test the agent installation To test that the Python agent package has been installed correctly and that the agent environment variables are being set correctly, you can ssh into the main gear of your application and run: newrelic-admin validate-config - stdout Copy This admin script will create a connection and report test transaction data under the application Python Agent Test in your account. Data can take up to five minutes to appear in the UI. If it doesn't appear after some time, capture the output from running the test and use the data to troubleshoot the issue. If you need further assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com. Initialize the Python agent The OpenShift Python cartridges provide two ways of running a WSGI application. The first method uses a preconfigured Apache/mod_wsgi installation. In this case your WSGI application entry point must be defined in the wsgi.py file. The second method relies on you to provide a standalone Python web application script called app.py. This will typically start an embedded Python WSGI server, with the WSGI application entry point being specified within the app.py file, or be imported from a separate Python code file, such as the wsgi.py file. For either method, OpenShift controls the startup of the WSGI server. You must manually integrate the Python agent into your WSGI application. You cannot use the newrelic-admin wrapper script around the startup of the WSGI server. If you are using the Apache/mod_wsgi approach, add the following code at the very start of the wsgi.py file: import newrelic.agent newrelic.agent.initialize() Copy Make sure this precedes any other Python module imports appearing in the wsgi.py file. You do not need to provide any arguments to the initialize() call, because the license key information and destination for logging are read from the environment variables. If you are using an embedded Python WSGI server from app.py, place these lines at the very top of the app.py file, even if you import the WSGI application entry point from a wsgi.py file. When using app.py with wsgi.py, do not add these lines to wsgi.py. Avoid using the built-in development servers of any web framework. Also, do not use the OpenShift Python 2.6 cartridge or older Django versions. This is because these development servers are often based on the WSGI server from the wsgiref module from the Python standard library. The WSGI server from the wsgiref module had a bug, which meant it was not fully WSGI-compliant, and this would cause the Python agent to report incorrect data. This issue with the wsgiref module is only fixed in Python 2.7.4. The built-in WSGI server in older versions of Django prior to Django 1.4 had a similar problem. Wrap the WSGI application If you are using a Python web framework for which the agent provides automatic wrapping of the WSGI application entry point, this is all that needs to be done. Python web frameworks with automatic wrapping include Django, Flask, and Bottle. For others, you must modify the Python code file with your WSGI application entry point to wrap the WSGI application object with a WSGI application wrapper. This will initiate the timing for the web requests received by your application. Entry point Example code Enty point is a function Wrap it in a decorator. import newrelic.agent @newrelic.agent.wsgi_application() def application(environ, start_response): ... Copy Enty point is a function or object imported from a different module. Wrap it in pre decorator style. import myapp application = myapp.WSGIHandler() application = newrelic.agent.WSGIApplicationWrapper(application) Copy Override the application name By default, your data is recorded under the app name Python Application. To change the display name, use the APM user interface. However, from the agent side, we highly recommends keeping this as a unique, unchanging value, independent of changes to the display name in the UI. This is required if you intend to run multiple distinct sites under the one New Relic account and want to have the data reported separately. To override the application name, use the rhc env set command: rhc env set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='Web Site (Production)' -a yourappname Copy To verify that the configuration has been updated, run: rhc env list -a yourappname Copy Then look for: NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=Web Site (Production) Copy Changes to environment variables only take effect the next time you restart your web application gears. Debug the Python agent To begin debugging, collect the log output from the Python agent. When the NEW_RELIC_LOG environment variable is set to stderr, the log messages from the Python agent will be captured within the standard Python web application logs. To tail the web application logs under OpenShift, run: rhc tail -a YOUR_APP_NAME Copy To get the complete log, copy back from each of your web applications the log file: $OPENSHIFT_PYTHON_LOG_DIR/python.log Copy By default the Python agent will log at info level. If the agent requires an alternate level of logging, you will need to manually add an additional environment variable. For example, to set logging output to debug, run: rhc env set NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=debug -a YOUR_APP_NAME Copy Environment variables do not take effect immediately, so be sure to restart your web application gears. Run debug logging only when requested and only for the time required. Debug logging can produce a lot of output and will bloat your log files. Remove this setting as soon as it is no longer required by running the following command, and then restart your web application gears: rhc env unset NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL -a YOUR_APP_NAME Copy Use the logfile to troubleshoot the issue. If you need further assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com Update agent configuration file With OpenShift, the preferred way of specifying your account license key and defining where logging should go is to use environment variables. This means it is not necessary to use an agent configuration file to get the agent working. However, without the agent configuration file, it is not possible to customize other agent settings. If you enable server-side configuration for your application, you do not need an agent configuration file. This is done from the Application settings in the APM user interface application. Using server-side configuration you can override core settings for the agent. When a change is made to a setting via the UI, the agent running within each of your web application processes will be notified, and it will pick up the changed settings. However, some agent features are incompatible with server-side configuration. In these cases, use an agent configuration file pushed up with your web application to OpenShift. To add and enable an agent configuration file with OpenShift: Add the agent configuration file newrelic.ini to the root directory of your project repository that you are pushing up to OpenShift. This should contain a [newrelic] section along with just the specific configuration setting you need to set. For example: [newrelic] transaction_tracer.function_trace = mydbm:connect Copy Do not use the agent configuration file for core settings such as the license key or app name, as doing so will override the environment variable settings. You also likely do not want the license key as part of your GIT repository, especially if the project source code is publicly available. Also note that if server-side configuration is enabled at the same time, any setting that can be set via server-side configuration will always override the local setting. Therefore only use this for settings that cannot be set using server-side configuration if server-side configuration is enabled. Now modify the wsgi.py or app.py file where you added the code to initialize the Python agent. Change the code you had already added to: import os import newrelic.agent repo_dir = os.environ['OPENSHIFT_REPO_DIR'] config_file = os.path.join(repo_dir, 'newrelic.ini') newrelic.agent.initialize(config_file) Copy Commit the configuration file to your repository and push the change up to OpenShift.",

Install the Python agent Before you install the Python agent, make sure your system meets the system requirements. You must also create a New Relic account. We support a number of web frameworks and libraries right out of the box, including Django, WSGI, and Gunicorn. If you use one of the supported web frameworks, installation is easy. If you use an unsupported framework, the process will involve some additions to your app code and/or web server files. For a quick and simple install process that will work for the majority of setups, follow these simple steps: Download and install the Python package. Create config file. Integrate the Python agent with your application. Read the Quick Start guide Add Python data Monitor non-web scripts, background tasks, and functions The Python agent also lets you monitor non-web scripts, worker processes, tasks, and functions. The installation process for these non-web transactions is similar to the one used for a web app, with one major difference: instead of going through the standard integration process described in the install instructions, you would manually \"wrap\" any function you want to monitor. For more information, see Non-web tasks and processes. For instructions on monitoring Celery tasks, see Celery background tasks. What's next after installation? Once you get the agent up and running, some suggested next steps are: Explore your data in and get comfortable with the user interface. Read our docs on our other observability solutions and the APM page. Change your application's name, or other configuration options. Learn about setting up custom instrumentation for application activity not monitored by default. Consider the Python Telemetry SDK. Troubleshooting After you complete the install process, your data should appear in the APM UI within five minutes. If it does not, use these troubleshooting resources: If no data appears, follow these troubleshooting steps. If you experience issues when installing or running the Python agent on a new host, test that the package is installed correctly and that it can contact New Relic's data collector service. For other problems, see the full list of troubleshooting documentation. Check the source code The Python agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "Heroku is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) solution for hosting web applications in various agent languages, including Python. With the agent, you can extend Heroku with metrics from New Relic One. This document describes special considerations for using Heroku as a hosting service with Python agent. Contents Install the New Relic add-on After deploying your Python app on Heroku, install the Python agent: Via the Heroku website To install the New Relic add-on through the Heroku website, you must be logged in to Heroku: From Heroku's Add-on page for New Relic, select a subscription plan. From Select an app, select your New Relic app. Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='Your Application Name' Copy Restart your dyno. Generate some traffic to your app. Via Heroku toolbelt To install the Python agent add-on with Heroku the toolbelt: Run the following command, where $planlevel is the appropriate subscription plan: heroku addons:create newrelic:$planlevel Copy Give your application a descriptive name with this toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='Your Application Name' Copy Restart your dyno. Generate some traffic to your app. Installing the add-on automatically creates a private New Relic account and configures access for Heroku hosts. The agent will begin monitoring application performance, end user experience, and host performance collected after the add-on is installed. Within a few minutes, data should start appearing in your APM Summary page. Upgrade from an existing agent installation If an agent is already installed, reinstall the add-on using the Heroku toolbelt command. heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='Your Application Name' Copy Install the Python agent To install a third party Python package such as our Python agent on Heroku, use pip. Heroku automatically looks for a requirements.txt file in the root directory of your project. It installs anything listed in that file when you push your project to Heroku. Create or edit the requirements.txt file, adding the line: newrelic Copy Django users: Modify the web entry of your Procfile, prefixing the value with newrelic-admin run-program. For example: web: newrelic-admin run-program gunicorn mysite.wsgi Copy Push your project up to Heroku. This will install the the Python agent package with the latest version listed on the Python Package Index (PyPi). Update the Python agent Heroku caches packages and does not detect when a newer version of the Python agent is available. To force an upgrade: Edit the requirements.txt file by including the specific Python agent version (n.n.n.n) with the package name: newrelic==n.n.n.n Copy Push your project up to Heroku. Verify the New Relic add-on To verify that the New Relic add-on has been enabled, run: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC Copy This generates a list of New Relic-specific environment variables in Heroku. The Python agent uses these to determine which New Relic account and application data to use for reporting data. At a minimum, you should see: NEW_RELIC_LOG=stdout NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=Your app name Copy The license key is unique to your New Relic account. Troubleshoot your installation Within a few minutes of installing and configuring the agent, data should start appearing in your app's APM Summary page. If no data appears, test that environment variables are being detected properly by running: heroku run newrelic-admin validate-config - stdout Copy This will create a connection and report test transaction data under the application Python Agent Test. Capture the output from running the test, and use the data to troubleshoot the issue. If you need further assistance, follow the Python agent troubleshooting procedures. Initialize the Python agent To initialize the Python agent: From the root of your project, find the Procfile. Modify the web entry in your Procfile to define what to do to start up your Python web application. Refer to the following examples to insert newrelic-admin run-program at the start of the command. Run your Python web application under the control of the the Python agent's admin script. Hosting mechanism Example web entry Flask with the built-in development host web: newrelic-admin run-program python hello.py Copy Flask with gunicorn web: newrelic-admin run-program gunicorn -b \"0.0.0.0:$PORT\" -w 3 hello:app Copy Django with gunicorn listed in INSTALLED_APPS web: newrelic-admin run-program python hellodjango/manage.py run_gunicorn -b \"0.0.0.0:$PORT\" -w 3 Copy Caution Avoid using the built-in development hosts of any web framework prior to Python version 2.7.4 or prior to Django 1.4. Instead, use gunicorn or uWSGI. The WSGI host using the wsgiref module was not fully WSGI compliant for development hosts prior to Python version 2.7.4. This prevented the Python agent from being able to report correct data. WSGI application wrapping The agent provides automatic wrapping of the the WSGI application point for these web frameworks: Bottle Django Flask If you are using any of these Python web frameworks, no additional steps are required. For others, you must modify the Python code file with your WSGI application entry point to wrap the WSGI application object with a WSGI application wrapper. This will initiate the timing for the web requests received by your application. If the entry point is this... Do this... Entry point is a function Wrap it in a decorator: import newrelic.agent @newrelic.agent.wsgi_application() def application(environ, start_response): ... Copy Entry point is a function or object imported from a different module Wrap it in pre decorator style: import myapp application = myapp.WSGIHandler() application = newrelic.agent.WSGIApplicationWrapper(application) Copy Track Celery tasks To record execution time for Celery tasks as background tasks against your web application, wrap the startup of the Celery host with the newrelic-admin command. Prefix the existing startup command defined by the worker entry in your Procfile: worker: newrelic-admin run-program python hellodjango/manage.py celeryd -E -B --loglevel=INFO Copy Debug the Python agent To begin debugging, collect the log output from the Python agent. Heroku sends Python agent output to standard output and captures it in the web server log. To get access to the web server log for Heroku, run: heroku logs Copy By default the Python agent will log at info level. If New Relic Support requests an alternate level of logging, you must manually add a config variable. For example, to set logging output to debug, run: heroku config:add NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=debug Copy Your application automatically restarts when you change the log level. Caution The debug log level produces large quantities of output. Be sure to remove this setting as soon as it is no longer required, by running: heroku config:remove NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Copy Edit the agent configuration file When using Heroku's add-on with New Relic, this automatically sets key environment variables for the Python agent. You can also customize additional settings with the agent configuration file, or use server-side configuration. Do not add core settings such as the license key, application name, etc. to the configuration file. Heroku automatically adds these settings. To customize other settings, use the Python agent configuration file with Heroku: Add the newrelic.ini agent configuration file to the root directory of your project repository that you are pushing up to Heroku: In the [newrelic] section, include the specific configuration setting; for example: [newrelic] transaction_tracer.function_trace = mydbm:connect Copy Commit the configuration file to your repository, and push the change up to Heroku. Use the heroku config:add command to set the NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE environment variable for your deployed application: heroku config:add NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini Copy If you are using the newrelic-admin wrapper program to launch your WSGI host, the settings for your license key, application name, etc., will be picked up from the environment variables set by Heroku. Any additional settings you set in the agent configuration file will also be applied. Then, when the agent registers with New Relic, any server-side configuration will also be merged to create the final configuration the agent will use.",

      "body": "OpenShift is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) solution capable of hosting web applications using various languages, including the Python agent. Prepare your application Before installing the Python agent, make sure your Python web application is installed and running under OpenShift using one of the available Python cartridges. See the OpenShift developer guides for more information. Install the APM Python agent OpenShift support two different ways of installing third party Python packages. You can either list the package as a dependency in the setup.py for your web application, or in the requirements.txt file used by pip. If you are using a setup.py file, install the agent by adding newrelic to the list of third party modules passed to install_requires: from setuptools import setup setup(name='YourAppName', version='1.0', description='OpenShift App', author='Your Name', author_email='example@example.com', url='https://www.python.org/community/sigs/current/distutils-sig', install_requires=['Flask>=0.7.2', 'MarkupSafe', 'newrelic'], ) Copy If you are using pip, add the following line to requirements.txt: newrelic Copy When you push your project up to OpenShift, this will install the Python agent package. It will use the latest version of the Python agent from the OpenShift mirror of the Python Package Index (PyPi). Updates to the OpenShift mirror of PyPi can be delayed, so you may have to wait up to a day before a new release on PyPi is available on OpenShift. Update the Python agent OpenShift will cache packages and will not detect when a newer version of the Python agent is available. To force an upgrade to a newer version, explicitly list the version against the package name in the setup.py or requirements.txt file and push your application. Use this syntax: newrelic==A.B.C.D Copy Replace A.B.C.D with the version of the the Python agent you wish to install. Use Python agent environment variables In order for the Python agent to report data to the correct account, you need to tell it the license key for your New Relic account. For OpenShift, the most secure way to provide the license key is using an environment variable configured in your application configuration using the rhc env set command. This avoids storing sensitive information in your GIT repository and also works if you are using a scaled web application which is hosted on multiple physical hosts. rhc env set NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=YOUR_LICENSE_KEY -a YOUR_APP_NAME Copy While specifying your license key, also tell the Python agent where to record log messages: rhc env set NEW_RELIC_LOG=stderr -a YOUR_APP_NAME Copy To verify that the environment variables are being set, run: rhc env list -a YOUR_APP_NAME Copy Although set, these will only take effect the next time the web application gears are restarted. Test the agent installation To test that the Python agent package has been installed correctly and that the agent environment variables are being set correctly, you can ssh into the main gear of your application and run: newrelic-admin validate-config - stdout Copy This admin script will create a connection and report test transaction data under the application Python Agent Test in your account. Data can take up to five minutes to appear in the UI. If it doesn't appear after some time, capture the output from running the test and use the data to troubleshoot the issue. If you need further assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com. Initialize the Python agent The OpenShift Python cartridges provide two ways of running a WSGI application. The first method uses a preconfigured Apache/mod_wsgi installation. In this case your WSGI application entry point must be defined in the wsgi.py file. The second method relies on you to provide a standalone Python web application script called app.py. This will typically start an embedded Python WSGI server, with the WSGI application entry point being specified within the app.py file, or be imported from a separate Python code file, such as the wsgi.py file. For either method, OpenShift controls the startup of the WSGI server. You must manually integrate the Python agent into your WSGI application. You cannot use the newrelic-admin wrapper script around the startup of the WSGI server. If you are using the Apache/mod_wsgi approach, add the following code at the very start of the wsgi.py file: import newrelic.agent newrelic.agent.initialize() Copy Make sure this precedes any other Python module imports appearing in the wsgi.py file. You do not need to provide any arguments to the initialize() call, because the license key information and destination for logging are read from the environment variables. If you are using an embedded Python WSGI server from app.py, place these lines at the very top of the app.py file, even if you import the WSGI application entry point from a wsgi.py file. When using app.py with wsgi.py, do not add these lines to wsgi.py. Avoid using the built-in development servers of any web framework. Also, do not use the OpenShift Python 2.6 cartridge or older Django versions. This is because these development servers are often based on the WSGI server from the wsgiref module from the Python standard library. The WSGI server from the wsgiref module had a bug, which meant it was not fully WSGI-compliant, and this would cause the Python agent to report incorrect data. This issue with the wsgiref module is only fixed in Python 2.7.4. The built-in WSGI server in older versions of Django prior to Django 1.4 had a similar problem. Wrap the WSGI application If you are using a Python web framework for which the agent provides automatic wrapping of the WSGI application entry point, this is all that needs to be done. Python web frameworks with automatic wrapping include Django, Flask, and Bottle. For others, you must modify the Python code file with your WSGI application entry point to wrap the WSGI application object with a WSGI application wrapper. This will initiate the timing for the web requests received by your application. Entry point Example code Enty point is a function Wrap it in a decorator. import newrelic.agent @newrelic.agent.wsgi_application() def application(environ, start_response): ... Copy Enty point is a function or object imported from a different module. Wrap it in pre decorator style. import myapp application = myapp.WSGIHandler() application = newrelic.agent.WSGIApplicationWrapper(application) Copy Override the application name By default, your data is recorded under the app name Python Application. To change the display name, use the APM user interface. However, from the agent side, we highly recommends keeping this as a unique, unchanging value, independent of changes to the display name in the UI. This is required if you intend to run multiple distinct sites under the one New Relic account and want to have the data reported separately. To override the application name, use the rhc env set command: rhc env set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='Web Site (Production)' -a yourappname Copy To verify that the configuration has been updated, run: rhc env list -a yourappname Copy Then look for: NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=Web Site (Production) Copy Changes to environment variables only take effect the next time you restart your web application gears. Debug the Python agent To begin debugging, collect the log output from the Python agent. When the NEW_RELIC_LOG environment variable is set to stderr, the log messages from the Python agent will be captured within the standard Python web application logs. To tail the web application logs under OpenShift, run: rhc tail -a YOUR_APP_NAME Copy To get the complete log, copy back from each of your web applications the log file: $OPENSHIFT_PYTHON_LOG_DIR/python.log Copy By default the Python agent will log at info level. If the agent requires an alternate level of logging, you will need to manually add an additional environment variable. For example, to set logging output to debug, run: rhc env set NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=debug -a YOUR_APP_NAME Copy Environment variables do not take effect immediately, so be sure to restart your web application gears. Run debug logging only when requested and only for the time required. Debug logging can produce a lot of output and will bloat your log files. Remove this setting as soon as it is no longer required by running the following command, and then restart your web application gears: rhc env unset NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL -a YOUR_APP_NAME Copy Use the logfile to troubleshoot the issue. If you need further assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com Update agent configuration file With OpenShift, the preferred way of specifying your account license key and defining where logging should go is to use environment variables. This means it is not necessary to use an agent configuration file to get the agent working. However, without the agent configuration file, it is not possible to customize other agent settings. If you enable server-side configuration for your application, you do not need an agent configuration file. This is done from the Application settings in the APM user interface application. Using server-side configuration you can override core settings for the agent. When a change is made to a setting via the UI, the agent running within each of your web application processes will be notified, and it will pick up the changed settings. However, some agent features are incompatible with server-side configuration. In these cases, use an agent configuration file pushed up with your web application to OpenShift. To add and enable an agent configuration file with OpenShift: Add the agent configuration file newrelic.ini to the root directory of your project repository that you are pushing up to OpenShift. This should contain a [newrelic] section along with just the specific configuration setting you need to set. For example: [newrelic] transaction_tracer.function_trace = mydbm:connect Copy Do not use the agent configuration file for core settings such as the license key or app name, as doing so will override the environment variable settings. You also likely do not want the license key as part of your GIT repository, especially if the project source code is publicly available. Also note that if server-side configuration is enabled at the same time, any setting that can be set via server-side configuration will always override the local setting. Therefore only use this for settings that cannot be set using server-side configuration if server-side configuration is enabled. Now modify the wsgi.py or app.py file where you added the code to initialize the Python agent. Change the code you had already added to: import os import newrelic.agent repo_dir = os.environ['OPENSHIFT_REPO_DIR'] config_file = os.path.join(repo_dir, 'newrelic.ini') newrelic.agent.initialize(config_file) Copy Commit the configuration file to your repository and push the change up to OpenShift.",

Extend agent instrumentation Other helpful tools include: Tools Description Browser monitoring Integrate the Python agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user browser activity. Simple scripts and background tasks Monitor job-based or task queuing systems, like Celery, or other standalone non-web functions. Business data analysis with data exploration. Use the Python agent with our data explorer to organize, query, and visualize your data to answer key questions about application performance and customer experience. Use default transaction attributes, or add your own. Query your data using the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). Send your own event data. Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards. Install the Python agent Before you install the Python agent, make sure your system meets the system requirements. You must also create a New Relic account. We support a number of web frameworks and libraries right out of the box, including Django, WSGI, and Gunicorn. If you use one of the supported web frameworks, installation is easy. If you use an unsupported framework, the process will involve some additions to your app code and/or web server files. For a quick and simple install process that will work for the majority of setups, follow these simple steps: Download and install the Python package. Create config file. Integrate the Python agent with your application. Read the Quick Start guide Add Python data Monitor non-web scripts, background tasks, and functions The Python agent also lets you monitor non-web scripts, worker processes, tasks, and functions. The installation process for these non-web transactions is similar to the one used for a web app, with one major difference: instead of going through the standard integration process described in the install instructions, you would manually \"wrap\" any function you want to monitor. For more information, see Non-web tasks and processes. For instructions on monitoring Celery tasks, see Celery background tasks. What's next after installation? Once you get the agent up and running, some suggested next steps are: Explore your data in and get comfortable with the user interface. Read our docs on our other observability solutions and the APM page. Change your application's name, or other configuration options. Learn about setting up custom instrumentation for application activity not monitored by default. Consider the Python Telemetry SDK. Troubleshooting After you complete the install process, your data should appear in the APM UI within five minutes. If it does not, use these troubleshooting resources: If no data appears, follow these troubleshooting steps. If you experience issues when installing or running the Python agent on a new host, test that the package is installed correctly and that it can contact New Relic's data collector service. For other problems, see the full list of troubleshooting documentation. Check the source code The Python agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "The Python agent API allows you to customize and extend your monitoring. Use the Python agent API to: Manually instrument an unsupported framework or third-party system. Add instrumentation to supplement the agent's default monitoring. This document describes some of the available Python API calls. For a description of all our available APIs, see Introduction to APIs. Custom instrumentation or API If your goal is custom instrumentation, consider using the configuration file method, which allows you to add functions and class methods to the config file that will be auto-instrumented by the agent. The benefit of the config-file method is that it does not require you to change your application code. However, the Python agent API is much more powerful and is best for setting up more complex and tailored instrumentation. To ensure you have access to the full API functionality, update to the latest Python agent. Monitor transactions and segments The Python agent is compatible with most of the common WSGI web frameworks. If the agent supports your framework, web requests automatically will be captured as transactions and displayed in the New Relic One UI. A transaction can also have function-level segments that are captured as part of a transaction trace. Use these methods to monitor web transactions, non-web transactions, and transaction segments: If you want to... Do this... Monitor WSGI web transactions The Python agent automatically captures web transactions for supported frameworks. If you do not have a supported framework, you can use the wsgi_application function to monitor your WSGI entry point. Monitor non-web transactions The Python agent classifies non-web transactions as background tasks. To capture non-web transactions, use background_task. Capture more details about a transaction If your transaction traces do not have the level of detail you want: Use function_trace to capture more function-level detail in transactions. Use datastore_trace to capture more detail about datastore calls. Ignore a transaction Use any of these options: To ignore a transaction altogether, use ignore_transaction. To prevent a transaction from producing a transaction trace, use suppress_transaction_trace. To end a transaction before the agent would end it automatically, use end_of_transaction. Add and edit transaction metadata Sometimes the code you target is visible in our UI, but some details of the method are not useful. For example: The default name is not helpful, or it is causing a metric grouping issue. You want to add custom attributes to your transactions so you can filter them when querying. Use these calls when you want to change the metadata of an existing transaction: If you want to... Do this... Get reference to current transaction To return an object representing the current transaction, use current_transaction. This is required by some other Python agent API calls. Change the name of a transaction Use set_transaction_name. Add metadata (such as a customer's subscription level) to transactions Add custom attributes to your transactions using add_custom_parameter, or use other API calls to report custom data. Mark a transaction as a background job To convert a web transaction into a background task so that it appears as a non-web transaction in the UI, use set_background_task. Prevent a transaction from affecting your Apdex score Use suppress_apdex_metric. See related logs To see logs directly within the context of your application's errors and traces, use the get_linking_metadata API call to annotate your logs. For more information about correlating log data with other telemetry data, see our logs in context documentation. Report custom events and custom metric data The agent reports data in two primary forms: Metric data measures numeric, time-based values; for example, connections per minute. Event data captures discrete event information. Events have key-value attributes attached to them. You can analyze and query event data. Use these methods to create new event data and new metric data: If you want to... Do this... Send data about an event for use when querying your data. Use record_custom_event. Report time-based metrics on application performance To report a single metric, use record_custom_metric. To report a set of metrics, use record_custom_metrics. Report an exception as an error By default, the Python agent only reports unhandled exceptions. To report a Python exception as an error, use notice_error. Report query string parameters For security reasons, query string parameters associated with web transactions are disabled by default. Use capture_request_params to enable them. Tag events with metadata To add attributes to events for more detailed analysis in Insights or error analytics, use add_custom_parameter. Generate metrics from data sources and data factories To generate metrics with a pull-style API rather than the push-style API implemented by record_custom_metric(), use these API calls: register_data_source data_source_generator data_source_factory Message-related calls These API calls allow you to collect performance data on your message-passing architecture or service; for example, RabbitMQ. To use these calls, make sure you have Python agent version 2.88.0.72 or higher. If you want to... Do this... Report messages as a transaction Use message_transaction. Report message details as transaction trace segments Use message_trace. Implement distributed tracing These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. Services and applications monitored by our agents will automatically pass distributed tracing context to each other when using a supported framework. When not using a supported framework, you will need to use the distributed tracing APIs to manually accept this context. Supported web frameworks (for example, Flask, Django, Tornado) will automatically call accept_distributed_trace_payload when creating a transaction. Supported external web services libraries will automatically call create_distributed_trace_payload before making an external HTTP call. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. If you want to... Do this... Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Use create_distributed_trace_payload. Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace Use accept_distributed_trace_payload. Agent configuration, initialization, shutdown These calls help you manage Python agent behavior, such as initializing and integrating the agent, and referencing or changing configuration settings: If you want to... Do this... Initialize the agent To initialize the Python agent with a specific configuration file as part of advanced integration process, use initialize. Get a reference to the application object The application object represents an agent-monitored application and is used by some Python agent API calls. Get a reference to configuration settings To control the Python agent's behavior, you can use configuration settings. To get a reference to config file and environment variable settings and make changes to them, use global_settings. To get a reference to all settings, including server-side configuration from our UI, use application_settings. Shut down the agent To forcibly shut down the agent instead of allowing it to make the standard final attempt to upload data, use shutdown_agent. Control the Browser monitoring agent You can install the browser monitoring agent by automatically adding it to your pages or by deploying it on specific pages by copying and pasting the browser agent JavaScript snippet. You can also control the browser agent by using APM agent API calls. For more information, see Browser agent and the Python agent. If you want to... Do this... Monitor specific page views To inject the browser agent header and footer JavaScript snippets into views you want to monitor, use both get_browser_timing_header and get_browser_timing_footer. Disable monitoring of specific page views To disable browser monitoring for specific page views, use disable_browser_autorum.",

For additional information about specific agent updates, refer to the Python agent release notes. Update with Python package index (PyPi) The Python agent package is listed on PyPi at http://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic. To update with a specific package, follow the corresponding instructions: Python package Installation procedures pip To update the newrelic package directly from PyPi, run: pip install --upgrade newrelic Copy If you have New Relic in your requirements.txt file, you can do a mass update of all required packages by running: pip install -r requirements.txt Copy easy_install To update using easy_install, run: easy_install --upgrade newrelic Copy Tip We recommend using pip rather than using easy_install, because pip will correctly remove old versions when updating the agent software. buildout Install the package by creating an appropriate section for the newrelic package using the zc.recipe.egg recipe. Download package manually To manually download the New Relic Python package: Remove the current New Relic package. Download the new package, then follow the Python agent installation procedures. Tip We recommend using pip rather than using manual installation, because pip will correctly remove old versions when updating the agent software. Python agent versions not supported End of life notification: As of January 26, 2015, we will no longer accept data from Python agent versions earlier than 2.42.0. These agent versions use an out-of-date protocol when communicating with our data collection services. In addition, many of these versions contain a potential security issue where they may incorrectly send sensitive data to our data collector. Update unsupported agent versions Important If you are updating from an older agent version, including major version jumps, review the following list for changes in functionality. Migration Comments 4.2.0.100 and higher Release notes: Python agent 4.2.0.100 Manual override for the path to your local CA bundle. This CA bundle will be used to validate the SSL certificate presented by our data collection service. Set with the Python agent config file. 4.0.0.99 Release notes: Python agent 4.0.0.99 Previously deprecated APIs removed: Transaction.add_user_attribute (use Transaction.add_custom_parameter) Transaction.add_user_attributes (use Transaction.add_custom_parameters) wrap_callable (use FunctionWrapper) Removed support for Python 2.6 and Python 3.3: Python 2.6 and Python 3.3 are no longer supported. Recommendation: Update your application to a supported version of Python in order to continue to receive updates to the Python agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3: These are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. 3.0.0.89 Release notes: Python agent 3.0.0.89 Previously deprecated APIs removed: transaction (use current_transaction) name_transaction (use set_transaction_name) Application.record_metric (use Application.record_custom_metric) Application.record_metrics (use Application.record_custom_metrics) Transaction.record_metric (use Transaction.record_custom_metric) Transaction.name_transaction (use Transaction.set_transaction_name) Deprecated APIs: Transaction.add_user_attribute has been deprecated in favor of Transaction.add_custom_parameter. Transaction.add_user_attribute will be removed in a future release. Transaction.add_user_attributes has been deprecated in favor of Transaction.add_custom_parameters. Transaction.add_user_attributes will be removed in a future release. wrap_callable has been deprecated in favor of FunctionWrapper. wrap_callable will be removed in a future release. data-source admin command: The platform API (used by newrelic-admin data-source) has been removed. Please use data sources in place of the platform API. 2.104.0.86 Release notes: Python agent 2.104.0.86 SSL: Disabling SSL connections has been deprecated. SSL connections are enabled by default. In a future release, the option to disable SSL will be removed. 2.56.0.42 Release notes: Python agent 2.56.0.42 Deprecated config settings: Several configuration settings have been deprecated. The most commonly used of the deprecated settings are capture_params and ignored_params. To achieve the same functionality as the old settings, use the new attributes.include and attributes.exclude settings. 2.10.0.8 Release notes: Python agent 2.10.0.8 Deprecated API: Do not use the agent API function add_user_attribute(), which is now deprecated. Instead, use the add_custom_parameter() function. Optional: To display these parameters in browser traces, enable the browser_monitoring.capture_attributes agent configuration setting. At or below 2.0.0 Proxy settings: Python agent versions 2.0.0 or earlier do not provide the proxy_scheme setting, and the protocol scheme defaults to http or https depending on whether SSL is disabled or enabled. If you are updating from an older agent version and your config file doesn't include proxy_scheme, ensure you add the setting and set it appropriately. If you don't, the agent will continue to base the protocol scheme on the SSL setting for backwards compatibility. Proxies are usually only configured to accept proxy requests via the http protocol scheme. If you do not set proxy_scheme, this may result in a failure. 1.11.0.55 Release notes: Python agent 1.11.0.55 Thread profiling for WSGI servers: We have disabled the ability to get thread profiling information when a WSGI server uses coroutine libraries such as gevent or eventlet. This is because, due to the nature of how coroutines are implemented, we are not able to generate accurate usable data. 1.0.3.138 Release notes: Python agent 1.0.3.138 Attributes from WSGI requests: Attributes captured from WSGI request environments such as REQUEST_METHOD, HTTP_REFERER, and HTTP_USER_AGENT now appear in the UI under the Request environment category in error details and slow transaction traces. Previously they appeared in the UI under Custom parameters.",

To update with a specific package, follow the corresponding instructions: Python package Installation procedures pip To update the newrelic package directly from PyPi, run: pip install --upgrade newrelic Copy If you have New Relic in your requirements.txt file, you can do a mass update of all required packages by running: pip install -r requirements.txt Copy easy_install To update using easy_install, run: easy_install --upgrade newrelic Copy Tip We recommend using pip rather than using easy_install, because pip will correctly remove old versions when updating the agent software. buildout Install the package by creating an appropriate section for the newrelic package using the zc.recipe.egg recipe. Download package manually To manually download the New Relic Python package: Remove the current New Relic package. Download the new package, then follow the Python agent installation procedures. Tip We recommend using pip rather than using manual installation, because pip will correctly remove old versions when updating the agent software. Python agent versions not supported End of life notification: As of January 26, 2015, we will no longer accept data from Python agent versions earlier than 2.42.0. These agent versions use an out-of-date protocol when communicating with our data collection services. In addition, many of these versions contain a potential security issue where they may incorrectly send sensitive data to our data collector. Update unsupported agent versions Important If you are updating from an older agent version, including major version jumps, review the following list for changes in functionality. Migration Comments 4.2.0.100 and higher Release notes: Python agent 4.2.0.100 Manual override for the path to your local CA bundle. This CA bundle will be used to validate the SSL certificate presented by our data collection service. Set with the Python agent config file. 4.0.0.99 Release notes: Python agent 4.0.0.99 Previously deprecated APIs removed: Transaction.add_user_attribute (use Transaction.add_custom_parameter) Transaction.add_user_attributes (use Transaction.add_custom_parameters) wrap_callable (use FunctionWrapper) Removed support for Python 2.6 and Python 3.3: Python 2.6 and Python 3.3 are no longer supported. Recommendation: Update your application to a supported version of Python in order to continue to receive updates to the Python agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3: These are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. 3.0.0.89 Release notes: Python agent 3.0.0.89 Previously deprecated APIs removed: transaction (use current_transaction) name_transaction (use set_transaction_name) Application.record_metric (use Application.record_custom_metric) Application.record_metrics (use Application.record_custom_metrics) Transaction.record_metric (use Transaction.record_custom_metric) Transaction.name_transaction (use Transaction.set_transaction_name) Deprecated APIs: Transaction.add_user_attribute has been deprecated in favor of Transaction.add_custom_parameter. Transaction.add_user_attribute will be removed in a future release. Transaction.add_user_attributes has been deprecated in favor of Transaction.add_custom_parameters. Transaction.add_user_attributes will be removed in a future release. wrap_callable has been deprecated in favor of FunctionWrapper. wrap_callable will be removed in a future release. data-source admin command: The platform API (used by newrelic-admin data-source) has been removed. Please use data sources in place of the platform API. 2.104.0.86 Release notes: Python agent 2.104.0.86 SSL: Disabling SSL connections has been deprecated. SSL connections are enabled by default. In a future release, the option to disable SSL will be removed. 2.56.0.42 Release notes: Python agent 2.56.0.42 Deprecated config settings: Several configuration settings have been deprecated. The most commonly used of the deprecated settings are capture_params and ignored_params. To achieve the same functionality as the old settings, use the new attributes.include and attributes.exclude settings. 2.10.0.8 Release notes: Python agent 2.10.0.8 Deprecated API: Do not use the agent API function add_user_attribute(), which is now deprecated. Instead, use the add_custom_parameter() function. Optional: To display these parameters in browser traces, enable the browser_monitoring.capture_attributes agent configuration setting. At or below 2.0.0 Proxy settings: Python agent versions 2.0.0 or earlier do not provide the proxy_scheme setting, and the protocol scheme defaults to http or https depending on whether SSL is disabled or enabled. If you are updating from an older agent version and your config file doesn't include proxy_scheme, ensure you add the setting and set it appropriately. If you don't, the agent will continue to base the protocol scheme on the SSL setting for backwards compatibility. Proxies are usually only configured to accept proxy requests via the http protocol scheme. If you do not set proxy_scheme, this may result in a failure. 1.11.0.55 Release notes: Python agent 1.11.0.55 Thread profiling for WSGI servers: We have disabled the ability to get thread profiling information when a WSGI server uses coroutine libraries such as gevent or eventlet. This is because, due to the nature of how coroutines are implemented, we are not able to generate accurate usable data. 1.0.3.138 Release notes: Python agent 1.0.3.138 Attributes from WSGI requests: Attributes captured from WSGI request environments such as REQUEST_METHOD, HTTP_REFERER, and HTTP_USER_AGENT now appear in the UI under the Request environment category in error details and slow transaction traces. Previously they appeared in the UI under Custom parameters.",

      "body": "Our Python agent monitors your Python application to help you identify and solve performance issues. You can also extend your performance monitoring to collect and analyze business data to help you improve the customer experience and make data-driven business decisions. With flexible options for custom instrumentation and APIs, The Python agent offers multiple building blocks to customize the data you need from your app. Our Python works with a wide variety of web frameworks and hosting mechanisms, including Django, Gunicorn, WSGI, CherryPy, uWSGI, and more. You can also install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Monitor app performance After you install the Python agent, it begins to collect data about your app. You can view the data as charts and tables in New Relic One. View the big picture of your app. Monitor your app's Apdex (user satisfaction). Get a high-level summary of your app with Summary page. Enable distributed tracing to see activity across an architecture having many services. Install Infrastructure monitoring and view detailed server/host data for your app. Find errors and problems quickly. Track key transactions specific to your business. Create custom dashboards for important metrics. Alert your team when an error or problem occurs before it affects your users. View performance after a deployment. Drill down into performance details. Examine code-level transaction traces. Examine database query traces. Examine error traces. Use thread profiler sessions to see detailed stack traces of sampled threads View logs for your APM and infrastructure data Bring your logs and application's data together to make troubleshooting easier and faster. No need to switch to another UI page in New Relic One. With logs in context, you can see log messages related to your errors and traces directly in your app's UI. You can also see logs in context of your infrastructure data, such as Kubernetes clusters. Extend agent instrumentation Other helpful tools include: Tools Description Browser monitoring Integrate the Python agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user browser activity. Simple scripts and background tasks Monitor job-based or task queuing systems, like Celery, or other standalone non-web functions. Business data analysis with data exploration. Use the Python agent with our data explorer to organize, query, and visualize your data to answer key questions about application performance and customer experience. Use default transaction attributes, or add your own. Query your data using the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). Send your own event data. Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards. Install the Python agent Before you install the Python agent, make sure your system meets the system requirements. You must also create a New Relic account. We support a number of web frameworks and libraries right out of the box, including Django, WSGI, and Gunicorn. If you use one of the supported web frameworks, installation is easy. If you use an unsupported framework, the process will involve some additions to your app code and/or web server files. For a quick and simple install process that will work for the majority of setups, follow these simple steps: Download and install the Python package. Create config file. Integrate the Python agent with your application. Read the Quick Start guide Add Python data Monitor non-web scripts, background tasks, and functions The Python agent also lets you monitor non-web scripts, worker processes, tasks, and functions. The installation process for these non-web transactions is similar to the one used for a web app, with one major difference: instead of going through the standard integration process described in the install instructions, you would manually \"wrap\" any function you want to monitor. For more information, see Non-web tasks and processes. For instructions on monitoring Celery tasks, see Celery background tasks. What's next after installation? Once you get the agent up and running, some suggested next steps are: Explore your data in and get comfortable with the user interface. Read our docs on our other observability solutions and the APM page. Change your application's name, or other configuration options. Learn about setting up custom instrumentation for application activity not monitored by default. Consider the Python Telemetry SDK. Troubleshooting After you complete the install process, your data should appear in the APM UI within five minutes. If it does not, use these troubleshooting resources: If no data appears, follow these troubleshooting steps. If you experience issues when installing or running the Python agent on a new host, test that the package is installed correctly and that it can contact New Relic's data collector service.

Python versions 2.6 and 3.3: These are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. 3.0.0.89 Release notes: Python agent 3.0.0.89 Previously deprecated APIs removed: transaction (use current_transaction) name_transaction (use set_transaction_name) Application.record_metric (use Application.record_custom_metric) Application.record_metrics (use Application.record_custom_metrics) Transaction.record_metric (use Transaction.record_custom_metric) Transaction.name_transaction (use Transaction.set_transaction_name) Deprecated APIs: Transaction.add_user_attribute has been deprecated in favor of Transaction.add_custom_parameter. Transaction.add_user_attribute will be removed in a future release. Transaction.add_user_attributes has been deprecated in favor of Transaction.add_custom_parameters. Transaction.add_user_attributes will be removed in a future release. wrap_callable has been deprecated in favor of FunctionWrapper. wrap_callable will be removed in a future release. data-source admin command: The platform API (used by newrelic-admin data-source) has been removed. Please use data sources in place of the platform API. 2.104.0.86 Release notes: Python agent 2.104.0.86 SSL: Disabling SSL connections has been deprecated. SSL connections are enabled by default. In a future release, the option to disable SSL will be removed. 2.56.0.42 Release notes: Python agent 2.56.0.42 Deprecated config settings: Several configuration settings have been deprecated. The most commonly used of the deprecated settings are capture_params and ignored_params. To achieve the same functionality as the old settings, use the new attributes.include and attributes.exclude settings. 2.10.0.8 Release notes: Python agent 2.10.0.8 Deprecated API: Do not use the agent API function add_user_attribute(), which is now deprecated. Instead, use the add_custom_parameter() function. Optional: To display these parameters in browser traces, enable the browser_monitoring.capture_attributes agent configuration setting. At or below 2.0.0 Proxy settings: Python agent versions 2.0.0 or earlier do not provide the proxy_scheme setting, and the protocol scheme defaults to http or https depending on whether SSL is disabled or enabled. If you are updating from an older agent version and your config file doesn't include proxy_scheme, ensure you add the setting and set it appropriately. If you don't, the agent will continue to base the protocol scheme on the SSL setting for backwards compatibility. Proxies are usually only configured to accept proxy requests via the http protocol scheme. If you do not set proxy_scheme, this may result in a failure. 1.11.0.55 Release notes: Python agent 1.11.0.55 Thread profiling for WSGI servers: We have disabled the ability to get thread profiling information when a WSGI server uses coroutine libraries such as gevent or eventlet. This is because, due to the nature of how coroutines are implemented, we are not able to generate accurate usable data. 1.0.3.138 Release notes: Python agent 1.0.3.138 Attributes from WSGI requests: Attributes captured from WSGI request environments such as REQUEST_METHOD, HTTP_REFERER, and HTTP_USER_AGENT now appear in the UI under the Request environment category in error details and slow transaction traces. Previously they appeared in the UI under Custom parameters.",

Install the Python agent Before you install the Python agent, make sure your system meets the system requirements. You must also create a New Relic account. We support a number of web frameworks and libraries right out of the box, including Django, WSGI, and Gunicorn. If you use one of the supported web frameworks, installation is easy. If you use an unsupported framework, the process will involve some additions to your app code and/or web server files. For a quick and simple install process that will work for the majority of setups, follow these simple steps: Download and install the Python package. Create config file. Integrate the Python agent with your application. Read the Quick Start guide Add Python data Monitor non-web scripts, background tasks, and functions The Python agent also lets you monitor non-web scripts, worker processes, tasks, and functions. The installation process for these non-web transactions is similar to the one used for a web app, with one major difference: instead of going through the standard integration process described in the install instructions, you would manually \"wrap\" any function you want to monitor. For more information, see Non-web tasks and processes. For instructions on monitoring Celery tasks, see Celery background tasks. What's next after installation? Once you get the agent up and running, some suggested next steps are: Explore your data in and get comfortable with the user interface. Read our docs on our other observability solutions and the APM page. Change your application's name, or other configuration options. Learn about setting up custom instrumentation for application activity not monitored by default. Consider the Python Telemetry SDK. Troubleshooting After you complete the install process, your data should appear in the APM UI within five minutes. If it does not, use these troubleshooting resources: If no data appears, follow these troubleshooting steps. If you experience issues when installing or running the Python agent on a new host, test that the package is installed correctly and that it can contact New Relic's data collector service.

To update with a specific package, follow the corresponding instructions: Python package Installation procedures pip To update the newrelic package directly from PyPi, run: pip install --upgrade newrelic Copy If you have New Relic in your requirements.txt file, you can do a mass update of all required packages by running: pip install -r requirements.txt Copy easy_install To update using easy_install, run: easy_install --upgrade newrelic Copy Tip We recommend using pip rather than using easy_install, because pip will correctly remove old versions when updating the agent software. buildout Install the package by creating an appropriate section for the newrelic package using the zc.recipe.egg recipe. Download package manually To manually download the New Relic Python package: Remove the current New Relic package. Download the new package, then follow the Python agent installation procedures. Tip We recommend using pip rather than using manual installation, because pip will correctly remove old versions when updating the agent software. Python agent versions not supported End of life notification: As of January 26, 2015, we will no longer accept data from Python agent versions earlier than 2.42.0. These agent versions use an out-of-date protocol when communicating with our data collection services. In addition, many of these versions contain a potential security issue where they may incorrectly send sensitive data to our data collector. Update unsupported agent versions Important If you are updating from an older agent version, including major version jumps, review the following list for changes in functionality. Migration Comments 4.2.0.100 and higher Release notes: Python agent 4.2.0.100 Manual override for the path to your local CA bundle. This CA bundle will be used to validate the SSL certificate presented by our data collection service. Set with the Python agent config file. 4.0.0.99 Release notes: Python agent 4.0.0.99 Previously deprecated APIs removed: Transaction.add_user_attribute (use Transaction.add_custom_parameter) Transaction.add_user_attributes (use Transaction.add_custom_parameters) wrap_callable (use FunctionWrapper) Removed support for Python 2.6 and Python 3.3: Python 2.6 and Python 3.3 are no longer supported. Recommendation: Update your application to a supported version of Python in order to continue to receive updates to the Python agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3: These are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. 3.0.0.89 Release notes: Python agent 3.0.0.89 Previously deprecated APIs removed: transaction (use current_transaction) name_transaction (use set_transaction_name) Application.record_metric (use Application.record_custom_metric) Application.record_metrics (use Application.record_custom_metrics) Transaction.record_metric (use Transaction.record_custom_metric) Transaction.name_transaction (use Transaction.set_transaction_name) Deprecated APIs: Transaction.add_user_attribute has been deprecated in favor of Transaction.add_custom_parameter. Transaction.add_user_attribute will be removed in a future release. Transaction.add_user_attributes has been deprecated in favor of Transaction.add_custom_parameters. Transaction.add_user_attributes will be removed in a future release. wrap_callable has been deprecated in favor of FunctionWrapper. wrap_callable will be removed in a future release. data-source admin command: The platform API (used by newrelic-admin data-source) has been removed. Please use data sources in place of the platform API. 2.104.0.86 Release notes: Python agent 2.104.0.86 SSL: Disabling SSL connections has been deprecated. SSL connections are enabled by default. In a future release, the option to disable SSL will be removed. 2.56.0.42 Release notes: Python agent 2.56.0.42 Deprecated config settings: Several configuration settings have been deprecated. The most commonly used of the deprecated settings are capture_params and ignored_params. To achieve the same functionality as the old settings, use the new attributes.include and attributes.exclude settings. 2.10.0.8 Release notes: Python agent 2.10.0.8 Deprecated API: Do not use the agent API function add_user_attribute(), which is now deprecated. Instead, use the add_custom_parameter() function. Optional: To display these parameters in browser traces, enable the browser_monitoring.capture_attributes agent configuration setting. At or below 2.0.0 Proxy settings: Python agent versions 2.0.0 or earlier do not provide the proxy_scheme setting, and the protocol scheme defaults to http or https depending on whether SSL is disabled or enabled. If you are updating from an older agent version and your config file doesn't include proxy_scheme, ensure you add the setting and set it appropriately. If you don't, the agent will continue to base the protocol scheme on the SSL setting for backwards compatibility. Proxies are usually only configured to accept proxy requests via the http protocol scheme. If you do not set proxy_scheme, this may result in a failure. 1.11.0.55 Release notes: Python agent 1.11.0.55 Thread profiling for WSGI servers: We have disabled the ability to get thread profiling information when a WSGI server uses coroutine libraries such as gevent or eventlet. This is because, due to the nature of how coroutines are implemented, we are not able to generate accurate usable data. 1.0.3.138 Release notes: Python agent 1.0.3.138 Attributes from WSGI requests: Attributes captured from WSGI request environments such as REQUEST_METHOD, HTTP_REFERER, and HTTP_USER_AGENT now appear in the UI under the Request environment category in error details and slow transaction traces.

      "body": "Our Python agent monitors your Python application to help you identify and solve performance issues. You can also extend your performance monitoring to collect and analyze business data to help you improve the customer experience and make data-driven business decisions. With flexible options for custom instrumentation and APIs, The Python agent offers multiple building blocks to customize the data you need from your app. Our Python works with a wide variety of web frameworks and hosting mechanisms, including Django, Gunicorn, WSGI, CherryPy, uWSGI, and more. You can also install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Monitor app performance After you install the Python agent, it begins to collect data about your app. You can view the data as charts and tables in New Relic One. View the big picture of your app. Monitor your app's Apdex (user satisfaction). Get a high-level summary of your app with Summary page. Enable distributed tracing to see activity across an architecture having many services. Install Infrastructure monitoring and view detailed server/host data for your app. Find errors and problems quickly. Track key transactions specific to your business. Create custom dashboards for important metrics. Alert your team when an error or problem occurs before it affects your users. View performance after a deployment. Drill down into performance details. Examine code-level transaction traces. Examine database query traces. Examine error traces. Use thread profiler sessions to see detailed stack traces of sampled threads View logs for your APM and infrastructure data Bring your logs and application's data together to make troubleshooting easier and faster. No need to switch to another UI page in New Relic One. With logs in context, you can see log messages related to your errors and traces directly in your app's UI. You can also see logs in context of your infrastructure data, such as Kubernetes clusters. Extend agent instrumentation Other helpful tools include: Tools Description Browser monitoring Integrate the Python agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user browser activity. Simple scripts and background tasks Monitor job-based or task queuing systems, like Celery, or other standalone non-web functions. Business data analysis with data exploration. Use the Python agent with our data explorer to organize, query, and visualize your data to answer key questions about application performance and customer experience. Use default transaction attributes, or add your own. Query your data using the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). Send your own event data. Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards. Install the Python agent Before you install the Python agent, make sure your system meets the system requirements. You must also create a New Relic account. We support a number of web frameworks and libraries right out of the box, including Django, WSGI, and Gunicorn. If you use one of the supported web frameworks, installation is easy. If you use an unsupported framework, the process will involve some additions to your app code and/or web server files. For a quick and simple install process that will work for the majority of setups, follow these simple steps: Download and install the Python package. Create config file. Integrate the Python agent with your application. Read the Quick Start guide Add Python data Monitor non-web scripts, background tasks, and functions The Python agent also lets you monitor non-web scripts, worker processes, tasks, and functions. The installation process for these non-web transactions is similar to the one used for a web app, with one major difference: instead of going through the standard integration process described in the install instructions, you would manually \"wrap\" any function you want to monitor. For more information, see Non-web tasks and processes. For instructions on monitoring Celery tasks, see Celery background tasks. What's next after installation? Once you get the agent up and running, some suggested next steps are: Explore your data in and get comfortable with the user interface. Read our docs on our other observability solutions and the APM page. Change your application's name, or other configuration options. Learn about setting up custom instrumentation for application activity not monitored by default. Consider the Python Telemetry SDK. Troubleshooting After you complete the install process, your data should appear in the APM UI within five minutes. If it does not, use these troubleshooting resources: If no data appears, follow these troubleshooting steps. If you experience issues when installing or running the Python agent on a new host, test that the package is installed correctly and that it can contact New Relic's data collector service. For other problems, see the full list of troubleshooting documentation. Check the source code The Python agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

If you do not set proxy_scheme, this may result in a failure. 1.11.0.55 Release notes: Python agent 1.11.0.55 Thread profiling for WSGI servers: We have disabled the ability to get thread profiling information when a WSGI server uses coroutine libraries such as gevent or eventlet. This is because, due to the nature of how coroutines are implemented, we are not able to generate accurate usable data. 1.0.3.138 Release notes: Python agent 1.0.3.138 Attributes from WSGI requests: Attributes captured from WSGI request environments such as REQUEST_METHOD, HTTP_REFERER, and HTTP_USER_AGENT now appear in the UI under the Request environment category in error details and slow transaction traces. Previously they appeared in the UI under Custom parameters.",

      "body": "Our Python agent monitors your Python application to help you identify and solve performance issues. You can also extend your performance monitoring to collect and analyze business data to help you improve the customer experience and make data-driven business decisions. With flexible options for custom instrumentation and APIs, The Python agent offers multiple building blocks to customize the data you need from your app. Our Python works with a wide variety of web frameworks and hosting mechanisms, including Django, Gunicorn, WSGI, CherryPy, uWSGI, and more. You can also install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Monitor app performance After you install the Python agent, it begins to collect data about your app. You can view the data as charts and tables in New Relic One. View the big picture of your app. Monitor your app's Apdex (user satisfaction). Get a high-level summary of your app with Summary page. Enable distributed tracing to see activity across an architecture having many services. Install Infrastructure monitoring and view detailed server/host data for your app. Find errors and problems quickly. Track key transactions specific to your business. Create custom dashboards for important metrics. Alert your team when an error or problem occurs before it affects your users. View performance after a deployment. Drill down into performance details. Examine code-level transaction traces. Examine database query traces. Examine error traces. Use thread profiler sessions to see detailed stack traces of sampled threads View logs for your APM and infrastructure data Bring your logs and application's data together to make troubleshooting easier and faster. No need to switch to another UI page in New Relic One. With logs in context, you can see log messages related to your errors and traces directly in your app's UI. You can also see logs in context of your infrastructure data, such as Kubernetes clusters. Extend agent instrumentation Other helpful tools include: Tools Description Browser monitoring Integrate the Python agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user browser activity. Simple scripts and background tasks Monitor job-based or task queuing systems, like Celery, or other standalone non-web functions. Business data analysis with data exploration. Use the Python agent with our data explorer to organize, query, and visualize your data to answer key questions about application performance and customer experience. Use default transaction attributes, or add your own. Query your data using the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). Send your own event data. Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards. Install the Python agent Before you install the Python agent, make sure your system meets the system requirements. You must also create a New Relic account. We support a number of web frameworks and libraries right out of the box, including Django, WSGI, and Gunicorn. If you use one of the supported web frameworks, installation is easy. If you use an unsupported framework, the process will involve some additions to your app code and/or web server files. For a quick and simple install process that will work for the majority of setups, follow these simple steps: Download and install the Python package. Create config file. Integrate the Python agent with your application. Read the Quick Start guide Add Python data Monitor non-web scripts, background tasks, and functions The Python agent also lets you monitor non-web scripts, worker processes, tasks, and functions. The installation process for these non-web transactions is similar to the one used for a web app, with one major difference: instead of going through the standard integration process described in the install instructions, you would manually \"wrap\" any function you want to monitor. For more information, see Non-web tasks and processes. For instructions on monitoring Celery tasks, see Celery background tasks. What's next after installation? Once you get the agent up and running, some suggested next steps are: Explore your data in and get comfortable with the user interface. Read our docs on our other observability solutions and the APM page. Change your application's name, or other configuration options. Learn about setting up custom instrumentation for application activity not monitored by default. Consider the Python Telemetry SDK. Troubleshooting After you complete the install process, your data should appear in the APM UI within five minutes. If it does not, use these troubleshooting resources: If no data appears, follow these troubleshooting steps. If you experience issues when installing or running the Python agent on a new host, test that the package is installed correctly and that it can contact New Relic's data collector service. For other problems, see the full list of troubleshooting documentation. Check the source code The Python agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "The Python agent API allows you to customize and extend your monitoring. Use the Python agent API to: Manually instrument an unsupported framework or third-party system. Add instrumentation to supplement the agent's default monitoring. This document describes some of the available Python API calls. For a description of all our available APIs, see Introduction to APIs. Custom instrumentation or API If your goal is custom instrumentation, consider using the configuration file method, which allows you to add functions and class methods to the config file that will be auto-instrumented by the agent. The benefit of the config-file method is that it does not require you to change your application code. However, the Python agent API is much more powerful and is best for setting up more complex and tailored instrumentation. To ensure you have access to the full API functionality, update to the latest Python agent. Monitor transactions and segments The Python agent is compatible with most of the common WSGI web frameworks. If the agent supports your framework, web requests automatically will be captured as transactions and displayed in the New Relic One UI. A transaction can also have function-level segments that are captured as part of a transaction trace. Use these methods to monitor web transactions, non-web transactions, and transaction segments: If you want to... Do this... Monitor WSGI web transactions The Python agent automatically captures web transactions for supported frameworks. If you do not have a supported framework, you can use the wsgi_application function to monitor your WSGI entry point. Monitor non-web transactions The Python agent classifies non-web transactions as background tasks. To capture non-web transactions, use background_task. Capture more details about a transaction If your transaction traces do not have the level of detail you want: Use function_trace to capture more function-level detail in transactions. Use datastore_trace to capture more detail about datastore calls. Ignore a transaction Use any of these options: To ignore a transaction altogether, use ignore_transaction. To prevent a transaction from producing a transaction trace, use suppress_transaction_trace. To end a transaction before the agent would end it automatically, use end_of_transaction. Add and edit transaction metadata Sometimes the code you target is visible in our UI, but some details of the method are not useful. For example: The default name is not helpful, or it is causing a metric grouping issue. You want to add custom attributes to your transactions so you can filter them when querying. Use these calls when you want to change the metadata of an existing transaction: If you want to... Do this... Get reference to current transaction To return an object representing the current transaction, use current_transaction. This is required by some other Python agent API calls. Change the name of a transaction Use set_transaction_name. Add metadata (such as a customer's subscription level) to transactions Add custom attributes to your transactions using add_custom_parameter, or use other API calls to report custom data. Mark a transaction as a background job To convert a web transaction into a background task so that it appears as a non-web transaction in the UI, use set_background_task. Prevent a transaction from affecting your Apdex score Use suppress_apdex_metric. See related logs To see logs directly within the context of your application's errors and traces, use the get_linking_metadata API call to annotate your logs. For more information about correlating log data with other telemetry data, see our logs in context documentation. Report custom events and custom metric data The agent reports data in two primary forms: Metric data measures numeric, time-based values; for example, connections per minute. Event data captures discrete event information. Events have key-value attributes attached to them. You can analyze and query event data. Use these methods to create new event data and new metric data: If you want to... Do this... Send data about an event for use when querying your data. Use record_custom_event. Report time-based metrics on application performance To report a single metric, use record_custom_metric. To report a set of metrics, use record_custom_metrics. Report an exception as an error By default, the Python agent only reports unhandled exceptions. To report a Python exception as an error, use notice_error. Report query string parameters For security reasons, query string parameters associated with web transactions are disabled by default. Use capture_request_params to enable them. Tag events with metadata To add attributes to events for more detailed analysis in Insights or error analytics, use add_custom_parameter. Generate metrics from data sources and data factories To generate metrics with a pull-style API rather than the push-style API implemented by record_custom_metric(), use these API calls: register_data_source data_source_generator data_source_factory Message-related calls These API calls allow you to collect performance data on your message-passing architecture or service; for example, RabbitMQ. To use these calls, make sure you have Python agent version 2.88.0.72 or higher. If you want to... Do this... Report messages as a transaction Use message_transaction. Report message details as transaction trace segments Use message_trace. Implement distributed tracing These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. Services and applications monitored by our agents will automatically pass distributed tracing context to each other when using a supported framework. When not using a supported framework, you will need to use the distributed tracing APIs to manually accept this context. Supported web frameworks (for example, Flask, Django, Tornado) will automatically call accept_distributed_trace_payload when creating a transaction. Supported external web services libraries will automatically call create_distributed_trace_payload before making an external HTTP call. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. If you want to... Do this... Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Use create_distributed_trace_payload. Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace Use accept_distributed_trace_payload. Agent configuration, initialization, shutdown These calls help you manage Python agent behavior, such as initializing and integrating the agent, and referencing or changing configuration settings: If you want to... Do this... Initialize the agent To initialize the Python agent with a specific configuration file as part of advanced integration process, use initialize. Get a reference to the application object The application object represents an agent-monitored application and is used by some Python agent API calls. Get a reference to configuration settings To control the Python agent's behavior, you can use configuration settings. To get a reference to config file and environment variable settings and make changes to them, use global_settings. To get a reference to all settings, including server-side configuration from our UI, use application_settings. Shut down the agent To forcibly shut down the agent instead of allowing it to make the standard final attempt to upload data, use shutdown_agent. Control the Browser monitoring agent You can install the browser monitoring agent by automatically adding it to your pages or by deploying it on specific pages by copying and pasting the browser agent JavaScript snippet. You can also control the browser agent by using APM agent API calls. For more information, see Browser agent and the Python agent. If you want to... Do this... Monitor specific page views To inject the browser agent header and footer JavaScript snippets into views you want to monitor, use both get_browser_timing_header and get_browser_timing_footer. Disable monitoring of specific page views To disable browser monitoring for specific page views, use disable_browser_autorum.",

Extend agent instrumentation Other helpful tools include: Tools Description Browser monitoring Integrate the Python agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user browser activity. Simple scripts and background tasks Monitor job-based or task queuing systems, like Celery, or other standalone non-web functions. Business data analysis with data exploration. Use the Python agent with our data explorer to organize, query, and visualize your data to answer key questions about application performance and customer experience. Use default transaction attributes, or add your own. Query your data using the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). Send your own event data. Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards. Install the Python agent Before you install the Python agent, make sure your system meets the system requirements. You must also create a New Relic account. We support a number of web frameworks and libraries right out of the box, including Django, WSGI, and Gunicorn. If you use one of the supported web frameworks, installation is easy. If you use an unsupported framework, the process will involve some additions to your app code and/or web server files. For a quick and simple install process that will work for the majority of setups, follow these simple steps: Download and install the Python package. Create config file. Integrate the Python agent with your application. Read the Quick Start guide Add Python data Monitor non-web scripts, background tasks, and functions The Python agent also lets you monitor non-web scripts, worker processes, tasks, and functions. The installation process for these non-web transactions is similar to the one used for a web app, with one major difference: instead of going through the standard integration process described in the install instructions, you would manually \"wrap\" any function you want to monitor. For more information, see Non-web tasks and processes. For instructions on monitoring Celery tasks, see Celery background tasks. What's next after installation? Once you get the agent up and running, some suggested next steps are: Explore your data in and get comfortable with the user interface. Read our docs on our other observability solutions and the APM page. Change your application's name, or other configuration options. Learn about setting up custom instrumentation for application activity not monitored by default. Consider the Python Telemetry SDK. Troubleshooting After you complete the install process, your data should appear in the APM UI within five minutes. If it does not, use these troubleshooting resources: If no data appears, follow these troubleshooting steps. If you experience issues when installing or running the Python agent on a new host, test that the package is installed correctly and that it can contact New Relic's data collector service. For other problems, see the full list of troubleshooting documentation. Check the source code The Python agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "The Python agent API allows you to customize and extend your monitoring. Use the Python agent API to: Manually instrument an unsupported framework or third-party system. Add instrumentation to supplement the agent's default monitoring. This document describes some of the available Python API calls. For a description of all our available APIs, see Introduction to APIs. Custom instrumentation or API If your goal is custom instrumentation, consider using the configuration file method, which allows you to add functions and class methods to the config file that will be auto-instrumented by the agent. The benefit of the config-file method is that it does not require you to change your application code. However, the Python agent API is much more powerful and is best for setting up more complex and tailored instrumentation. To ensure you have access to the full API functionality, update to the latest Python agent. Monitor transactions and segments The Python agent is compatible with most of the common WSGI web frameworks. If the agent supports your framework, web requests automatically will be captured as transactions and displayed in the New Relic One UI. A transaction can also have function-level segments that are captured as part of a transaction trace. Use these methods to monitor web transactions, non-web transactions, and transaction segments: If you want to... Do this... Monitor WSGI web transactions The Python agent automatically captures web transactions for supported frameworks. If you do not have a supported framework, you can use the wsgi_application function to monitor your WSGI entry point. Monitor non-web transactions The Python agent classifies non-web transactions as background tasks. To capture non-web transactions, use background_task. Capture more details about a transaction If your transaction traces do not have the level of detail you want: Use function_trace to capture more function-level detail in transactions. Use datastore_trace to capture more detail about datastore calls. Ignore a transaction Use any of these options: To ignore a transaction altogether, use ignore_transaction. To prevent a transaction from producing a transaction trace, use suppress_transaction_trace. To end a transaction before the agent would end it automatically, use end_of_transaction. Add and edit transaction metadata Sometimes the code you target is visible in our UI, but some details of the method are not useful. For example: The default name is not helpful, or it is causing a metric grouping issue. You want to add custom attributes to your transactions so you can filter them when querying. Use these calls when you want to change the metadata of an existing transaction: If you want to... Do this... Get reference to current transaction To return an object representing the current transaction, use current_transaction. This is required by some other Python agent API calls. Change the name of a transaction Use set_transaction_name. Add metadata (such as a customer's subscription level) to transactions Add custom attributes to your transactions using add_custom_parameter, or use other API calls to report custom data. Mark a transaction as a background job To convert a web transaction into a background task so that it appears as a non-web transaction in the UI, use set_background_task. Prevent a transaction from affecting your Apdex score Use suppress_apdex_metric. See related logs To see logs directly within the context of your application's errors and traces, use the get_linking_metadata API call to annotate your logs. For more information about correlating log data with other telemetry data, see our logs in context documentation. Report custom events and custom metric data The agent reports data in two primary forms: Metric data measures numeric, time-based values; for example, connections per minute. Event data captures discrete event information. Events have key-value attributes attached to them. You can analyze and query event data. Use these methods to create new event data and new metric data: If you want to... Do this... Send data about an event for use when querying your data. Use record_custom_event. Report time-based metrics on application performance To report a single metric, use record_custom_metric. To report a set of metrics, use record_custom_metrics. Report an exception as an error By default, the Python agent only reports unhandled exceptions. To report a Python exception as an error, use notice_error. Report query string parameters For security reasons, query string parameters associated with web transactions are disabled by default. Use capture_request_params to enable them. Tag events with metadata To add attributes to events for more detailed analysis in Insights or error analytics, use add_custom_parameter. Generate metrics from data sources and data factories To generate metrics with a pull-style API rather than the push-style API implemented by record_custom_metric(), use these API calls: register_data_source data_source_generator data_source_factory Message-related calls These API calls allow you to collect performance data on your message-passing architecture or service; for example, RabbitMQ. To use these calls, make sure you have Python agent version 2.88.0.72 or higher. If you want to... Do this... Report messages as a transaction Use message_transaction. Report message details as transaction trace segments Use message_trace. Implement distributed tracing These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. Services and applications monitored by our agents will automatically pass distributed tracing context to each other when using a supported framework. When not using a supported framework, you will need to use the distributed tracing APIs to manually accept this context. Supported web frameworks (for example, Flask, Django, Tornado) will automatically call accept_distributed_trace_payload when creating a transaction. Supported external web services libraries will automatically call create_distributed_trace_payload before making an external HTTP call. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. If you want to... Do this... Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Use create_distributed_trace_payload. Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace Use accept_distributed_trace_payload. Agent configuration, initialization, shutdown These calls help you manage Python agent behavior, such as initializing and integrating the agent, and referencing or changing configuration settings: If you want to... Do this... Initialize the agent To initialize the Python agent with a specific configuration file as part of advanced integration process, use initialize. Get a reference to the application object The application object represents an agent-monitored application and is used by some Python agent API calls. Get a reference to configuration settings To control the Python agent's behavior, you can use configuration settings. To get a reference to config file and environment variable settings and make changes to them, use global_settings. To get a reference to all settings, including server-side configuration from our UI, use application_settings. Shut down the agent To forcibly shut down the agent instead of allowing it to make the standard final attempt to upload data, use shutdown_agent. Control the Browser monitoring agent You can install the browser monitoring agent by automatically adding it to your pages or by deploying it on specific pages by copying and pasting the browser agent JavaScript snippet. You can also control the browser agent by using APM agent API calls. For more information, see Browser agent and the Python agent. If you want to... Do this... Monitor specific page views To inject the browser agent header and footer JavaScript snippets into views you want to monitor, use both get_browser_timing_header and get_browser_timing_footer. Disable monitoring of specific page views To disable browser monitoring for specific page views, use disable_browser_autorum.",

      "body": "The Python agent API allows you to customize and extend your monitoring. Use the Python agent API to: Manually instrument an unsupported framework or third-party system. Add instrumentation to supplement the agent's default monitoring. This document describes some of the available Python API calls. For a description of all our available APIs, see Introduction to APIs. Custom instrumentation or API If your goal is custom instrumentation, consider using the configuration file method, which allows you to add functions and class methods to the config file that will be auto-instrumented by the agent. The benefit of the config-file method is that it does not require you to change your application code. However, the Python agent API is much more powerful and is best for setting up more complex and tailored instrumentation. To ensure you have access to the full API functionality, update to the latest Python agent. Monitor transactions and segments The Python agent is compatible with most of the common WSGI web frameworks. If the agent supports your framework, web requests automatically will be captured as transactions and displayed in the New Relic One UI. A transaction can also have function-level segments that are captured as part of a transaction trace. Use these methods to monitor web transactions, non-web transactions, and transaction segments: If you want to... Do this... Monitor WSGI web transactions The Python agent automatically captures web transactions for supported frameworks. If you do not have a supported framework, you can use the wsgi_application function to monitor your WSGI entry point. Monitor non-web transactions The Python agent classifies non-web transactions as background tasks. To capture non-web transactions, use background_task. Capture more details about a transaction If your transaction traces do not have the level of detail you want: Use function_trace to capture more function-level detail in transactions. Use datastore_trace to capture more detail about datastore calls. Ignore a transaction Use any of these options: To ignore a transaction altogether, use ignore_transaction. To prevent a transaction from producing a transaction trace, use suppress_transaction_trace. To end a transaction before the agent would end it automatically, use end_of_transaction. Add and edit transaction metadata Sometimes the code you target is visible in our UI, but some details of the method are not useful. For example: The default name is not helpful, or it is causing a metric grouping issue. You want to add custom attributes to your transactions so you can filter them when querying. Use these calls when you want to change the metadata of an existing transaction: If you want to... Do this... Get reference to current transaction To return an object representing the current transaction, use current_transaction. This is required by some other Python agent API calls. Change the name of a transaction Use set_transaction_name. Add metadata (such as a customer's subscription level) to transactions Add custom attributes to your transactions using add_custom_parameter, or use other API calls to report custom data. Mark a transaction as a background job To convert a web transaction into a background task so that it appears as a non-web transaction in the UI, use set_background_task. Prevent a transaction from affecting your Apdex score Use suppress_apdex_metric. See related logs To see logs directly within the context of your application's errors and traces, use the get_linking_metadata API call to annotate your logs. For more information about correlating log data with other telemetry data, see our logs in context documentation. Report custom events and custom metric data The agent reports data in two primary forms: Metric data measures numeric, time-based values; for example, connections per minute. Event data captures discrete event information. Events have key-value attributes attached to them. You can analyze and query event data. Use these methods to create new event data and new metric data: If you want to... Do this... Send data about an event for use when querying your data. Use record_custom_event. Report time-based metrics on application performance To report a single metric, use record_custom_metric. To report a set of metrics, use record_custom_metrics. Report an exception as an error By default, the Python agent only reports unhandled exceptions. To report a Python exception as an error, use notice_error. Report query string parameters For security reasons, query string parameters associated with web transactions are disabled by default. Use capture_request_params to enable them. Tag events with metadata To add attributes to events for more detailed analysis in Insights or error analytics, use add_custom_parameter. Generate metrics from data sources and data factories To generate metrics with a pull-style API rather than the push-style API implemented by record_custom_metric(), use these API calls: register_data_source data_source_generator data_source_factory Message-related calls These API calls allow you to collect performance data on your message-passing architecture or service; for example, RabbitMQ. To use these calls, make sure you have Python agent version 2.88.0.72 or higher. If you want to... Do this... Report messages as a transaction Use message_transaction. Report message details as transaction trace segments Use message_trace. Implement distributed tracing These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. Services and applications monitored by our agents will automatically pass distributed tracing context to each other when using a supported framework. When not using a supported framework, you will need to use the distributed tracing APIs to manually accept this context. Supported web frameworks (for example, Flask, Django, Tornado) will automatically call accept_distributed_trace_payload when creating a transaction. Supported external web services libraries will automatically call create_distributed_trace_payload before making an external HTTP call. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. If you want to... Do this... Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Use create_distributed_trace_payload. Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace Use accept_distributed_trace_payload. Agent configuration, initialization, shutdown These calls help you manage Python agent behavior, such as initializing and integrating the agent, and referencing or changing configuration settings: If you want to... Do this... Initialize the agent To initialize the Python agent with a specific configuration file as part of advanced integration process, use initialize. Get a reference to the application object The application object represents an agent-monitored application and is used by some Python agent API calls. Get a reference to configuration settings To control the Python agent's behavior, you can use configuration settings. To get a reference to config file and environment variable settings and make changes to them, use global_settings. To get a reference to all settings, including server-side configuration from our UI, use application_settings. Shut down the agent To forcibly shut down the agent instead of allowing it to make the standard final attempt to upload data, use shutdown_agent. Control the Browser monitoring agent You can install the browser monitoring agent by automatically adding it to your pages or by deploying it on specific pages by copying and pasting the browser agent JavaScript snippet. You can also control the browser agent by using APM agent API calls. For more information, see Browser agent and the Python agent. If you want to... Do this... Monitor specific page views To inject the browser agent header and footer JavaScript snippets into views you want to monitor, use both get_browser_timing_header and get_browser_timing_footer. Disable monitoring of specific page views To disable browser monitoring for specific page views, use disable_browser_autorum.",

      "body": "Our Python agent monitors your Python application to help you identify and solve performance issues. You can also extend your performance monitoring to collect and analyze business data to help you improve the customer experience and make data-driven business decisions. With flexible options for custom instrumentation and APIs, The Python agent offers multiple building blocks to customize the data you need from your app. Our Python works with a wide variety of web frameworks and hosting mechanisms, including Django, Gunicorn, WSGI, CherryPy, uWSGI, and more. You can also install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Monitor app performance After you install the Python agent, it begins to collect data about your app. You can view the data as charts and tables in New Relic One. View the big picture of your app. Monitor your app's Apdex (user satisfaction). Get a high-level summary of your app with Summary page. Enable distributed tracing to see activity across an architecture having many services. Install Infrastructure monitoring and view detailed server/host data for your app. Find errors and problems quickly. Track key transactions specific to your business. Create custom dashboards for important metrics. Alert your team when an error or problem occurs before it affects your users. View performance after a deployment. Drill down into performance details. Examine code-level transaction traces. Examine database query traces. Examine error traces. Use thread profiler sessions to see detailed stack traces of sampled threads View logs for your APM and infrastructure data Bring your logs and application's data together to make troubleshooting easier and faster. No need to switch to another UI page in New Relic One. With logs in context, you can see log messages related to your errors and traces directly in your app's UI. You can also see logs in context of your infrastructure data, such as Kubernetes clusters. Extend agent instrumentation Other helpful tools include: Tools Description Browser monitoring Integrate the Python agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user browser activity. Simple scripts and background tasks Monitor job-based or task queuing systems, like Celery, or other standalone non-web functions. Business data analysis with data exploration. Use the Python agent with our data explorer to organize, query, and visualize your data to answer key questions about application performance and customer experience. Use default transaction attributes, or add your own. Query your data using the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). Send your own event data. Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards. Install the Python agent Before you install the Python agent, make sure your system meets the system requirements. You must also create a New Relic account. We support a number of web frameworks and libraries right out of the box, including Django, WSGI, and Gunicorn. If you use one of the supported web frameworks, installation is easy. If you use an unsupported framework, the process will involve some additions to your app code and/or web server files. For a quick and simple install process that will work for the majority of setups, follow these simple steps: Download and install the Python package. Create config file. Integrate the Python agent with your application. Read the Quick Start guide Add Python data Monitor non-web scripts, background tasks, and functions The Python agent also lets you monitor non-web scripts, worker processes, tasks, and functions. The installation process for these non-web transactions is similar to the one used for a web app, with one major difference: instead of going through the standard integration process described in the install instructions, you would manually \"wrap\" any function you want to monitor. For more information, see Non-web tasks and processes. For instructions on monitoring Celery tasks, see Celery background tasks. What's next after installation? Once you get the agent up and running, some suggested next steps are: Explore your data in and get comfortable with the user interface. Read our docs on our other observability solutions and the APM page. Change your application's name, or other configuration options. Learn about setting up custom instrumentation for application activity not monitored by default. Consider the Python Telemetry SDK. Troubleshooting After you complete the install process, your data should appear in the APM UI within five minutes. If it does not, use these troubleshooting resources: If no data appears, follow these troubleshooting steps. If you experience issues when installing or running the Python agent on a new host, test that the package is installed correctly and that it can contact New Relic's data collector service. For other problems, see the full list of troubleshooting documentation. Check the source code The Python agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

View the big picture of your app. Monitor your app's Apdex (user satisfaction). Get a high-level summary of your app with Summary page. Enable distributed tracing to see activity across an architecture having many services. Install Infrastructure monitoring and view detailed server/host data for your app. Find errors and problems quickly. Track key transactions specific to your business. Create custom dashboards for important metrics. Alert your team when an error or problem occurs before it affects your users. View performance after a deployment. Drill down into performance details. Examine code-level transaction traces. Examine database query traces. Examine error traces. Use thread profiler sessions to see detailed stack traces of sampled threads View logs for your APM and infrastructure data Bring your logs and application's data together to make troubleshooting easier and faster. No need to switch to another UI page in New Relic One. With logs in context, you can see log messages related to your errors and traces directly in your app's UI. You can also see logs in context of your infrastructure data, such as Kubernetes clusters. Extend agent instrumentation Other helpful tools include: Tools Description Browser monitoring Integrate the Python agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user browser activity. Simple scripts and background tasks Monitor job-based or task queuing systems, like Celery, or other standalone non-web functions. Business data analysis with data exploration. Use the Python agent with our data explorer to organize, query, and visualize your data to answer key questions about application performance and customer experience. Use default transaction attributes, or add your own. Query your data using the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). Send your own event data. Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards. Install the Python agent Before you install the Python agent, make sure your system meets the system requirements. You must also create a New Relic account. We support a number of web frameworks and libraries right out of the box, including Django, WSGI, and Gunicorn. If you use one of the supported web frameworks, installation is easy. If you use an unsupported framework, the process will involve some additions to your app code and/or web server files. For a quick and simple install process that will work for the majority of setups, follow these simple steps: Download and install the Python package. Create config file. Integrate the Python agent with your application. Read the Quick Start guide Add Python data Monitor non-web scripts, background tasks, and functions The Python agent also lets you monitor non-web scripts, worker processes, tasks, and functions. The installation process for these non-web transactions is similar to the one used for a web app, with one major difference: instead of going through the standard integration process described in the install instructions, you would manually \"wrap\" any function you want to monitor. For more information, see Non-web tasks and processes. For instructions on monitoring Celery tasks, see Celery background tasks. What's next after installation? Once you get the agent up and running, some suggested next steps are: Explore your data in and get comfortable with the user interface. Read our docs on our other observability solutions and the APM page. Change your application's name, or other configuration options. Learn about setting up custom instrumentation for application activity not monitored by default. Consider the Python Telemetry SDK. Troubleshooting After you complete the install process, your data should appear in the APM UI within five minutes. If it does not, use these troubleshooting resources: If no data appears, follow these troubleshooting steps. If you experience issues when installing or running the Python agent on a new host, test that the package is installed correctly and that it can contact New Relic's data collector service. For other problems, see the full list of troubleshooting documentation. Check the source code The Python agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "The Python agent API allows you to customize and extend your monitoring. Use the Python agent API to: Manually instrument an unsupported framework or third-party system. Add instrumentation to supplement the agent's default monitoring. This document describes some of the available Python API calls. For a description of all our available APIs, see Introduction to APIs. Custom instrumentation or API If your goal is custom instrumentation, consider using the configuration file method, which allows you to add functions and class methods to the config file that will be auto-instrumented by the agent. The benefit of the config-file method is that it does not require you to change your application code. However, the Python agent API is much more powerful and is best for setting up more complex and tailored instrumentation. To ensure you have access to the full API functionality, update to the latest Python agent. Monitor transactions and segments The Python agent is compatible with most of the common WSGI web frameworks. If the agent supports your framework, web requests automatically will be captured as transactions and displayed in the New Relic One UI. A transaction can also have function-level segments that are captured as part of a transaction trace. Use these methods to monitor web transactions, non-web transactions, and transaction segments: If you want to... Do this... Monitor WSGI web transactions The Python agent automatically captures web transactions for supported frameworks. If you do not have a supported framework, you can use the wsgi_application function to monitor your WSGI entry point. Monitor non-web transactions The Python agent classifies non-web transactions as background tasks. To capture non-web transactions, use background_task. Capture more details about a transaction If your transaction traces do not have the level of detail you want: Use function_trace to capture more function-level detail in transactions. Use datastore_trace to capture more detail about datastore calls. Ignore a transaction Use any of these options: To ignore a transaction altogether, use ignore_transaction. To prevent a transaction from producing a transaction trace, use suppress_transaction_trace. To end a transaction before the agent would end it automatically, use end_of_transaction. Add and edit transaction metadata Sometimes the code you target is visible in our UI, but some details of the method are not useful. For example: The default name is not helpful, or it is causing a metric grouping issue. You want to add custom attributes to your transactions so you can filter them when querying. Use these calls when you want to change the metadata of an existing transaction: If you want to... Do this... Get reference to current transaction To return an object representing the current transaction, use current_transaction. This is required by some other Python agent API calls. Change the name of a transaction Use set_transaction_name. Add metadata (such as a customer's subscription level) to transactions Add custom attributes to your transactions using add_custom_parameter, or use other API calls to report custom data. Mark a transaction as a background job To convert a web transaction into a background task so that it appears as a non-web transaction in the UI, use set_background_task. Prevent a transaction from affecting your Apdex score Use suppress_apdex_metric. See related logs To see logs directly within the context of your application's errors and traces, use the get_linking_metadata API call to annotate your logs. For more information about correlating log data with other telemetry data, see our logs in context documentation. Report custom events and custom metric data The agent reports data in two primary forms: Metric data measures numeric, time-based values; for example, connections per minute. Event data captures discrete event information. Events have key-value attributes attached to them. You can analyze and query event data. Use these methods to create new event data and new metric data: If you want to... Do this... Send data about an event for use when querying your data. Use record_custom_event. Report time-based metrics on application performance To report a single metric, use record_custom_metric. To report a set of metrics, use record_custom_metrics. Report an exception as an error By default, the Python agent only reports unhandled exceptions. To report a Python exception as an error, use notice_error. Report query string parameters For security reasons, query string parameters associated with web transactions are disabled by default. Use capture_request_params to enable them. Tag events with metadata To add attributes to events for more detailed analysis in Insights or error analytics, use add_custom_parameter. Generate metrics from data sources and data factories To generate metrics with a pull-style API rather than the push-style API implemented by record_custom_metric(), use these API calls: register_data_source data_source_generator data_source_factory Message-related calls These API calls allow you to collect performance data on your message-passing architecture or service; for example, RabbitMQ. To use these calls, make sure you have Python agent version 2.88.0.72 or higher. If you want to... Do this... Report messages as a transaction Use message_transaction. Report message details as transaction trace segments Use message_trace. Implement distributed tracing These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. Services and applications monitored by our agents will automatically pass distributed tracing context to each other when using a supported framework. When not using a supported framework, you will need to use the distributed tracing APIs to manually accept this context. Supported web frameworks (for example, Flask, Django, Tornado) will automatically call accept_distributed_trace_payload when creating a transaction. Supported external web services libraries will automatically call create_distributed_trace_payload before making an external HTTP call. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. If you want to... Do this... Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Use create_distributed_trace_payload. Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace Use accept_distributed_trace_payload. Agent configuration, initialization, shutdown These calls help you manage Python agent behavior, such as initializing and integrating the agent, and referencing or changing configuration settings: If you want to... Do this... Initialize the agent To initialize the Python agent with a specific configuration file as part of advanced integration process, use initialize. Get a reference to the application object The application object represents an agent-monitored application and is used by some Python agent API calls. Get a reference to configuration settings To control the Python agent's behavior, you can use configuration settings. To get a reference to config file and environment variable settings and make changes to them, use global_settings. To get a reference to all settings, including server-side configuration from our UI, use application_settings. Shut down the agent To forcibly shut down the agent instead of allowing it to make the standard final attempt to upload data, use shutdown_agent. Control the Browser monitoring agent You can install the browser monitoring agent by automatically adding it to your pages or by deploying it on specific pages by copying and pasting the browser agent JavaScript snippet. You can also control the browser agent by using APM agent API calls. For more information, see Browser agent and the Python agent. If you want to... Do this... Monitor specific page views To inject the browser agent header and footer JavaScript snippets into views you want to monitor, use both get_browser_timing_header and get_browser_timing_footer. Disable monitoring of specific page views To disable browser monitoring for specific page views, use disable_browser_autorum.",

The benefit of the config-file method is that it does not require you to change your application code. However, the Python agent API is much more powerful and is best for setting up more complex and tailored instrumentation. To ensure you have access to the full API functionality, update to the latest Python agent. Monitor transactions and segments The Python agent is compatible with most of the common WSGI web frameworks. If the agent supports your framework, web requests automatically will be captured as transactions and displayed in the New Relic One UI. A transaction can also have function-level segments that are captured as part of a transaction trace. Use these methods to monitor web transactions, non-web transactions, and transaction segments: If you want to... Do this... Monitor WSGI web transactions The Python agent automatically captures web transactions for supported frameworks. If you do not have a supported framework, you can use the wsgi_application function to monitor your WSGI entry point. Monitor non-web transactions The Python agent classifies non-web transactions as background tasks. To capture non-web transactions, use background_task. Capture more details about a transaction If your transaction traces do not have the level of detail you want: Use function_trace to capture more function-level detail in transactions. Use datastore_trace to capture more detail about datastore calls. Ignore a transaction Use any of these options: To ignore a transaction altogether, use ignore_transaction. To prevent a transaction from producing a transaction trace, use suppress_transaction_trace. To end a transaction before the agent would end it automatically, use end_of_transaction. Add and edit transaction metadata Sometimes the code you target is visible in our UI, but some details of the method are not useful. For example: The default name is not helpful, or it is causing a metric grouping issue. You want to add custom attributes to your transactions so you can filter them when querying. Use these calls when you want to change the metadata of an existing transaction: If you want to... Do this... Get reference to current transaction To return an object representing the current transaction, use current_transaction. This is required by some other Python agent API calls. Change the name of a transaction Use set_transaction_name. Add metadata (such as a customer's subscription level) to transactions Add custom attributes to your transactions using add_custom_parameter, or use other API calls to report custom data. Mark a transaction as a background job To convert a web transaction into a background task so that it appears as a non-web transaction in the UI, use set_background_task. Prevent a transaction from affecting your Apdex score Use suppress_apdex_metric. See related logs To see logs directly within the context of your application's errors and traces, use the get_linking_metadata API call to annotate your logs. For more information about correlating log data with other telemetry data, see our logs in context documentation. Report custom events and custom metric data The agent reports data in two primary forms: Metric data measures numeric, time-based values; for example, connections per minute. Event data captures discrete event information. Events have key-value attributes attached to them. You can analyze and query event data. Use these methods to create new event data and new metric data: If you want to... Do this... Send data about an event for use when querying your data. Use record_custom_event. Report time-based metrics on application performance To report a single metric, use record_custom_metric. To report a set of metrics, use record_custom_metrics. Report an exception as an error By default, the Python agent only reports unhandled exceptions. To report a Python exception as an error, use notice_error. Report query string parameters For security reasons, query string parameters associated with web transactions are disabled by default. Use capture_request_params to enable them. Tag events with metadata To add attributes to events for more detailed analysis in Insights or error analytics, use add_custom_parameter. Generate metrics from data sources and data factories To generate metrics with a pull-style API rather than the push-style API implemented by record_custom_metric(), use these API calls: register_data_source data_source_generator data_source_factory Message-related calls These API calls allow you to collect performance data on your message-passing architecture or service; for example, RabbitMQ. To use these calls, make sure you have Python agent version 2.88.0.72 or higher. If you want to... Do this... Report messages as a transaction Use message_transaction. Report message details as transaction trace segments Use message_trace. Implement distributed tracing These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. Services and applications monitored by our agents will automatically pass distributed tracing context to each other when using a supported framework. When not using a supported framework, you will need to use the distributed tracing APIs to manually accept this context. Supported web frameworks (for example, Flask, Django, Tornado) will automatically call accept_distributed_trace_payload when creating a transaction. Supported external web services libraries will automatically call create_distributed_trace_payload before making an external HTTP call. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. If you want to... Do this... Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Use create_distributed_trace_payload. Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace Use accept_distributed_trace_payload. Agent configuration, initialization, shutdown These calls help you manage Python agent behavior, such as initializing and integrating the agent, and referencing or changing configuration settings: If you want to... Do this... Initialize the agent To initialize the Python agent with a specific configuration file as part of advanced integration process, use initialize. Get a reference to the application object The application object represents an agent-monitored application and is used by some Python agent API calls. Get a reference to configuration settings To control the Python agent's behavior, you can use configuration settings. To get a reference to config file and environment variable settings and make changes to them, use global_settings. To get a reference to all settings, including server-side configuration from our UI, use application_settings. Shut down the agent To forcibly shut down the agent instead of allowing it to make the standard final attempt to upload data, use shutdown_agent. Control the Browser monitoring agent You can install the browser monitoring agent by automatically adding it to your pages or by deploying it on specific pages by copying and pasting the browser agent JavaScript snippet. You can also control the browser agent by using APM agent API calls. For more information, see Browser agent and the Python agent. If you want to... Do this... Monitor specific page views To inject the browser agent header and footer JavaScript snippets into views you want to monitor, use both get_browser_timing_header and get_browser_timing_footer. Disable monitoring of specific page views To disable browser monitoring for specific page views, use disable_browser_autorum.",

Extend agent instrumentation Other helpful tools include: Tools Description Browser monitoring Integrate the Python agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user browser activity. Simple scripts and background tasks Monitor job-based or task queuing systems, like Celery, or other standalone non-web functions. Business data analysis with data exploration. Use the Python agent with our data explorer to organize, query, and visualize your data to answer key questions about application performance and customer experience. Use default transaction attributes, or add your own. Query your data using the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). Send your own event data. Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards. Install the Python agent Before you install the Python agent, make sure your system meets the system requirements. You must also create a New Relic account. We support a number of web frameworks and libraries right out of the box, including Django, WSGI, and Gunicorn. If you use one of the supported web frameworks, installation is easy. If you use an unsupported framework, the process will involve some additions to your app code and/or web server files. For a quick and simple install process that will work for the majority of setups, follow these simple steps: Download and install the Python package. Create config file. Integrate the Python agent with your application. Read the Quick Start guide Add Python data Monitor non-web scripts, background tasks, and functions The Python agent also lets you monitor non-web scripts, worker processes, tasks, and functions. The installation process for these non-web transactions is similar to the one used for a web app, with one major difference: instead of going through the standard integration process described in the install instructions, you would manually \"wrap\" any function you want to monitor. For more information, see Non-web tasks and processes. For instructions on monitoring Celery tasks, see Celery background tasks. What's next after installation? Once you get the agent up and running, some suggested next steps are: Explore your data in and get comfortable with the user interface. Read our docs on our other observability solutions and the APM page. Change your application's name, or other configuration options. Learn about setting up custom instrumentation for application activity not monitored by default. Consider the Python Telemetry SDK. Troubleshooting After you complete the install process, your data should appear in the APM UI within five minutes. If it does not, use these troubleshooting resources: If no data appears, follow these troubleshooting steps. If you experience issues when installing or running the Python agent on a new host, test that the package is installed correctly and that it can contact New Relic's data collector service. For other problems, see the full list of troubleshooting documentation. Check the source code The Python agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

Use the Python agent with our data explorer to organize, query, and visualize your data to answer key questions about application performance and customer experience. Use default transaction attributes, or add your own. Query your data using the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). Send your own event data. Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards. Install the Python agent Before you install the Python agent, make sure your system meets the system requirements. You must also create a New Relic account. We support a number of web frameworks and libraries right out of the box, including Django, WSGI, and Gunicorn. If you use one of the supported web frameworks, installation is easy. If you use an unsupported framework, the process will involve some additions to your app code and/or web server files. For a quick and simple install process that will work for the majority of setups, follow these simple steps: Download and install the Python package. Create config file. Integrate the Python agent with your application. Read the Quick Start guide Add Python data Monitor non-web scripts, background tasks, and functions The Python agent also lets you monitor non-web scripts, worker processes, tasks, and functions. The installation process for these non-web transactions is similar to the one used for a web app, with one major difference: instead of going through the standard integration process described in the install instructions, you would manually \"wrap\" any function you want to monitor. For more information, see Non-web tasks and processes. For instructions on monitoring Celery tasks, see Celery background tasks. What's next after installation? Once you get the agent up and running, some suggested next steps are: Explore your data in and get comfortable with the user interface. Read our docs on our other observability solutions and the APM page. Change your application's name, or other configuration options. Learn about setting up custom instrumentation for application activity not monitored by default. Consider the Python Telemetry SDK. Troubleshooting After you complete the install process, your data should appear in the APM UI within five minutes. If it does not, use these troubleshooting resources: If no data appears, follow these troubleshooting steps. If you experience issues when installing or running the Python agent on a new host, test that the package is installed correctly and that it can contact New Relic's data collector service. For other problems, see the full list of troubleshooting documentation. Check the source code The Python agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "The Python agent API allows you to customize and extend your monitoring. Use the Python agent API to: Manually instrument an unsupported framework or third-party system. Add instrumentation to supplement the agent's default monitoring. This document describes some of the available Python API calls. For a description of all our available APIs, see Introduction to APIs. Custom instrumentation or API If your goal is custom instrumentation, consider using the configuration file method, which allows you to add functions and class methods to the config file that will be auto-instrumented by the agent. The benefit of the config-file method is that it does not require you to change your application code. However, the Python agent API is much more powerful and is best for setting up more complex and tailored instrumentation. To ensure you have access to the full API functionality, update to the latest Python agent. Monitor transactions and segments The Python agent is compatible with most of the common WSGI web frameworks. If the agent supports your framework, web requests automatically will be captured as transactions and displayed in the New Relic One UI. A transaction can also have function-level segments that are captured as part of a transaction trace. Use these methods to monitor web transactions, non-web transactions, and transaction segments: If you want to... Do this... Monitor WSGI web transactions The Python agent automatically captures web transactions for supported frameworks. If you do not have a supported framework, you can use the wsgi_application function to monitor your WSGI entry point. Monitor non-web transactions The Python agent classifies non-web transactions as background tasks. To capture non-web transactions, use background_task. Capture more details about a transaction If your transaction traces do not have the level of detail you want: Use function_trace to capture more function-level detail in transactions. Use datastore_trace to capture more detail about datastore calls. Ignore a transaction Use any of these options: To ignore a transaction altogether, use ignore_transaction. To prevent a transaction from producing a transaction trace, use suppress_transaction_trace. To end a transaction before the agent would end it automatically, use end_of_transaction. Add and edit transaction metadata Sometimes the code you target is visible in our UI, but some details of the method are not useful. For example: The default name is not helpful, or it is causing a metric grouping issue. You want to add custom attributes to your transactions so you can filter them when querying. Use these calls when you want to change the metadata of an existing transaction: If you want to... Do this... Get reference to current transaction To return an object representing the current transaction, use current_transaction. This is required by some other Python agent API calls. Change the name of a transaction Use set_transaction_name. Add metadata (such as a customer's subscription level) to transactions Add custom attributes to your transactions using add_custom_parameter, or use other API calls to report custom data. Mark a transaction as a background job To convert a web transaction into a background task so that it appears as a non-web transaction in the UI, use set_background_task. Prevent a transaction from affecting your Apdex score Use suppress_apdex_metric. See related logs To see logs directly within the context of your application's errors and traces, use the get_linking_metadata API call to annotate your logs. For more information about correlating log data with other telemetry data, see our logs in context documentation. Report custom events and custom metric data The agent reports data in two primary forms: Metric data measures numeric, time-based values; for example, connections per minute. Event data captures discrete event information. Events have key-value attributes attached to them. You can analyze and query event data. Use these methods to create new event data and new metric data: If you want to... Do this... Send data about an event for use when querying your data. Use record_custom_event. Report time-based metrics on application performance To report a single metric, use record_custom_metric. To report a set of metrics, use record_custom_metrics. Report an exception as an error By default, the Python agent only reports unhandled exceptions. To report a Python exception as an error, use notice_error. Report query string parameters For security reasons, query string parameters associated with web transactions are disabled by default. Use capture_request_params to enable them. Tag events with metadata To add attributes to events for more detailed analysis in Insights or error analytics, use add_custom_parameter. Generate metrics from data sources and data factories To generate metrics with a pull-style API rather than the push-style API implemented by record_custom_metric(), use these API calls: register_data_source data_source_generator data_source_factory Message-related calls These API calls allow you to collect performance data on your message-passing architecture or service; for example, RabbitMQ. To use these calls, make sure you have Python agent version 2.88.0.72 or higher. If you want to... Do this... Report messages as a transaction Use message_transaction. Report message details as transaction trace segments Use message_trace. Implement distributed tracing These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. Services and applications monitored by our agents will automatically pass distributed tracing context to each other when using a supported framework. When not using a supported framework, you will need to use the distributed tracing APIs to manually accept this context. Supported web frameworks (for example, Flask, Django, Tornado) will automatically call accept_distributed_trace_payload when creating a transaction. Supported external web services libraries will automatically call create_distributed_trace_payload before making an external HTTP call. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. If you want to... Do this... Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Use create_distributed_trace_payload. Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace Use accept_distributed_trace_payload. Agent configuration, initialization, shutdown These calls help you manage Python agent behavior, such as initializing and integrating the agent, and referencing or changing configuration settings: If you want to... Do this... Initialize the agent To initialize the Python agent with a specific configuration file as part of advanced integration process, use initialize. Get a reference to the application object The application object represents an agent-monitored application and is used by some Python agent API calls. Get a reference to configuration settings To control the Python agent's behavior, you can use configuration settings. To get a reference to config file and environment variable settings and make changes to them, use global_settings. To get a reference to all settings, including server-side configuration from our UI, use application_settings. Shut down the agent To forcibly shut down the agent instead of allowing it to make the standard final attempt to upload data, use shutdown_agent. Control the Browser monitoring agent You can install the browser monitoring agent by automatically adding it to your pages or by deploying it on specific pages by copying and pasting the browser agent JavaScript snippet. You can also control the browser agent by using APM agent API calls. For more information, see Browser agent and the Python agent. If you want to... Do this... Monitor specific page views To inject the browser agent header and footer JavaScript snippets into views you want to monitor, use both get_browser_timing_header and get_browser_timing_footer. Disable monitoring of specific page views To disable browser monitoring for specific page views, use disable_browser_autorum.",

Add and edit transaction metadata Sometimes the code you target is visible in our UI, but some details of the method are not useful. For example: The default name is not helpful, or it is causing a metric grouping issue. You want to add custom attributes to your transactions so you can filter them when querying. Use these calls when you want to change the metadata of an existing transaction: If you want to... Do this... Get reference to current transaction To return an object representing the current transaction, use current_transaction. This is required by some other Python agent API calls. Change the name of a transaction Use set_transaction_name. Add metadata (such as a customer's subscription level) to transactions Add custom attributes to your transactions using add_custom_parameter, or use other API calls to report custom data. Mark a transaction as a background job To convert a web transaction into a background task so that it appears as a non-web transaction in the UI, use set_background_task. Prevent a transaction from affecting your Apdex score Use suppress_apdex_metric. See related logs To see logs directly within the context of your application's errors and traces, use the get_linking_metadata API call to annotate your logs. For more information about correlating log data with other telemetry data, see our logs in context documentation. Report custom events and custom metric data The agent reports data in two primary forms: Metric data measures numeric, time-based values; for example, connections per minute. Event data captures discrete event information. Events have key-value attributes attached to them. You can analyze and query event data. Use these methods to create new event data and new metric data: If you want to... Do this... Send data about an event for use when querying your data. Use record_custom_event. Report time-based metrics on application performance To report a single metric, use record_custom_metric. To report a set of metrics, use record_custom_metrics. Report an exception as an error By default, the Python agent only reports unhandled exceptions. To report a Python exception as an error, use notice_error. Report query string parameters For security reasons, query string parameters associated with web transactions are disabled by default. Use capture_request_params to enable them. Tag events with metadata To add attributes to events for more detailed analysis in Insights or error analytics, use add_custom_parameter. Generate metrics from data sources and data factories To generate metrics with a pull-style API rather than the push-style API implemented by record_custom_metric(), use these API calls: register_data_source data_source_generator data_source_factory Message-related calls These API calls allow you to collect performance data on your message-passing architecture or service; for example, RabbitMQ. To use these calls, make sure you have Python agent version 2.88.0.72 or higher. If you want to... Do this... Report messages as a transaction Use message_transaction. Report message details as transaction trace segments Use message_trace. Implement distributed tracing These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. Services and applications monitored by our agents will automatically pass distributed tracing context to each other when using a supported framework. When not using a supported framework, you will need to use the distributed tracing APIs to manually accept this context. Supported web frameworks (for example, Flask, Django, Tornado) will automatically call accept_distributed_trace_payload when creating a transaction. Supported external web services libraries will automatically call create_distributed_trace_payload before making an external HTTP call. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. If you want to... Do this... Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Use create_distributed_trace_payload. Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace Use accept_distributed_trace_payload. Agent configuration, initialization, shutdown These calls help you manage Python agent behavior, such as initializing and integrating the agent, and referencing or changing configuration settings: If you want to... Do this... Initialize the agent To initialize the Python agent with a specific configuration file as part of advanced integration process, use initialize. Get a reference to the application object The application object represents an agent-monitored application and is used by some Python agent API calls. Get a reference to configuration settings To control the Python agent's behavior, you can use configuration settings. To get a reference to config file and environment variable settings and make changes to them, use global_settings. To get a reference to all settings, including server-side configuration from our UI, use application_settings. Shut down the agent To forcibly shut down the agent instead of allowing it to make the standard final attempt to upload data, use shutdown_agent. Control the Browser monitoring agent You can install the browser monitoring agent by automatically adding it to your pages or by deploying it on specific pages by copying and pasting the browser agent JavaScript snippet. You can also control the browser agent by using APM agent API calls. For more information, see Browser agent and the Python agent. If you want to... Do this... Monitor specific page views To inject the browser agent header and footer JavaScript snippets into views you want to monitor, use both get_browser_timing_header and get_browser_timing_footer. Disable monitoring of specific page views To disable browser monitoring for specific page views, use disable_browser_autorum.",

Extend agent instrumentation Other helpful tools include: Tools Description Browser monitoring Integrate the Python agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user browser activity. Simple scripts and background tasks Monitor job-based or task queuing systems, like Celery, or other standalone non-web functions. Business data analysis with data exploration. Use the Python agent with our data explorer to organize, query, and visualize your data to answer key questions about application performance and customer experience. Use default transaction attributes, or add your own. Query your data using the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). Send your own event data. Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards. Install the Python agent Before you install the Python agent, make sure your system meets the system requirements. You must also create a New Relic account. We support a number of web frameworks and libraries right out of the box, including Django, WSGI, and Gunicorn. If you use one of the supported web frameworks, installation is easy. If you use an unsupported framework, the process will involve some additions to your app code and/or web server files. For a quick and simple install process that will work for the majority of setups, follow these simple steps: Download and install the Python package. Create config file. Integrate the Python agent with your application. Read the Quick Start guide Add Python data Monitor non-web scripts, background tasks, and functions The Python agent also lets you monitor non-web scripts, worker processes, tasks, and functions. The installation process for these non-web transactions is similar to the one used for a web app, with one major difference: instead of going through the standard integration process described in the install instructions, you would manually \"wrap\" any function you want to monitor. For more information, see Non-web tasks and processes. For instructions on monitoring Celery tasks, see Celery background tasks. What's next after installation? Once you get the agent up and running, some suggested next steps are: Explore your data in and get comfortable with the user interface. Read our docs on our other observability solutions and the APM page. Change your application's name, or other configuration options. Learn about setting up custom instrumentation for application activity not monitored by default. Consider the Python Telemetry SDK. Troubleshooting After you complete the install process, your data should appear in the APM UI within five minutes. If it does not, use these troubleshooting resources: If no data appears, follow these troubleshooting steps. If you experience issues when installing or running the Python agent on a new host, test that the package is installed correctly and that it can contact New Relic's data collector service. For other problems, see the full list of troubleshooting documentation. Check the source code The Python agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

Add instrumentation to supplement the agent's default monitoring. This document describes some of the available Python API calls. For a description of all our available APIs, see Introduction to APIs. Custom instrumentation or API If your goal is custom instrumentation, consider using the configuration file method, which allows you to add functions and class methods to the config file that will be auto-instrumented by the agent. The benefit of the config-file method is that it does not require you to change your application code. However, the Python agent API is much more powerful and is best for setting up more complex and tailored instrumentation. To ensure you have access to the full API functionality, update to the latest Python agent. Monitor transactions and segments The Python agent is compatible with most of the common WSGI web frameworks. If the agent supports your framework, web requests automatically will be captured as transactions and displayed in the New Relic One UI. A transaction can also have function-level segments that are captured as part of a transaction trace. Use these methods to monitor web transactions, non-web transactions, and transaction segments: If you want to... Do this... Monitor WSGI web transactions The Python agent automatically captures web transactions for supported frameworks. If you do not have a supported framework, you can use the wsgi_application function to monitor your WSGI entry point. Monitor non-web transactions The Python agent classifies non-web transactions as background tasks. To capture non-web transactions, use background_task. Capture more details about a transaction If your transaction traces do not have the level of detail you want: Use function_trace to capture more function-level detail in transactions. Use datastore_trace to capture more detail about datastore calls. Ignore a transaction Use any of these options: To ignore a transaction altogether, use ignore_transaction.

Once you get the agent up and running, some suggested next steps are: Explore your data in and get comfortable with the user interface. Read our docs on our other observability solutions and the APM page. Change your application's name, or other configuration options. Learn about setting up custom instrumentation for application activity not monitored by default. Consider the Python Telemetry SDK. Troubleshooting After you complete the install process, your data should appear in the APM UI within five minutes. If it does not, use these troubleshooting resources: If no data appears, follow these troubleshooting steps. If you experience issues when installing or running the Python agent on a new host, test that the package is installed correctly and that it can contact New Relic's data collector service.

      "body": "The Python agent API allows you to customize and extend your monitoring. Use the Python agent API to: Manually instrument an unsupported framework or third-party system. Add instrumentation to supplement the agent's default monitoring. This document describes some of the available Python API calls. For a description of all our available APIs, see Introduction to APIs. Custom instrumentation or API If your goal is custom instrumentation, consider using the configuration file method, which allows you to add functions and class methods to the config file that will be auto-instrumented by the agent. The benefit of the config-file method is that it does not require you to change your application code. However, the Python agent API is much more powerful and is best for setting up more complex and tailored instrumentation. To ensure you have access to the full API functionality, update to the latest Python agent. Monitor transactions and segments The Python agent is compatible with most of the common WSGI web frameworks. If the agent supports your framework, web requests automatically will be captured as transactions and displayed in the New Relic One UI. A transaction can also have function-level segments that are captured as part of a transaction trace. Use these methods to monitor web transactions, non-web transactions, and transaction segments: If you want to... Do this... Monitor WSGI web transactions The Python agent automatically captures web transactions for supported frameworks. If you do not have a supported framework, you can use the wsgi_application function to monitor your WSGI entry point. Monitor non-web transactions The Python agent classifies non-web transactions as background tasks. To capture non-web transactions, use background_task. Capture more details about a transaction If your transaction traces do not have the level of detail you want: Use function_trace to capture more function-level detail in transactions. Use datastore_trace to capture more detail about datastore calls. Ignore a transaction Use any of these options: To ignore a transaction altogether, use ignore_transaction. To prevent a transaction from producing a transaction trace, use suppress_transaction_trace. To end a transaction before the agent would end it automatically, use end_of_transaction. Add and edit transaction metadata Sometimes the code you target is visible in our UI, but some details of the method are not useful. For example: The default name is not helpful, or it is causing a metric grouping issue. You want to add custom attributes to your transactions so you can filter them when querying. Use these calls when you want to change the metadata of an existing transaction: If you want to... Do this... Get reference to current transaction To return an object representing the current transaction, use current_transaction. This is required by some other Python agent API calls. Change the name of a transaction Use set_transaction_name. Add metadata (such as a customer's subscription level) to transactions Add custom attributes to your transactions using add_custom_parameter, or use other API calls to report custom data. Mark a transaction as a background job To convert a web transaction into a background task so that it appears as a non-web transaction in the UI, use set_background_task. Prevent a transaction from affecting your Apdex score Use suppress_apdex_metric. See related logs To see logs directly within the context of your application's errors and traces, use the get_linking_metadata API call to annotate your logs. For more information about correlating log data with other telemetry data, see our logs in context documentation. Report custom events and custom metric data The agent reports data in two primary forms: Metric data measures numeric, time-based values; for example, connections per minute. Event data captures discrete event information. Events have key-value attributes attached to them. You can analyze and query event data. Use these methods to create new event data and new metric data: If you want to... Do this... Send data about an event for use when querying your data. Use record_custom_event. Report time-based metrics on application performance To report a single metric, use record_custom_metric. To report a set of metrics, use record_custom_metrics. Report an exception as an error By default, the Python agent only reports unhandled exceptions. To report a Python exception as an error, use notice_error. Report query string parameters For security reasons, query string parameters associated with web transactions are disabled by default. Use capture_request_params to enable them. Tag events with metadata To add attributes to events for more detailed analysis in Insights or error analytics, use add_custom_parameter. Generate metrics from data sources and data factories To generate metrics with a pull-style API rather than the push-style API implemented by record_custom_metric(), use these API calls: register_data_source data_source_generator data_source_factory Message-related calls These API calls allow you to collect performance data on your message-passing architecture or service; for example, RabbitMQ. To use these calls, make sure you have Python agent version 2.88.0.72 or higher. If you want to... Do this... Report messages as a transaction Use message_transaction. Report message details as transaction trace segments Use message_trace. Implement distributed tracing These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. Services and applications monitored by our agents will automatically pass distributed tracing context to each other when using a supported framework. When not using a supported framework, you will need to use the distributed tracing APIs to manually accept this context. Supported web frameworks (for example, Flask, Django, Tornado) will automatically call accept_distributed_trace_payload when creating a transaction. Supported external web services libraries will automatically call create_distributed_trace_payload before making an external HTTP call. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. If you want to... Do this... Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Use create_distributed_trace_payload. Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace Use accept_distributed_trace_payload. Agent configuration, initialization, shutdown These calls help you manage Python agent behavior, such as initializing and integrating the agent, and referencing or changing configuration settings: If you want to... Do this... Initialize the agent To initialize the Python agent with a specific configuration file as part of advanced integration process, use initialize. Get a reference to the application object The application object represents an agent-monitored application and is used by some Python agent API calls. Get a reference to configuration settings To control the Python agent's behavior, you can use configuration settings. To get a reference to config file and environment variable settings and make changes to them, use global_settings. To get a reference to all settings, including server-side configuration from our UI, use application_settings. Shut down the agent To forcibly shut down the agent instead of allowing it to make the standard final attempt to upload data, use shutdown_agent. Control the Browser monitoring agent You can install the browser monitoring agent by automatically adding it to your pages or by deploying it on specific pages by copying and pasting the browser agent JavaScript snippet. You can also control the browser agent by using APM agent API calls. For more information, see Browser agent and the Python agent. If you want to... Do this... Monitor specific page views To inject the browser agent header and footer JavaScript snippets into views you want to monitor, use both get_browser_timing_header and get_browser_timing_footer. Disable monitoring of specific page views To disable browser monitoring for specific page views, use disable_browser_autorum.",

Report custom events and custom metric data The agent reports data in two primary forms: Metric data measures numeric, time-based values; for example, connections per minute. Event data captures discrete event information. Events have key-value attributes attached to them. You can analyze and query event data. Use these methods to create new event data and new metric data: If you want to... Do this... Send data about an event for use when querying your data. Use record_custom_event. Report time-based metrics on application performance To report a single metric, use record_custom_metric. To report a set of metrics, use record_custom_metrics. Report an exception as an error By default, the Python agent only reports unhandled exceptions. To report a Python exception as an error, use notice_error. Report query string parameters For security reasons, query string parameters associated with web transactions are disabled by default. Use capture_request_params to enable them. Tag events with metadata To add attributes to events for more detailed analysis in Insights or error analytics, use add_custom_parameter. Generate metrics from data sources and data factories To generate metrics with a pull-style API rather than the push-style API implemented by record_custom_metric(), use these API calls: register_data_source data_source_generator data_source_factory Message-related calls These API calls allow you to collect performance data on your message-passing architecture or service; for example, RabbitMQ. To use these calls, make sure you have Python agent version 2.88.0.72 or higher. If you want to... Do this... Report messages as a transaction Use message_transaction. Report message details as transaction trace segments Use message_trace. Implement distributed tracing These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. Services and applications monitored by our agents will automatically pass distributed tracing context to each other when using a supported framework. When not using a supported framework, you will need to use the distributed tracing APIs to manually accept this context. Supported web frameworks (for example, Flask, Django, Tornado) will automatically call accept_distributed_trace_payload when creating a transaction. Supported external web services libraries will automatically call create_distributed_trace_payload before making an external HTTP call. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. If you want to... Do this... Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Use create_distributed_trace_payload. Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace Use accept_distributed_trace_payload. Agent configuration, initialization, shutdown These calls help you manage Python agent behavior, such as initializing and integrating the agent, and referencing or changing configuration settings: If you want to... Do this... Initialize the agent To initialize the Python agent with a specific configuration file as part of advanced integration process, use initialize. Get a reference to the application object The application object represents an agent-monitored application and is used by some Python agent API calls. Get a reference to configuration settings To control the Python agent's behavior, you can use configuration settings. To get a reference to config file and environment variable settings and make changes to them, use global_settings. To get a reference to all settings, including server-side configuration from our UI, use application_settings. Shut down the agent To forcibly shut down the agent instead of allowing it to make the standard final attempt to upload data, use shutdown_agent. Control the Browser monitoring agent You can install the browser monitoring agent by automatically adding it to your pages or by deploying it on specific pages by copying and pasting the browser agent JavaScript snippet. You can also control the browser agent by using APM agent API calls. For more information, see Browser agent and the Python agent. If you want to... Do this... Monitor specific page views To inject the browser agent header and footer JavaScript snippets into views you want to monitor, use both get_browser_timing_header and get_browser_timing_footer. Disable monitoring of specific page views To disable browser monitoring for specific page views, use disable_browser_autorum.",

Install the Python agent Before you install the Python agent, make sure your system meets the system requirements. You must also create a New Relic account. We support a number of web frameworks and libraries right out of the box, including Django, WSGI, and Gunicorn. If you use one of the supported web frameworks, installation is easy. If you use an unsupported framework, the process will involve some additions to your app code and/or web server files. For a quick and simple install process that will work for the majority of setups, follow these simple steps: Download and install the Python package. Create config file. Integrate the Python agent with your application. Read the Quick Start guide Add Python data Monitor non-web scripts, background tasks, and functions The Python agent also lets you monitor non-web scripts, worker processes, tasks, and functions. The installation process for these non-web transactions is similar to the one used for a web app, with one major difference: instead of going through the standard integration process described in the install instructions, you would manually \"wrap\" any function you want to monitor. For more information, see Non-web tasks and processes. For instructions on monitoring Celery tasks, see Celery background tasks. What's next after installation? Once you get the agent up and running, some suggested next steps are: Explore your data in and get comfortable with the user interface. Read our docs on our other observability solutions and the APM page. Change your application's name, or other configuration options. Learn about setting up custom instrumentation for application activity not monitored by default. Consider the Python Telemetry SDK. Troubleshooting After you complete the install process, your data should appear in the APM UI within five minutes. If it does not, use these troubleshooting resources: If no data appears, follow these troubleshooting steps. If you experience issues when installing or running the Python agent on a new host, test that the package is installed correctly and that it can contact New Relic's data collector service.

      "body": "The Python agent API allows you to customize and extend your monitoring. Use the Python agent API to: Manually instrument an unsupported framework or third-party system. Add instrumentation to supplement the agent's default monitoring. This document describes some of the available Python API calls. For a description of all our available APIs, see Introduction to APIs. Custom instrumentation or API If your goal is custom instrumentation, consider using the configuration file method, which allows you to add functions and class methods to the config file that will be auto-instrumented by the agent. The benefit of the config-file method is that it does not require you to change your application code. However, the Python agent API is much more powerful and is best for setting up more complex and tailored instrumentation. To ensure you have access to the full API functionality, update to the latest Python agent. Monitor transactions and segments The Python agent is compatible with most of the common WSGI web frameworks. If the agent supports your framework, web requests automatically will be captured as transactions and displayed in the New Relic One UI. A transaction can also have function-level segments that are captured as part of a transaction trace. Use these methods to monitor web transactions, non-web transactions, and transaction segments: If you want to... Do this... Monitor WSGI web transactions The Python agent automatically captures web transactions for supported frameworks. If you do not have a supported framework, you can use the wsgi_application function to monitor your WSGI entry point. Monitor non-web transactions The Python agent classifies non-web transactions as background tasks. To capture non-web transactions, use background_task. Capture more details about a transaction If your transaction traces do not have the level of detail you want: Use function_trace to capture more function-level detail in transactions. Use datastore_trace to capture more detail about datastore calls. Ignore a transaction Use any of these options: To ignore a transaction altogether, use ignore_transaction. To prevent a transaction from producing a transaction trace, use suppress_transaction_trace. To end a transaction before the agent would end it automatically, use end_of_transaction. Add and edit transaction metadata Sometimes the code you target is visible in our UI, but some details of the method are not useful. For example: The default name is not helpful, or it is causing a metric grouping issue. You want to add custom attributes to your transactions so you can filter them when querying. Use these calls when you want to change the metadata of an existing transaction: If you want to... Do this... Get reference to current transaction To return an object representing the current transaction, use current_transaction. This is required by some other Python agent API calls. Change the name of a transaction Use set_transaction_name. Add metadata (such as a customer's subscription level) to transactions Add custom attributes to your transactions using add_custom_parameter, or use other API calls to report custom data. Mark a transaction as a background job To convert a web transaction into a background task so that it appears as a non-web transaction in the UI, use set_background_task. Prevent a transaction from affecting your Apdex score Use suppress_apdex_metric. See related logs To see logs directly within the context of your application's errors and traces, use the get_linking_metadata API call to annotate your logs.

      "body": "The Python agent API allows you to customize and extend your monitoring. Use the Python agent API to: Manually instrument an unsupported framework or third-party system. Add instrumentation to supplement the agent's default monitoring. This document describes some of the available Python API calls. For a description of all our available APIs, see Introduction to APIs. Custom instrumentation or API If your goal is custom instrumentation, consider using the configuration file method, which allows you to add functions and class methods to the config file that will be auto-instrumented by the agent. The benefit of the config-file method is that it does not require you to change your application code. However, the Python agent API is much more powerful and is best for setting up more complex and tailored instrumentation. To ensure you have access to the full API functionality, update to the latest Python agent. Monitor transactions and segments The Python agent is compatible with most of the common WSGI web frameworks. If the agent supports your framework, web requests automatically will be captured as transactions and displayed in the New Relic One UI. A transaction can also have function-level segments that are captured as part of a transaction trace. Use these methods to monitor web transactions, non-web transactions, and transaction segments: If you want to... Do this... Monitor WSGI web transactions The Python agent automatically captures web transactions for supported frameworks. If you do not have a supported framework, you can use the wsgi_application function to monitor your WSGI entry point. Monitor non-web transactions The Python agent classifies non-web transactions as background tasks. To capture non-web transactions, use background_task. Capture more details about a transaction If your transaction traces do not have the level of detail you want: Use function_trace to capture more function-level detail in transactions. Use datastore_trace to capture more detail about datastore calls. Ignore a transaction Use any of these options: To ignore a transaction altogether, use ignore_transaction. To prevent a transaction from producing a transaction trace, use suppress_transaction_trace. To end a transaction before the agent would end it automatically, use end_of_transaction. Add and edit transaction metadata Sometimes the code you target is visible in our UI, but some details of the method are not useful. For example: The default name is not helpful, or it is causing a metric grouping issue. You want to add custom attributes to your transactions so you can filter them when querying. Use these calls when you want to change the metadata of an existing transaction: If you want to... Do this... Get reference to current transaction To return an object representing the current transaction, use current_transaction. This is required by some other Python agent API calls. Change the name of a transaction Use set_transaction_name. Add metadata (such as a customer's subscription level) to transactions Add custom attributes to your transactions using add_custom_parameter, or use other API calls to report custom data. Mark a transaction as a background job To convert a web transaction into a background task so that it appears as a non-web transaction in the UI, use set_background_task. Prevent a transaction from affecting your Apdex score Use suppress_apdex_metric. See related logs To see logs directly within the context of your application's errors and traces, use the get_linking_metadata API call to annotate your logs. For more information about correlating log data with other telemetry data, see our logs in context documentation. Report custom events and custom metric data The agent reports data in two primary forms: Metric data measures numeric, time-based values; for example, connections per minute. Event data captures discrete event information. Events have key-value attributes attached to them. You can analyze and query event data. Use these methods to create new event data and new metric data: If you want to... Do this... Send data about an event for use when querying your data. Use record_custom_event. Report time-based metrics on application performance To report a single metric, use record_custom_metric. To report a set of metrics, use record_custom_metrics. Report an exception as an error By default, the Python agent only reports unhandled exceptions. To report a Python exception as an error, use notice_error. Report query string parameters For security reasons, query string parameters associated with web transactions are disabled by default. Use capture_request_params to enable them. Tag events with metadata To add attributes to events for more detailed analysis in Insights or error analytics, use add_custom_parameter. Generate metrics from data sources and data factories To generate metrics with a pull-style API rather than the push-style API implemented by record_custom_metric(), use these API calls: register_data_source data_source_generator data_source_factory Message-related calls These API calls allow you to collect performance data on your message-passing architecture or service; for example, RabbitMQ. To use these calls, make sure you have Python agent version 2.88.0.72 or higher. If you want to... Do this... Report messages as a transaction Use message_transaction. Report message details as transaction trace segments Use message_trace. Implement distributed tracing These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. Services and applications monitored by our agents will automatically pass distributed tracing context to each other when using a supported framework. When not using a supported framework, you will need to use the distributed tracing APIs to manually accept this context. Supported web frameworks (for example, Flask, Django, Tornado) will automatically call accept_distributed_trace_payload when creating a transaction. Supported external web services libraries will automatically call create_distributed_trace_payload before making an external HTTP call. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. If you want to... Do this... Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Use create_distributed_trace_payload. Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace Use accept_distributed_trace_payload. Agent configuration, initialization, shutdown These calls help you manage Python agent behavior, such as initializing and integrating the agent, and referencing or changing configuration settings: If you want to... Do this... Initialize the agent To initialize the Python agent with a specific configuration file as part of advanced integration process, use initialize. Get a reference to the application object The application object represents an agent-monitored application and is used by some Python agent API calls. Get a reference to configuration settings To control the Python agent's behavior, you can use configuration settings. To get a reference to config file and environment variable settings and make changes to them, use global_settings. To get a reference to all settings, including server-side configuration from our UI, use application_settings. Shut down the agent To forcibly shut down the agent instead of allowing it to make the standard final attempt to upload data, use shutdown_agent. Control the Browser monitoring agent You can install the browser monitoring agent by automatically adding it to your pages or by deploying it on specific pages by copying and pasting the browser agent JavaScript snippet. You can also control the browser agent by using APM agent API calls. For more information, see Browser agent and the Python agent. If you want to... Do this... Monitor specific page views To inject the browser agent header and footer JavaScript snippets into views you want to monitor, use both get_browser_timing_header and get_browser_timing_footer. Disable monitoring of specific page views To disable browser monitoring for specific page views, use disable_browser_autorum.",

      "body": "Our Python agent monitors your Python application to help you identify and solve performance issues. You can also extend your performance monitoring to collect and analyze business data to help you improve the customer experience and make data-driven business decisions. With flexible options for custom instrumentation and APIs, The Python agent offers multiple building blocks to customize the data you need from your app. Our Python works with a wide variety of web frameworks and hosting mechanisms, including Django, Gunicorn, WSGI, CherryPy, uWSGI, and more. You can also install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Monitor app performance After you install the Python agent, it begins to collect data about your app. You can view the data as charts and tables in New Relic One. View the big picture of your app. Monitor your app's Apdex (user satisfaction). Get a high-level summary of your app with Summary page. Enable distributed tracing to see activity across an architecture having many services. Install Infrastructure monitoring and view detailed server/host data for your app. Find errors and problems quickly. Track key transactions specific to your business. Create custom dashboards for important metrics. Alert your team when an error or problem occurs before it affects your users. View performance after a deployment. Drill down into performance details. Examine code-level transaction traces. Examine database query traces. Examine error traces. Use thread profiler sessions to see detailed stack traces of sampled threads View logs for your APM and infrastructure data Bring your logs and application's data together to make troubleshooting easier and faster. No need to switch to another UI page in New Relic One. With logs in context, you can see log messages related to your errors and traces directly in your app's UI. You can also see logs in context of your infrastructure data, such as Kubernetes clusters. Extend agent instrumentation Other helpful tools include: Tools Description Browser monitoring Integrate the Python agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user browser activity. Simple scripts and background tasks Monitor job-based or task queuing systems, like Celery, or other standalone non-web functions. Business data analysis with data exploration. Use the Python agent with our data explorer to organize, query, and visualize your data to answer key questions about application performance and customer experience. Use default transaction attributes, or add your own. Query your data using the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). Send your own event data. Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards. Install the Python agent Before you install the Python agent, make sure your system meets the system requirements. You must also create a New Relic account. We support a number of web frameworks and libraries right out of the box, including Django, WSGI, and Gunicorn. If you use one of the supported web frameworks, installation is easy. If you use an unsupported framework, the process will involve some additions to your app code and/or web server files. For a quick and simple install process that will work for the majority of setups, follow these simple steps: Download and install the Python package. Create config file. Integrate the Python agent with your application. Read the Quick Start guide Add Python data Monitor non-web scripts, background tasks, and functions The Python agent also lets you monitor non-web scripts, worker processes, tasks, and functions. The installation process for these non-web transactions is similar to the one used for a web app, with one major difference: instead of going through the standard integration process described in the install instructions, you would manually \"wrap\" any function you want to monitor. For more information, see Non-web tasks and processes. For instructions on monitoring Celery tasks, see Celery background tasks. What's next after installation? Once you get the agent up and running, some suggested next steps are: Explore your data in and get comfortable with the user interface. Read our docs on our other observability solutions and the APM page. Change your application's name, or other configuration options. Learn about setting up custom instrumentation for application activity not monitored by default. Consider the Python Telemetry SDK. Troubleshooting After you complete the install process, your data should appear in the APM UI within five minutes. If it does not, use these troubleshooting resources: If no data appears, follow these troubleshooting steps. If you experience issues when installing or running the Python agent on a new host, test that the package is installed correctly and that it can contact New Relic's data collector service. For other problems, see the full list of troubleshooting documentation. Check the source code The Python agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

To use these calls, make sure you have Python agent version 2.88.0.72 or higher. If you want to... Do this... Report messages as a transaction Use message_transaction. Report message details as transaction trace segments Use message_trace. Implement distributed tracing These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. Services and applications monitored by our agents will automatically pass distributed tracing context to each other when using a supported framework. When not using a supported framework, you will need to use the distributed tracing APIs to manually accept this context. Supported web frameworks (for example, Flask, Django, Tornado) will automatically call accept_distributed_trace_payload when creating a transaction. Supported external web services libraries will automatically call create_distributed_trace_payload before making an external HTTP call. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. If you want to... Do this... Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Use create_distributed_trace_payload. Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace Use accept_distributed_trace_payload. Agent configuration, initialization, shutdown These calls help you manage Python agent behavior, such as initializing and integrating the agent, and referencing or changing configuration settings: If you want to... Do this... Initialize the agent To initialize the Python agent with a specific configuration file as part of advanced integration process, use initialize. Get a reference to the application object The application object represents an agent-monitored application and is used by some Python agent API calls. Get a reference to configuration settings To control the Python agent's behavior, you can use configuration settings. To get a reference to config file and environment variable settings and make changes to them, use global_settings. To get a reference to all settings, including server-side configuration from our UI, use application_settings. Shut down the agent To forcibly shut down the agent instead of allowing it to make the standard final attempt to upload data, use shutdown_agent. Control the Browser monitoring agent You can install the browser monitoring agent by automatically adding it to your pages or by deploying it on specific pages by copying and pasting the browser agent JavaScript snippet. You can also control the browser agent by using APM agent API calls. For more information, see Browser agent and the Python agent. If you want to... Do this... Monitor specific page views To inject the browser agent header and footer JavaScript snippets into views you want to monitor, use both get_browser_timing_header and get_browser_timing_footer. Disable monitoring of specific page views To disable browser monitoring for specific page views, use disable_browser_autorum.",

Integrate the Python agent with your application. Read the Quick Start guide Add Python data Monitor non-web scripts, background tasks, and functions The Python agent also lets you monitor non-web scripts, worker processes, tasks, and functions. The installation process for these non-web transactions is similar to the one used for a web app, with one major difference: instead of going through the standard integration process described in the install instructions, you would manually \"wrap\" any function you want to monitor. For more information, see Non-web tasks and processes. For instructions on monitoring Celery tasks, see Celery background tasks. What's next after installation? Once you get the agent up and running, some suggested next steps are: Explore your data in and get comfortable with the user interface. Read our docs on our other observability solutions and the APM page. Change your application's name, or other configuration options. Learn about setting up custom instrumentation for application activity not monitored by default. Consider the Python Telemetry SDK. Troubleshooting After you complete the install process, your data should appear in the APM UI within five minutes. If it does not, use these troubleshooting resources: If no data appears, follow these troubleshooting steps. If you experience issues when installing or running the Python agent on a new host, test that the package is installed correctly and that it can contact New Relic's data collector service.

      "body": "The Python agent API allows you to customize and extend your monitoring. Use the Python agent API to: Manually instrument an unsupported framework or third-party system. Add instrumentation to supplement the agent's default monitoring. This document describes some of the available Python API calls. For a description of all our available APIs, see Introduction to APIs. Custom instrumentation or API If your goal is custom instrumentation, consider using the configuration file method, which allows you to add functions and class methods to the config file that will be auto-instrumented by the agent. The benefit of the config-file method is that it does not require you to change your application code. However, the Python agent API is much more powerful and is best for setting up more complex and tailored instrumentation. To ensure you have access to the full API functionality, update to the latest Python agent. Monitor transactions and segments The Python agent is compatible with most of the common WSGI web frameworks. If the agent supports your framework, web requests automatically will be captured as transactions and displayed in the New Relic One UI. A transaction can also have function-level segments that are captured as part of a transaction trace. Use these methods to monitor web transactions, non-web transactions, and transaction segments: If you want to... Do this... Monitor WSGI web transactions The Python agent automatically captures web transactions for supported frameworks. If you do not have a supported framework, you can use the wsgi_application function to monitor your WSGI entry point. Monitor non-web transactions The Python agent classifies non-web transactions as background tasks. To capture non-web transactions, use background_task. Capture more details about a transaction If your transaction traces do not have the level of detail you want: Use function_trace to capture more function-level detail in transactions. Use datastore_trace to capture more detail about datastore calls. Ignore a transaction Use any of these options: To ignore a transaction altogether, use ignore_transaction. To prevent a transaction from producing a transaction trace, use suppress_transaction_trace. To end a transaction before the agent would end it automatically, use end_of_transaction. Add and edit transaction metadata Sometimes the code you target is visible in our UI, but some details of the method are not useful. For example: The default name is not helpful, or it is causing a metric grouping issue. You want to add custom attributes to your transactions so you can filter them when querying. Use these calls when you want to change the metadata of an existing transaction: If you want to... Do this... Get reference to current transaction To return an object representing the current transaction, use current_transaction. This is required by some other Python agent API calls. Change the name of a transaction Use set_transaction_name. Add metadata (such as a customer's subscription level) to transactions Add custom attributes to your transactions using add_custom_parameter, or use other API calls to report custom data. Mark a transaction as a background job To convert a web transaction into a background task so that it appears as a non-web transaction in the UI, use set_background_task. Prevent a transaction from affecting your Apdex score Use suppress_apdex_metric. See related logs To see logs directly within the context of your application's errors and traces, use the get_linking_metadata API call to annotate your logs. For more information about correlating log data with other telemetry data, see our logs in context documentation. Report custom events and custom metric data The agent reports data in two primary forms: Metric data measures numeric, time-based values; for example, connections per minute. Event data captures discrete event information. Events have key-value attributes attached to them. You can analyze and query event data. Use these methods to create new event data and new metric data: If you want to... Do this... Send data about an event for use when querying your data. Use record_custom_event. Report time-based metrics on application performance To report a single metric, use record_custom_metric. To report a set of metrics, use record_custom_metrics. Report an exception as an error By default, the Python agent only reports unhandled exceptions. To report a Python exception as an error, use notice_error. Report query string parameters For security reasons, query string parameters associated with web transactions are disabled by default. Use capture_request_params to enable them. Tag events with metadata To add attributes to events for more detailed analysis in Insights or error analytics, use add_custom_parameter. Generate metrics from data sources and data factories To generate metrics with a pull-style API rather than the push-style API implemented by record_custom_metric(), use these API calls: register_data_source data_source_generator data_source_factory Message-related calls These API calls allow you to collect performance data on your message-passing architecture or service; for example, RabbitMQ.

      "body": "The Python agent API allows you to customize and extend your monitoring. Use the Python agent API to: Manually instrument an unsupported framework or third-party system. Add instrumentation to supplement the agent's default monitoring. This document describes some of the available Python API calls. For a description of all our available APIs, see Introduction to APIs. Custom instrumentation or API If your goal is custom instrumentation, consider using the configuration file method, which allows you to add functions and class methods to the config file that will be auto-instrumented by the agent. The benefit of the config-file method is that it does not require you to change your application code. However, the Python agent API is much more powerful and is best for setting up more complex and tailored instrumentation. To ensure you have access to the full API functionality, update to the latest Python agent. Monitor transactions and segments The Python agent is compatible with most of the common WSGI web frameworks. If the agent supports your framework, web requests automatically will be captured as transactions and displayed in the New Relic One UI. A transaction can also have function-level segments that are captured as part of a transaction trace. Use these methods to monitor web transactions, non-web transactions, and transaction segments: If you want to... Do this... Monitor WSGI web transactions The Python agent automatically captures web transactions for supported frameworks. If you do not have a supported framework, you can use the wsgi_application function to monitor your WSGI entry point. Monitor non-web transactions The Python agent classifies non-web transactions as background tasks. To capture non-web transactions, use background_task. Capture more details about a transaction If your transaction traces do not have the level of detail you want: Use function_trace to capture more function-level detail in transactions. Use datastore_trace to capture more detail about datastore calls. Ignore a transaction Use any of these options: To ignore a transaction altogether, use ignore_transaction. To prevent a transaction from producing a transaction trace, use suppress_transaction_trace. To end a transaction before the agent would end it automatically, use end_of_transaction. Add and edit transaction metadata Sometimes the code you target is visible in our UI, but some details of the method are not useful. For example: The default name is not helpful, or it is causing a metric grouping issue. You want to add custom attributes to your transactions so you can filter them when querying. Use these calls when you want to change the metadata of an existing transaction: If you want to... Do this... Get reference to current transaction To return an object representing the current transaction, use current_transaction. This is required by some other Python agent API calls. Change the name of a transaction Use set_transaction_name. Add metadata (such as a customer's subscription level) to transactions Add custom attributes to your transactions using add_custom_parameter, or use other API calls to report custom data. Mark a transaction as a background job To convert a web transaction into a background task so that it appears as a non-web transaction in the UI, use set_background_task. Prevent a transaction from affecting your Apdex score Use suppress_apdex_metric. See related logs To see logs directly within the context of your application's errors and traces, use the get_linking_metadata API call to annotate your logs. For more information about correlating log data with other telemetry data, see our logs in context documentation. Report custom events and custom metric data The agent reports data in two primary forms: Metric data measures numeric, time-based values; for example, connections per minute. Event data captures discrete event information. Events have key-value attributes attached to them. You can analyze and query event data. Use these methods to create new event data and new metric data: If you want to... Do this... Send data about an event for use when querying your data. Use record_custom_event. Report time-based metrics on application performance To report a single metric, use record_custom_metric. To report a set of metrics, use record_custom_metrics. Report an exception as an error By default, the Python agent only reports unhandled exceptions. To report a Python exception as an error, use notice_error. Report query string parameters For security reasons, query string parameters associated with web transactions are disabled by default. Use capture_request_params to enable them. Tag events with metadata To add attributes to events for more detailed analysis in Insights or error analytics, use add_custom_parameter. Generate metrics from data sources and data factories To generate metrics with a pull-style API rather than the push-style API implemented by record_custom_metric(), use these API calls: register_data_source data_source_generator data_source_factory Message-related calls These API calls allow you to collect performance data on your message-passing architecture or service; for example, RabbitMQ. To use these calls, make sure you have Python agent version 2.88.0.72 or higher. If you want to... Do this... Report messages as a transaction Use message_transaction. Report message details as transaction trace segments Use message_trace. Implement distributed tracing These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. Services and applications monitored by our agents will automatically pass distributed tracing context to each other when using a supported framework. When not using a supported framework, you will need to use the distributed tracing APIs to manually accept this context. Supported web frameworks (for example, Flask, Django, Tornado) will automatically call accept_distributed_trace_payload when creating a transaction. Supported external web services libraries will automatically call create_distributed_trace_payload before making an external HTTP call. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. If you want to... Do this... Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Use create_distributed_trace_payload. Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace Use accept_distributed_trace_payload. Agent configuration, initialization, shutdown These calls help you manage Python agent behavior, such as initializing and integrating the agent, and referencing or changing configuration settings: If you want to... Do this... Initialize the agent To initialize the Python agent with a specific configuration file as part of advanced integration process, use initialize. Get a reference to the application object The application object represents an agent-monitored application and is used by some Python agent API calls. Get a reference to configuration settings To control the Python agent's behavior, you can use configuration settings. To get a reference to config file and environment variable settings and make changes to them, use global_settings. To get a reference to all settings, including server-side configuration from our UI, use application_settings. Shut down the agent To forcibly shut down the agent instead of allowing it to make the standard final attempt to upload data, use shutdown_agent. Control the Browser monitoring agent You can install the browser monitoring agent by automatically adding it to your pages or by deploying it on specific pages by copying and pasting the browser agent JavaScript snippet. You can also control the browser agent by using APM agent API calls. For more information, see Browser agent and the Python agent. If you want to... Do this... Monitor specific page views To inject the browser agent header and footer JavaScript snippets into views you want to monitor, use both get_browser_timing_header and get_browser_timing_footer. Disable monitoring of specific page views To disable browser monitoring for specific page views, use disable_browser_autorum.",

      "body": "Our Python agent monitors your Python application to help you identify and solve performance issues. You can also extend your performance monitoring to collect and analyze business data to help you improve the customer experience and make data-driven business decisions. With flexible options for custom instrumentation and APIs, The Python agent offers multiple building blocks to customize the data you need from your app. Our Python works with a wide variety of web frameworks and hosting mechanisms, including Django, Gunicorn, WSGI, CherryPy, uWSGI, and more. You can also install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Monitor app performance After you install the Python agent, it begins to collect data about your app. You can view the data as charts and tables in New Relic One. View the big picture of your app. Monitor your app's Apdex (user satisfaction). Get a high-level summary of your app with Summary page. Enable distributed tracing to see activity across an architecture having many services. Install Infrastructure monitoring and view detailed server/host data for your app. Find errors and problems quickly. Track key transactions specific to your business. Create custom dashboards for important metrics. Alert your team when an error or problem occurs before it affects your users. View performance after a deployment. Drill down into performance details. Examine code-level transaction traces. Examine database query traces. Examine error traces. Use thread profiler sessions to see detailed stack traces of sampled threads View logs for your APM and infrastructure data Bring your logs and application's data together to make troubleshooting easier and faster. No need to switch to another UI page in New Relic One. With logs in context, you can see log messages related to your errors and traces directly in your app's UI. You can also see logs in context of your infrastructure data, such as Kubernetes clusters. Extend agent instrumentation Other helpful tools include: Tools Description Browser monitoring Integrate the Python agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user browser activity. Simple scripts and background tasks Monitor job-based or task queuing systems, like Celery, or other standalone non-web functions. Business data analysis with data exploration. Use the Python agent with our data explorer to organize, query, and visualize your data to answer key questions about application performance and customer experience. Use default transaction attributes, or add your own. Query your data using the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). Send your own event data. Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards. Install the Python agent Before you install the Python agent, make sure your system meets the system requirements. You must also create a New Relic account. We support a number of web frameworks and libraries right out of the box, including Django, WSGI, and Gunicorn. If you use one of the supported web frameworks, installation is easy. If you use an unsupported framework, the process will involve some additions to your app code and/or web server files. For a quick and simple install process that will work for the majority of setups, follow these simple steps: Download and install the Python package. Create config file. Integrate the Python agent with your application. Read the Quick Start guide Add Python data Monitor non-web scripts, background tasks, and functions The Python agent also lets you monitor non-web scripts, worker processes, tasks, and functions. The installation process for these non-web transactions is similar to the one used for a web app, with one major difference: instead of going through the standard integration process described in the install instructions, you would manually \"wrap\" any function you want to monitor. For more information, see Non-web tasks and processes. For instructions on monitoring Celery tasks, see Celery background tasks. What's next after installation? Once you get the agent up and running, some suggested next steps are: Explore your data in and get comfortable with the user interface. Read our docs on our other observability solutions and the APM page. Change your application's name, or other configuration options. Learn about setting up custom instrumentation for application activity not monitored by default. Consider the Python Telemetry SDK. Troubleshooting After you complete the install process, your data should appear in the APM UI within five minutes. If it does not, use these troubleshooting resources: If no data appears, follow these troubleshooting steps. If you experience issues when installing or running the Python agent on a new host, test that the package is installed correctly and that it can contact New Relic's data collector service. For other problems, see the full list of troubleshooting documentation. Check the source code The Python agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

Extend agent instrumentation Other helpful tools include: Tools Description Browser monitoring Integrate the Python agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user browser activity. Simple scripts and background tasks Monitor job-based or task queuing systems, like Celery, or other standalone non-web functions. Business data analysis with data exploration. Use the Python agent with our data explorer to organize, query, and visualize your data to answer key questions about application performance and customer experience. Use default transaction attributes, or add your own. Query your data using the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). Send your own event data. Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards. Install the Python agent Before you install the Python agent, make sure your system meets the system requirements. You must also create a New Relic account. We support a number of web frameworks and libraries right out of the box, including Django, WSGI, and Gunicorn. If you use one of the supported web frameworks, installation is easy. If you use an unsupported framework, the process will involve some additions to your app code and/or web server files. For a quick and simple install process that will work for the majority of setups, follow these simple steps: Download and install the Python package. Create config file. Integrate the Python agent with your application. Read the Quick Start guide Add Python data Monitor non-web scripts, background tasks, and functions The Python agent also lets you monitor non-web scripts, worker processes, tasks, and functions. The installation process for these non-web transactions is similar to the one used for a web app, with one major difference: instead of going through the standard integration process described in the install instructions, you would manually \"wrap\" any function you want to monitor. For more information, see Non-web tasks and processes. For instructions on monitoring Celery tasks, see Celery background tasks. What's next after installation? Once you get the agent up and running, some suggested next steps are: Explore your data in and get comfortable with the user interface. Read our docs on our other observability solutions and the APM page. Change your application's name, or other configuration options. Learn about setting up custom instrumentation for application activity not monitored by default. Consider the Python Telemetry SDK. Troubleshooting After you complete the install process, your data should appear in the APM UI within five minutes. If it does not, use these troubleshooting resources: If no data appears, follow these troubleshooting steps. If you experience issues when installing or running the Python agent on a new host, test that the package is installed correctly and that it can contact New Relic's data collector service. For other problems, see the full list of troubleshooting documentation. Check the source code The Python agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "The Python agent API allows you to customize and extend your monitoring. Use the Python agent API to: Manually instrument an unsupported framework or third-party system. Add instrumentation to supplement the agent's default monitoring. This document describes some of the available Python API calls. For a description of all our available APIs, see Introduction to APIs. Custom instrumentation or API If your goal is custom instrumentation, consider using the configuration file method, which allows you to add functions and class methods to the config file that will be auto-instrumented by the agent. The benefit of the config-file method is that it does not require you to change your application code. However, the Python agent API is much more powerful and is best for setting up more complex and tailored instrumentation. To ensure you have access to the full API functionality, update to the latest Python agent. Monitor transactions and segments The Python agent is compatible with most of the common WSGI web frameworks. If the agent supports your framework, web requests automatically will be captured as transactions and displayed in the New Relic One UI. A transaction can also have function-level segments that are captured as part of a transaction trace. Use these methods to monitor web transactions, non-web transactions, and transaction segments: If you want to... Do this... Monitor WSGI web transactions The Python agent automatically captures web transactions for supported frameworks. If you do not have a supported framework, you can use the wsgi_application function to monitor your WSGI entry point. Monitor non-web transactions The Python agent classifies non-web transactions as background tasks. To capture non-web transactions, use background_task. Capture more details about a transaction If your transaction traces do not have the level of detail you want: Use function_trace to capture more function-level detail in transactions. Use datastore_trace to capture more detail about datastore calls. Ignore a transaction Use any of these options: To ignore a transaction altogether, use ignore_transaction. To prevent a transaction from producing a transaction trace, use suppress_transaction_trace. To end a transaction before the agent would end it automatically, use end_of_transaction. Add and edit transaction metadata Sometimes the code you target is visible in our UI, but some details of the method are not useful. For example: The default name is not helpful, or it is causing a metric grouping issue. You want to add custom attributes to your transactions so you can filter them when querying. Use these calls when you want to change the metadata of an existing transaction: If you want to... Do this... Get reference to current transaction To return an object representing the current transaction, use current_transaction. This is required by some other Python agent API calls. Change the name of a transaction Use set_transaction_name. Add metadata (such as a customer's subscription level) to transactions Add custom attributes to your transactions using add_custom_parameter, or use other API calls to report custom data. Mark a transaction as a background job To convert a web transaction into a background task so that it appears as a non-web transaction in the UI, use set_background_task. Prevent a transaction from affecting your Apdex score Use suppress_apdex_metric. See related logs To see logs directly within the context of your application's errors and traces, use the get_linking_metadata API call to annotate your logs. For more information about correlating log data with other telemetry data, see our logs in context documentation. Report custom events and custom metric data The agent reports data in two primary forms: Metric data measures numeric, time-based values; for example, connections per minute. Event data captures discrete event information. Events have key-value attributes attached to them. You can analyze and query event data. Use these methods to create new event data and new metric data: If you want to... Do this... Send data about an event for use when querying your data. Use record_custom_event. Report time-based metrics on application performance To report a single metric, use record_custom_metric. To report a set of metrics, use record_custom_metrics. Report an exception as an error By default, the Python agent only reports unhandled exceptions. To report a Python exception as an error, use notice_error. Report query string parameters For security reasons, query string parameters associated with web transactions are disabled by default. Use capture_request_params to enable them. Tag events with metadata To add attributes to events for more detailed analysis in Insights or error analytics, use add_custom_parameter. Generate metrics from data sources and data factories To generate metrics with a pull-style API rather than the push-style API implemented by record_custom_metric(), use these API calls: register_data_source data_source_generator data_source_factory Message-related calls These API calls allow you to collect performance data on your message-passing architecture or service; for example, RabbitMQ. To use these calls, make sure you have Python agent version 2.88.0.72 or higher. If you want to... Do this... Report messages as a transaction Use message_transaction. Report message details as transaction trace segments Use message_trace. Implement distributed tracing These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. Services and applications monitored by our agents will automatically pass distributed tracing context to each other when using a supported framework. When not using a supported framework, you will need to use the distributed tracing APIs to manually accept this context. Supported web frameworks (for example, Flask, Django, Tornado) will automatically call accept_distributed_trace_payload when creating a transaction. Supported external web services libraries will automatically call create_distributed_trace_payload before making an external HTTP call. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. If you want to... Do this... Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Use create_distributed_trace_payload. Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace Use accept_distributed_trace_payload. Agent configuration, initialization, shutdown These calls help you manage Python agent behavior, such as initializing and integrating the agent, and referencing or changing configuration settings: If you want to... Do this... Initialize the agent To initialize the Python agent with a specific configuration file as part of advanced integration process, use initialize. Get a reference to the application object The application object represents an agent-monitored application and is used by some Python agent API calls. Get a reference to configuration settings To control the Python agent's behavior, you can use configuration settings. To get a reference to config file and environment variable settings and make changes to them, use global_settings.

      "body": "The Python agent API allows you to customize and extend your monitoring. Use the Python agent API to: Manually instrument an unsupported framework or third-party system. Add instrumentation to supplement the agent's default monitoring. This document describes some of the available Python API calls. For a description of all our available APIs, see Introduction to APIs. Custom instrumentation or API If your goal is custom instrumentation, consider using the configuration file method, which allows you to add functions and class methods to the config file that will be auto-instrumented by the agent. The benefit of the config-file method is that it does not require you to change your application code. However, the Python agent API is much more powerful and is best for setting up more complex and tailored instrumentation. To ensure you have access to the full API functionality, update to the latest Python agent. Monitor transactions and segments The Python agent is compatible with most of the common WSGI web frameworks. If the agent supports your framework, web requests automatically will be captured as transactions and displayed in the New Relic One UI. A transaction can also have function-level segments that are captured as part of a transaction trace. Use these methods to monitor web transactions, non-web transactions, and transaction segments: If you want to... Do this... Monitor WSGI web transactions The Python agent automatically captures web transactions for supported frameworks. If you do not have a supported framework, you can use the wsgi_application function to monitor your WSGI entry point. Monitor non-web transactions The Python agent classifies non-web transactions as background tasks. To capture non-web transactions, use background_task. Capture more details about a transaction If your transaction traces do not have the level of detail you want: Use function_trace to capture more function-level detail in transactions. Use datastore_trace to capture more detail about datastore calls. Ignore a transaction Use any of these options: To ignore a transaction altogether, use ignore_transaction. To prevent a transaction from producing a transaction trace, use suppress_transaction_trace. To end a transaction before the agent would end it automatically, use end_of_transaction. Add and edit transaction metadata Sometimes the code you target is visible in our UI, but some details of the method are not useful. For example: The default name is not helpful, or it is causing a metric grouping issue. You want to add custom attributes to your transactions so you can filter them when querying. Use these calls when you want to change the metadata of an existing transaction: If you want to... Do this... Get reference to current transaction To return an object representing the current transaction, use current_transaction. This is required by some other Python agent API calls. Change the name of a transaction Use set_transaction_name. Add metadata (such as a customer's subscription level) to transactions Add custom attributes to your transactions using add_custom_parameter, or use other API calls to report custom data. Mark a transaction as a background job To convert a web transaction into a background task so that it appears as a non-web transaction in the UI, use set_background_task. Prevent a transaction from affecting your Apdex score Use suppress_apdex_metric. See related logs To see logs directly within the context of your application's errors and traces, use the get_linking_metadata API call to annotate your logs. For more information about correlating log data with other telemetry data, see our logs in context documentation. Report custom events and custom metric data The agent reports data in two primary forms: Metric data measures numeric, time-based values; for example, connections per minute. Event data captures discrete event information. Events have key-value attributes attached to them. You can analyze and query event data. Use these methods to create new event data and new metric data: If you want to... Do this... Send data about an event for use when querying your data. Use record_custom_event. Report time-based metrics on application performance To report a single metric, use record_custom_metric. To report a set of metrics, use record_custom_metrics. Report an exception as an error By default, the Python agent only reports unhandled exceptions. To report a Python exception as an error, use notice_error. Report query string parameters For security reasons, query string parameters associated with web transactions are disabled by default. Use capture_request_params to enable them. Tag events with metadata To add attributes to events for more detailed analysis in Insights or error analytics, use add_custom_parameter. Generate metrics from data sources and data factories To generate metrics with a pull-style API rather than the push-style API implemented by record_custom_metric(), use these API calls: register_data_source data_source_generator data_source_factory Message-related calls These API calls allow you to collect performance data on your message-passing architecture or service; for example, RabbitMQ. To use these calls, make sure you have Python agent version 2.88.0.72 or higher. If you want to... Do this... Report messages as a transaction Use message_transaction. Report message details as transaction trace segments Use message_trace. Implement distributed tracing These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. Services and applications monitored by our agents will automatically pass distributed tracing context to each other when using a supported framework. When not using a supported framework, you will need to use the distributed tracing APIs to manually accept this context. Supported web frameworks (for example, Flask, Django, Tornado) will automatically call accept_distributed_trace_payload when creating a transaction. Supported external web services libraries will automatically call create_distributed_trace_payload before making an external HTTP call. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. If you want to... Do this... Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Use create_distributed_trace_payload. Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace Use accept_distributed_trace_payload. Agent configuration, initialization, shutdown These calls help you manage Python agent behavior, such as initializing and integrating the agent, and referencing or changing configuration settings: If you want to... Do this... Initialize the agent To initialize the Python agent with a specific configuration file as part of advanced integration process, use initialize. Get a reference to the application object The application object represents an agent-monitored application and is used by some Python agent API calls. Get a reference to configuration settings To control the Python agent's behavior, you can use configuration settings. To get a reference to config file and environment variable settings and make changes to them, use global_settings. To get a reference to all settings, including server-side configuration from our UI, use application_settings. Shut down the agent To forcibly shut down the agent instead of allowing it to make the standard final attempt to upload data, use shutdown_agent. Control the Browser monitoring agent You can install the browser monitoring agent by automatically adding it to your pages or by deploying it on specific pages by copying and pasting the browser agent JavaScript snippet. You can also control the browser agent by using APM agent API calls. For more information, see Browser agent and the Python agent. If you want to... Do this... Monitor specific page views To inject the browser agent header and footer JavaScript snippets into views you want to monitor, use both get_browser_timing_header and get_browser_timing_footer. Disable monitoring of specific page views To disable browser monitoring for specific page views, use disable_browser_autorum.",

      "body": "Our Python agent monitors your Python application to help you identify and solve performance issues. You can also extend your performance monitoring to collect and analyze business data to help you improve the customer experience and make data-driven business decisions. With flexible options for custom instrumentation and APIs, The Python agent offers multiple building blocks to customize the data you need from your app. Our Python works with a wide variety of web frameworks and hosting mechanisms, including Django, Gunicorn, WSGI, CherryPy, uWSGI, and more. You can also install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Monitor app performance After you install the Python agent, it begins to collect data about your app. You can view the data as charts and tables in New Relic One. View the big picture of your app. Monitor your app's Apdex (user satisfaction). Get a high-level summary of your app with Summary page. Enable distributed tracing to see activity across an architecture having many services. Install Infrastructure monitoring and view detailed server/host data for your app. Find errors and problems quickly. Track key transactions specific to your business. Create custom dashboards for important metrics. Alert your team when an error or problem occurs before it affects your users. View performance after a deployment. Drill down into performance details. Examine code-level transaction traces. Examine database query traces. Examine error traces. Use thread profiler sessions to see detailed stack traces of sampled threads View logs for your APM and infrastructure data Bring your logs and application's data together to make troubleshooting easier and faster. No need to switch to another UI page in New Relic One. With logs in context, you can see log messages related to your errors and traces directly in your app's UI. You can also see logs in context of your infrastructure data, such as Kubernetes clusters. Extend agent instrumentation Other helpful tools include: Tools Description Browser monitoring Integrate the Python agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user browser activity. Simple scripts and background tasks Monitor job-based or task queuing systems, like Celery, or other standalone non-web functions. Business data analysis with data exploration. Use the Python agent with our data explorer to organize, query, and visualize your data to answer key questions about application performance and customer experience. Use default transaction attributes, or add your own. Query your data using the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). Send your own event data. Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards. Install the Python agent Before you install the Python agent, make sure your system meets the system requirements. You must also create a New Relic account. We support a number of web frameworks and libraries right out of the box, including Django, WSGI, and Gunicorn. If you use one of the supported web frameworks, installation is easy. If you use an unsupported framework, the process will involve some additions to your app code and/or web server files. For a quick and simple install process that will work for the majority of setups, follow these simple steps: Download and install the Python package. Create config file. Integrate the Python agent with your application. Read the Quick Start guide Add Python data Monitor non-web scripts, background tasks, and functions The Python agent also lets you monitor non-web scripts, worker processes, tasks, and functions. The installation process for these non-web transactions is similar to the one used for a web app, with one major difference: instead of going through the standard integration process described in the install instructions, you would manually \"wrap\" any function you want to monitor. For more information, see Non-web tasks and processes. For instructions on monitoring Celery tasks, see Celery background tasks. What's next after installation? Once you get the agent up and running, some suggested next steps are: Explore your data in and get comfortable with the user interface. Read our docs on our other observability solutions and the APM page. Change your application's name, or other configuration options. Learn about setting up custom instrumentation for application activity not monitored by default. Consider the Python Telemetry SDK. Troubleshooting After you complete the install process, your data should appear in the APM UI within five minutes. If it does not, use these troubleshooting resources: If no data appears, follow these troubleshooting steps. If you experience issues when installing or running the Python agent on a new host, test that the package is installed correctly and that it can contact New Relic's data collector service. For other problems, see the full list of troubleshooting documentation. Check the source code The Python agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

Extend agent instrumentation Other helpful tools include: Tools Description Browser monitoring Integrate the Python agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user browser activity. Simple scripts and background tasks Monitor job-based or task queuing systems, like Celery, or other standalone non-web functions. Business data analysis with data exploration. Use the Python agent with our data explorer to organize, query, and visualize your data to answer key questions about application performance and customer experience. Use default transaction attributes, or add your own. Query your data using the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). Send your own event data. Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards. Install the Python agent Before you install the Python agent, make sure your system meets the system requirements. You must also create a New Relic account. We support a number of web frameworks and libraries right out of the box, including Django, WSGI, and Gunicorn. If you use one of the supported web frameworks, installation is easy. If you use an unsupported framework, the process will involve some additions to your app code and/or web server files. For a quick and simple install process that will work for the majority of setups, follow these simple steps: Download and install the Python package. Create config file. Integrate the Python agent with your application. Read the Quick Start guide Add Python data Monitor non-web scripts, background tasks, and functions The Python agent also lets you monitor non-web scripts, worker processes, tasks, and functions. The installation process for these non-web transactions is similar to the one used for a web app, with one major difference: instead of going through the standard integration process described in the install instructions, you would manually \"wrap\" any function you want to monitor. For more information, see Non-web tasks and processes. For instructions on monitoring Celery tasks, see Celery background tasks. What's next after installation? Once you get the agent up and running, some suggested next steps are: Explore your data in and get comfortable with the user interface. Read our docs on our other observability solutions and the APM page. Change your application's name, or other configuration options. Learn about setting up custom instrumentation for application activity not monitored by default. Consider the Python Telemetry SDK. Troubleshooting After you complete the install process, your data should appear in the APM UI within five minutes. If it does not, use these troubleshooting resources: If no data appears, follow these troubleshooting steps. If you experience issues when installing or running the Python agent on a new host, test that the package is installed correctly and that it can contact New Relic's data collector service. For other problems, see the full list of troubleshooting documentation. Check the source code The Python agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "The Python agent API allows you to customize and extend your monitoring. Use the Python agent API to: Manually instrument an unsupported framework or third-party system. Add instrumentation to supplement the agent's default monitoring. This document describes some of the available Python API calls. For a description of all our available APIs, see Introduction to APIs. Custom instrumentation or API If your goal is custom instrumentation, consider using the configuration file method, which allows you to add functions and class methods to the config file that will be auto-instrumented by the agent. The benefit of the config-file method is that it does not require you to change your application code. However, the Python agent API is much more powerful and is best for setting up more complex and tailored instrumentation. To ensure you have access to the full API functionality, update to the latest Python agent. Monitor transactions and segments The Python agent is compatible with most of the common WSGI web frameworks. If the agent supports your framework, web requests automatically will be captured as transactions and displayed in the New Relic One UI. A transaction can also have function-level segments that are captured as part of a transaction trace. Use these methods to monitor web transactions, non-web transactions, and transaction segments: If you want to... Do this... Monitor WSGI web transactions The Python agent automatically captures web transactions for supported frameworks. If you do not have a supported framework, you can use the wsgi_application function to monitor your WSGI entry point. Monitor non-web transactions The Python agent classifies non-web transactions as background tasks. To capture non-web transactions, use background_task. Capture more details about a transaction If your transaction traces do not have the level of detail you want: Use function_trace to capture more function-level detail in transactions. Use datastore_trace to capture more detail about datastore calls. Ignore a transaction Use any of these options: To ignore a transaction altogether, use ignore_transaction. To prevent a transaction from producing a transaction trace, use suppress_transaction_trace. To end a transaction before the agent would end it automatically, use end_of_transaction. Add and edit transaction metadata Sometimes the code you target is visible in our UI, but some details of the method are not useful. For example: The default name is not helpful, or it is causing a metric grouping issue. You want to add custom attributes to your transactions so you can filter them when querying. Use these calls when you want to change the metadata of an existing transaction: If you want to... Do this... Get reference to current transaction To return an object representing the current transaction, use current_transaction. This is required by some other Python agent API calls. Change the name of a transaction Use set_transaction_name. Add metadata (such as a customer's subscription level) to transactions Add custom attributes to your transactions using add_custom_parameter, or use other API calls to report custom data. Mark a transaction as a background job To convert a web transaction into a background task so that it appears as a non-web transaction in the UI, use set_background_task. Prevent a transaction from affecting your Apdex score Use suppress_apdex_metric. See related logs To see logs directly within the context of your application's errors and traces, use the get_linking_metadata API call to annotate your logs. For more information about correlating log data with other telemetry data, see our logs in context documentation. Report custom events and custom metric data The agent reports data in two primary forms: Metric data measures numeric, time-based values; for example, connections per minute. Event data captures discrete event information. Events have key-value attributes attached to them. You can analyze and query event data. Use these methods to create new event data and new metric data: If you want to... Do this... Send data about an event for use when querying your data. Use record_custom_event. Report time-based metrics on application performance To report a single metric, use record_custom_metric. To report a set of metrics, use record_custom_metrics. Report an exception as an error By default, the Python agent only reports unhandled exceptions. To report a Python exception as an error, use notice_error. Report query string parameters For security reasons, query string parameters associated with web transactions are disabled by default. Use capture_request_params to enable them. Tag events with metadata To add attributes to events for more detailed analysis in Insights or error analytics, use add_custom_parameter. Generate metrics from data sources and data factories To generate metrics with a pull-style API rather than the push-style API implemented by record_custom_metric(), use these API calls: register_data_source data_source_generator data_source_factory Message-related calls These API calls allow you to collect performance data on your message-passing architecture or service; for example, RabbitMQ. To use these calls, make sure you have Python agent version 2.88.0.72 or higher. If you want to... Do this... Report messages as a transaction Use message_transaction. Report message details as transaction trace segments Use message_trace. Implement distributed tracing These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. Services and applications monitored by our agents will automatically pass distributed tracing context to each other when using a supported framework. When not using a supported framework, you will need to use the distributed tracing APIs to manually accept this context. Supported web frameworks (for example, Flask, Django, Tornado) will automatically call accept_distributed_trace_payload when creating a transaction. Supported external web services libraries will automatically call create_distributed_trace_payload before making an external HTTP call. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. If you want to... Do this... Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Use create_distributed_trace_payload. Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace Use accept_distributed_trace_payload. Agent configuration, initialization, shutdown These calls help you manage Python agent behavior, such as initializing and integrating the agent, and referencing or changing configuration settings: If you want to... Do this... Initialize the agent To initialize the Python agent with a specific configuration file as part of advanced integration process, use initialize. Get a reference to the application object The application object represents an agent-monitored application and is used by some Python agent API calls. Get a reference to configuration settings To control the Python agent's behavior, you can use configuration settings. To get a reference to config file and environment variable settings and make changes to them, use global_settings. To get a reference to all settings, including server-side configuration from our UI, use application_settings. Shut down the agent To forcibly shut down the agent instead of allowing it to make the standard final attempt to upload data, use shutdown_agent. Control the Browser monitoring agent You can install the browser monitoring agent by automatically adding it to your pages or by deploying it on specific pages by copying and pasting the browser agent JavaScript snippet. You can also control the browser agent by using APM agent API calls. For more information, see Browser agent and the Python agent. If you want to... Do this... Monitor specific page views To inject the browser agent header and footer JavaScript snippets into views you want to monitor, use both get_browser_timing_header and get_browser_timing_footer. Disable monitoring of specific page views To disable browser monitoring for specific page views, use disable_browser_autorum.",

      "body": "The Python agent API allows you to customize and extend your monitoring. Use the Python agent API to: Manually instrument an unsupported framework or third-party system. Add instrumentation to supplement the agent's default monitoring. This document describes some of the available Python API calls. For a description of all our available APIs, see Introduction to APIs. Custom instrumentation or API If your goal is custom instrumentation, consider using the configuration file method, which allows you to add functions and class methods to the config file that will be auto-instrumented by the agent. The benefit of the config-file method is that it does not require you to change your application code. However, the Python agent API is much more powerful and is best for setting up more complex and tailored instrumentation. To ensure you have access to the full API functionality, update to the latest Python agent. Monitor transactions and segments The Python agent is compatible with most of the common WSGI web frameworks. If the agent supports your framework, web requests automatically will be captured as transactions and displayed in the New Relic One UI. A transaction can also have function-level segments that are captured as part of a transaction trace. Use these methods to monitor web transactions, non-web transactions, and transaction segments: If you want to... Do this... Monitor WSGI web transactions The Python agent automatically captures web transactions for supported frameworks. If you do not have a supported framework, you can use the wsgi_application function to monitor your WSGI entry point. Monitor non-web transactions The Python agent classifies non-web transactions as background tasks. To capture non-web transactions, use background_task. Capture more details about a transaction If your transaction traces do not have the level of detail you want: Use function_trace to capture more function-level detail in transactions. Use datastore_trace to capture more detail about datastore calls. Ignore a transaction Use any of these options: To ignore a transaction altogether, use ignore_transaction. To prevent a transaction from producing a transaction trace, use suppress_transaction_trace. To end a transaction before the agent would end it automatically, use end_of_transaction. Add and edit transaction metadata Sometimes the code you target is visible in our UI, but some details of the method are not useful. For example: The default name is not helpful, or it is causing a metric grouping issue. You want to add custom attributes to your transactions so you can filter them when querying. Use these calls when you want to change the metadata of an existing transaction: If you want to... Do this... Get reference to current transaction To return an object representing the current transaction, use current_transaction. This is required by some other Python agent API calls. Change the name of a transaction Use set_transaction_name. Add metadata (such as a customer's subscription level) to transactions Add custom attributes to your transactions using add_custom_parameter, or use other API calls to report custom data. Mark a transaction as a background job To convert a web transaction into a background task so that it appears as a non-web transaction in the UI, use set_background_task. Prevent a transaction from affecting your Apdex score Use suppress_apdex_metric. See related logs To see logs directly within the context of your application's errors and traces, use the get_linking_metadata API call to annotate your logs. For more information about correlating log data with other telemetry data, see our logs in context documentation. Report custom events and custom metric data The agent reports data in two primary forms: Metric data measures numeric, time-based values; for example, connections per minute. Event data captures discrete event information. Events have key-value attributes attached to them. You can analyze and query event data. Use these methods to create new event data and new metric data: If you want to... Do this... Send data about an event for use when querying your data. Use record_custom_event. Report time-based metrics on application performance To report a single metric, use record_custom_metric. To report a set of metrics, use record_custom_metrics. Report an exception as an error By default, the Python agent only reports unhandled exceptions. To report a Python exception as an error, use notice_error. Report query string parameters For security reasons, query string parameters associated with web transactions are disabled by default. Use capture_request_params to enable them. Tag events with metadata To add attributes to events for more detailed analysis in Insights or error analytics, use add_custom_parameter. Generate metrics from data sources and data factories To generate metrics with a pull-style API rather than the push-style API implemented by record_custom_metric(), use these API calls: register_data_source data_source_generator data_source_factory Message-related calls These API calls allow you to collect performance data on your message-passing architecture or service; for example, RabbitMQ. To use these calls, make sure you have Python agent version 2.88.0.72 or higher. If you want to... Do this... Report messages as a transaction Use message_transaction. Report message details as transaction trace segments Use message_trace. Implement distributed tracing These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. Services and applications monitored by our agents will automatically pass distributed tracing context to each other when using a supported framework. When not using a supported framework, you will need to use the distributed tracing APIs to manually accept this context. Supported web frameworks (for example, Flask, Django, Tornado) will automatically call accept_distributed_trace_payload when creating a transaction. Supported external web services libraries will automatically call create_distributed_trace_payload before making an external HTTP call. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. If you want to... Do this... Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Use create_distributed_trace_payload. Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace Use accept_distributed_trace_payload. Agent configuration, initialization, shutdown These calls help you manage Python agent behavior, such as initializing and integrating the agent, and referencing or changing configuration settings: If you want to... Do this... Initialize the agent To initialize the Python agent with a specific configuration file as part of advanced integration process, use initialize. Get a reference to the application object The application object represents an agent-monitored application and is used by some Python agent API calls. Get a reference to configuration settings To control the Python agent's behavior, you can use configuration settings. To get a reference to config file and environment variable settings and make changes to them, use global_settings. To get a reference to all settings, including server-side configuration from our UI, use application_settings. Shut down the agent To forcibly shut down the agent instead of allowing it to make the standard final attempt to upload data, use shutdown_agent. Control the Browser monitoring agent You can install the browser monitoring agent by automatically adding it to your pages or by deploying it on specific pages by copying and pasting the browser agent JavaScript snippet. You can also control the browser agent by using APM agent API calls. For more information, see Browser agent and the Python agent. If you want to... Do this... Monitor specific page views To inject the browser agent header and footer JavaScript snippets into views you want to monitor, use both get_browser_timing_header and get_browser_timing_footer. Disable monitoring of specific page views To disable browser monitoring for specific page views, use disable_browser_autorum.",

      "body": "Our Python agent monitors your Python application to help you identify and solve performance issues. You can also extend your performance monitoring to collect and analyze business data to help you improve the customer experience and make data-driven business decisions. With flexible options for custom instrumentation and APIs, The Python agent offers multiple building blocks to customize the data you need from your app. Our Python works with a wide variety of web frameworks and hosting mechanisms, including Django, Gunicorn, WSGI, CherryPy, uWSGI, and more. You can also install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Monitor app performance After you install the Python agent, it begins to collect data about your app. You can view the data as charts and tables in New Relic One. View the big picture of your app. Monitor your app's Apdex (user satisfaction). Get a high-level summary of your app with Summary page. Enable distributed tracing to see activity across an architecture having many services. Install Infrastructure monitoring and view detailed server/host data for your app. Find errors and problems quickly. Track key transactions specific to your business. Create custom dashboards for important metrics. Alert your team when an error or problem occurs before it affects your users. View performance after a deployment. Drill down into performance details. Examine code-level transaction traces. Examine database query traces. Examine error traces. Use thread profiler sessions to see detailed stack traces of sampled threads View logs for your APM and infrastructure data Bring your logs and application's data together to make troubleshooting easier and faster. No need to switch to another UI page in New Relic One. With logs in context, you can see log messages related to your errors and traces directly in your app's UI. You can also see logs in context of your infrastructure data, such as Kubernetes clusters. Extend agent instrumentation Other helpful tools include: Tools Description Browser monitoring Integrate the Python agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user browser activity. Simple scripts and background tasks Monitor job-based or task queuing systems, like Celery, or other standalone non-web functions. Business data analysis with data exploration. Use the Python agent with our data explorer to organize, query, and visualize your data to answer key questions about application performance and customer experience. Use default transaction attributes, or add your own. Query your data using the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). Send your own event data. Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards. Install the Python agent Before you install the Python agent, make sure your system meets the system requirements. You must also create a New Relic account. We support a number of web frameworks and libraries right out of the box, including Django, WSGI, and Gunicorn. If you use one of the supported web frameworks, installation is easy. If you use an unsupported framework, the process will involve some additions to your app code and/or web server files. For a quick and simple install process that will work for the majority of setups, follow these simple steps: Download and install the Python package. Create config file. Integrate the Python agent with your application. Read the Quick Start guide Add Python data Monitor non-web scripts, background tasks, and functions The Python agent also lets you monitor non-web scripts, worker processes, tasks, and functions. The installation process for these non-web transactions is similar to the one used for a web app, with one major difference: instead of going through the standard integration process described in the install instructions, you would manually \"wrap\" any function you want to monitor. For more information, see Non-web tasks and processes. For instructions on monitoring Celery tasks, see Celery background tasks. What's next after installation? Once you get the agent up and running, some suggested next steps are: Explore your data in and get comfortable with the user interface. Read our docs on our other observability solutions and the APM page. Change your application's name, or other configuration options. Learn about setting up custom instrumentation for application activity not monitored by default. Consider the Python Telemetry SDK. Troubleshooting After you complete the install process, your data should appear in the APM UI within five minutes. If it does not, use these troubleshooting resources: If no data appears, follow these troubleshooting steps. If you experience issues when installing or running the Python agent on a new host, test that the package is installed correctly and that it can contact New Relic's data collector service. For other problems, see the full list of troubleshooting documentation. Check the source code The Python agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

Use the Python agent with our data explorer to organize, query, and visualize your data to answer key questions about application performance and customer experience. Use default transaction attributes, or add your own. Query your data using the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). Send your own event data. Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards. Install the Python agent Before you install the Python agent, make sure your system meets the system requirements. You must also create a New Relic account. We support a number of web frameworks and libraries right out of the box, including Django, WSGI, and Gunicorn. If you use one of the supported web frameworks, installation is easy. If you use an unsupported framework, the process will involve some additions to your app code and/or web server files. For a quick and simple install process that will work for the majority of setups, follow these simple steps: Download and install the Python package. Create config file. Integrate the Python agent with your application. Read the Quick Start guide Add Python data Monitor non-web scripts, background tasks, and functions The Python agent also lets you monitor non-web scripts, worker processes, tasks, and functions. The installation process for these non-web transactions is similar to the one used for a web app, with one major difference: instead of going through the standard integration process described in the install instructions, you would manually \"wrap\" any function you want to monitor. For more information, see Non-web tasks and processes. For instructions on monitoring Celery tasks, see Celery background tasks. What's next after installation? Once you get the agent up and running, some suggested next steps are: Explore your data in and get comfortable with the user interface. Read our docs on our other observability solutions and the APM page. Change your application's name, or other configuration options. Learn about setting up custom instrumentation for application activity not monitored by default. Consider the Python Telemetry SDK. Troubleshooting After you complete the install process, your data should appear in the APM UI within five minutes. If it does not, use these troubleshooting resources: If no data appears, follow these troubleshooting steps. If you experience issues when installing or running the Python agent on a new host, test that the package is installed correctly and that it can contact New Relic's data collector service. For other problems, see the full list of troubleshooting documentation. Check the source code The Python agent is open source software.

      "body": "The New Relic Java agent API lets you control, customize, and extend the functionality of the APM Java agent. This API consists of: Static methods on the com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic class A @Trace annotation for implementing custom instrumentation A hierarchy of API objects providing additional functionality Use this API to set up custom instrumentation of your Java app and collect more in-depth data. For detailed information about this API, see the complete Javadoc on GitHub. Another way to set up custom instrumentation is to use XML instrumentation. The XML option is simpler and does not require modification of your app code, but it lacks the complete functionality of the Java agent API. Important For best results when using the API, ensure that you have the latest Java agent release. Several APIs used in the examples require Java agent 6.4.0 or higher. For all available New Relic APIs, see Intro to APIs. Use the API To access the API class, add newrelic-api.jar to your application class path. The jar is in the New Relic Java agent's installation zip file. You can call the API when the Java agent is not running. The API methods are just stubs; the implementation is added when the Java agent loads the class. Transactions To instrument Transactions in your application, use the following APIs. If you want to... Use this Create a Transaction when New Relic does not create one automatically @Trace(dispatcher = true) on the method that encompasses the work to be reported. When this annotation is used on a method within the context of an existing transaction, this will not start a new transaction, but rather include the method in the existing transaction. Capture the duration of a method that New Relic does not automatically trace @Trace() on the method you want to time. Set the name of the current Transaction NewRelic.setTransactionName(...) Start the timer for the response time of the current Transaction and to cause a Transaction you create to be reported as a Web transaction, rather than as an Other transaction NewRelic.setRequestAndReponse(...) Add custom attributes to Transactions and TransactionEvents NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) Prevent a Transaction from being reported to New Relic NewRelic.ignoreTransaction() Exclude a Transaction when calculating your app's Apdex score NewRelic.ignoreApdex() See related logs To see logs directly within the context of your application's errors and traces, use these API calls to annotate your logs: getTraceMetadata getLinkingMetadata For more information about correlating log data with other telemetry data, see our logs in context documentation. Instrument asynchronous work For detailed information, see Java agent API for asynchronous applications. If you want to... Use this Trace an asynchronous method if it is linked to an existing Transaction... @Trace(async = true) Link the Transaction associated with the Token on the current thread... Token.link() or Token.linkAndExpire() Expire a Token associated with the current Transaction... Token.expire() Stop timing a Segment and have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.end() Stop timing a Segment and not have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.ignore() Distributed tracing API usage These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. See Java agent configuration for all distributed tracing config options. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. To see these APIs in action, see Using Java agent distributing tracing API with Kafka. Important With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs were introduced, with the exception of addCustomAttribute(), which was introduced in 6.1.0. We highly recommended using these APIs instead of the deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Learn about the type-specific headers of an inbound or outbound message. Headers Copy For a provided implementation of Headers use ConcurrentHashMapHeaders. See an example of W3C trace context headers implementation in DT API usage with Kafka. Create and insert distributed tracing headers into a Headers data structure. This API will insert both newrelic and W3C Trace Context headers (traceparent & tracestate), unless the agent is explicitly configured to exclude newrelic headers. Transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Accept the distributed tracing headers sent from the calling service and link these services together in a distributed trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(TransportType, Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Understand a utility class that provides enum constants for defining the transport type when accepting distributed tracing headers. TransportType Copy Add custom attributes to SpanEvents in distributed traces NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().addCustomAttribute(...) Caution With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs have been deprecated and replaced by the APIs in the above table. It's highly recommended to upgrade the agent and use the new APIs instead of these deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Transaction.createDistributedTracePayload() Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTracePayload(...) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The text() call returns a JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.text() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The httpSafe() call returns a base64 encoded JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.httpSafe() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Cross application tracing (CAT) API usage Important Cross application tracing has been deprecated as of agent version 7.4.0 and will be removed in a future agent version. Instead of using cross application tracing, we recommend our distributed tracing features. Distributed tracing is an improvement on the cross application tracing feature and is recommended for large, distributed systems. To track external calls and add cross application tracing, use the following APIs: If you want to... Use this Trace across a custom transport channel that New Relic does not support by default, such as a proprietary RPC transport Transaction.getRequestMetadata(), .processRequestMetadata(...), .getResponseMetadata(), .processResponseMetadata(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. View or change the metric name or a rollup metric name of a TracedMethod (A rollup metric name, such as OtherTransaction/all, is not scoped to a specific transaction. It represents all background transactions.) TracedMethod.getMetricName(), .setMetricName(...), .setRollupMetricName(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Report a call to an external HTTP service, database server, message queue, or other external resource that is being traced using the Java agent API's @Trace annotation TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) passing arguments constructed using ExternalParameters builder. Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Enable and add cross application tracing when communicating with an external HTTP or JMS service that is instrumented by New Relic TracedMethod.addOutboundRequestHeaders(...) along with TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Add timing for an application server or dispatcher that is not supported automatically Transaction.setRequest(...), Transaction.setResponse(...), or NewRelic.setRequestAndResponse(...), and Transaction.markResponseSent() Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Obtain references to New Relic API classes Other tasks require the New Relic Agent object. The Agent object exposes multiple objects that give you the following functionality: If you want to... Use this Get a reference to the current Transaction NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction() Get a Token to link asynchronous work NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().getToken() Copy Start and get a reference to a Segment NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().startSegment() Copy Get a reference to the method currently being traced NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod() Get a reference to the Agent logger NewRelic.getAgent().getLogger() Get a reference to the Agent configuration NewRelic.getAgent().getConfig() Get a reference to an aggregator for custom metrics NewRelic.getAgent().getAggregator() Get a reference to Insights (our original name for the feature that governed custom events) in order to record custom events NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights() Additional API functionality The following APIs provide additional functionality, such as setting app server info, reporting errors, adding page load timing information, recording custom metrics, and sending custom events. If you want to... Use this Explicitly set port, name, and version information for an application server or dispatcher and the instance name for a JVM NewRelic.setAppServerPort(...), .setServerInfo(...), and .setInstanceName(...) Copy Report an error that New Relic does not report automatically NewRelic.noticeError(...) When inside a transaction, the last call to noticeError wins. Only 1 error will be reported per transaction. Add browser page load timing for Transactions that New Relic does not add to the header automatically NewRelic.getBrowserTimingHeader(), .getBrowserTimingFooter(), .setUserName(String name), .setAccountName(String name), and .setProductName(String name) Copy Create and accumulate custom metrics NewRelic.recordMetric(...), .recordResponseTimeMetric(...), or .incrementCounter(...) Record custom events Insights.recordCustomEvent(...) Or, use NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) to add custom attributes to the New Relic-defined TransactionEvent type. Also refer to the information in this document about using Insights to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Additional API usage examples For detailed code examples about using the APIs, see New Relic's documentation about custom instrumentation for: External calls, cross application traces, messaging, datastores, and web frameworks Cross application tracing and external datastore calls Apps using custom instrumentation with annotation Custom framework instrumentation API Preventing unwanted instrumentation Inserting custom attributes Inserting custom events Collecting custom metrics",

      "body": "The Python agent API allows you to customize and extend your monitoring. Use the Python agent API to: Manually instrument an unsupported framework or third-party system. Add instrumentation to supplement the agent's default monitoring. This document describes some of the available Python API calls. For a description of all our available APIs, see Introduction to APIs. Custom instrumentation or API If your goal is custom instrumentation, consider using the configuration file method, which allows you to add functions and class methods to the config file that will be auto-instrumented by the agent. The benefit of the config-file method is that it does not require you to change your application code. However, the Python agent API is much more powerful and is best for setting up more complex and tailored instrumentation. To ensure you have access to the full API functionality, update to the latest Python agent. Monitor transactions and segments The Python agent is compatible with most of the common WSGI web frameworks. If the agent supports your framework, web requests automatically will be captured as transactions and displayed in the New Relic One UI. A transaction can also have function-level segments that are captured as part of a transaction trace. Use these methods to monitor web transactions, non-web transactions, and transaction segments: If you want to... Do this... Monitor WSGI web transactions The Python agent automatically captures web transactions for supported frameworks. If you do not have a supported framework, you can use the wsgi_application function to monitor your WSGI entry point. Monitor non-web transactions The Python agent classifies non-web transactions as background tasks. To capture non-web transactions, use background_task. Capture more details about a transaction If your transaction traces do not have the level of detail you want: Use function_trace to capture more function-level detail in transactions. Use datastore_trace to capture more detail about datastore calls. Ignore a transaction Use any of these options: To ignore a transaction altogether, use ignore_transaction. To prevent a transaction from producing a transaction trace, use suppress_transaction_trace. To end a transaction before the agent would end it automatically, use end_of_transaction. Add and edit transaction metadata Sometimes the code you target is visible in our UI, but some details of the method are not useful. For example: The default name is not helpful, or it is causing a metric grouping issue. You want to add custom attributes to your transactions so you can filter them when querying. Use these calls when you want to change the metadata of an existing transaction: If you want to... Do this... Get reference to current transaction To return an object representing the current transaction, use current_transaction. This is required by some other Python agent API calls. Change the name of a transaction Use set_transaction_name. Add metadata (such as a customer's subscription level) to transactions Add custom attributes to your transactions using add_custom_parameter, or use other API calls to report custom data. Mark a transaction as a background job To convert a web transaction into a background task so that it appears as a non-web transaction in the UI, use set_background_task. Prevent a transaction from affecting your Apdex score Use suppress_apdex_metric. See related logs To see logs directly within the context of your application's errors and traces, use the get_linking_metadata API call to annotate your logs. For more information about correlating log data with other telemetry data, see our logs in context documentation. Report custom events and custom metric data The agent reports data in two primary forms: Metric data measures numeric, time-based values; for example, connections per minute. Event data captures discrete event information. Events have key-value attributes attached to them. You can analyze and query event data. Use these methods to create new event data and new metric data: If you want to... Do this... Send data about an event for use when querying your data. Use record_custom_event. Report time-based metrics on application performance To report a single metric, use record_custom_metric. To report a set of metrics, use record_custom_metrics. Report an exception as an error By default, the Python agent only reports unhandled exceptions. To report a Python exception as an error, use notice_error. Report query string parameters For security reasons, query string parameters associated with web transactions are disabled by default. Use capture_request_params to enable them. Tag events with metadata To add attributes to events for more detailed analysis in Insights or error analytics, use add_custom_parameter. Generate metrics from data sources and data factories To generate metrics with a pull-style API rather than the push-style API implemented by record_custom_metric(), use these API calls: register_data_source data_source_generator data_source_factory Message-related calls These API calls allow you to collect performance data on your message-passing architecture or service; for example, RabbitMQ. To use these calls, make sure you have Python agent version 2.88.0.72 or higher. If you want to... Do this... Report messages as a transaction Use message_transaction. Report message details as transaction trace segments Use message_trace. Implement distributed tracing These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. Services and applications monitored by our agents will automatically pass distributed tracing context to each other when using a supported framework. When not using a supported framework, you will need to use the distributed tracing APIs to manually accept this context. Supported web frameworks (for example, Flask, Django, Tornado) will automatically call accept_distributed_trace_payload when creating a transaction. Supported external web services libraries will automatically call create_distributed_trace_payload before making an external HTTP call. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. If you want to... Do this... Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Use create_distributed_trace_payload. Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace Use accept_distributed_trace_payload. Agent configuration, initialization, shutdown These calls help you manage Python agent behavior, such as initializing and integrating the agent, and referencing or changing configuration settings: If you want to... Do this... Initialize the agent To initialize the Python agent with a specific configuration file as part of advanced integration process, use initialize. Get a reference to the application object The application object represents an agent-monitored application and is used by some Python agent API calls. Get a reference to configuration settings To control the Python agent's behavior, you can use configuration settings. To get a reference to config file and environment variable settings and make changes to them, use global_settings. To get a reference to all settings, including server-side configuration from our UI, use application_settings. Shut down the agent To forcibly shut down the agent instead of allowing it to make the standard final attempt to upload data, use shutdown_agent. Control the Browser monitoring agent You can install the browser monitoring agent by automatically adding it to your pages or by deploying it on specific pages by copying and pasting the browser agent JavaScript snippet. You can also control the browser agent by using APM agent API calls. For more information, see Browser agent and the Python agent. If you want to... Do this... Monitor specific page views To inject the browser agent header and footer JavaScript snippets into views you want to monitor, use both get_browser_timing_header and get_browser_timing_footer. Disable monitoring of specific page views To disable browser monitoring for specific page views, use disable_browser_autorum.",

      "body": "Our Python agent monitors your Python application to help you identify and solve performance issues. You can also extend your performance monitoring to collect and analyze business data to help you improve the customer experience and make data-driven business decisions. With flexible options for custom instrumentation and APIs, The Python agent offers multiple building blocks to customize the data you need from your app. Our Python works with a wide variety of web frameworks and hosting mechanisms, including Django, Gunicorn, WSGI, CherryPy, uWSGI, and more. You can also install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Monitor app performance After you install the Python agent, it begins to collect data about your app. You can view the data as charts and tables in New Relic One. View the big picture of your app. Monitor your app's Apdex (user satisfaction). Get a high-level summary of your app with Summary page. Enable distributed tracing to see activity across an architecture having many services. Install Infrastructure monitoring and view detailed server/host data for your app. Find errors and problems quickly. Track key transactions specific to your business. Create custom dashboards for important metrics. Alert your team when an error or problem occurs before it affects your users. View performance after a deployment. Drill down into performance details. Examine code-level transaction traces. Examine database query traces. Examine error traces. Use thread profiler sessions to see detailed stack traces of sampled threads View logs for your APM and infrastructure data Bring your logs and application's data together to make troubleshooting easier and faster. No need to switch to another UI page in New Relic One. With logs in context, you can see log messages related to your errors and traces directly in your app's UI. You can also see logs in context of your infrastructure data, such as Kubernetes clusters. Extend agent instrumentation Other helpful tools include: Tools Description Browser monitoring Integrate the Python agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user browser activity. Simple scripts and background tasks Monitor job-based or task queuing systems, like Celery, or other standalone non-web functions. Business data analysis with data exploration. Use the Python agent with our data explorer to organize, query, and visualize your data to answer key questions about application performance and customer experience. Use default transaction attributes, or add your own. Query your data using the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). Send your own event data. Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards. Install the Python agent Before you install the Python agent, make sure your system meets the system requirements. You must also create a New Relic account. We support a number of web frameworks and libraries right out of the box, including Django, WSGI, and Gunicorn. If you use one of the supported web frameworks, installation is easy. If you use an unsupported framework, the process will involve some additions to your app code and/or web server files. For a quick and simple install process that will work for the majority of setups, follow these simple steps: Download and install the Python package. Create config file. Integrate the Python agent with your application. Read the Quick Start guide Add Python data Monitor non-web scripts, background tasks, and functions The Python agent also lets you monitor non-web scripts, worker processes, tasks, and functions. The installation process for these non-web transactions is similar to the one used for a web app, with one major difference: instead of going through the standard integration process described in the install instructions, you would manually \"wrap\" any function you want to monitor. For more information, see Non-web tasks and processes. For instructions on monitoring Celery tasks, see Celery background tasks. What's next after installation? Once you get the agent up and running, some suggested next steps are: Explore your data in and get comfortable with the user interface. Read our docs on our other observability solutions and the APM page. Change your application's name, or other configuration options. Learn about setting up custom instrumentation for application activity not monitored by default. Consider the Python Telemetry SDK. Troubleshooting After you complete the install process, your data should appear in the APM UI within five minutes. If it does not, use these troubleshooting resources: If no data appears, follow these troubleshooting steps. If you experience issues when installing or running the Python agent on a new host, test that the package is installed correctly and that it can contact New Relic's data collector service. For other problems, see the full list of troubleshooting documentation. Check the source code The Python agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

Extend agent instrumentation Other helpful tools include: Tools Description Browser monitoring Integrate the Python agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user browser activity. Simple scripts and background tasks Monitor job-based or task queuing systems, like Celery, or other standalone non-web functions. Business data analysis with data exploration. Use the Python agent with our data explorer to organize, query, and visualize your data to answer key questions about application performance and customer experience. Use default transaction attributes, or add your own. Query your data using the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). Send your own event data. Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards. Install the Python agent Before you install the Python agent, make sure your system meets the system requirements. You must also create a New Relic account. We support a number of web frameworks and libraries right out of the box, including Django, WSGI, and Gunicorn. If you use one of the supported web frameworks, installation is easy. If you use an unsupported framework, the process will involve some additions to your app code and/or web server files. For a quick and simple install process that will work for the majority of setups, follow these simple steps: Download and install the Python package. Create config file. Integrate the Python agent with your application. Read the Quick Start guide Add Python data Monitor non-web scripts, background tasks, and functions The Python agent also lets you monitor non-web scripts, worker processes, tasks, and functions. The installation process for these non-web transactions is similar to the one used for a web app, with one major difference: instead of going through the standard integration process described in the install instructions, you would manually \"wrap\" any function you want to monitor. For more information, see Non-web tasks and processes. For instructions on monitoring Celery tasks, see Celery background tasks. What's next after installation? Once you get the agent up and running, some suggested next steps are: Explore your data in and get comfortable with the user interface. Read our docs on our other observability solutions and the APM page. Change your application's name, or other configuration options. Learn about setting up custom instrumentation for application activity not monitored by default. Consider the Python Telemetry SDK. Troubleshooting After you complete the install process, your data should appear in the APM UI within five minutes. If it does not, use these troubleshooting resources: If no data appears, follow these troubleshooting steps. If you experience issues when installing or running the Python agent on a new host, test that the package is installed correctly and that it can contact New Relic's data collector service. For other problems, see the full list of troubleshooting documentation. Check the source code The Python agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "The Python agent API allows you to customize and extend your monitoring. Use the Python agent API to: Manually instrument an unsupported framework or third-party system. Add instrumentation to supplement the agent's default monitoring. This document describes some of the available Python API calls. For a description of all our available APIs, see Introduction to APIs. Custom instrumentation or API If your goal is custom instrumentation, consider using the configuration file method, which allows you to add functions and class methods to the config file that will be auto-instrumented by the agent. The benefit of the config-file method is that it does not require you to change your application code. However, the Python agent API is much more powerful and is best for setting up more complex and tailored instrumentation. To ensure you have access to the full API functionality, update to the latest Python agent. Monitor transactions and segments The Python agent is compatible with most of the common WSGI web frameworks. If the agent supports your framework, web requests automatically will be captured as transactions and displayed in the New Relic One UI. A transaction can also have function-level segments that are captured as part of a transaction trace. Use these methods to monitor web transactions, non-web transactions, and transaction segments: If you want to... Do this... Monitor WSGI web transactions The Python agent automatically captures web transactions for supported frameworks. If you do not have a supported framework, you can use the wsgi_application function to monitor your WSGI entry point. Monitor non-web transactions The Python agent classifies non-web transactions as background tasks. To capture non-web transactions, use background_task. Capture more details about a transaction If your transaction traces do not have the level of detail you want: Use function_trace to capture more function-level detail in transactions. Use datastore_trace to capture more detail about datastore calls. Ignore a transaction Use any of these options: To ignore a transaction altogether, use ignore_transaction. To prevent a transaction from producing a transaction trace, use suppress_transaction_trace. To end a transaction before the agent would end it automatically, use end_of_transaction. Add and edit transaction metadata Sometimes the code you target is visible in our UI, but some details of the method are not useful. For example: The default name is not helpful, or it is causing a metric grouping issue. You want to add custom attributes to your transactions so you can filter them when querying. Use these calls when you want to change the metadata of an existing transaction: If you want to... Do this... Get reference to current transaction To return an object representing the current transaction, use current_transaction. This is required by some other Python agent API calls. Change the name of a transaction Use set_transaction_name. Add metadata (such as a customer's subscription level) to transactions Add custom attributes to your transactions using add_custom_parameter, or use other API calls to report custom data. Mark a transaction as a background job To convert a web transaction into a background task so that it appears as a non-web transaction in the UI, use set_background_task. Prevent a transaction from affecting your Apdex score Use suppress_apdex_metric. See related logs To see logs directly within the context of your application's errors and traces, use the get_linking_metadata API call to annotate your logs. For more information about correlating log data with other telemetry data, see our logs in context documentation. Report custom events and custom metric data The agent reports data in two primary forms: Metric data measures numeric, time-based values; for example, connections per minute. Event data captures discrete event information. Events have key-value attributes attached to them. You can analyze and query event data. Use these methods to create new event data and new metric data: If you want to... Do this... Send data about an event for use when querying your data. Use record_custom_event. Report time-based metrics on application performance To report a single metric, use record_custom_metric. To report a set of metrics, use record_custom_metrics. Report an exception as an error By default, the Python agent only reports unhandled exceptions. To report a Python exception as an error, use notice_error. Report query string parameters For security reasons, query string parameters associated with web transactions are disabled by default. Use capture_request_params to enable them. Tag events with metadata To add attributes to events for more detailed analysis in Insights or error analytics, use add_custom_parameter. Generate metrics from data sources and data factories To generate metrics with a pull-style API rather than the push-style API implemented by record_custom_metric(), use these API calls: register_data_source data_source_generator data_source_factory Message-related calls These API calls allow you to collect performance data on your message-passing architecture or service; for example, RabbitMQ. To use these calls, make sure you have Python agent version 2.88.0.72 or higher. If you want to... Do this... Report messages as a transaction Use message_transaction. Report message details as transaction trace segments Use message_trace. Implement distributed tracing These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. Services and applications monitored by our agents will automatically pass distributed tracing context to each other when using a supported framework. When not using a supported framework, you will need to use the distributed tracing APIs to manually accept this context. Supported web frameworks (for example, Flask, Django, Tornado) will automatically call accept_distributed_trace_payload when creating a transaction. Supported external web services libraries will automatically call create_distributed_trace_payload before making an external HTTP call. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. If you want to... Do this... Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Use create_distributed_trace_payload. Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace Use accept_distributed_trace_payload. Agent configuration, initialization, shutdown These calls help you manage Python agent behavior, such as initializing and integrating the agent, and referencing or changing configuration settings: If you want to... Do this... Initialize the agent To initialize the Python agent with a specific configuration file as part of advanced integration process, use initialize. Get a reference to the application object The application object represents an agent-monitored application and is used by some Python agent API calls. Get a reference to configuration settings To control the Python agent's behavior, you can use configuration settings. To get a reference to config file and environment variable settings and make changes to them, use global_settings. To get a reference to all settings, including server-side configuration from our UI, use application_settings. Shut down the agent To forcibly shut down the agent instead of allowing it to make the standard final attempt to upload data, use shutdown_agent. Control the Browser monitoring agent You can install the browser monitoring agent by automatically adding it to your pages or by deploying it on specific pages by copying and pasting the browser agent JavaScript snippet. You can also control the browser agent by using APM agent API calls. For more information, see Browser agent and the Python agent. If you want to... Do this... Monitor specific page views To inject the browser agent header and footer JavaScript snippets into views you want to monitor, use both get_browser_timing_header and get_browser_timing_footer. Disable monitoring of specific page views To disable browser monitoring for specific page views, use disable_browser_autorum.",

      "body": "The Python agent API allows you to customize and extend your monitoring. Use the Python agent API to: Manually instrument an unsupported framework or third-party system. Add instrumentation to supplement the agent's default monitoring. This document describes some of the available Python API calls. For a description of all our available APIs, see Introduction to APIs. Custom instrumentation or API If your goal is custom instrumentation, consider using the configuration file method, which allows you to add functions and class methods to the config file that will be auto-instrumented by the agent. The benefit of the config-file method is that it does not require you to change your application code. However, the Python agent API is much more powerful and is best for setting up more complex and tailored instrumentation. To ensure you have access to the full API functionality, update to the latest Python agent. Monitor transactions and segments The Python agent is compatible with most of the common WSGI web frameworks. If the agent supports your framework, web requests automatically will be captured as transactions and displayed in the New Relic One UI. A transaction can also have function-level segments that are captured as part of a transaction trace. Use these methods to monitor web transactions, non-web transactions, and transaction segments: If you want to... Do this... Monitor WSGI web transactions The Python agent automatically captures web transactions for supported frameworks. If you do not have a supported framework, you can use the wsgi_application function to monitor your WSGI entry point. Monitor non-web transactions The Python agent classifies non-web transactions as background tasks. To capture non-web transactions, use background_task. Capture more details about a transaction If your transaction traces do not have the level of detail you want: Use function_trace to capture more function-level detail in transactions. Use datastore_trace to capture more detail about datastore calls. Ignore a transaction Use any of these options: To ignore a transaction altogether, use ignore_transaction. To prevent a transaction from producing a transaction trace, use suppress_transaction_trace. To end a transaction before the agent would end it automatically, use end_of_transaction. Add and edit transaction metadata Sometimes the code you target is visible in our UI, but some details of the method are not useful. For example: The default name is not helpful, or it is causing a metric grouping issue. You want to add custom attributes to your transactions so you can filter them when querying. Use these calls when you want to change the metadata of an existing transaction: If you want to... Do this... Get reference to current transaction To return an object representing the current transaction, use current_transaction. This is required by some other Python agent API calls. Change the name of a transaction Use set_transaction_name. Add metadata (such as a customer's subscription level) to transactions Add custom attributes to your transactions using add_custom_parameter, or use other API calls to report custom data. Mark a transaction as a background job To convert a web transaction into a background task so that it appears as a non-web transaction in the UI, use set_background_task. Prevent a transaction from affecting your Apdex score Use suppress_apdex_metric. See related logs To see logs directly within the context of your application's errors and traces, use the get_linking_metadata API call to annotate your logs. For more information about correlating log data with other telemetry data, see our logs in context documentation. Report custom events and custom metric data The agent reports data in two primary forms: Metric data measures numeric, time-based values; for example, connections per minute. Event data captures discrete event information. Events have key-value attributes attached to them. You can analyze and query event data. Use these methods to create new event data and new metric data: If you want to... Do this... Send data about an event for use when querying your data. Use record_custom_event. Report time-based metrics on application performance To report a single metric, use record_custom_metric. To report a set of metrics, use record_custom_metrics. Report an exception as an error By default, the Python agent only reports unhandled exceptions. To report a Python exception as an error, use notice_error. Report query string parameters For security reasons, query string parameters associated with web transactions are disabled by default. Use capture_request_params to enable them. Tag events with metadata To add attributes to events for more detailed analysis in Insights or error analytics, use add_custom_parameter. Generate metrics from data sources and data factories To generate metrics with a pull-style API rather than the push-style API implemented by record_custom_metric(), use these API calls: register_data_source data_source_generator data_source_factory Message-related calls These API calls allow you to collect performance data on your message-passing architecture or service; for example, RabbitMQ. To use these calls, make sure you have Python agent version 2.88.0.72 or higher. If you want to... Do this... Report messages as a transaction Use message_transaction. Report message details as transaction trace segments Use message_trace. Implement distributed tracing These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. Services and applications monitored by our agents will automatically pass distributed tracing context to each other when using a supported framework. When not using a supported framework, you will need to use the distributed tracing APIs to manually accept this context. Supported web frameworks (for example, Flask, Django, Tornado) will automatically call accept_distributed_trace_payload when creating a transaction. Supported external web services libraries will automatically call create_distributed_trace_payload before making an external HTTP call. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. If you want to... Do this... Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Use create_distributed_trace_payload. Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace Use accept_distributed_trace_payload. Agent configuration, initialization, shutdown These calls help you manage Python agent behavior, such as initializing and integrating the agent, and referencing or changing configuration settings: If you want to... Do this... Initialize the agent To initialize the Python agent with a specific configuration file as part of advanced integration process, use initialize. Get a reference to the application object The application object represents an agent-monitored application and is used by some Python agent API calls. Get a reference to configuration settings To control the Python agent's behavior, you can use configuration settings. To get a reference to config file and environment variable settings and make changes to them, use global_settings. To get a reference to all settings, including server-side configuration from our UI, use application_settings. Shut down the agent To forcibly shut down the agent instead of allowing it to make the standard final attempt to upload data, use shutdown_agent. Control the Browser monitoring agent You can install the browser monitoring agent by automatically adding it to your pages or by deploying it on specific pages by copying and pasting the browser agent JavaScript snippet. You can also control the browser agent by using APM agent API calls. For more information, see Browser agent and the Python agent. If you want to... Do this... Monitor specific page views To inject the browser agent header and footer JavaScript snippets into views you want to monitor, use both get_browser_timing_header and get_browser_timing_footer. Disable monitoring of specific page views To disable browser monitoring for specific page views, use disable_browser_autorum.",

      "body": "Our Python agent monitors your Python application to help you identify and solve performance issues. You can also extend your performance monitoring to collect and analyze business data to help you improve the customer experience and make data-driven business decisions. With flexible options for custom instrumentation and APIs, The Python agent offers multiple building blocks to customize the data you need from your app. Our Python works with a wide variety of web frameworks and hosting mechanisms, including Django, Gunicorn, WSGI, CherryPy, uWSGI, and more. You can also install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Monitor app performance After you install the Python agent, it begins to collect data about your app. You can view the data as charts and tables in New Relic One. View the big picture of your app. Monitor your app's Apdex (user satisfaction). Get a high-level summary of your app with Summary page. Enable distributed tracing to see activity across an architecture having many services. Install Infrastructure monitoring and view detailed server/host data for your app. Find errors and problems quickly. Track key transactions specific to your business. Create custom dashboards for important metrics. Alert your team when an error or problem occurs before it affects your users. View performance after a deployment. Drill down into performance details. Examine code-level transaction traces. Examine database query traces. Examine error traces. Use thread profiler sessions to see detailed stack traces of sampled threads View logs for your APM and infrastructure data Bring your logs and application's data together to make troubleshooting easier and faster. No need to switch to another UI page in New Relic One. With logs in context, you can see log messages related to your errors and traces directly in your app's UI. You can also see logs in context of your infrastructure data, such as Kubernetes clusters. Extend agent instrumentation Other helpful tools include: Tools Description Browser monitoring Integrate the Python agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user browser activity. Simple scripts and background tasks Monitor job-based or task queuing systems, like Celery, or other standalone non-web functions. Business data analysis with data exploration. Use the Python agent with our data explorer to organize, query, and visualize your data to answer key questions about application performance and customer experience. Use default transaction attributes, or add your own. Query your data using the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). Send your own event data. Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards. Install the Python agent Before you install the Python agent, make sure your system meets the system requirements. You must also create a New Relic account. We support a number of web frameworks and libraries right out of the box, including Django, WSGI, and Gunicorn. If you use one of the supported web frameworks, installation is easy. If you use an unsupported framework, the process will involve some additions to your app code and/or web server files. For a quick and simple install process that will work for the majority of setups, follow these simple steps: Download and install the Python package. Create config file. Integrate the Python agent with your application. Read the Quick Start guide Add Python data Monitor non-web scripts, background tasks, and functions The Python agent also lets you monitor non-web scripts, worker processes, tasks, and functions. The installation process for these non-web transactions is similar to the one used for a web app, with one major difference: instead of going through the standard integration process described in the install instructions, you would manually \"wrap\" any function you want to monitor. For more information, see Non-web tasks and processes. For instructions on monitoring Celery tasks, see Celery background tasks. What's next after installation? Once you get the agent up and running, some suggested next steps are: Explore your data in and get comfortable with the user interface. Read our docs on our other observability solutions and the APM page. Change your application's name, or other configuration options. Learn about setting up custom instrumentation for application activity not monitored by default. Consider the Python Telemetry SDK. Troubleshooting After you complete the install process, your data should appear in the APM UI within five minutes. If it does not, use these troubleshooting resources: If no data appears, follow these troubleshooting steps. If you experience issues when installing or running the Python agent on a new host, test that the package is installed correctly and that it can contact New Relic's data collector service. For other problems, see the full list of troubleshooting documentation. Check the source code The Python agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "Our Python agent monitors your Python application to help you identify and solve performance issues. You can also extend your performance monitoring to collect and analyze business data to help you improve the customer experience and make data-driven business decisions. With flexible options for custom instrumentation and APIs, The Python agent offers multiple building blocks to customize the data you need from your app. Our Python works with a wide variety of web frameworks and hosting mechanisms, including Django, Gunicorn, WSGI, CherryPy, uWSGI, and more. You can also install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Monitor app performance After you install the Python agent, it begins to collect data about your app. You can view the data as charts and tables in New Relic One. View the big picture of your app. Monitor your app's Apdex (user satisfaction). Get a high-level summary of your app with Summary page. Enable distributed tracing to see activity across an architecture having many services. Install Infrastructure monitoring and view detailed server/host data for your app. Find errors and problems quickly. Track key transactions specific to your business. Create custom dashboards for important metrics. Alert your team when an error or problem occurs before it affects your users. View performance after a deployment. Drill down into performance details. Examine code-level transaction traces. Examine database query traces. Examine error traces. Use thread profiler sessions to see detailed stack traces of sampled threads View logs for your APM and infrastructure data Bring your logs and application's data together to make troubleshooting easier and faster. No need to switch to another UI page in New Relic One. With logs in context, you can see log messages related to your errors and traces directly in your app's UI. You can also see logs in context of your infrastructure data, such as Kubernetes clusters. Extend agent instrumentation Other helpful tools include: Tools Description Browser monitoring Integrate the Python agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user browser activity. Simple scripts and background tasks Monitor job-based or task queuing systems, like Celery, or other standalone non-web functions. Business data analysis with data exploration. Use the Python agent with our data explorer to organize, query, and visualize your data to answer key questions about application performance and customer experience. Use default transaction attributes, or add your own. Query your data using the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). Send your own event data. Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards. Install the Python agent Before you install the Python agent, make sure your system meets the system requirements. You must also create a New Relic account. We support a number of web frameworks and libraries right out of the box, including Django, WSGI, and Gunicorn. If you use one of the supported web frameworks, installation is easy. If you use an unsupported framework, the process will involve some additions to your app code and/or web server files. For a quick and simple install process that will work for the majority of setups, follow these simple steps: Download and install the Python package. Create config file. Integrate the Python agent with your application. Read the Quick Start guide Add Python data Monitor non-web scripts, background tasks, and functions The Python agent also lets you monitor non-web scripts, worker processes, tasks, and functions. The installation process for these non-web transactions is similar to the one used for a web app, with one major difference: instead of going through the standard integration process described in the install instructions, you would manually \"wrap\" any function you want to monitor. For more information, see Non-web tasks and processes. For instructions on monitoring Celery tasks, see Celery background tasks. What's next after installation? Once you get the agent up and running, some suggested next steps are: Explore your data in and get comfortable with the user interface. Read our docs on our other observability solutions and the APM page. Change your application's name, or other configuration options. Learn about setting up custom instrumentation for application activity not monitored by default. Consider the Python Telemetry SDK. Troubleshooting After you complete the install process, your data should appear in the APM UI within five minutes. If it does not, use these troubleshooting resources: If no data appears, follow these troubleshooting steps. If you experience issues when installing or running the Python agent on a new host, test that the package is installed correctly and that it can contact New Relic's data collector service. For other problems, see the full list of troubleshooting documentation. Check the source code The Python agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "The Python agent API allows you to customize and extend your monitoring. Use the Python agent API to: Manually instrument an unsupported framework or third-party system. Add instrumentation to supplement the agent's default monitoring. This document describes some of the available Python API calls. For a description of all our available APIs, see Introduction to APIs. Custom instrumentation or API If your goal is custom instrumentation, consider using the configuration file method, which allows you to add functions and class methods to the config file that will be auto-instrumented by the agent. The benefit of the config-file method is that it does not require you to change your application code. However, the Python agent API is much more powerful and is best for setting up more complex and tailored instrumentation. To ensure you have access to the full API functionality, update to the latest Python agent. Monitor transactions and segments The Python agent is compatible with most of the common WSGI web frameworks. If the agent supports your framework, web requests automatically will be captured as transactions and displayed in the New Relic One UI. A transaction can also have function-level segments that are captured as part of a transaction trace. Use these methods to monitor web transactions, non-web transactions, and transaction segments: If you want to... Do this... Monitor WSGI web transactions The Python agent automatically captures web transactions for supported frameworks. If you do not have a supported framework, you can use the wsgi_application function to monitor your WSGI entry point. Monitor non-web transactions The Python agent classifies non-web transactions as background tasks. To capture non-web transactions, use background_task. Capture more details about a transaction If your transaction traces do not have the level of detail you want: Use function_trace to capture more function-level detail in transactions. Use datastore_trace to capture more detail about datastore calls. Ignore a transaction Use any of these options: To ignore a transaction altogether, use ignore_transaction. To prevent a transaction from producing a transaction trace, use suppress_transaction_trace. To end a transaction before the agent would end it automatically, use end_of_transaction. Add and edit transaction metadata Sometimes the code you target is visible in our UI, but some details of the method are not useful. For example: The default name is not helpful, or it is causing a metric grouping issue. You want to add custom attributes to your transactions so you can filter them when querying. Use these calls when you want to change the metadata of an existing transaction: If you want to... Do this... Get reference to current transaction To return an object representing the current transaction, use current_transaction. This is required by some other Python agent API calls. Change the name of a transaction Use set_transaction_name. Add metadata (such as a customer's subscription level) to transactions Add custom attributes to your transactions using add_custom_parameter, or use other API calls to report custom data. Mark a transaction as a background job To convert a web transaction into a background task so that it appears as a non-web transaction in the UI, use set_background_task. Prevent a transaction from affecting your Apdex score Use suppress_apdex_metric. See related logs To see logs directly within the context of your application's errors and traces, use the get_linking_metadata API call to annotate your logs. For more information about correlating log data with other telemetry data, see our logs in context documentation. Report custom events and custom metric data The agent reports data in two primary forms: Metric data measures numeric, time-based values; for example, connections per minute. Event data captures discrete event information. Events have key-value attributes attached to them. You can analyze and query event data. Use these methods to create new event data and new metric data: If you want to... Do this... Send data about an event for use when querying your data. Use record_custom_event. Report time-based metrics on application performance To report a single metric, use record_custom_metric. To report a set of metrics, use record_custom_metrics. Report an exception as an error By default, the Python agent only reports unhandled exceptions. To report a Python exception as an error, use notice_error. Report query string parameters For security reasons, query string parameters associated with web transactions are disabled by default. Use capture_request_params to enable them. Tag events with metadata To add attributes to events for more detailed analysis in Insights or error analytics, use add_custom_parameter. Generate metrics from data sources and data factories To generate metrics with a pull-style API rather than the push-style API implemented by record_custom_metric(), use these API calls: register_data_source data_source_generator data_source_factory Message-related calls These API calls allow you to collect performance data on your message-passing architecture or service; for example, RabbitMQ. To use these calls, make sure you have Python agent version 2.88.0.72 or higher. If you want to... Do this... Report messages as a transaction Use message_transaction. Report message details as transaction trace segments Use message_trace. Implement distributed tracing These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. Services and applications monitored by our agents will automatically pass distributed tracing context to each other when using a supported framework. When not using a supported framework, you will need to use the distributed tracing APIs to manually accept this context. Supported web frameworks (for example, Flask, Django, Tornado) will automatically call accept_distributed_trace_payload when creating a transaction. Supported external web services libraries will automatically call create_distributed_trace_payload before making an external HTTP call. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. If you want to... Do this... Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Use create_distributed_trace_payload. Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace Use accept_distributed_trace_payload. Agent configuration, initialization, shutdown These calls help you manage Python agent behavior, such as initializing and integrating the agent, and referencing or changing configuration settings: If you want to... Do this... Initialize the agent To initialize the Python agent with a specific configuration file as part of advanced integration process, use initialize. Get a reference to the application object The application object represents an agent-monitored application and is used by some Python agent API calls. Get a reference to configuration settings To control the Python agent's behavior, you can use configuration settings. To get a reference to config file and environment variable settings and make changes to them, use global_settings. To get a reference to all settings, including server-side configuration from our UI, use application_settings. Shut down the agent To forcibly shut down the agent instead of allowing it to make the standard final attempt to upload data, use shutdown_agent. Control the Browser monitoring agent You can install the browser monitoring agent by automatically adding it to your pages or by deploying it on specific pages by copying and pasting the browser agent JavaScript snippet. You can also control the browser agent by using APM agent API calls. For more information, see Browser agent and the Python agent. If you want to... Do this... Monitor specific page views To inject the browser agent header and footer JavaScript snippets into views you want to monitor, use both get_browser_timing_header and get_browser_timing_footer. Disable monitoring of specific page views To disable browser monitoring for specific page views, use disable_browser_autorum.",

See related logs To see logs directly within the context of your application's errors and traces, use the get_linking_metadata API call to annotate your logs. For more information about correlating log data with other telemetry data, see our logs in context documentation. Report custom events and custom metric data The agent reports data in two primary forms: Metric data measures numeric, time-based values; for example, connections per minute. Event data captures discrete event information. Events have key-value attributes attached to them. You can analyze and query event data. Use these methods to create new event data and new metric data: If you want to... Do this... Send data about an event for use when querying your data. Use record_custom_event. Report time-based metrics on application performance To report a single metric, use record_custom_metric. To report a set of metrics, use record_custom_metrics. Report an exception as an error By default, the Python agent only reports unhandled exceptions. To report a Python exception as an error, use notice_error. Report query string parameters For security reasons, query string parameters associated with web transactions are disabled by default. Use capture_request_params to enable them. Tag events with metadata To add attributes to events for more detailed analysis in Insights or error analytics, use add_custom_parameter. Generate metrics from data sources and data factories To generate metrics with a pull-style API rather than the push-style API implemented by record_custom_metric(), use these API calls: register_data_source data_source_generator data_source_factory Message-related calls These API calls allow you to collect performance data on your message-passing architecture or service; for example, RabbitMQ. To use these calls, make sure you have Python agent version 2.88.0.72 or higher. If you want to... Do this... Report messages as a transaction Use message_transaction. Report message details as transaction trace segments Use message_trace. Implement distributed tracing These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. Services and applications monitored by our agents will automatically pass distributed tracing context to each other when using a supported framework. When not using a supported framework, you will need to use the distributed tracing APIs to manually accept this context. Supported web frameworks (for example, Flask, Django, Tornado) will automatically call accept_distributed_trace_payload when creating a transaction. Supported external web services libraries will automatically call create_distributed_trace_payload before making an external HTTP call. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. If you want to... Do this... Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Use create_distributed_trace_payload. Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace Use accept_distributed_trace_payload. Agent configuration, initialization, shutdown These calls help you manage Python agent behavior, such as initializing and integrating the agent, and referencing or changing configuration settings: If you want to... Do this... Initialize the agent To initialize the Python agent with a specific configuration file as part of advanced integration process, use initialize. Get a reference to the application object The application object represents an agent-monitored application and is used by some Python agent API calls. Get a reference to configuration settings To control the Python agent's behavior, you can use configuration settings. To get a reference to config file and environment variable settings and make changes to them, use global_settings. To get a reference to all settings, including server-side configuration from our UI, use application_settings. Shut down the agent To forcibly shut down the agent instead of allowing it to make the standard final attempt to upload data, use shutdown_agent. Control the Browser monitoring agent You can install the browser monitoring agent by automatically adding it to your pages or by deploying it on specific pages by copying and pasting the browser agent JavaScript snippet. You can also control the browser agent by using APM agent API calls. For more information, see Browser agent and the Python agent. If you want to... Do this...

Add instrumentation to supplement the agent's default monitoring. This document describes some of the available Python API calls. For a description of all our available APIs, see Introduction to APIs. Custom instrumentation or API If your goal is custom instrumentation, consider using the configuration file method, which allows you to add functions and class methods to the config file that will be auto-instrumented by the agent. The benefit of the config-file method is that it does not require you to change your application code. However, the Python agent API is much more powerful and is best for setting up more complex and tailored instrumentation. To ensure you have access to the full API functionality, update to the latest Python agent. Monitor transactions and segments The Python agent is compatible with most of the common WSGI web frameworks. If the agent supports your framework, web requests automatically will be captured as transactions and displayed in the New Relic One UI. A transaction can also have function-level segments that are captured as part of a transaction trace. Use these methods to monitor web transactions, non-web transactions, and transaction segments: If you want to... Do this... Monitor WSGI web transactions The Python agent automatically captures web transactions for supported frameworks. If you do not have a supported framework, you can use the wsgi_application function to monitor your WSGI entry point. Monitor non-web transactions The Python agent classifies non-web transactions as background tasks. To capture non-web transactions, use background_task. Capture more details about a transaction If your transaction traces do not have the level of detail you want: Use function_trace to capture more function-level detail in transactions. Use datastore_trace to capture more detail about datastore calls. Ignore a transaction Use any of these options: To ignore a transaction altogether, use ignore_transaction. To prevent a transaction from producing a transaction trace, use suppress_transaction_trace. To end a transaction before the agent would end it automatically, use end_of_transaction. Add and edit transaction metadata Sometimes the code you target is visible in our UI, but some details of the method are not useful. For example: The default name is not helpful, or it is causing a metric grouping issue. You want to add custom attributes to your transactions so you can filter them when querying. Use these calls when you want to change the metadata of an existing transaction: If you want to... Do this... Get reference to current transaction To return an object representing the current transaction, use current_transaction. This is required by some other Python agent API calls. Change the name of a transaction Use set_transaction_name. Add metadata (such as a customer's subscription level) to transactions Add custom attributes to your transactions using add_custom_parameter, or use other API calls to report custom data. Mark a transaction as a background job To convert a web transaction into a background task so that it appears as a non-web transaction in the UI, use set_background_task. Prevent a transaction from affecting your Apdex score Use suppress_apdex_metric.

Use the Python agent with our data explorer to organize, query, and visualize your data to answer key questions about application performance and customer experience. Use default transaction attributes, or add your own. Query your data using the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). Send your own event data. Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards. Install the Python agent Before you install the Python agent, make sure your system meets the system requirements. You must also create a New Relic account. We support a number of web frameworks and libraries right out of the box, including Django, WSGI, and Gunicorn. If you use one of the supported web frameworks, installation is easy. If you use an unsupported framework, the process will involve some additions to your app code and/or web server files. For a quick and simple install process that will work for the majority of setups, follow these simple steps: Download and install the Python package. Create config file. Integrate the Python agent with your application. Read the Quick Start guide Add Python data Monitor non-web scripts, background tasks, and functions The Python agent also lets you monitor non-web scripts, worker processes, tasks, and functions. The installation process for these non-web transactions is similar to the one used for a web app, with one major difference: instead of going through the standard integration process described in the install instructions, you would manually \"wrap\" any function you want to monitor. For more information, see Non-web tasks and processes. For instructions on monitoring Celery tasks, see Celery background tasks. What's next after installation? Once you get the agent up and running, some suggested next steps are: Explore your data in and get comfortable with the user interface. Read our docs on our other observability solutions and the APM page. Change your application's name, or other configuration options. Learn about setting up custom instrumentation for application activity not monitored by default. Consider the Python Telemetry SDK. Troubleshooting After you complete the install process, your data should appear in the APM UI within five minutes. If it does not, use these troubleshooting resources: If no data appears, follow these troubleshooting steps. If you experience issues when installing or running the Python agent on a new host, test that the package is installed correctly and that it can contact New Relic's data collector service. For other problems, see the full list of troubleshooting documentation. Check the source code The Python agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "The Python agent API allows you to customize and extend your monitoring. Use the Python agent API to: Manually instrument an unsupported framework or third-party system. Add instrumentation to supplement the agent's default monitoring. This document describes some of the available Python API calls. For a description of all our available APIs, see Introduction to APIs. Custom instrumentation or API If your goal is custom instrumentation, consider using the configuration file method, which allows you to add functions and class methods to the config file that will be auto-instrumented by the agent. The benefit of the config-file method is that it does not require you to change your application code. However, the Python agent API is much more powerful and is best for setting up more complex and tailored instrumentation. To ensure you have access to the full API functionality, update to the latest Python agent. Monitor transactions and segments The Python agent is compatible with most of the common WSGI web frameworks. If the agent supports your framework, web requests automatically will be captured as transactions and displayed in the New Relic One UI. A transaction can also have function-level segments that are captured as part of a transaction trace. Use these methods to monitor web transactions, non-web transactions, and transaction segments: If you want to... Do this... Monitor WSGI web transactions The Python agent automatically captures web transactions for supported frameworks. If you do not have a supported framework, you can use the wsgi_application function to monitor your WSGI entry point. Monitor non-web transactions The Python agent classifies non-web transactions as background tasks. To capture non-web transactions, use background_task. Capture more details about a transaction If your transaction traces do not have the level of detail you want: Use function_trace to capture more function-level detail in transactions. Use datastore_trace to capture more detail about datastore calls. Ignore a transaction Use any of these options: To ignore a transaction altogether, use ignore_transaction. To prevent a transaction from producing a transaction trace, use suppress_transaction_trace. To end a transaction before the agent would end it automatically, use end_of_transaction. Add and edit transaction metadata Sometimes the code you target is visible in our UI, but some details of the method are not useful. For example: The default name is not helpful, or it is causing a metric grouping issue. You want to add custom attributes to your transactions so you can filter them when querying. Use these calls when you want to change the metadata of an existing transaction: If you want to... Do this... Get reference to current transaction To return an object representing the current transaction, use current_transaction. This is required by some other Python agent API calls. Change the name of a transaction Use set_transaction_name. Add metadata (such as a customer's subscription level) to transactions Add custom attributes to your transactions using add_custom_parameter, or use other API calls to report custom data. Mark a transaction as a background job To convert a web transaction into a background task so that it appears as a non-web transaction in the UI, use set_background_task. Prevent a transaction from affecting your Apdex score Use suppress_apdex_metric. See related logs To see logs directly within the context of your application's errors and traces, use the get_linking_metadata API call to annotate your logs. For more information about correlating log data with other telemetry data, see our logs in context documentation. Report custom events and custom metric data The agent reports data in two primary forms: Metric data measures numeric, time-based values; for example, connections per minute. Event data captures discrete event information. Events have key-value attributes attached to them. You can analyze and query event data. Use these methods to create new event data and new metric data: If you want to... Do this... Send data about an event for use when querying your data. Use record_custom_event. Report time-based metrics on application performance To report a single metric, use record_custom_metric. To report a set of metrics, use record_custom_metrics. Report an exception as an error By default, the Python agent only reports unhandled exceptions. To report a Python exception as an error, use notice_error. Report query string parameters For security reasons, query string parameters associated with web transactions are disabled by default. Use capture_request_params to enable them. Tag events with metadata To add attributes to events for more detailed analysis in Insights or error analytics, use add_custom_parameter. Generate metrics from data sources and data factories To generate metrics with a pull-style API rather than the push-style API implemented by record_custom_metric(), use these API calls: register_data_source data_source_generator data_source_factory Message-related calls These API calls allow you to collect performance data on your message-passing architecture or service; for example, RabbitMQ. To use these calls, make sure you have Python agent version 2.88.0.72 or higher. If you want to... Do this... Report messages as a transaction Use message_transaction. Report message details as transaction trace segments Use message_trace. Implement distributed tracing These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. Services and applications monitored by our agents will automatically pass distributed tracing context to each other when using a supported framework. When not using a supported framework, you will need to use the distributed tracing APIs to manually accept this context. Supported web frameworks (for example, Flask, Django, Tornado) will automatically call accept_distributed_trace_payload when creating a transaction. Supported external web services libraries will automatically call create_distributed_trace_payload before making an external HTTP call. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. If you want to... Do this... Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Use create_distributed_trace_payload. Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace Use accept_distributed_trace_payload. Agent configuration, initialization, shutdown These calls help you manage Python agent behavior, such as initializing and integrating the agent, and referencing or changing configuration settings: If you want to... Do this... Initialize the agent To initialize the Python agent with a specific configuration file as part of advanced integration process, use initialize. Get a reference to the application object The application object represents an agent-monitored application and is used by some Python agent API calls. Get a reference to configuration settings To control the Python agent's behavior, you can use configuration settings. To get a reference to config file and environment variable settings and make changes to them, use global_settings. To get a reference to all settings, including server-side configuration from our UI, use application_settings. Shut down the agent To forcibly shut down the agent instead of allowing it to make the standard final attempt to upload data, use shutdown_agent. Control the Browser monitoring agent You can install the browser monitoring agent by automatically adding it to your pages or by deploying it on specific pages by copying and pasting the browser agent JavaScript snippet. You can also control the browser agent by using APM agent API calls. For more information, see Browser agent and the Python agent. If you want to... Do this... Monitor specific page views To inject the browser agent header and footer JavaScript snippets into views you want to monitor, use both get_browser_timing_header and get_browser_timing_footer. Disable monitoring of specific page views To disable browser monitoring for specific page views, use disable_browser_autorum.",

For a description of all our available APIs, see Introduction to APIs. Custom instrumentation or API If your goal is custom instrumentation, consider using the configuration file method, which allows you to add functions and class methods to the config file that will be auto-instrumented by the agent. The benefit of the config-file method is that it does not require you to change your application code. However, the Python agent API is much more powerful and is best for setting up more complex and tailored instrumentation. To ensure you have access to the full API functionality, update to the latest Python agent. Monitor transactions and segments The Python agent is compatible with most of the common WSGI web frameworks. If the agent supports your framework, web requests automatically will be captured as transactions and displayed in the New Relic One UI. A transaction can also have function-level segments that are captured as part of a transaction trace. Use these methods to monitor web transactions, non-web transactions, and transaction segments: If you want to... Do this... Monitor WSGI web transactions The Python agent automatically captures web transactions for supported frameworks. If you do not have a supported framework, you can use the wsgi_application function to monitor your WSGI entry point. Monitor non-web transactions The Python agent classifies non-web transactions as background tasks. To capture non-web transactions, use background_task. Capture more details about a transaction If your transaction traces do not have the level of detail you want: Use function_trace to capture more function-level detail in transactions. Use datastore_trace to capture more detail about datastore calls. Ignore a transaction Use any of these options: To ignore a transaction altogether, use ignore_transaction. To prevent a transaction from producing a transaction trace, use suppress_transaction_trace. To end a transaction before the agent would end it automatically, use end_of_transaction. Add and edit transaction metadata Sometimes the code you target is visible in our UI, but some details of the method are not useful. For example: The default name is not helpful, or it is causing a metric grouping issue. You want to add custom attributes to your transactions so you can filter them when querying. Use these calls when you want to change the metadata of an existing transaction: If you want to... Do this... Get reference to current transaction To return an object representing the current transaction, use current_transaction. This is required by some other Python agent API calls. Change the name of a transaction Use set_transaction_name. Add metadata (such as a customer's subscription level) to transactions Add custom attributes to your transactions using add_custom_parameter, or use other API calls to report custom data. Mark a transaction as a background job To convert a web transaction into a background task so that it appears as a non-web transaction in the UI, use set_background_task. Prevent a transaction from affecting your Apdex score Use suppress_apdex_metric. See related logs To see logs directly within the context of your application's errors and traces, use the get_linking_metadata API call to annotate your logs. For more information about correlating log data with other telemetry data, see our logs in context documentation. Report custom events and custom metric data The agent reports data in two primary forms: Metric data measures numeric, time-based values; for example, connections per minute. Event data captures discrete event information. Events have key-value attributes attached to them. You can analyze and query event data. Use these methods to create new event data and new metric data: If you want to... Do this... Send data about an event for use when querying your data. Use record_custom_event. Report time-based metrics on application performance To report a single metric, use record_custom_metric. To report a set of metrics, use record_custom_metrics. Report an exception as an error By default, the Python agent only reports unhandled exceptions. To report a Python exception as an error, use notice_error. Report query string parameters For security reasons, query string parameters associated with web transactions are disabled by default. Use capture_request_params to enable them. Tag events with metadata To add attributes to events for more detailed analysis in Insights or error analytics, use add_custom_parameter. Generate metrics from data sources and data factories To generate metrics with a pull-style API rather than the push-style API implemented by record_custom_metric(), use these API calls: register_data_source data_source_generator data_source_factory Message-related calls These API calls allow you to collect performance data on your message-passing architecture or service; for example, RabbitMQ. To use these calls, make sure you have Python agent version 2.88.0.72 or higher. If you want to... Do this... Report messages as a transaction Use message_transaction. Report message details as transaction trace segments Use message_trace. Implement distributed tracing These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. Services and applications monitored by our agents will automatically pass distributed tracing context to each other when using a supported framework. When not using a supported framework, you will need to use the distributed tracing APIs to manually accept this context. Supported web frameworks (for example, Flask, Django, Tornado) will automatically call accept_distributed_trace_payload when creating a transaction. Supported external web services libraries will automatically call create_distributed_trace_payload before making an external HTTP call. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. If you want to... Do this... Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Use create_distributed_trace_payload. Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace Use accept_distributed_trace_payload. Agent configuration, initialization, shutdown These calls help you manage Python agent behavior, such as initializing and integrating the agent, and referencing or changing configuration settings: If you want to... Do this... Initialize the agent To initialize the Python agent with a specific configuration file as part of advanced integration process, use initialize. Get a reference to the application object The application object represents an agent-monitored application and is used by some Python agent API calls. Get a reference to configuration settings To control the Python agent's behavior, you can use configuration settings. To get a reference to config file and environment variable settings and make changes to them, use global_settings. To get a reference to all settings, including server-side configuration from our UI, use application_settings. Shut down the agent To forcibly shut down the agent instead of allowing it to make the standard final attempt to upload data, use shutdown_agent. Control the Browser monitoring agent You can install the browser monitoring agent by automatically adding it to your pages or by deploying it on specific pages by copying and pasting the browser agent JavaScript snippet. You can also control the browser agent by using APM agent API calls. For more information, see Browser agent and the Python agent. If you want to... Do this... Monitor specific page views To inject the browser agent header and footer JavaScript snippets into views you want to monitor, use both get_browser_timing_header and get_browser_timing_footer. Disable monitoring of specific page views To disable browser monitoring for specific page views, use disable_browser_autorum.",

Extend agent instrumentation Other helpful tools include: Tools Description Browser monitoring Integrate the Python agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user browser activity. Simple scripts and background tasks Monitor job-based or task queuing systems, like Celery, or other standalone non-web functions. Business data analysis with data exploration. Use the Python agent with our data explorer to organize, query, and visualize your data to answer key questions about application performance and customer experience. Use default transaction attributes, or add your own. Query your data using the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). Send your own event data. Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards. Install the Python agent Before you install the Python agent, make sure your system meets the system requirements. You must also create a New Relic account. We support a number of web frameworks and libraries right out of the box, including Django, WSGI, and Gunicorn. If you use one of the supported web frameworks, installation is easy. If you use an unsupported framework, the process will involve some additions to your app code and/or web server files. For a quick and simple install process that will work for the majority of setups, follow these simple steps: Download and install the Python package. Create config file. Integrate the Python agent with your application. Read the Quick Start guide Add Python data Monitor non-web scripts, background tasks, and functions The Python agent also lets you monitor non-web scripts, worker processes, tasks, and functions. The installation process for these non-web transactions is similar to the one used for a web app, with one major difference: instead of going through the standard integration process described in the install instructions, you would manually \"wrap\" any function you want to monitor. For more information, see Non-web tasks and processes. For instructions on monitoring Celery tasks, see Celery background tasks. What's next after installation? Once you get the agent up and running, some suggested next steps are: Explore your data in and get comfortable with the user interface. Read our docs on our other observability solutions and the APM page. Change your application's name, or other configuration options. Learn about setting up custom instrumentation for application activity not monitored by default. Consider the Python Telemetry SDK. Troubleshooting After you complete the install process, your data should appear in the APM UI within five minutes. If it does not, use these troubleshooting resources: If no data appears, follow these troubleshooting steps. If you experience issues when installing or running the Python agent on a new host, test that the package is installed correctly and that it can contact New Relic's data collector service. For other problems, see the full list of troubleshooting documentation. Check the source code The Python agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

Extend agent instrumentation Other helpful tools include: Tools Description Browser monitoring Integrate the Python agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user browser activity. Simple scripts and background tasks Monitor job-based or task queuing systems, like Celery, or other standalone non-web functions. Business data analysis with data exploration. Use the Python agent with our data explorer to organize, query, and visualize your data to answer key questions about application performance and customer experience. Use default transaction attributes, or add your own. Query your data using the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). Send your own event data. Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards. Install the Python agent Before you install the Python agent, make sure your system meets the system requirements. You must also create a New Relic account. We support a number of web frameworks and libraries right out of the box, including Django, WSGI, and Gunicorn. If you use one of the supported web frameworks, installation is easy. If you use an unsupported framework, the process will involve some additions to your app code and/or web server files. For a quick and simple install process that will work for the majority of setups, follow these simple steps: Download and install the Python package. Create config file. Integrate the Python agent with your application. Read the Quick Start guide Add Python data Monitor non-web scripts, background tasks, and functions The Python agent also lets you monitor non-web scripts, worker processes, tasks, and functions. The installation process for these non-web transactions is similar to the one used for a web app, with one major difference: instead of going through the standard integration process described in the install instructions, you would manually \"wrap\" any function you want to monitor. For more information, see Non-web tasks and processes. For instructions on monitoring Celery tasks, see Celery background tasks. What's next after installation? Once you get the agent up and running, some suggested next steps are: Explore your data in and get comfortable with the user interface. Read our docs on our other observability solutions and the APM page. Change your application's name, or other configuration options. Learn about setting up custom instrumentation for application activity not monitored by default. Consider the Python Telemetry SDK. Troubleshooting After you complete the install process, your data should appear in the APM UI within five minutes. If it does not, use these troubleshooting resources: If no data appears, follow these troubleshooting steps. If you experience issues when installing or running the Python agent on a new host, test that the package is installed correctly and that it can contact New Relic's data collector service. For other problems, see the full list of troubleshooting documentation. Check the source code The Python agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "The Python agent API allows you to customize and extend your monitoring. Use the Python agent API to: Manually instrument an unsupported framework or third-party system. Add instrumentation to supplement the agent's default monitoring. This document describes some of the available Python API calls. For a description of all our available APIs, see Introduction to APIs. Custom instrumentation or API If your goal is custom instrumentation, consider using the configuration file method, which allows you to add functions and class methods to the config file that will be auto-instrumented by the agent. The benefit of the config-file method is that it does not require you to change your application code. However, the Python agent API is much more powerful and is best for setting up more complex and tailored instrumentation. To ensure you have access to the full API functionality, update to the latest Python agent. Monitor transactions and segments The Python agent is compatible with most of the common WSGI web frameworks. If the agent supports your framework, web requests automatically will be captured as transactions and displayed in the New Relic One UI. A transaction can also have function-level segments that are captured as part of a transaction trace. Use these methods to monitor web transactions, non-web transactions, and transaction segments: If you want to... Do this... Monitor WSGI web transactions The Python agent automatically captures web transactions for supported frameworks. If you do not have a supported framework, you can use the wsgi_application function to monitor your WSGI entry point. Monitor non-web transactions The Python agent classifies non-web transactions as background tasks. To capture non-web transactions, use background_task. Capture more details about a transaction If your transaction traces do not have the level of detail you want: Use function_trace to capture more function-level detail in transactions. Use datastore_trace to capture more detail about datastore calls. Ignore a transaction Use any of these options: To ignore a transaction altogether, use ignore_transaction. To prevent a transaction from producing a transaction trace, use suppress_transaction_trace. To end a transaction before the agent would end it automatically, use end_of_transaction. Add and edit transaction metadata Sometimes the code you target is visible in our UI, but some details of the method are not useful. For example: The default name is not helpful, or it is causing a metric grouping issue. You want to add custom attributes to your transactions so you can filter them when querying. Use these calls when you want to change the metadata of an existing transaction: If you want to... Do this... Get reference to current transaction To return an object representing the current transaction, use current_transaction. This is required by some other Python agent API calls. Change the name of a transaction Use set_transaction_name. Add metadata (such as a customer's subscription level) to transactions Add custom attributes to your transactions using add_custom_parameter, or use other API calls to report custom data. Mark a transaction as a background job To convert a web transaction into a background task so that it appears as a non-web transaction in the UI, use set_background_task. Prevent a transaction from affecting your Apdex score Use suppress_apdex_metric. See related logs To see logs directly within the context of your application's errors and traces, use the get_linking_metadata API call to annotate your logs. For more information about correlating log data with other telemetry data, see our logs in context documentation. Report custom events and custom metric data The agent reports data in two primary forms: Metric data measures numeric, time-based values; for example, connections per minute. Event data captures discrete event information. Events have key-value attributes attached to them. You can analyze and query event data. Use these methods to create new event data and new metric data: If you want to... Do this... Send data about an event for use when querying your data. Use record_custom_event. Report time-based metrics on application performance To report a single metric, use record_custom_metric. To report a set of metrics, use record_custom_metrics. Report an exception as an error By default, the Python agent only reports unhandled exceptions. To report a Python exception as an error, use notice_error. Report query string parameters For security reasons, query string parameters associated with web transactions are disabled by default. Use capture_request_params to enable them. Tag events with metadata To add attributes to events for more detailed analysis in Insights or error analytics, use add_custom_parameter. Generate metrics from data sources and data factories To generate metrics with a pull-style API rather than the push-style API implemented by record_custom_metric(), use these API calls: register_data_source data_source_generator data_source_factory Message-related calls These API calls allow you to collect performance data on your message-passing architecture or service; for example, RabbitMQ. To use these calls, make sure you have Python agent version 2.88.0.72 or higher. If you want to... Do this... Report messages as a transaction Use message_transaction. Report message details as transaction trace segments Use message_trace. Implement distributed tracing These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. Services and applications monitored by our agents will automatically pass distributed tracing context to each other when using a supported framework. When not using a supported framework, you will need to use the distributed tracing APIs to manually accept this context. Supported web frameworks (for example, Flask, Django, Tornado) will automatically call accept_distributed_trace_payload when creating a transaction. Supported external web services libraries will automatically call create_distributed_trace_payload before making an external HTTP call. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. If you want to... Do this... Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Use create_distributed_trace_payload. Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace Use accept_distributed_trace_payload. Agent configuration, initialization, shutdown These calls help you manage Python agent behavior, such as initializing and integrating the agent, and referencing or changing configuration settings: If you want to... Do this... Initialize the agent To initialize the Python agent with a specific configuration file as part of advanced integration process, use initialize. Get a reference to the application object The application object represents an agent-monitored application and is used by some Python agent API calls. Get a reference to configuration settings To control the Python agent's behavior, you can use configuration settings. To get a reference to config file and environment variable settings and make changes to them, use global_settings. To get a reference to all settings, including server-side configuration from our UI, use application_settings. Shut down the agent To forcibly shut down the agent instead of allowing it to make the standard final attempt to upload data, use shutdown_agent. Control the Browser monitoring agent You can install the browser monitoring agent by automatically adding it to your pages or by deploying it on specific pages by copying and pasting the browser agent JavaScript snippet. You can also control the browser agent by using APM agent API calls. For more information, see Browser agent and the Python agent. If you want to... Do this... Monitor specific page views To inject the browser agent header and footer JavaScript snippets into views you want to monitor, use both get_browser_timing_header and get_browser_timing_footer. Disable monitoring of specific page views To disable browser monitoring for specific page views, use disable_browser_autorum.",

Use datastore_trace to capture more detail about datastore calls. Ignore a transaction Use any of these options: To ignore a transaction altogether, use ignore_transaction. To prevent a transaction from producing a transaction trace, use suppress_transaction_trace. To end a transaction before the agent would end it automatically, use end_of_transaction. Add and edit transaction metadata Sometimes the code you target is visible in our UI, but some details of the method are not useful. For example: The default name is not helpful, or it is causing a metric grouping issue. You want to add custom attributes to your transactions so you can filter them when querying. Use these calls when you want to change the metadata of an existing transaction: If you want to... Do this... Get reference to current transaction To return an object representing the current transaction, use current_transaction. This is required by some other Python agent API calls. Change the name of a transaction Use set_transaction_name. Add metadata (such as a customer's subscription level) to transactions Add custom attributes to your transactions using add_custom_parameter, or use other API calls to report custom data. Mark a transaction as a background job To convert a web transaction into a background task so that it appears as a non-web transaction in the UI, use set_background_task. Prevent a transaction from affecting your Apdex score Use suppress_apdex_metric. See related logs To see logs directly within the context of your application's errors and traces, use the get_linking_metadata API call to annotate your logs. For more information about correlating log data with other telemetry data, see our logs in context documentation. Report custom events and custom metric data The agent reports data in two primary forms: Metric data measures numeric, time-based values; for example, connections per minute. Event data captures discrete event information. Events have key-value attributes attached to them. You can analyze and query event data. Use these methods to create new event data and new metric data: If you want to... Do this... Send data about an event for use when querying your data. Use record_custom_event. Report time-based metrics on application performance To report a single metric, use record_custom_metric. To report a set of metrics, use record_custom_metrics. Report an exception as an error By default, the Python agent only reports unhandled exceptions. To report a Python exception as an error, use notice_error. Report query string parameters For security reasons, query string parameters associated with web transactions are disabled by default. Use capture_request_params to enable them. Tag events with metadata To add attributes to events for more detailed analysis in Insights or error analytics, use add_custom_parameter. Generate metrics from data sources and data factories To generate metrics with a pull-style API rather than the push-style API implemented by record_custom_metric(), use these API calls: register_data_source data_source_generator data_source_factory Message-related calls These API calls allow you to collect performance data on your message-passing architecture or service; for example, RabbitMQ. To use these calls, make sure you have Python agent version 2.88.0.72 or higher. If you want to... Do this... Report messages as a transaction Use message_transaction. Report message details as transaction trace segments Use message_trace. Implement distributed tracing These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. Services and applications monitored by our agents will automatically pass distributed tracing context to each other when using a supported framework. When not using a supported framework, you will need to use the distributed tracing APIs to manually accept this context. Supported web frameworks (for example, Flask, Django, Tornado) will automatically call accept_distributed_trace_payload when creating a transaction. Supported external web services libraries will automatically call create_distributed_trace_payload before making an external HTTP call. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. If you want to... Do this... Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Use create_distributed_trace_payload. Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace Use accept_distributed_trace_payload. Agent configuration, initialization, shutdown These calls help you manage Python agent behavior, such as initializing and integrating the agent, and referencing or changing configuration settings: If you want to... Do this... Initialize the agent To initialize the Python agent with a specific configuration file as part of advanced integration process, use initialize. Get a reference to the application object The application object represents an agent-monitored application and is used by some Python agent API calls. Get a reference to configuration settings To control the Python agent's behavior, you can use configuration settings. To get a reference to config file and environment variable settings and make changes to them, use global_settings. To get a reference to all settings, including server-side configuration from our UI, use application_settings. Shut down the agent To forcibly shut down the agent instead of allowing it to make the standard final attempt to upload data, use shutdown_agent. Control the Browser monitoring agent You can install the browser monitoring agent by automatically adding it to your pages or by deploying it on specific pages by copying and pasting the browser agent JavaScript snippet. You can also control the browser agent by using APM agent API calls. For more information, see Browser agent and the Python agent. If you want to... Do this... Monitor specific page views To inject the browser agent header and footer JavaScript snippets into views you want to monitor, use both get_browser_timing_header and get_browser_timing_footer. Disable monitoring of specific page views To disable browser monitoring for specific page views, use disable_browser_autorum.",

Extend agent instrumentation Other helpful tools include: Tools Description Browser monitoring Integrate the Python agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user browser activity. Simple scripts and background tasks Monitor job-based or task queuing systems, like Celery, or other standalone non-web functions. Business data analysis with data exploration. Use the Python agent with our data explorer to organize, query, and visualize your data to answer key questions about application performance and customer experience. Use default transaction attributes, or add your own. Query your data using the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). Send your own event data. Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards. Install the Python agent Before you install the Python agent, make sure your system meets the system requirements. You must also create a New Relic account. We support a number of web frameworks and libraries right out of the box, including Django, WSGI, and Gunicorn. If you use one of the supported web frameworks, installation is easy. If you use an unsupported framework, the process will involve some additions to your app code and/or web server files. For a quick and simple install process that will work for the majority of setups, follow these simple steps: Download and install the Python package. Create config file. Integrate the Python agent with your application. Read the Quick Start guide Add Python data Monitor non-web scripts, background tasks, and functions The Python agent also lets you monitor non-web scripts, worker processes, tasks, and functions. The installation process for these non-web transactions is similar to the one used for a web app, with one major difference: instead of going through the standard integration process described in the install instructions, you would manually \"wrap\" any function you want to monitor. For more information, see Non-web tasks and processes. For instructions on monitoring Celery tasks, see Celery background tasks. What's next after installation? Once you get the agent up and running, some suggested next steps are: Explore your data in and get comfortable with the user interface. Read our docs on our other observability solutions and the APM page. Change your application's name, or other configuration options. Learn about setting up custom instrumentation for application activity not monitored by default. Consider the Python Telemetry SDK. Troubleshooting After you complete the install process, your data should appear in the APM UI within five minutes. If it does not, use these troubleshooting resources: If no data appears, follow these troubleshooting steps. If you experience issues when installing or running the Python agent on a new host, test that the package is installed correctly and that it can contact New Relic's data collector service. For other problems, see the full list of troubleshooting documentation. Check the source code The Python agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

Add instrumentation to supplement the agent's default monitoring. This document describes some of the available Python API calls. For a description of all our available APIs, see Introduction to APIs. Custom instrumentation or API If your goal is custom instrumentation, consider using the configuration file method, which allows you to add functions and class methods to the config file that will be auto-instrumented by the agent. The benefit of the config-file method is that it does not require you to change your application code. However, the Python agent API is much more powerful and is best for setting up more complex and tailored instrumentation. To ensure you have access to the full API functionality, update to the latest Python agent. Monitor transactions and segments The Python agent is compatible with most of the common WSGI web frameworks. If the agent supports your framework, web requests automatically will be captured as transactions and displayed in the New Relic One UI. A transaction can also have function-level segments that are captured as part of a transaction trace. Use these methods to monitor web transactions, non-web transactions, and transaction segments: If you want to... Do this...

The installation process for these non-web transactions is similar to the one used for a web app, with one major difference: instead of going through the standard integration process described in the install instructions, you would manually \"wrap\" any function you want to monitor. For more information, see Non-web tasks and processes. For instructions on monitoring Celery tasks, see Celery background tasks. What's next after installation? Once you get the agent up and running, some suggested next steps are: Explore your data in and get comfortable with the user interface. Read our docs on our other observability solutions and the APM page. Change your application's name, or other configuration options. Learn about setting up custom instrumentation for application activity not monitored by default. Consider the Python Telemetry SDK. Troubleshooting After you complete the install process, your data should appear in the APM UI within five minutes. If it does not, use these troubleshooting resources: If no data appears, follow these troubleshooting steps. If you experience issues when installing or running the Python agent on a new host, test that the package is installed correctly and that it can contact New Relic's data collector service. For other problems, see the full list of troubleshooting documentation. Check the source code The Python agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "The Python agent API allows you to customize and extend your monitoring. Use the Python agent API to: Manually instrument an unsupported framework or third-party system. Add instrumentation to supplement the agent's default monitoring. This document describes some of the available Python API calls. For a description of all our available APIs, see Introduction to APIs. Custom instrumentation or API If your goal is custom instrumentation, consider using the configuration file method, which allows you to add functions and class methods to the config file that will be auto-instrumented by the agent. The benefit of the config-file method is that it does not require you to change your application code. However, the Python agent API is much more powerful and is best for setting up more complex and tailored instrumentation. To ensure you have access to the full API functionality, update to the latest Python agent. Monitor transactions and segments The Python agent is compatible with most of the common WSGI web frameworks. If the agent supports your framework, web requests automatically will be captured as transactions and displayed in the New Relic One UI. A transaction can also have function-level segments that are captured as part of a transaction trace. Use these methods to monitor web transactions, non-web transactions, and transaction segments: If you want to... Do this... Monitor WSGI web transactions The Python agent automatically captures web transactions for supported frameworks. If you do not have a supported framework, you can use the wsgi_application function to monitor your WSGI entry point. Monitor non-web transactions The Python agent classifies non-web transactions as background tasks. To capture non-web transactions, use background_task. Capture more details about a transaction If your transaction traces do not have the level of detail you want: Use function_trace to capture more function-level detail in transactions. Use datastore_trace to capture more detail about datastore calls. Ignore a transaction Use any of these options: To ignore a transaction altogether, use ignore_transaction. To prevent a transaction from producing a transaction trace, use suppress_transaction_trace. To end a transaction before the agent would end it automatically, use end_of_transaction. Add and edit transaction metadata Sometimes the code you target is visible in our UI, but some details of the method are not useful. For example: The default name is not helpful, or it is causing a metric grouping issue. You want to add custom attributes to your transactions so you can filter them when querying. Use these calls when you want to change the metadata of an existing transaction: If you want to... Do this... Get reference to current transaction To return an object representing the current transaction, use current_transaction. This is required by some other Python agent API calls. Change the name of a transaction Use set_transaction_name. Add metadata (such as a customer's subscription level) to transactions Add custom attributes to your transactions using add_custom_parameter, or use other API calls to report custom data. Mark a transaction as a background job To convert a web transaction into a background task so that it appears as a non-web transaction in the UI, use set_background_task. Prevent a transaction from affecting your Apdex score Use suppress_apdex_metric. See related logs To see logs directly within the context of your application's errors and traces, use the get_linking_metadata API call to annotate your logs. For more information about correlating log data with other telemetry data, see our logs in context documentation. Report custom events and custom metric data The agent reports data in two primary forms: Metric data measures numeric, time-based values; for example, connections per minute. Event data captures discrete event information. Events have key-value attributes attached to them. You can analyze and query event data. Use these methods to create new event data and new metric data: If you want to... Do this... Send data about an event for use when querying your data. Use record_custom_event. Report time-based metrics on application performance To report a single metric, use record_custom_metric. To report a set of metrics, use record_custom_metrics. Report an exception as an error By default, the Python agent only reports unhandled exceptions. To report a Python exception as an error, use notice_error. Report query string parameters For security reasons, query string parameters associated with web transactions are disabled by default. Use capture_request_params to enable them. Tag events with metadata To add attributes to events for more detailed analysis in Insights or error analytics, use add_custom_parameter. Generate metrics from data sources and data factories To generate metrics with a pull-style API rather than the push-style API implemented by record_custom_metric(), use these API calls: register_data_source data_source_generator data_source_factory Message-related calls These API calls allow you to collect performance data on your message-passing architecture or service; for example, RabbitMQ. To use these calls, make sure you have Python agent version 2.88.0.72 or higher. If you want to... Do this... Report messages as a transaction Use message_transaction. Report message details as transaction trace segments Use message_trace. Implement distributed tracing These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. Services and applications monitored by our agents will automatically pass distributed tracing context to each other when using a supported framework. When not using a supported framework, you will need to use the distributed tracing APIs to manually accept this context. Supported web frameworks (for example, Flask, Django, Tornado) will automatically call accept_distributed_trace_payload when creating a transaction. Supported external web services libraries will automatically call create_distributed_trace_payload before making an external HTTP call. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. If you want to... Do this... Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Use create_distributed_trace_payload. Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace Use accept_distributed_trace_payload. Agent configuration, initialization, shutdown These calls help you manage Python agent behavior, such as initializing and integrating the agent, and referencing or changing configuration settings: If you want to... Do this... Initialize the agent To initialize the Python agent with a specific configuration file as part of advanced integration process, use initialize. Get a reference to the application object The application object represents an agent-monitored application and is used by some Python agent API calls. Get a reference to configuration settings To control the Python agent's behavior, you can use configuration settings. To get a reference to config file and environment variable settings and make changes to them, use global_settings. To get a reference to all settings, including server-side configuration from our UI, use application_settings. Shut down the agent To forcibly shut down the agent instead of allowing it to make the standard final attempt to upload data, use shutdown_agent. Control the Browser monitoring agent You can install the browser monitoring agent by automatically adding it to your pages or by deploying it on specific pages by copying and pasting the browser agent JavaScript snippet. You can also control the browser agent by using APM agent API calls. For more information, see Browser agent and the Python agent. If you want to... Do this... Monitor specific page views To inject the browser agent header and footer JavaScript snippets into views you want to monitor, use both get_browser_timing_header and get_browser_timing_footer. Disable monitoring of specific page views To disable browser monitoring for specific page views, use disable_browser_autorum.",

See related logs To see logs directly within the context of your application's errors and traces, use the get_linking_metadata API call to annotate your logs. For more information about correlating log data with other telemetry data, see our logs in context documentation. Report custom events and custom metric data The agent reports data in two primary forms: Metric data measures numeric, time-based values; for example, connections per minute. Event data captures discrete event information. Events have key-value attributes attached to them. You can analyze and query event data. Use these methods to create new event data and new metric data: If you want to... Do this... Send data about an event for use when querying your data. Use record_custom_event. Report time-based metrics on application performance To report a single metric, use record_custom_metric. To report a set of metrics, use record_custom_metrics. Report an exception as an error By default, the Python agent only reports unhandled exceptions. To report a Python exception as an error, use notice_error. Report query string parameters For security reasons, query string parameters associated with web transactions are disabled by default. Use capture_request_params to enable them. Tag events with metadata To add attributes to events for more detailed analysis in Insights or error analytics, use add_custom_parameter. Generate metrics from data sources and data factories To generate metrics with a pull-style API rather than the push-style API implemented by record_custom_metric(), use these API calls: register_data_source data_source_generator data_source_factory Message-related calls These API calls allow you to collect performance data on your message-passing architecture or service; for example, RabbitMQ. To use these calls, make sure you have Python agent version 2.88.0.72 or higher. If you want to... Do this... Report messages as a transaction Use message_transaction. Report message details as transaction trace segments Use message_trace. Implement distributed tracing These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. Services and applications monitored by our agents will automatically pass distributed tracing context to each other when using a supported framework. When not using a supported framework, you will need to use the distributed tracing APIs to manually accept this context. Supported web frameworks (for example, Flask, Django, Tornado) will automatically call accept_distributed_trace_payload when creating a transaction. Supported external web services libraries will automatically call create_distributed_trace_payload before making an external HTTP call. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. If you want to... Do this... Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Use create_distributed_trace_payload. Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace Use accept_distributed_trace_payload. Agent configuration, initialization, shutdown These calls help you manage Python agent behavior, such as initializing and integrating the agent, and referencing or changing configuration settings: If you want to... Do this... Initialize the agent To initialize the Python agent with a specific configuration file as part of advanced integration process, use initialize. Get a reference to the application object The application object represents an agent-monitored application and is used by some Python agent API calls. Get a reference to configuration settings To control the Python agent's behavior, you can use configuration settings. To get a reference to config file and environment variable settings and make changes to them, use global_settings. To get a reference to all settings, including server-side configuration from our UI, use application_settings. Shut down the agent To forcibly shut down the agent instead of allowing it to make the standard final attempt to upload data, use shutdown_agent. Control the Browser monitoring agent You can install the browser monitoring agent by automatically adding it to your pages or by deploying it on specific pages by copying and pasting the browser agent JavaScript snippet. You can also control the browser agent by using APM agent API calls. For more information, see Browser agent and the Python agent. If you want to... Do this... Monitor specific page views To inject the browser agent header and footer JavaScript snippets into views you want to monitor, use both get_browser_timing_header and get_browser_timing_footer. Disable monitoring of specific page views To disable browser monitoring for specific page views, use disable_browser_autorum.",

Integrate the Python agent with your application. Read the Quick Start guide Add Python data Monitor non-web scripts, background tasks, and functions The Python agent also lets you monitor non-web scripts, worker processes, tasks, and functions. The installation process for these non-web transactions is similar to the one used for a web app, with one major difference: instead of going through the standard integration process described in the install instructions, you would manually \"wrap\" any function you want to monitor. For more information, see Non-web tasks and processes. For instructions on monitoring Celery tasks, see Celery background tasks. What's next after installation? Once you get the agent up and running, some suggested next steps are: Explore your data in and get comfortable with the user interface. Read our docs on our other observability solutions and the APM page. Change your application's name, or other configuration options. Learn about setting up custom instrumentation for application activity not monitored by default. Consider the Python Telemetry SDK. Troubleshooting After you complete the install process, your data should appear in the APM UI within five minutes. If it does not, use these troubleshooting resources: If no data appears, follow these troubleshooting steps.

      "body": "The Python agent API allows you to customize and extend your monitoring. Use the Python agent API to: Manually instrument an unsupported framework or third-party system. Add instrumentation to supplement the agent's default monitoring. This document describes some of the available Python API calls. For a description of all our available APIs, see Introduction to APIs. Custom instrumentation or API If your goal is custom instrumentation, consider using the configuration file method, which allows you to add functions and class methods to the config file that will be auto-instrumented by the agent. The benefit of the config-file method is that it does not require you to change your application code. However, the Python agent API is much more powerful and is best for setting up more complex and tailored instrumentation. To ensure you have access to the full API functionality, update to the latest Python agent. Monitor transactions and segments The Python agent is compatible with most of the common WSGI web frameworks. If the agent supports your framework, web requests automatically will be captured as transactions and displayed in the New Relic One UI. A transaction can also have function-level segments that are captured as part of a transaction trace. Use these methods to monitor web transactions, non-web transactions, and transaction segments: If you want to... Do this... Monitor WSGI web transactions The Python agent automatically captures web transactions for supported frameworks. If you do not have a supported framework, you can use the wsgi_application function to monitor your WSGI entry point. Monitor non-web transactions The Python agent classifies non-web transactions as background tasks. To capture non-web transactions, use background_task. Capture more details about a transaction If your transaction traces do not have the level of detail you want: Use function_trace to capture more function-level detail in transactions. Use datastore_trace to capture more detail about datastore calls. Ignore a transaction Use any of these options: To ignore a transaction altogether, use ignore_transaction. To prevent a transaction from producing a transaction trace, use suppress_transaction_trace. To end a transaction before the agent would end it automatically, use end_of_transaction. Add and edit transaction metadata Sometimes the code you target is visible in our UI, but some details of the method are not useful. For example: The default name is not helpful, or it is causing a metric grouping issue. You want to add custom attributes to your transactions so you can filter them when querying. Use these calls when you want to change the metadata of an existing transaction: If you want to... Do this... Get reference to current transaction To return an object representing the current transaction, use current_transaction. This is required by some other Python agent API calls. Change the name of a transaction Use set_transaction_name. Add metadata (such as a customer's subscription level) to transactions Add custom attributes to your transactions using add_custom_parameter, or use other API calls to report custom data. Mark a transaction as a background job To convert a web transaction into a background task so that it appears as a non-web transaction in the UI, use set_background_task. Prevent a transaction from affecting your Apdex score Use suppress_apdex_metric. See related logs To see logs directly within the context of your application's errors and traces, use the get_linking_metadata API call to annotate your logs.

      "body": "The Python agent API allows you to customize and extend your monitoring. Use the Python agent API to: Manually instrument an unsupported framework or third-party system. Add instrumentation to supplement the agent's default monitoring. This document describes some of the available Python API calls. For a description of all our available APIs, see Introduction to APIs. Custom instrumentation or API If your goal is custom instrumentation, consider using the configuration file method, which allows you to add functions and class methods to the config file that will be auto-instrumented by the agent. The benefit of the config-file method is that it does not require you to change your application code. However, the Python agent API is much more powerful and is best for setting up more complex and tailored instrumentation. To ensure you have access to the full API functionality, update to the latest Python agent. Monitor transactions and segments The Python agent is compatible with most of the common WSGI web frameworks. If the agent supports your framework, web requests automatically will be captured as transactions and displayed in the New Relic One UI. A transaction can also have function-level segments that are captured as part of a transaction trace. Use these methods to monitor web transactions, non-web transactions, and transaction segments: If you want to... Do this... Monitor WSGI web transactions The Python agent automatically captures web transactions for supported frameworks. If you do not have a supported framework, you can use the wsgi_application function to monitor your WSGI entry point. Monitor non-web transactions The Python agent classifies non-web transactions as background tasks. To capture non-web transactions, use background_task. Capture more details about a transaction If your transaction traces do not have the level of detail you want: Use function_trace to capture more function-level detail in transactions. Use datastore_trace to capture more detail about datastore calls. Ignore a transaction Use any of these options: To ignore a transaction altogether, use ignore_transaction. To prevent a transaction from producing a transaction trace, use suppress_transaction_trace. To end a transaction before the agent would end it automatically, use end_of_transaction. Add and edit transaction metadata Sometimes the code you target is visible in our UI, but some details of the method are not useful. For example: The default name is not helpful, or it is causing a metric grouping issue. You want to add custom attributes to your transactions so you can filter them when querying. Use these calls when you want to change the metadata of an existing transaction: If you want to... Do this... Get reference to current transaction To return an object representing the current transaction, use current_transaction. This is required by some other Python agent API calls. Change the name of a transaction Use set_transaction_name. Add metadata (such as a customer's subscription level) to transactions Add custom attributes to your transactions using add_custom_parameter, or use other API calls to report custom data. Mark a transaction as a background job To convert a web transaction into a background task so that it appears as a non-web transaction in the UI, use set_background_task. Prevent a transaction from affecting your Apdex score Use suppress_apdex_metric. See related logs To see logs directly within the context of your application's errors and traces, use the get_linking_metadata API call to annotate your logs. For more information about correlating log data with other telemetry data, see our logs in context documentation. Report custom events and custom metric data The agent reports data in two primary forms: Metric data measures numeric, time-based values; for example, connections per minute. Event data captures discrete event information. Events have key-value attributes attached to them. You can analyze and query event data. Use these methods to create new event data and new metric data: If you want to... Do this... Send data about an event for use when querying your data. Use record_custom_event. Report time-based metrics on application performance To report a single metric, use record_custom_metric. To report a set of metrics, use record_custom_metrics. Report an exception as an error By default, the Python agent only reports unhandled exceptions. To report a Python exception as an error, use notice_error. Report query string parameters For security reasons, query string parameters associated with web transactions are disabled by default. Use capture_request_params to enable them. Tag events with metadata To add attributes to events for more detailed analysis in Insights or error analytics, use add_custom_parameter. Generate metrics from data sources and data factories To generate metrics with a pull-style API rather than the push-style API implemented by record_custom_metric(), use these API calls: register_data_source data_source_generator data_source_factory Message-related calls These API calls allow you to collect performance data on your message-passing architecture or service; for example, RabbitMQ. To use these calls, make sure you have Python agent version 2.88.0.72 or higher. If you want to... Do this... Report messages as a transaction Use message_transaction. Report message details as transaction trace segments Use message_trace. Implement distributed tracing These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. Services and applications monitored by our agents will automatically pass distributed tracing context to each other when using a supported framework. When not using a supported framework, you will need to use the distributed tracing APIs to manually accept this context. Supported web frameworks (for example, Flask, Django, Tornado) will automatically call accept_distributed_trace_payload when creating a transaction. Supported external web services libraries will automatically call create_distributed_trace_payload before making an external HTTP call. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. If you want to... Do this... Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Use create_distributed_trace_payload. Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace Use accept_distributed_trace_payload. Agent configuration, initialization, shutdown These calls help you manage Python agent behavior, such as initializing and integrating the agent, and referencing or changing configuration settings: If you want to... Do this... Initialize the agent To initialize the Python agent with a specific configuration file as part of advanced integration process, use initialize. Get a reference to the application object The application object represents an agent-monitored application and is used by some Python agent API calls. Get a reference to configuration settings To control the Python agent's behavior, you can use configuration settings. To get a reference to config file and environment variable settings and make changes to them, use global_settings. To get a reference to all settings, including server-side configuration from our UI, use application_settings. Shut down the agent To forcibly shut down the agent instead of allowing it to make the standard final attempt to upload data, use shutdown_agent. Control the Browser monitoring agent You can install the browser monitoring agent by automatically adding it to your pages or by deploying it on specific pages by copying and pasting the browser agent JavaScript snippet. You can also control the browser agent by using APM agent API calls. For more information, see Browser agent and the Python agent. If you want to... Do this... Monitor specific page views To inject the browser agent header and footer JavaScript snippets into views you want to monitor, use both get_browser_timing_header and get_browser_timing_footer. Disable monitoring of specific page views To disable browser monitoring for specific page views, use disable_browser_autorum.",

You can also extend your performance monitoring to collect and analyze business data to help you improve the customer experience and make data-driven business decisions. With flexible options for custom instrumentation and APIs, The Python agent offers multiple building blocks to customize the data you need from your app. Our Python works with a wide variety of web frameworks and hosting mechanisms, including Django, Gunicorn, WSGI, CherryPy, uWSGI, and more. You can also install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Monitor app performance After you install the Python agent, it begins to collect data about your app. You can view the data as charts and tables in New Relic One. View the big picture of your app. Monitor your app's Apdex (user satisfaction). Get a high-level summary of your app with Summary page. Enable distributed tracing to see activity across an architecture having many services. Install Infrastructure monitoring and view detailed server/host data for your app. Find errors and problems quickly. Track key transactions specific to your business. Create custom dashboards for important metrics. Alert your team when an error or problem occurs before it affects your users. View performance after a deployment. Drill down into performance details. Examine code-level transaction traces. Examine database query traces. Examine error traces. Use thread profiler sessions to see detailed stack traces of sampled threads View logs for your APM and infrastructure data Bring your logs and application's data together to make troubleshooting easier and faster. No need to switch to another UI page in New Relic One. With logs in context, you can see log messages related to your errors and traces directly in your app's UI. You can also see logs in context of your infrastructure data, such as Kubernetes clusters. Extend agent instrumentation Other helpful tools include: Tools Description Browser monitoring Integrate the Python agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user browser activity. Simple scripts and background tasks Monitor job-based or task queuing systems, like Celery, or other standalone non-web functions. Business data analysis with data exploration. Use the Python agent with our data explorer to organize, query, and visualize your data to answer key questions about application performance and customer experience. Use default transaction attributes, or add your own. Query your data using the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). Send your own event data. Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards. Install the Python agent Before you install the Python agent, make sure your system meets the system requirements. You must also create a New Relic account. We support a number of web frameworks and libraries right out of the box, including Django, WSGI, and Gunicorn. If you use one of the supported web frameworks, installation is easy. If you use an unsupported framework, the process will involve some additions to your app code and/or web server files. For a quick and simple install process that will work for the majority of setups, follow these simple steps: Download and install the Python package. Create config file. Integrate the Python agent with your application. Read the Quick Start guide Add Python data Monitor non-web scripts, background tasks, and functions The Python agent also lets you monitor non-web scripts, worker processes, tasks, and functions. The installation process for these non-web transactions is similar to the one used for a web app, with one major difference: instead of going through the standard integration process described in the install instructions, you would manually \"wrap\" any function you want to monitor. For more information, see Non-web tasks and processes. For instructions on monitoring Celery tasks, see Celery background tasks. What's next after installation? Once you get the agent up and running, some suggested next steps are: Explore your data in and get comfortable with the user interface. Read our docs on our other observability solutions and the APM page. Change your application's name, or other configuration options. Learn about setting up custom instrumentation for application activity not monitored by default. Consider the Python Telemetry SDK. Troubleshooting After you complete the install process, your data should appear in the APM UI within five minutes. If it does not, use these troubleshooting resources: If no data appears, follow these troubleshooting steps. If you experience issues when installing or running the Python agent on a new host, test that the package is installed correctly and that it can contact New Relic's data collector service. For other problems, see the full list of troubleshooting documentation. Check the source code The Python agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

Generate metrics from data sources and data factories To generate metrics with a pull-style API rather than the push-style API implemented by record_custom_metric(), use these API calls: register_data_source data_source_generator data_source_factory Message-related calls These API calls allow you to collect performance data on your message-passing architecture or service; for example, RabbitMQ. To use these calls, make sure you have Python agent version 2.88.0.72 or higher. If you want to... Do this... Report messages as a transaction Use message_transaction. Report message details as transaction trace segments Use message_trace. Implement distributed tracing These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. Services and applications monitored by our agents will automatically pass distributed tracing context to each other when using a supported framework. When not using a supported framework, you will need to use the distributed tracing APIs to manually accept this context. Supported web frameworks (for example, Flask, Django, Tornado) will automatically call accept_distributed_trace_payload when creating a transaction. Supported external web services libraries will automatically call create_distributed_trace_payload before making an external HTTP call. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. If you want to... Do this... Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Use create_distributed_trace_payload. Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace Use accept_distributed_trace_payload. Agent configuration, initialization, shutdown These calls help you manage Python agent behavior, such as initializing and integrating the agent, and referencing or changing configuration settings: If you want to... Do this... Initialize the agent To initialize the Python agent with a specific configuration file as part of advanced integration process, use initialize. Get a reference to the application object The application object represents an agent-monitored application and is used by some Python agent API calls. Get a reference to configuration settings To control the Python agent's behavior, you can use configuration settings. To get a reference to config file and environment variable settings and make changes to them, use global_settings. To get a reference to all settings, including server-side configuration from our UI, use application_settings. Shut down the agent To forcibly shut down the agent instead of allowing it to make the standard final attempt to upload data, use shutdown_agent. Control the Browser monitoring agent You can install the browser monitoring agent by automatically adding it to your pages or by deploying it on specific pages by copying and pasting the browser agent JavaScript snippet. You can also control the browser agent by using APM agent API calls. For more information, see Browser agent and the Python agent. If you want to... Do this... Monitor specific page views To inject the browser agent header and footer JavaScript snippets into views you want to monitor, use both get_browser_timing_header and get_browser_timing_footer. Disable monitoring of specific page views To disable browser monitoring for specific page views, use disable_browser_autorum.",

Install the Python agent Before you install the Python agent, make sure your system meets the system requirements. You must also create a New Relic account. We support a number of web frameworks and libraries right out of the box, including Django, WSGI, and Gunicorn. If you use one of the supported web frameworks, installation is easy. If you use an unsupported framework, the process will involve some additions to your app code and/or web server files. For a quick and simple install process that will work for the majority of setups, follow these simple steps: Download and install the Python package. Create config file. Integrate the Python agent with your application. Read the Quick Start guide Add Python data Monitor non-web scripts, background tasks, and functions The Python agent also lets you monitor non-web scripts, worker processes, tasks, and functions. The installation process for these non-web transactions is similar to the one used for a web app, with one major difference: instead of going through the standard integration process described in the install instructions, you would manually \"wrap\" any function you want to monitor. For more information, see Non-web tasks and processes. For instructions on monitoring Celery tasks, see Celery background tasks. What's next after installation? Once you get the agent up and running, some suggested next steps are: Explore your data in and get comfortable with the user interface. Read our docs on our other observability solutions and the APM page. Change your application's name, or other configuration options. Learn about setting up custom instrumentation for application activity not monitored by default. Consider the Python Telemetry SDK. Troubleshooting After you complete the install process, your data should appear in the APM UI within five minutes. If it does not, use these troubleshooting resources: If no data appears, follow these troubleshooting steps. If you experience issues when installing or running the Python agent on a new host, test that the package is installed correctly and that it can contact New Relic's data collector service.

      "body": "The Python agent API allows you to customize and extend your monitoring. Use the Python agent API to: Manually instrument an unsupported framework or third-party system. Add instrumentation to supplement the agent's default monitoring. This document describes some of the available Python API calls. For a description of all our available APIs, see Introduction to APIs. Custom instrumentation or API If your goal is custom instrumentation, consider using the configuration file method, which allows you to add functions and class methods to the config file that will be auto-instrumented by the agent. The benefit of the config-file method is that it does not require you to change your application code. However, the Python agent API is much more powerful and is best for setting up more complex and tailored instrumentation. To ensure you have access to the full API functionality, update to the latest Python agent. Monitor transactions and segments The Python agent is compatible with most of the common WSGI web frameworks. If the agent supports your framework, web requests automatically will be captured as transactions and displayed in the New Relic One UI. A transaction can also have function-level segments that are captured as part of a transaction trace. Use these methods to monitor web transactions, non-web transactions, and transaction segments: If you want to... Do this... Monitor WSGI web transactions The Python agent automatically captures web transactions for supported frameworks. If you do not have a supported framework, you can use the wsgi_application function to monitor your WSGI entry point. Monitor non-web transactions The Python agent classifies non-web transactions as background tasks. To capture non-web transactions, use background_task. Capture more details about a transaction If your transaction traces do not have the level of detail you want: Use function_trace to capture more function-level detail in transactions. Use datastore_trace to capture more detail about datastore calls. Ignore a transaction Use any of these options: To ignore a transaction altogether, use ignore_transaction. To prevent a transaction from producing a transaction trace, use suppress_transaction_trace. To end a transaction before the agent would end it automatically, use end_of_transaction. Add and edit transaction metadata Sometimes the code you target is visible in our UI, but some details of the method are not useful. For example: The default name is not helpful, or it is causing a metric grouping issue. You want to add custom attributes to your transactions so you can filter them when querying. Use these calls when you want to change the metadata of an existing transaction: If you want to... Do this... Get reference to current transaction To return an object representing the current transaction, use current_transaction. This is required by some other Python agent API calls. Change the name of a transaction Use set_transaction_name. Add metadata (such as a customer's subscription level) to transactions Add custom attributes to your transactions using add_custom_parameter, or use other API calls to report custom data. Mark a transaction as a background job To convert a web transaction into a background task so that it appears as a non-web transaction in the UI, use set_background_task. Prevent a transaction from affecting your Apdex score Use suppress_apdex_metric. See related logs To see logs directly within the context of your application's errors and traces, use the get_linking_metadata API call to annotate your logs. For more information about correlating log data with other telemetry data, see our logs in context documentation. Report custom events and custom metric data The agent reports data in two primary forms: Metric data measures numeric, time-based values; for example, connections per minute. Event data captures discrete event information. Events have key-value attributes attached to them. You can analyze and query event data. Use these methods to create new event data and new metric data: If you want to... Do this... Send data about an event for use when querying your data. Use record_custom_event. Report time-based metrics on application performance To report a single metric, use record_custom_metric. To report a set of metrics, use record_custom_metrics. Report an exception as an error By default, the Python agent only reports unhandled exceptions. To report a Python exception as an error, use notice_error. Report query string parameters For security reasons, query string parameters associated with web transactions are disabled by default. Use capture_request_params to enable them. Tag events with metadata To add attributes to events for more detailed analysis in Insights or error analytics, use add_custom_parameter. Generate metrics from data sources and data factories To generate metrics with a pull-style API rather than the push-style API implemented by record_custom_metric(), use these API calls: register_data_source data_source_generator data_source_factory Message-related calls These API calls allow you to collect performance data on your message-passing architecture or service; for example, RabbitMQ.
