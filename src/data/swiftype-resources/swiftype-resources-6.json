If you don't have one already, start by creating a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Operating systems The Ruby agent supports UNIX-like operating systems such as Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and macOS. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported.

Capability Integration Browser monitoring The Ruby agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see the browser and Ruby agent documentation. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in infrastructure monitoring. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from Synthetics monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

      "body": "Caution Developer mode is deprecated and no longer supported as of Ruby agent version 4.1.0. The New Relic Ruby agent includes Developer mode, a built-in UI for examining details about web transactions in your application. With Developer mode, you can examine the library and database calls made by the controller actions as they are invoked on the Rails instance. The free Developer mode gives you some of the same in-depth transaction visibility you get with New Relic's transaction traces feature. However, it works only in a single Rails instance, and it has much higher overhead than the production version. It is not recommended for use beyond a developer's desktop sandbox. Security considerations The Ruby agent's Developer mode, which is on by default when the RAILS_ENV == \"development\", does not communicate with the New Relic collector in any way. Pie charts are rendered using Google Charts, which involves an HTTP post of aggregate data. Tip The Ruby agent's Production mode, which is on by default when the RAILS_ENV == \"production\" and RAILS_ENV == \"staging\", does communicate with the New Relic site. For more information, see Security. Installation To install Developer mode, install Ruby agent as a plugin or gem. You may also need to set developer_mode to true in your newrelic.yml for the RAILS_ENV in which you are working. Developer mode is on by default only when RAILS_ENV = development. While a newrelic.yml file will be created as part of the installation, it is not necessary to have a valid license key. Known issues Known issues with Developer mode include: Requires Rails 2.3 or higher Developer mode in recent agents only works on Rails 2.3 or higher. It is rack based, and earlier versions of the framework did not incorporate rack. The developer edition installs a middleware in your app that responds to any URL prepended with /newrelic; for example, /newrelic, /newrelic/files/images/foo.png, etc. In some cases the /newrelic URL gets captured by an earlier middleware. In this situation, disable the Developer mode route and include the middleware yourself: At the beginning of the file, in config.ru: require 'newrelic_rpm' require 'new_relic/rack/developer_mode' use NewRelic::Rack::DeveloperMode Copy Incompatible with Pow Developer mode is not supported from Pow, a zero-config Rack server for Mac OS X. Using Developer mode If you run your application on your desktop using thin, WEBrick, or something similar, open the URL /newrelic on your server to see the Developer mode user interface. Caution If you are using Passenger, Unicorn, or other forking application servers on your desktop, you may notice some odd behavior with disappearing data if your application server launches multiple instances. Refer to the Troubleshooting tips, which follow. Developer Mode Breakdown Chart Troubleshooting Troubleshooting tips for Developer mode: Disappearing requests If you have this problem with Unicorn or other multi-worker dispatchers, try limiting the number of workers to 1. Undefined method path for Rack::Request Some users may see an undefined method path for #<Rack::Request>. If you are using Rails version 2.3.2, then you are mostly likely running into a problem with the way the Rack dependency was defined in the Rails package. Either upgrade to 2.3.3 (or higher), or define Rack version 1.0.1 as a dependency in your Gemfile. ActiveRecord reloads Developer mode reloads ActiveRecord method definitions for every reload and reports the time spent defining the methods (such as define_attribute_method). This does not happen in production. To get real results to compare, add the following to the development environment: config.cache_classes = true Copy",

      "body": "New Relic offers several tools to help obtain the information needed to provide useful metrics about your Node.js application. These include: Reading the route names (if used) from the Express and Restify routers Using the API to name the current request, either with simple names or groups of controllers with actions Support rules that are stored in your agent's configuration that can mark requests to be renamed or ignored based on regular expressions matched against the request's raw URLs (also available as API calls) The number of names that New Relic tracks needs to be small enough so that the user experience is robust. It also needs to be large enough to provide the right amount of information (without overwhelming you with data) so that you can identify problem spots in your applications more easily. For more information, see the Node.js agent configuration documentation and the Node.js agent API documentation on Github. Request names The Node.js agent captures the HTTP method along with a potentially parameterized path (such as /user/:id) or a regular expression (such as /^/user/([-0-9a-f]+)$/). These pieces of information become part of the request name. If you have support for slow transaction traces and have enabled capture_params in your config file, the transaction trace will also have the request's parameters and their values attached to it. If you are dissatisfied with the request names that the Node.js agent uses, you can use API calls to create more descriptive names. Tip If grouping your requests under the generic name, then /* is sufficient, and you do not need to customize your configuration file or API calls. Requirements New Relic uses request names to group requests for many charts and tables. The value of these visualizations will drop as the number of different request names increases. For example, do not include potentially dynamic data like GUIDs, numerical IDs, or timestamps in the request names you create. If your request is slow enough to generate a transaction trace, that trace will contain the original URL. If you enable parameter capture, the parameters will also be attached to the trace. Tip Avoid having more than 50 different transaction names. For example, if you have more than a couple hundred different request names, rethink your naming strategy. Avoid metric grouping issues The request naming API helps New Relic avoid problems with trying to handle too many metrics, which sometimes is referred to as \"metric explosion.\" New Relic has several strategies to deal with these issues; the most severe is simply to add offending applications to your deny list. The main reason for you to be careful in using these request-naming tools is to prevent that from happening to your applications. For more information, see Metric grouping issues. Guidelines Define your configuration rules from the most specific to the most general. The first rules listed in your config file or added with the Node.js transaction naming API will be applied first and should be narrowly targeted. More general \"fall-through\" rules should be added toward the end of the list, because they will be evaluated in the order they were configured or added using the Node.js transaction naming API. URL pattern matching An online retailer has a URL pattern like this: /user/customers/all/prospects /user/customers/all/current /user/customers/all/returning /user/customers/John /user/customers/Jane Copy The retailer could create rules like this: // newrelic.js exports.config={ //other configuration rules:{ name:[ { pattern: \"/user/customers/all/prospects/\", name: \"/user/customers/all/prospects\" }, { pattern: \"/user/customers/all/.*\", name: \"/user/customers/all\" }, { pattern: \"/user/customers/.*\", name: \"/user/customers/:customer\" } ] } } Copy With these rules, the retailer would create three transaction names: /user/customers/:customer /user/customers/all /user/customers/all/prospects If the retailer reversed the order, the rules would catch all transactions in :customer, which would not be as useful. Load the request naming API Make sure that loading the New Relic module is the first thing your application does, as it needs to bootstrap itself before the rest of your application loads: var newrelic = require('newrelic'); Copy This returns the request naming API. You can safely require the module from multiple modules in your application, as it only initializes itself once. Request API calls Here is a summary of the Request API calls for New Relic's Node.js agent. newrelic.setTransactionName(name) newrelic.setTransactionName(name) Copy Name the current request, following the request naming requirements. You can call this function anywhere within the context of an HTTP request handler, at any time after handling of the request has started, but before the request has finished. In general, if the request and response objects are in scope, you can set the name. Explicitly calling newrelic.setTransactionName() will override any names set by Express or Restify routes. Also, calls to newrelic.setTransactionName() and newrelic.setControllerName() will overwrite each other. The last one to run before the request ends wins. newrelic.setControllerName(name, \\[action]) newrelic.setControllerName(name, \\[action]) Copy Name the current request using a controller-style pattern, optionally including the current controller action. If the action is omitted, New Relic will include the HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.) as the action. The rules for when you can call newrelic.setControllerName() are the same as they are for newrelic.setTransactionName(), including the request naming requirements. Explicitly calling newrelic.setControllerName() will override any names set by Express or Restify routes. Also, calls to newrelic.setTransactionName() and newrelic.setControllerName() will overwrite each other. The last one to run before the request ends wins. Custom instrumentation API calls Use these API calls to expand your instrumentation with custom instrumentation. newrelic.instrument(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) newrelic.instrument(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) Copy Sets an instrumentation callback for a specific module. The provided onRequire callback will be fired when the given module is loaded with require. The moduleName parameter should be the string that will be passed to require; for example, 'express' or 'amqplib/callback_api'. The optional onError callback is called if the onRequire parameters throws an error. This is useful for debugging your instrumentation. Use this method to: Add instrumentation for modules not currently instrumented by New Relic. Instrument your own code. Replace the Node.js agent's built-in instrumentation with your own. For more information, see New Relic's Node.js instrumentation tutorial on Github. newrelic.instrumentDatastore(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) newrelic.instrumentDatastore(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) Copy Sets an instrumentation callback for a datastore module. This method is just like newrelic.instrument(), except it provides a datastore-specialized shim. For more information, see New Relic's Node.js datastore instrumentation tutorial on Github. newrelic.instrumentLoadedModule(moduleName, moduleInstance) newrelic.instrumentLoadedModule(moduleName, moduleInstance) Copy The instrumentLoadedModule method allows you to add stock instrumentation to specific modules in situations where it's impossible to have require('newrelic'); as the first line of your app's main module. // load the agent const newrelic = require('newrelic') // module loaded before newrelic const expressModule = require('express') // instrument express _after_ the agent has been loaded newrelic.instrumentLoadedModule( 'express', // the module's name, as a string expressModule // the module instance ); Copy Important This method cannot instrument any arbitrary module. Its purpose is to add modules that were missed because the agent was not loaded as the first thing in your program. The instrumentLoadedModule method can only instrument modules the agent would normally instrument. You can see a list of these modules in the agent's lib/instrumentations module. newrelic.instrumentMessages(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) newrelic.instrumentMessages(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) Copy Sets an instrumentation callback for a message service client module. This method is just like newrelic.instrument(), except it provides a message-service-specialized shim. For more information, see New Relic's Node.js message service instrumentation tutorial on Github. newrelic.instrumentWebframework(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) newrelic.instrumentWebframework(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) Copy Sets an instrumentation callback for a web framework module. This method is just like newrelic.instrument(), except it provides a web-framework-specialized shim. For more information, see New Relic's Node.js web framework instrumentation tutorial on Github. newrelic.startWebTransaction(url, handle) newrelic.startWebTransaction(url, handle) Copy Instrument the specified web transaction. Using this API call, you can instrument transactions that New Relic does not automatically detect. The url defines the transaction name and needs to be static. Do not include variable data such as user ID. The handle defines the function you want to instrument. New Relic will capture any metrics that would be captured by auto-instrumentation, as well as manual instrumentation via startSegment(). You must handle custom transactions manually by calling newrelic.getTransaction() at the start of your transaction, and then call transaction.end() when you are finished. New Relic begins timing the transaction when newrelic.startWebTransaction() is called and ends the transaction when transaction.end() is called. You can also return a promise to indicate the end of the transaction. Please note that if this promise rejects, it does not automatically hook into New Relic’s error tracking. This needs to be done manually with noticeError(). newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction(name, \\[group], handle) newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction(name, \\[group], handle) Copy Instrument the specified background transaction. Using this API call, you can expand New Relic's instrumentation to capture data from background transactions. The name defines the transaction name and needs to be static. Do not include variable data such as user ID. The group is optional, and it allows you to group similar jobs together via the transaction type in the user interface. Like name, the group needs to be static. The handle defines a function that includes the entire background job you want to instrument. New Relic will capture any metrics that would be captured by auto-instrumentation, as well as manual instrumentation via startSegment(). You must handle custom transactions manually by calling newrelic.getTransaction() at the start of your transaction, and then call transaction.end() when you are finished. New Relic begins timing the transaction when newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction() is called and ends the transaction when transaction.end() is called. You can also return a promise to indicate the end of the transaction. Please note that if this promise rejects, it does not automatically hook into New Relic’s error tracking. This needs to be done manually with noticeError(). newrelic.getTransaction() newrelic.getTransaction() Copy Returns a handle on the currently executing transaction. This handle can then be used to interact with a given transaction safely from any context. It is best used with newrelic.startWebTransaction() and newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction(). Please refer to the transaction handle section for more details. newrelic.endTransaction() newrelic.endTransaction() Copy End the current web or background custom transaction. This method requires being in the correct transaction context when called. This API call takes no arguments. newrelic.startSegment(name, record, handler, callback) newrelic.startSegment(name, record, handler, callback) Copy Instrument a particular method to improve visibility into a transaction, or optionally turn it into a metric. The name defines a name for the segment. This name will be visible in transaction traces and as a new metric in the New Relic UI. The record flag defines whether the segment should be recorded as a metric. The handler is the function you want to track as a segment. The optional callback is a function passed to the handler to fire after its work is done. The agent begins timing the segment when startSegment is called. The segment is ended when either the handler finishes executing, or callback is fired, if it is provided. Custom metrics API calls Use these API calls to record additional arbitrary metrics: newrelic.recordMetric(name, value) newrelic.recordMetric(name, value) Copy Use recordMetric to record an event-based metric, usually associated with a particular duration. The name must be a string following standard metric naming rules. The value will usually be a number, but it can also be an object. When value is a numeric value, it should represent the magnitude of a measurement associated with an event; for example, the duration for a particular method call. When value is an object, it must contain count, total, min, max, and sumOfSquares keys, all with number values. This form is useful to aggregate metrics on your own and report them periodically; for example, from a setInterval. These values will be aggregated with any previously collected values for the same metric. The names of these keys match the names of the keys used by the platform API. newrelic.incrementMetric(name, \\[amount]) newrelic.incrementMetric(name, \\[amount]) Copy Use incrementMetric to update a metric that acts as a simple counter. The count of the selected metric will be incremented by the specified amount, defaulting to 1. Custom events API calls Use these API calls to record additional events: newrelic.recordCustomEvent(eventType, attributes) newrelic.recordCustomEvent(eventType, attributes) Copy Use recordCustomEvent to record an event-based metric, usually associated with a particular duration. The eventType must be an alphanumeric string less than 255 characters. The attributes must be an object of key and value pairs. The keys must be shorter than 255 characters, and the values must be string, number, or boolean. Recording a custom event The following example demonstrates recording a custom event with multiple attributes. const attributes = { attribute1: 'value1', attribute2: 2 } newrelic.recordCustomEvent('MessagingEvent', attributes) Copy Transaction handle methods This section details the methods provided by the TransactionHandle class instance that can be obtained through newrelic.getTransaction(). Use these methods to interact directly with the current transaction: transactionHandle.end(\\[callback]) transactionHandle.end(\\[callback]) Copy Use transactionHandle.end to end the transaction referenced by the handle instance. The callback is invoked when the transaction has fully ended. The finished transaction passed to the callback as the first argument. transactionHandle.ignore() transactionHandle.ignore() Copy Use transactionHandle.ignore to ignore the transaction referenced by the handle instance. transactionHandle.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(headers) transactionHandle.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(headers) Copy Important This API requires distributed tracing to be enabled. For context on how to use this call and its partner call acceptDistributedTraceHeaders, first read Enable distributed tracing with agent APIs. transactionHandle.insertDistributedTraceHeaders is used to implement distributed tracing. It modifies the headers map that is passed in by adding W3C Trace Context headers and New Relic Distributed Trace headers. The New Relic headers can be disabled with distributed_tracing.exclude_newrelic_header: true in the config. This method replaces the deprecated createDistributedTracePayload method, which only creates New Relic Distributed Trace payloads. Generating distributed trace headers In the following example, by calling insertDistributedTraceHeaders with an empty object, the appropriate Distributed Trace headers and W3C Trace Context headers will be generated for the transaction. // Call newrelic.getTransaction to retrieve a handle on the current transaction. const transactionHandle = newrelic.getTransaction() // This could be a header object from an incoming request as well const headersObject = {} newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction('background task', function executeTransaction() { const transaction = newrelic.getTransaction() // generate the headers transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(headersObject) }) Copy transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(transportType, headers) transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(transportType, headers) Copy Important This API requires distributed tracing to be enabled. For context on how to use this call and its partner call insertDistributedTraceHeaders, first read Enable distributed tracing with agent APIs. transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders is used to instrument the called service for inclusion in a distributed trace. It links the spans in a trace by accepting a payload generated by insertDistributedTraceHeaders or generated by some other W3C Trace Context compliant tracer. This method accepts the headers of an incoming request, looks for W3C Trace Context headers, and if not found, falls back to New Relic distributed trace headers. This method replaces the deprecated (and now removed as of version 7.0.0) acceptDistributedTracePayload method, which only handles New Relic distributed trace payloads. transportType should be one of the following strings: AMQP HTTP HTTPS IronMQ JMS Kafka Other Queue Unknown headers should be an object containing all the headers in the incoming request. The keys must be lowercase. Accept incoming distributed trace headers The following example demonstrates adding distributed trace headers retrieved from a Kafka message. In this example, we assume that the incoming Kafka message has Distributed Trace headers inserted. // incoming Kafka message headers const headersObject = message.headers // Call newrelic.getTransaction to retrieve a handle on the current transaction. const transactionHandle = newrelic.getTransaction() newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction('background task', function executeTransaction() { const transaction = newrelic.getTransaction() // accept the headers transaction.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders('Kafka', headersObject) }) Copy transactionHandle.createDistributedTracePayload() transactionHandle.createDistributedTracePayload() Copy Caution This method is deprecated and was removed in version 7.0.0! Please use insertDistributedTraceHeaders. Important This API requires distributed tracing to be enabled. For instructions on how to use this call, along with its partner call acceptDistributedTracePayload, see Enable distributed tracing with agent APIs. This call is used to implement distributed tracing. It generates a payload that is read by the receiving application with acceptDistributedTracePayload. Important Note: In order to maintain proper ordering of spans in a trace, you must generate the payload in the context of the span that sends it. The DistributedTracePayload object has two available methods used for generating the payload in different formats: DistributedTracePayload#text: returns a JSON representation of the payload. Link a nested background transaction // Call newrelic.getTransaction to retrieve a handle on the current transaction. var transactionHandle = newrelic.getTransaction() var payload = transactionHandle.createDistributedTracePayload() var jsonPayload = payload.text() newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction('background task', function executeTransaction() { var backgroundHandle = newrelic.getTransaction() // Link the nested transaction by accepting the payload with the background transaction's handle backgroundHandle.acceptDistributedTracePayload(jsonPayload) }) Copy DistributedTracePayload#httpSafe: returns a base64 encoded JSON representation of the payload. Place payload on an outgoing request // Call newrelic.getTransaction to retrieve a handle on the current transaction. var transactionHandle = newrelic.getTransaction() var payload = transactionHandle.createDistributedTracePayload() // Place the base64 encoded value on an outbound request header. req.headers[myTracingHeader] = payload.httpSafe() Copy transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTracePayload(payload) transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTracePayload(payload) Copy Caution This method is deprecated and was removed in version 7.0.0! Please use acceptDistributedTraceHeaders. Important This API requires distributed tracing to be enabled. For context on how to use this call and its partner call createDistributedTracePayload, first read Enable distributed tracing with agent APIs. transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTracePayload is used to instrument the called service for inclusion in a distributed trace. It links the spans in a trace by accepting the payload generated by createDistributedTracePayload. transactionHandle.isSampled() transactionHandle.isSampled() Copy Returns whether this trace is being sampled. Other API calls New Relic's Node.js agent includes additional API calls. newrelic.addCustomAttribute(name, value) newrelic.addCustomAttribute(name, value) Copy Set a custom attribute value to be displayed along with the transaction trace in the New Relic UI. This must be called within the context of a transaction so it has a place to set the custom attributes. Custom attributes will appear in APM's transaction trace detail view and in errors for the transaction. Add custom attribute newrelic.addCustomAttribute('attribute1', 'value1') Copy Caution If you want to use your custom attributes, avoid using any of the reserved terms used by NRQL when naming them. newrelic.addCustomAttributes(attributes) newrelic.addCustomAttributes(attributes) Copy Set multiple custom attribute values to be displayed along with the transaction trace in the New Relic UI. The attributes should be passed as a single object. This must be called within the context of a transaction so it has a place to set the custom attributes. Custom attributes will appear in the transaction trace detail view and in errors for the transaction. Adding custom attributes const attributes = { attribute1: 'value1', attribute2: 2 } newrelic.addCustomAttributes(attributes) Copy Caution If you want to use your custom attributes, avoid using any of the reserved terms used by NRQL when naming them. newrelic.addCustomSpanAttribute(name, value) newrelic.addCustomSpanAttribute(name, value) Copy Set a custom span attribute value to be displayed along with a transaction trace span in the New Relic UI. This must be called within the context of an active segment/span so it has a place to set the custom span attributes. Custom span attributes will appear in the Attributes section of the span detail view. Add custom span attribute newrelic.addCustomSpanAttribute('attribute1', 'value') Copy Important This API requires distributed tracing and span events to be enabled. Caution If you want to use your custom span attributes, avoid using any of the reserved terms used by NRQL when naming them. newrelic.addCustomSpanAttributes(attributes) newrelic.addCustomSpanAttributes(attributes) Copy Set multiple custom span attribute values to be displayed along with the transaction trace spans in the New Relic UI. The attributes should be passed as a single object. This must be called within the context of an active segment/span so it has a place to set the custom span attributes. Custom span attributes will appear in the Attributes section of the span detail view. Add custom span attributes const attributes = { attribute1: 'value1', attribute2: 'value2' } newrelic.addCustomSpanAttributes(attributes) Copy Important This API requires distributed tracing and span events to be enabled. Caution If you want to use your custom span attributes, avoid using any of the reserved terms used by NRQL when naming them. newrelic.getBrowserTimingHeader() newrelic.getBrowserTimingHeader() Copy Returns the HTML snippet to be inserted into the header of HTML pages to enable browser monitoring. The HTML will instruct the browser to fetch a small JavaScript file and start the page timer. newrelic.setIgnoreTransaction(ignored) newrelic.setIgnoreTransaction(ignored) Copy Tell the module whether or not to ignore a given request. This allows you to explicitly filter long-polling, irrelevant routes or requests you know will be time-consuming. This also allows you to gather metrics for requests that otherwise would be ignored. To ignore the transaction, set the parameter to true will ignore the transaction. To prevent a transaction from being ignored with this function, pass the parameter false. Passing null or undefined will not change whether the transaction is ignored. Caution This method is deprecated and was removed in version 7.0.0. Please use transactionHandle.ignore() newrelic.noticeError(error, \\[customParameters]) newrelic.noticeError(error, \\[customParameters]) Copy Use this call if your app is doing its own error handling with domains or try/catch clauses, but you want all of the information about how many errors are coming out of the app to be centrally managed. Unlike other Node.js calls, this can be used outside of route handlers, but it will have additional context if called from within transaction scope. Caution Errors recorded using this method do not obey the ignore_status_codes configuration value. newrelic.shutdown(\\[options], callback) newrelic.shutdown(\\[options], callback) Copy Use this method to gracefully shut down the agent. options options.collectPendingData - type boolean - Tell the agent whether to send any pending data to the New Relic collector before shutting down. options.timeout - type number (ms) - The default time before forcing a shutdown. When collectPendingData is true, the agent will wait for a connection before shutting down. This timeout is useful for short lived processes, like AWS Lambda, in order to keep the process from staying open too long, while trying to connect. Example: newrelic.shutdown({collectPendingData: true, timeout: 3000}, (error) => { process.exit() }) Copy newrelic.getLinkingMetadata() newrelic.getLinkingMetadata() Copy Returns key/value pairs which can be used to link traces or entities. It will only contain items with meaningful values. For instance, if distributed tracing is disabled, trace.id will not be included. newrelic.getTraceMetadata() newrelic.getTraceMetadata() Copy Returns and object containing the current trace ID and span ID. Important This API requires distributed tracing to be enabled or an empty object will be returned. Rules for naming and ignoring requests If you do not want to put calls to the New Relic module directly into your application code, you can use pattern-based rules to name requests. There are two sets of rules: one for renaming requests, and one to mark requests to be ignored by New Relic's instrumentation. Here is the structure for rules in New Relic's Node.js agent. rules.name A list of rules of the format {pattern : \"pattern\", name : \"name\"} for matching incoming request URLs to pattern and naming the matching New Relic transaction's name. This acts as a regex replace, where you can set the pattern either as a string, or as a JavaScript regular expression literal, and both pattern and name are required. When passing a regex as a string, escape backslashes, as the agent does not keep them when given as a string in a pattern. Define your configuration rules from the most specific to the most general, as the patterns will be evaluated in order and are terminal in nature. For more information, see the naming guidelines. This can also be set with the environment variable NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES, with multiple rules passed in as a list of comma-delimited JSON object literals: NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES='{\"pattern\":\"^t\",\"name\":\"u\"},{\"pattern\":\"^u\",\"name\":\"t\"}' Copy Optional rules attributes [#optional-rules] Additional optional attributes are available: Optional rules attributes Description terminate_chain Default: true When set to true (default), no further rules will be evaluated if this rule is a match. Setting this to false is useful when multiple rules should be used together. For example, one rule could be replacing a common pattern in many different URLs, while subsequent rule(s) would be more specific. replace_all Default: false When set to true, all matches of the pattern will be replaced. Otherwise, only the first match will be replaced. Using the g flag with regular expression literal will have the same effect. For example: pattern: '[0-9]+', replace_all: true Copy This has the same effect as pattern: /[0-9]+/g. precedence By default the rules are evaluated in order, from first to last. If you prefer to have complete control over the order, you can give each rule a precedence attribute. The precedence is an integer number, and rules are evaluated in ascending order. If precedence is not explicitly defined, it will be set to 500 by default. Additional attributes are ignored. Testing your naming rules [#testing-rules] The Node.js agent comes with a command-line tool for testing naming rules. For more information, run the following command in terminal window in a directory where your app is installed: node node_modules/.bin/newrelic-naming-rules Copy Naming rule examples [#examples-rules] Here are some examples of naming rules and the results. Match full URL pattern: \"^/items/[0-9]+$\", name: \"/items/:id\" Copy will result in: /items/123 => /items/:id /orders/123 => /orders/123 (not replaced since the rule is a full match) Copy Replace first match in URL pattern: \"[0-9]+\", name: \":id\" Copy will result in: /orders/123 => /orders/:id /items/123 => /items/:id /orders/123/items/123 => /orders/:id/items/123 Copy Replace all matches in any URL pattern: \"[0-9]+\", name: \":id\", replace_all: true Copy will result in: /orders/123/items/123 => /orders/:id/items/:id Copy Match group references Using regular expression match group references: pattern: '^/(items|orders)/[0-9]+$', name: '/\\\\1/:id' Copy will result in: /orders/123 => /orders/:id /items/123 => /items/:id Copy rules.ignore This can also be set via the environment variable NEW_RELIC_IGNORING_RULES, with multiple rules passed in as a list of comma-delimited patterns. Currently there is no way to escape commas in patterns. NEW_RELIC_IGNORING_RULES='^/socket\\.io/\\*/xhr-polling,ignore_me' Copy Here are full examples of how rules are included in the configuration file: Naming rule example // newrelic.js exports.config = { // other configuration rules : { name : [ { pattern: \"/tables/name-here\", name: \"/name-hererule1\" } ] } Copy Ignoring rule example If you are using socket.io, you will have a use case for ignoring rules right out of the box. To keep socket.io long-polling from dominating your response-time metrics and affecting the Apdex metrics for your application, add a rule such as: // newrelic.js exports.config = { // other configuration rules : { ignore : [ '^\\/socket\\.io\\/.*\\/xhr-polling' ] } }; Copy API calls for rules Here are the API calls for naming and ignoring rules with New Relic's Node.js agent. newrelic.addNamingRule(pattern, name) Programmatic version of rules.name. Once naming rules are added, they cannot be removed until the Node process is restarted. They can also be added via the Node.js agent's configuration. Both parameters are required. newrelic.addIgnoringRule(pattern) Programmatic version of rules.ignore. Once ignoring rules are added, they cannot be removed until the Node process is restarted. They can also be added via the Node.js agent's configuration. This parameter is required.",

      "body": "Caution Developer mode is deprecated and no longer supported as of Ruby agent version 4.1.0. The New Relic Ruby agent includes Developer mode, a built-in UI for examining details about web transactions in your application. With Developer mode, you can examine the library and database calls made by the controller actions as they are invoked on the Rails instance. The free Developer mode gives you some of the same in-depth transaction visibility you get with New Relic's transaction traces feature. However, it works only in a single Rails instance, and it has much higher overhead than the production version. It is not recommended for use beyond a developer's desktop sandbox. Security considerations The Ruby agent's Developer mode, which is on by default when the RAILS_ENV == \"development\", does not communicate with the New Relic collector in any way. Pie charts are rendered using Google Charts, which involves an HTTP post of aggregate data. Tip The Ruby agent's Production mode, which is on by default when the RAILS_ENV == \"production\" and RAILS_ENV == \"staging\", does communicate with the New Relic site. For more information, see Security. Installation To install Developer mode, install Ruby agent as a plugin or gem. You may also need to set developer_mode to true in your newrelic.yml for the RAILS_ENV in which you are working. Developer mode is on by default only when RAILS_ENV = development. While a newrelic.yml file will be created as part of the installation, it is not necessary to have a valid license key. Known issues Known issues with Developer mode include: Requires Rails 2.3 or higher Developer mode in recent agents only works on Rails 2.3 or higher. It is rack based, and earlier versions of the framework did not incorporate rack. The developer edition installs a middleware in your app that responds to any URL prepended with /newrelic; for example, /newrelic, /newrelic/files/images/foo.png, etc. In some cases the /newrelic URL gets captured by an earlier middleware. In this situation, disable the Developer mode route and include the middleware yourself: At the beginning of the file, in config.ru: require 'newrelic_rpm' require 'new_relic/rack/developer_mode' use NewRelic::Rack::DeveloperMode Copy Incompatible with Pow Developer mode is not supported from Pow, a zero-config Rack server for Mac OS X. Using Developer mode If you run your application on your desktop using thin, WEBrick, or something similar, open the URL /newrelic on your server to see the Developer mode user interface. Caution If you are using Passenger, Unicorn, or other forking application servers on your desktop, you may notice some odd behavior with disappearing data if your application server launches multiple instances. Refer to the Troubleshooting tips, which follow. Developer Mode Breakdown Chart Troubleshooting Troubleshooting tips for Developer mode: Disappearing requests If you have this problem with Unicorn or other multi-worker dispatchers, try limiting the number of workers to 1. Undefined method path for Rack::Request Some users may see an undefined method path for #<Rack::Request>. If you are using Rails version 2.3.2, then you are mostly likely running into a problem with the way the Rack dependency was defined in the Rails package. Either upgrade to 2.3.3 (or higher), or define Rack version 1.0.1 as a dependency in your Gemfile. ActiveRecord reloads Developer mode reloads ActiveRecord method definitions for every reload and reports the time spent defining the methods (such as define_attribute_method). This does not happen in production. To get real results to compare, add the following to the development environment: config.cache_classes = true Copy",

      "body": "New Relic offers several tools to help obtain the information needed to provide useful metrics about your Node.js application. These include: Reading the route names (if used) from the Express and Restify routers Using the API to name the current request, either with simple names or groups of controllers with actions Support rules that are stored in your agent's configuration that can mark requests to be renamed or ignored based on regular expressions matched against the request's raw URLs (also available as API calls) The number of names that New Relic tracks needs to be small enough so that the user experience is robust. It also needs to be large enough to provide the right amount of information (without overwhelming you with data) so that you can identify problem spots in your applications more easily. For more information, see the Node.js agent configuration documentation and the Node.js agent API documentation on Github. Request names The Node.js agent captures the HTTP method along with a potentially parameterized path (such as /user/:id) or a regular expression (such as /^/user/([-0-9a-f]+)$/). These pieces of information become part of the request name. If you have support for slow transaction traces and have enabled capture_params in your config file, the transaction trace will also have the request's parameters and their values attached to it. If you are dissatisfied with the request names that the Node.js agent uses, you can use API calls to create more descriptive names. Tip If grouping your requests under the generic name, then /* is sufficient, and you do not need to customize your configuration file or API calls. Requirements New Relic uses request names to group requests for many charts and tables. The value of these visualizations will drop as the number of different request names increases. For example, do not include potentially dynamic data like GUIDs, numerical IDs, or timestamps in the request names you create. If your request is slow enough to generate a transaction trace, that trace will contain the original URL. If you enable parameter capture, the parameters will also be attached to the trace. Tip Avoid having more than 50 different transaction names. For example, if you have more than a couple hundred different request names, rethink your naming strategy. Avoid metric grouping issues The request naming API helps New Relic avoid problems with trying to handle too many metrics, which sometimes is referred to as \"metric explosion.\" New Relic has several strategies to deal with these issues; the most severe is simply to add offending applications to your deny list. The main reason for you to be careful in using these request-naming tools is to prevent that from happening to your applications. For more information, see Metric grouping issues. Guidelines Define your configuration rules from the most specific to the most general. The first rules listed in your config file or added with the Node.js transaction naming API will be applied first and should be narrowly targeted. More general \"fall-through\" rules should be added toward the end of the list, because they will be evaluated in the order they were configured or added using the Node.js transaction naming API. URL pattern matching An online retailer has a URL pattern like this: /user/customers/all/prospects /user/customers/all/current /user/customers/all/returning /user/customers/John /user/customers/Jane Copy The retailer could create rules like this: // newrelic.js exports.config={ //other configuration rules:{ name:[ { pattern: \"/user/customers/all/prospects/\", name: \"/user/customers/all/prospects\" }, { pattern: \"/user/customers/all/.*\", name: \"/user/customers/all\" }, { pattern: \"/user/customers/.*\", name: \"/user/customers/:customer\" } ] } } Copy With these rules, the retailer would create three transaction names: /user/customers/:customer /user/customers/all /user/customers/all/prospects If the retailer reversed the order, the rules would catch all transactions in :customer, which would not be as useful. Load the request naming API Make sure that loading the New Relic module is the first thing your application does, as it needs to bootstrap itself before the rest of your application loads: var newrelic = require('newrelic'); Copy This returns the request naming API. You can safely require the module from multiple modules in your application, as it only initializes itself once. Request API calls Here is a summary of the Request API calls for New Relic's Node.js agent. newrelic.setTransactionName(name) newrelic.setTransactionName(name) Copy Name the current request, following the request naming requirements. You can call this function anywhere within the context of an HTTP request handler, at any time after handling of the request has started, but before the request has finished. In general, if the request and response objects are in scope, you can set the name. Explicitly calling newrelic.setTransactionName() will override any names set by Express or Restify routes. Also, calls to newrelic.setTransactionName() and newrelic.setControllerName() will overwrite each other. The last one to run before the request ends wins. newrelic.setControllerName(name, \\[action]) newrelic.setControllerName(name, \\[action]) Copy Name the current request using a controller-style pattern, optionally including the current controller action. If the action is omitted, New Relic will include the HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.) as the action. The rules for when you can call newrelic.setControllerName() are the same as they are for newrelic.setTransactionName(), including the request naming requirements. Explicitly calling newrelic.setControllerName() will override any names set by Express or Restify routes. Also, calls to newrelic.setTransactionName() and newrelic.setControllerName() will overwrite each other. The last one to run before the request ends wins. Custom instrumentation API calls Use these API calls to expand your instrumentation with custom instrumentation. newrelic.instrument(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) newrelic.instrument(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) Copy Sets an instrumentation callback for a specific module. The provided onRequire callback will be fired when the given module is loaded with require. The moduleName parameter should be the string that will be passed to require; for example, 'express' or 'amqplib/callback_api'. The optional onError callback is called if the onRequire parameters throws an error. This is useful for debugging your instrumentation. Use this method to: Add instrumentation for modules not currently instrumented by New Relic. Instrument your own code. Replace the Node.js agent's built-in instrumentation with your own. For more information, see New Relic's Node.js instrumentation tutorial on Github. newrelic.instrumentDatastore(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) newrelic.instrumentDatastore(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) Copy Sets an instrumentation callback for a datastore module. This method is just like newrelic.instrument(), except it provides a datastore-specialized shim. For more information, see New Relic's Node.js datastore instrumentation tutorial on Github. newrelic.instrumentLoadedModule(moduleName, moduleInstance) newrelic.instrumentLoadedModule(moduleName, moduleInstance) Copy The instrumentLoadedModule method allows you to add stock instrumentation to specific modules in situations where it's impossible to have require('newrelic'); as the first line of your app's main module. // load the agent const newrelic = require('newrelic') // module loaded before newrelic const expressModule = require('express') // instrument express _after_ the agent has been loaded newrelic.instrumentLoadedModule( 'express', // the module's name, as a string expressModule // the module instance ); Copy Important This method cannot instrument any arbitrary module. Its purpose is to add modules that were missed because the agent was not loaded as the first thing in your program. The instrumentLoadedModule method can only instrument modules the agent would normally instrument. You can see a list of these modules in the agent's lib/instrumentations module. newrelic.instrumentMessages(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) newrelic.instrumentMessages(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) Copy Sets an instrumentation callback for a message service client module. This method is just like newrelic.instrument(), except it provides a message-service-specialized shim. For more information, see New Relic's Node.js message service instrumentation tutorial on Github. newrelic.instrumentWebframework(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) newrelic.instrumentWebframework(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) Copy Sets an instrumentation callback for a web framework module. This method is just like newrelic.instrument(), except it provides a web-framework-specialized shim. For more information, see New Relic's Node.js web framework instrumentation tutorial on Github. newrelic.startWebTransaction(url, handle) newrelic.startWebTransaction(url, handle) Copy Instrument the specified web transaction. Using this API call, you can instrument transactions that New Relic does not automatically detect. The url defines the transaction name and needs to be static. Do not include variable data such as user ID. The handle defines the function you want to instrument. New Relic will capture any metrics that would be captured by auto-instrumentation, as well as manual instrumentation via startSegment(). You must handle custom transactions manually by calling newrelic.getTransaction() at the start of your transaction, and then call transaction.end() when you are finished. New Relic begins timing the transaction when newrelic.startWebTransaction() is called and ends the transaction when transaction.end() is called. You can also return a promise to indicate the end of the transaction. Please note that if this promise rejects, it does not automatically hook into New Relic’s error tracking. This needs to be done manually with noticeError(). newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction(name, \\[group], handle) newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction(name, \\[group], handle) Copy Instrument the specified background transaction. Using this API call, you can expand New Relic's instrumentation to capture data from background transactions. The name defines the transaction name and needs to be static. Do not include variable data such as user ID. The group is optional, and it allows you to group similar jobs together via the transaction type in the user interface. Like name, the group needs to be static. The handle defines a function that includes the entire background job you want to instrument. New Relic will capture any metrics that would be captured by auto-instrumentation, as well as manual instrumentation via startSegment(). You must handle custom transactions manually by calling newrelic.getTransaction() at the start of your transaction, and then call transaction.end() when you are finished. New Relic begins timing the transaction when newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction() is called and ends the transaction when transaction.end() is called. You can also return a promise to indicate the end of the transaction. Please note that if this promise rejects, it does not automatically hook into New Relic’s error tracking. This needs to be done manually with noticeError(). newrelic.getTransaction() newrelic.getTransaction() Copy Returns a handle on the currently executing transaction. This handle can then be used to interact with a given transaction safely from any context. It is best used with newrelic.startWebTransaction() and newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction(). Please refer to the transaction handle section for more details. newrelic.endTransaction() newrelic.endTransaction() Copy End the current web or background custom transaction. This method requires being in the correct transaction context when called. This API call takes no arguments. newrelic.startSegment(name, record, handler, callback) newrelic.startSegment(name, record, handler, callback) Copy Instrument a particular method to improve visibility into a transaction, or optionally turn it into a metric. The name defines a name for the segment. This name will be visible in transaction traces and as a new metric in the New Relic UI. The record flag defines whether the segment should be recorded as a metric. The handler is the function you want to track as a segment. The optional callback is a function passed to the handler to fire after its work is done. The agent begins timing the segment when startSegment is called. The segment is ended when either the handler finishes executing, or callback is fired, if it is provided. Custom metrics API calls Use these API calls to record additional arbitrary metrics: newrelic.recordMetric(name, value) newrelic.recordMetric(name, value) Copy Use recordMetric to record an event-based metric, usually associated with a particular duration. The name must be a string following standard metric naming rules. The value will usually be a number, but it can also be an object. When value is a numeric value, it should represent the magnitude of a measurement associated with an event; for example, the duration for a particular method call. When value is an object, it must contain count, total, min, max, and sumOfSquares keys, all with number values. This form is useful to aggregate metrics on your own and report them periodically; for example, from a setInterval. These values will be aggregated with any previously collected values for the same metric. The names of these keys match the names of the keys used by the platform API. newrelic.incrementMetric(name, \\[amount]) newrelic.incrementMetric(name, \\[amount]) Copy Use incrementMetric to update a metric that acts as a simple counter. The count of the selected metric will be incremented by the specified amount, defaulting to 1. Custom events API calls Use these API calls to record additional events: newrelic.recordCustomEvent(eventType, attributes) newrelic.recordCustomEvent(eventType, attributes) Copy Use recordCustomEvent to record an event-based metric, usually associated with a particular duration. The eventType must be an alphanumeric string less than 255 characters. The attributes must be an object of key and value pairs. The keys must be shorter than 255 characters, and the values must be string, number, or boolean. Recording a custom event The following example demonstrates recording a custom event with multiple attributes. const attributes = { attribute1: 'value1', attribute2: 2 } newrelic.recordCustomEvent('MessagingEvent', attributes) Copy Transaction handle methods This section details the methods provided by the TransactionHandle class instance that can be obtained through newrelic.getTransaction(). Use these methods to interact directly with the current transaction: transactionHandle.end(\\[callback]) transactionHandle.end(\\[callback]) Copy Use transactionHandle.end to end the transaction referenced by the handle instance. The callback is invoked when the transaction has fully ended. The finished transaction passed to the callback as the first argument. transactionHandle.ignore() transactionHandle.ignore() Copy Use transactionHandle.ignore to ignore the transaction referenced by the handle instance. transactionHandle.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(headers) transactionHandle.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(headers) Copy Important This API requires distributed tracing to be enabled. For context on how to use this call and its partner call acceptDistributedTraceHeaders, first read Enable distributed tracing with agent APIs. transactionHandle.insertDistributedTraceHeaders is used to implement distributed tracing. It modifies the headers map that is passed in by adding W3C Trace Context headers and New Relic Distributed Trace headers. The New Relic headers can be disabled with distributed_tracing.exclude_newrelic_header: true in the config. This method replaces the deprecated createDistributedTracePayload method, which only creates New Relic Distributed Trace payloads. Generating distributed trace headers In the following example, by calling insertDistributedTraceHeaders with an empty object, the appropriate Distributed Trace headers and W3C Trace Context headers will be generated for the transaction. // Call newrelic.getTransaction to retrieve a handle on the current transaction. const transactionHandle = newrelic.getTransaction() // This could be a header object from an incoming request as well const headersObject = {} newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction('background task', function executeTransaction() { const transaction = newrelic.getTransaction() // generate the headers transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(headersObject) }) Copy transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(transportType, headers) transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(transportType, headers) Copy Important This API requires distributed tracing to be enabled. For context on how to use this call and its partner call insertDistributedTraceHeaders, first read Enable distributed tracing with agent APIs. transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders is used to instrument the called service for inclusion in a distributed trace. It links the spans in a trace by accepting a payload generated by insertDistributedTraceHeaders or generated by some other W3C Trace Context compliant tracer. This method accepts the headers of an incoming request, looks for W3C Trace Context headers, and if not found, falls back to New Relic distributed trace headers. This method replaces the deprecated (and now removed as of version 7.0.0) acceptDistributedTracePayload method, which only handles New Relic distributed trace payloads. transportType should be one of the following strings: AMQP HTTP HTTPS IronMQ JMS Kafka Other Queue Unknown headers should be an object containing all the headers in the incoming request. The keys must be lowercase. Accept incoming distributed trace headers The following example demonstrates adding distributed trace headers retrieved from a Kafka message. In this example, we assume that the incoming Kafka message has Distributed Trace headers inserted. // incoming Kafka message headers const headersObject = message.headers // Call newrelic.getTransaction to retrieve a handle on the current transaction. const transactionHandle = newrelic.getTransaction() newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction('background task', function executeTransaction() { const transaction = newrelic.getTransaction() // accept the headers transaction.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders('Kafka', headersObject) }) Copy transactionHandle.createDistributedTracePayload() transactionHandle.createDistributedTracePayload() Copy Caution This method is deprecated and was removed in version 7.0.0! Please use insertDistributedTraceHeaders. Important This API requires distributed tracing to be enabled. For instructions on how to use this call, along with its partner call acceptDistributedTracePayload, see Enable distributed tracing with agent APIs. This call is used to implement distributed tracing. It generates a payload that is read by the receiving application with acceptDistributedTracePayload. Important Note: In order to maintain proper ordering of spans in a trace, you must generate the payload in the context of the span that sends it. The DistributedTracePayload object has two available methods used for generating the payload in different formats: DistributedTracePayload#text: returns a JSON representation of the payload. Link a nested background transaction // Call newrelic.getTransaction to retrieve a handle on the current transaction. var transactionHandle = newrelic.getTransaction() var payload = transactionHandle.createDistributedTracePayload() var jsonPayload = payload.text() newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction('background task', function executeTransaction() { var backgroundHandle = newrelic.getTransaction() // Link the nested transaction by accepting the payload with the background transaction's handle backgroundHandle.acceptDistributedTracePayload(jsonPayload) }) Copy DistributedTracePayload#httpSafe: returns a base64 encoded JSON representation of the payload. Place payload on an outgoing request // Call newrelic.getTransaction to retrieve a handle on the current transaction. var transactionHandle = newrelic.getTransaction() var payload = transactionHandle.createDistributedTracePayload() // Place the base64 encoded value on an outbound request header. req.headers[myTracingHeader] = payload.httpSafe() Copy transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTracePayload(payload) transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTracePayload(payload) Copy Caution This method is deprecated and was removed in version 7.0.0! Please use acceptDistributedTraceHeaders. Important This API requires distributed tracing to be enabled. For context on how to use this call and its partner call createDistributedTracePayload, first read Enable distributed tracing with agent APIs. transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTracePayload is used to instrument the called service for inclusion in a distributed trace. It links the spans in a trace by accepting the payload generated by createDistributedTracePayload. transactionHandle.isSampled() transactionHandle.isSampled() Copy Returns whether this trace is being sampled. Other API calls New Relic's Node.js agent includes additional API calls. newrelic.addCustomAttribute(name, value) newrelic.addCustomAttribute(name, value) Copy Set a custom attribute value to be displayed along with the transaction trace in the New Relic UI. This must be called within the context of a transaction so it has a place to set the custom attributes. Custom attributes will appear in APM's transaction trace detail view and in errors for the transaction. Add custom attribute newrelic.addCustomAttribute('attribute1', 'value1') Copy Caution If you want to use your custom attributes, avoid using any of the reserved terms used by NRQL when naming them. newrelic.addCustomAttributes(attributes) newrelic.addCustomAttributes(attributes) Copy Set multiple custom attribute values to be displayed along with the transaction trace in the New Relic UI. The attributes should be passed as a single object. This must be called within the context of a transaction so it has a place to set the custom attributes. Custom attributes will appear in the transaction trace detail view and in errors for the transaction. Adding custom attributes const attributes = { attribute1: 'value1', attribute2: 2 } newrelic.addCustomAttributes(attributes) Copy Caution If you want to use your custom attributes, avoid using any of the reserved terms used by NRQL when naming them. newrelic.addCustomSpanAttribute(name, value) newrelic.addCustomSpanAttribute(name, value) Copy Set a custom span attribute value to be displayed along with a transaction trace span in the New Relic UI. This must be called within the context of an active segment/span so it has a place to set the custom span attributes. Custom span attributes will appear in the Attributes section of the span detail view. Add custom span attribute newrelic.addCustomSpanAttribute('attribute1', 'value') Copy Important This API requires distributed tracing and span events to be enabled. Caution If you want to use your custom span attributes, avoid using any of the reserved terms used by NRQL when naming them. newrelic.addCustomSpanAttributes(attributes) newrelic.addCustomSpanAttributes(attributes) Copy Set multiple custom span attribute values to be displayed along with the transaction trace spans in the New Relic UI. The attributes should be passed as a single object. This must be called within the context of an active segment/span so it has a place to set the custom span attributes. Custom span attributes will appear in the Attributes section of the span detail view. Add custom span attributes const attributes = { attribute1: 'value1', attribute2: 'value2' } newrelic.addCustomSpanAttributes(attributes) Copy Important This API requires distributed tracing and span events to be enabled. Caution If you want to use your custom span attributes, avoid using any of the reserved terms used by NRQL when naming them. newrelic.getBrowserTimingHeader() newrelic.getBrowserTimingHeader() Copy Returns the HTML snippet to be inserted into the header of HTML pages to enable browser monitoring. The HTML will instruct the browser to fetch a small JavaScript file and start the page timer. newrelic.setIgnoreTransaction(ignored) newrelic.setIgnoreTransaction(ignored) Copy Tell the module whether or not to ignore a given request. This allows you to explicitly filter long-polling, irrelevant routes or requests you know will be time-consuming. This also allows you to gather metrics for requests that otherwise would be ignored. To ignore the transaction, set the parameter to true will ignore the transaction. To prevent a transaction from being ignored with this function, pass the parameter false. Passing null or undefined will not change whether the transaction is ignored. Caution This method is deprecated and was removed in version 7.0.0. Please use transactionHandle.ignore() newrelic.noticeError(error, \\[customParameters]) newrelic.noticeError(error, \\[customParameters]) Copy Use this call if your app is doing its own error handling with domains or try/catch clauses, but you want all of the information about how many errors are coming out of the app to be centrally managed. Unlike other Node.js calls, this can be used outside of route handlers, but it will have additional context if called from within transaction scope. Caution Errors recorded using this method do not obey the ignore_status_codes configuration value. newrelic.shutdown(\\[options], callback) newrelic.shutdown(\\[options], callback) Copy Use this method to gracefully shut down the agent. options options.collectPendingData - type boolean - Tell the agent whether to send any pending data to the New Relic collector before shutting down. options.timeout - type number (ms) - The default time before forcing a shutdown. When collectPendingData is true, the agent will wait for a connection before shutting down. This timeout is useful for short lived processes, like AWS Lambda, in order to keep the process from staying open too long, while trying to connect. Example: newrelic.shutdown({collectPendingData: true, timeout: 3000}, (error) => { process.exit() }) Copy newrelic.getLinkingMetadata() newrelic.getLinkingMetadata() Copy Returns key/value pairs which can be used to link traces or entities. It will only contain items with meaningful values. For instance, if distributed tracing is disabled, trace.id will not be included. newrelic.getTraceMetadata() newrelic.getTraceMetadata() Copy Returns and object containing the current trace ID and span ID. Important This API requires distributed tracing to be enabled or an empty object will be returned. Rules for naming and ignoring requests If you do not want to put calls to the New Relic module directly into your application code, you can use pattern-based rules to name requests. There are two sets of rules: one for renaming requests, and one to mark requests to be ignored by New Relic's instrumentation. Here is the structure for rules in New Relic's Node.js agent. rules.name A list of rules of the format {pattern : \"pattern\", name : \"name\"} for matching incoming request URLs to pattern and naming the matching New Relic transaction's name. This acts as a regex replace, where you can set the pattern either as a string, or as a JavaScript regular expression literal, and both pattern and name are required. When passing a regex as a string, escape backslashes, as the agent does not keep them when given as a string in a pattern. Define your configuration rules from the most specific to the most general, as the patterns will be evaluated in order and are terminal in nature. For more information, see the naming guidelines. This can also be set with the environment variable NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES, with multiple rules passed in as a list of comma-delimited JSON object literals: NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES='{\"pattern\":\"^t\",\"name\":\"u\"},{\"pattern\":\"^u\",\"name\":\"t\"}' Copy Optional rules attributes [#optional-rules] Additional optional attributes are available: Optional rules attributes Description terminate_chain Default: true When set to true (default), no further rules will be evaluated if this rule is a match. Setting this to false is useful when multiple rules should be used together. For example, one rule could be replacing a common pattern in many different URLs, while subsequent rule(s) would be more specific. replace_all Default: false When set to true, all matches of the pattern will be replaced. Otherwise, only the first match will be replaced. Using the g flag with regular expression literal will have the same effect. For example: pattern: '[0-9]+', replace_all: true Copy This has the same effect as pattern: /[0-9]+/g. precedence By default the rules are evaluated in order, from first to last. If you prefer to have complete control over the order, you can give each rule a precedence attribute. The precedence is an integer number, and rules are evaluated in ascending order. If precedence is not explicitly defined, it will be set to 500 by default. Additional attributes are ignored. Testing your naming rules [#testing-rules] The Node.js agent comes with a command-line tool for testing naming rules. For more information, run the following command in terminal window in a directory where your app is installed: node node_modules/.bin/newrelic-naming-rules Copy Naming rule examples [#examples-rules] Here are some examples of naming rules and the results. Match full URL pattern: \"^/items/[0-9]+$\", name: \"/items/:id\" Copy will result in: /items/123 => /items/:id /orders/123 => /orders/123 (not replaced since the rule is a full match) Copy Replace first match in URL pattern: \"[0-9]+\", name: \":id\" Copy will result in: /orders/123 => /orders/:id /items/123 => /items/:id /orders/123/items/123 => /orders/:id/items/123 Copy Replace all matches in any URL pattern: \"[0-9]+\", name: \":id\", replace_all: true Copy will result in: /orders/123/items/123 => /orders/:id/items/:id Copy Match group references Using regular expression match group references: pattern: '^/(items|orders)/[0-9]+$', name: '/\\\\1/:id' Copy will result in: /orders/123 => /orders/:id /items/123 => /items/:id Copy rules.ignore This can also be set via the environment variable NEW_RELIC_IGNORING_RULES, with multiple rules passed in as a list of comma-delimited patterns. Currently there is no way to escape commas in patterns. NEW_RELIC_IGNORING_RULES='^/socket\\.io/\\*/xhr-polling,ignore_me' Copy Here are full examples of how rules are included in the configuration file: Naming rule example // newrelic.js exports.config = { // other configuration rules : { name : [ { pattern: \"/tables/name-here\", name: \"/name-hererule1\" } ] } Copy Ignoring rule example If you are using socket.io, you will have a use case for ignoring rules right out of the box. To keep socket.io long-polling from dominating your response-time metrics and affecting the Apdex metrics for your application, add a rule such as: // newrelic.js exports.config = { // other configuration rules : { ignore : [ '^\\/socket\\.io\\/.*\\/xhr-polling' ] } }; Copy API calls for rules Here are the API calls for naming and ignoring rules with New Relic's Node.js agent. newrelic.addNamingRule(pattern, name) Programmatic version of rules.name. Once naming rules are added, they cannot be removed until the Node process is restarted. They can also be added via the Node.js agent's configuration. Both parameters are required. newrelic.addIgnoringRule(pattern) Programmatic version of rules.ignore. Once ignoring rules are added, they cannot be removed until the Node process is restarted. They can also be added via the Node.js agent's configuration. This parameter is required.",

Capability Integration Browser monitoring The Ruby agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see the browser and Ruby agent documentation. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in infrastructure monitoring. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from Synthetics monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

      "body": "Caution Developer mode is deprecated and no longer supported as of Ruby agent version 4.1.0. The New Relic Ruby agent includes Developer mode, a built-in UI for examining details about web transactions in your application. With Developer mode, you can examine the library and database calls made by the controller actions as they are invoked on the Rails instance. The free Developer mode gives you some of the same in-depth transaction visibility you get with New Relic's transaction traces feature. However, it works only in a single Rails instance, and it has much higher overhead than the production version. It is not recommended for use beyond a developer's desktop sandbox. Security considerations The Ruby agent's Developer mode, which is on by default when the RAILS_ENV == \"development\", does not communicate with the New Relic collector in any way. Pie charts are rendered using Google Charts, which involves an HTTP post of aggregate data. Tip The Ruby agent's Production mode, which is on by default when the RAILS_ENV == \"production\" and RAILS_ENV == \"staging\", does communicate with the New Relic site. For more information, see Security. Installation To install Developer mode, install Ruby agent as a plugin or gem. You may also need to set developer_mode to true in your newrelic.yml for the RAILS_ENV in which you are working. Developer mode is on by default only when RAILS_ENV = development. While a newrelic.yml file will be created as part of the installation, it is not necessary to have a valid license key. Known issues Known issues with Developer mode include: Requires Rails 2.3 or higher Developer mode in recent agents only works on Rails 2.3 or higher. It is rack based, and earlier versions of the framework did not incorporate rack. The developer edition installs a middleware in your app that responds to any URL prepended with /newrelic; for example, /newrelic, /newrelic/files/images/foo.png, etc. In some cases the /newrelic URL gets captured by an earlier middleware. In this situation, disable the Developer mode route and include the middleware yourself: At the beginning of the file, in config.ru: require 'newrelic_rpm' require 'new_relic/rack/developer_mode' use NewRelic::Rack::DeveloperMode Copy Incompatible with Pow Developer mode is not supported from Pow, a zero-config Rack server for Mac OS X. Using Developer mode If you run your application on your desktop using thin, WEBrick, or something similar, open the URL /newrelic on your server to see the Developer mode user interface. Caution If you are using Passenger, Unicorn, or other forking application servers on your desktop, you may notice some odd behavior with disappearing data if your application server launches multiple instances. Refer to the Troubleshooting tips, which follow. Developer Mode Breakdown Chart Troubleshooting Troubleshooting tips for Developer mode: Disappearing requests If you have this problem with Unicorn or other multi-worker dispatchers, try limiting the number of workers to 1. Undefined method path for Rack::Request Some users may see an undefined method path for #<Rack::Request>. If you are using Rails version 2.3.2, then you are mostly likely running into a problem with the way the Rack dependency was defined in the Rails package. Either upgrade to 2.3.3 (or higher), or define Rack version 1.0.1 as a dependency in your Gemfile. ActiveRecord reloads Developer mode reloads ActiveRecord method definitions for every reload and reports the time spent defining the methods (such as define_attribute_method). This does not happen in production. To get real results to compare, add the following to the development environment: config.cache_classes = true Copy",

      "body": "New Relic offers several tools to help obtain the information needed to provide useful metrics about your Node.js application. These include: Reading the route names (if used) from the Express and Restify routers Using the API to name the current request, either with simple names or groups of controllers with actions Support rules that are stored in your agent's configuration that can mark requests to be renamed or ignored based on regular expressions matched against the request's raw URLs (also available as API calls) The number of names that New Relic tracks needs to be small enough so that the user experience is robust. It also needs to be large enough to provide the right amount of information (without overwhelming you with data) so that you can identify problem spots in your applications more easily. For more information, see the Node.js agent configuration documentation and the Node.js agent API documentation on Github. Request names The Node.js agent captures the HTTP method along with a potentially parameterized path (such as /user/:id) or a regular expression (such as /^/user/([-0-9a-f]+)$/). These pieces of information become part of the request name. If you have support for slow transaction traces and have enabled capture_params in your config file, the transaction trace will also have the request's parameters and their values attached to it. If you are dissatisfied with the request names that the Node.js agent uses, you can use API calls to create more descriptive names. Tip If grouping your requests under the generic name, then /* is sufficient, and you do not need to customize your configuration file or API calls. Requirements New Relic uses request names to group requests for many charts and tables. The value of these visualizations will drop as the number of different request names increases. For example, do not include potentially dynamic data like GUIDs, numerical IDs, or timestamps in the request names you create. If your request is slow enough to generate a transaction trace, that trace will contain the original URL. If you enable parameter capture, the parameters will also be attached to the trace. Tip Avoid having more than 50 different transaction names. For example, if you have more than a couple hundred different request names, rethink your naming strategy. Avoid metric grouping issues The request naming API helps New Relic avoid problems with trying to handle too many metrics, which sometimes is referred to as \"metric explosion.\" New Relic has several strategies to deal with these issues; the most severe is simply to add offending applications to your deny list. The main reason for you to be careful in using these request-naming tools is to prevent that from happening to your applications. For more information, see Metric grouping issues. Guidelines Define your configuration rules from the most specific to the most general. The first rules listed in your config file or added with the Node.js transaction naming API will be applied first and should be narrowly targeted. More general \"fall-through\" rules should be added toward the end of the list, because they will be evaluated in the order they were configured or added using the Node.js transaction naming API. URL pattern matching An online retailer has a URL pattern like this: /user/customers/all/prospects /user/customers/all/current /user/customers/all/returning /user/customers/John /user/customers/Jane Copy The retailer could create rules like this: // newrelic.js exports.config={ //other configuration rules:{ name:[ { pattern: \"/user/customers/all/prospects/\", name: \"/user/customers/all/prospects\" }, { pattern: \"/user/customers/all/.*\", name: \"/user/customers/all\" }, { pattern: \"/user/customers/.*\", name: \"/user/customers/:customer\" } ] } } Copy With these rules, the retailer would create three transaction names: /user/customers/:customer /user/customers/all /user/customers/all/prospects If the retailer reversed the order, the rules would catch all transactions in :customer, which would not be as useful. Load the request naming API Make sure that loading the New Relic module is the first thing your application does, as it needs to bootstrap itself before the rest of your application loads: var newrelic = require('newrelic'); Copy This returns the request naming API. You can safely require the module from multiple modules in your application, as it only initializes itself once. Request API calls Here is a summary of the Request API calls for New Relic's Node.js agent. newrelic.setTransactionName(name) newrelic.setTransactionName(name) Copy Name the current request, following the request naming requirements. You can call this function anywhere within the context of an HTTP request handler, at any time after handling of the request has started, but before the request has finished. In general, if the request and response objects are in scope, you can set the name. Explicitly calling newrelic.setTransactionName() will override any names set by Express or Restify routes. Also, calls to newrelic.setTransactionName() and newrelic.setControllerName() will overwrite each other. The last one to run before the request ends wins. newrelic.setControllerName(name, \\[action]) newrelic.setControllerName(name, \\[action]) Copy Name the current request using a controller-style pattern, optionally including the current controller action. If the action is omitted, New Relic will include the HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.) as the action. The rules for when you can call newrelic.setControllerName() are the same as they are for newrelic.setTransactionName(), including the request naming requirements. Explicitly calling newrelic.setControllerName() will override any names set by Express or Restify routes. Also, calls to newrelic.setTransactionName() and newrelic.setControllerName() will overwrite each other. The last one to run before the request ends wins. Custom instrumentation API calls Use these API calls to expand your instrumentation with custom instrumentation. newrelic.instrument(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) newrelic.instrument(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) Copy Sets an instrumentation callback for a specific module. The provided onRequire callback will be fired when the given module is loaded with require. The moduleName parameter should be the string that will be passed to require; for example, 'express' or 'amqplib/callback_api'. The optional onError callback is called if the onRequire parameters throws an error. This is useful for debugging your instrumentation. Use this method to: Add instrumentation for modules not currently instrumented by New Relic. Instrument your own code. Replace the Node.js agent's built-in instrumentation with your own. For more information, see New Relic's Node.js instrumentation tutorial on Github. newrelic.instrumentDatastore(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) newrelic.instrumentDatastore(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) Copy Sets an instrumentation callback for a datastore module. This method is just like newrelic.instrument(), except it provides a datastore-specialized shim. For more information, see New Relic's Node.js datastore instrumentation tutorial on Github. newrelic.instrumentLoadedModule(moduleName, moduleInstance) newrelic.instrumentLoadedModule(moduleName, moduleInstance) Copy The instrumentLoadedModule method allows you to add stock instrumentation to specific modules in situations where it's impossible to have require('newrelic'); as the first line of your app's main module. // load the agent const newrelic = require('newrelic') // module loaded before newrelic const expressModule = require('express') // instrument express _after_ the agent has been loaded newrelic.instrumentLoadedModule( 'express', // the module's name, as a string expressModule // the module instance ); Copy Important This method cannot instrument any arbitrary module. Its purpose is to add modules that were missed because the agent was not loaded as the first thing in your program. The instrumentLoadedModule method can only instrument modules the agent would normally instrument. You can see a list of these modules in the agent's lib/instrumentations module. newrelic.instrumentMessages(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) newrelic.instrumentMessages(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) Copy Sets an instrumentation callback for a message service client module. This method is just like newrelic.instrument(), except it provides a message-service-specialized shim. For more information, see New Relic's Node.js message service instrumentation tutorial on Github. newrelic.instrumentWebframework(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) newrelic.instrumentWebframework(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) Copy Sets an instrumentation callback for a web framework module. This method is just like newrelic.instrument(), except it provides a web-framework-specialized shim. For more information, see New Relic's Node.js web framework instrumentation tutorial on Github. newrelic.startWebTransaction(url, handle) newrelic.startWebTransaction(url, handle) Copy Instrument the specified web transaction. Using this API call, you can instrument transactions that New Relic does not automatically detect. The url defines the transaction name and needs to be static. Do not include variable data such as user ID. The handle defines the function you want to instrument. New Relic will capture any metrics that would be captured by auto-instrumentation, as well as manual instrumentation via startSegment(). You must handle custom transactions manually by calling newrelic.getTransaction() at the start of your transaction, and then call transaction.end() when you are finished. New Relic begins timing the transaction when newrelic.startWebTransaction() is called and ends the transaction when transaction.end() is called. You can also return a promise to indicate the end of the transaction. Please note that if this promise rejects, it does not automatically hook into New Relic’s error tracking. This needs to be done manually with noticeError(). newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction(name, \\[group], handle) newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction(name, \\[group], handle) Copy Instrument the specified background transaction. Using this API call, you can expand New Relic's instrumentation to capture data from background transactions. The name defines the transaction name and needs to be static. Do not include variable data such as user ID. The group is optional, and it allows you to group similar jobs together via the transaction type in the user interface. Like name, the group needs to be static. The handle defines a function that includes the entire background job you want to instrument. New Relic will capture any metrics that would be captured by auto-instrumentation, as well as manual instrumentation via startSegment(). You must handle custom transactions manually by calling newrelic.getTransaction() at the start of your transaction, and then call transaction.end() when you are finished. New Relic begins timing the transaction when newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction() is called and ends the transaction when transaction.end() is called. You can also return a promise to indicate the end of the transaction. Please note that if this promise rejects, it does not automatically hook into New Relic’s error tracking. This needs to be done manually with noticeError(). newrelic.getTransaction() newrelic.getTransaction() Copy Returns a handle on the currently executing transaction. This handle can then be used to interact with a given transaction safely from any context. It is best used with newrelic.startWebTransaction() and newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction(). Please refer to the transaction handle section for more details. newrelic.endTransaction() newrelic.endTransaction() Copy End the current web or background custom transaction. This method requires being in the correct transaction context when called. This API call takes no arguments. newrelic.startSegment(name, record, handler, callback) newrelic.startSegment(name, record, handler, callback) Copy Instrument a particular method to improve visibility into a transaction, or optionally turn it into a metric. The name defines a name for the segment. This name will be visible in transaction traces and as a new metric in the New Relic UI. The record flag defines whether the segment should be recorded as a metric. The handler is the function you want to track as a segment. The optional callback is a function passed to the handler to fire after its work is done. The agent begins timing the segment when startSegment is called. The segment is ended when either the handler finishes executing, or callback is fired, if it is provided. Custom metrics API calls Use these API calls to record additional arbitrary metrics: newrelic.recordMetric(name, value) newrelic.recordMetric(name, value) Copy Use recordMetric to record an event-based metric, usually associated with a particular duration. The name must be a string following standard metric naming rules. The value will usually be a number, but it can also be an object. When value is a numeric value, it should represent the magnitude of a measurement associated with an event; for example, the duration for a particular method call. When value is an object, it must contain count, total, min, max, and sumOfSquares keys, all with number values. This form is useful to aggregate metrics on your own and report them periodically; for example, from a setInterval. These values will be aggregated with any previously collected values for the same metric. The names of these keys match the names of the keys used by the platform API. newrelic.incrementMetric(name, \\[amount]) newrelic.incrementMetric(name, \\[amount]) Copy Use incrementMetric to update a metric that acts as a simple counter. The count of the selected metric will be incremented by the specified amount, defaulting to 1. Custom events API calls Use these API calls to record additional events: newrelic.recordCustomEvent(eventType, attributes) newrelic.recordCustomEvent(eventType, attributes) Copy Use recordCustomEvent to record an event-based metric, usually associated with a particular duration. The eventType must be an alphanumeric string less than 255 characters. The attributes must be an object of key and value pairs. The keys must be shorter than 255 characters, and the values must be string, number, or boolean. Recording a custom event The following example demonstrates recording a custom event with multiple attributes. const attributes = { attribute1: 'value1', attribute2: 2 } newrelic.recordCustomEvent('MessagingEvent', attributes) Copy Transaction handle methods This section details the methods provided by the TransactionHandle class instance that can be obtained through newrelic.getTransaction(). Use these methods to interact directly with the current transaction: transactionHandle.end(\\[callback]) transactionHandle.end(\\[callback]) Copy Use transactionHandle.end to end the transaction referenced by the handle instance. The callback is invoked when the transaction has fully ended. The finished transaction passed to the callback as the first argument. transactionHandle.ignore() transactionHandle.ignore() Copy Use transactionHandle.ignore to ignore the transaction referenced by the handle instance. transactionHandle.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(headers) transactionHandle.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(headers) Copy Important This API requires distributed tracing to be enabled. For context on how to use this call and its partner call acceptDistributedTraceHeaders, first read Enable distributed tracing with agent APIs. transactionHandle.insertDistributedTraceHeaders is used to implement distributed tracing. It modifies the headers map that is passed in by adding W3C Trace Context headers and New Relic Distributed Trace headers. The New Relic headers can be disabled with distributed_tracing.exclude_newrelic_header: true in the config. This method replaces the deprecated createDistributedTracePayload method, which only creates New Relic Distributed Trace payloads. Generating distributed trace headers In the following example, by calling insertDistributedTraceHeaders with an empty object, the appropriate Distributed Trace headers and W3C Trace Context headers will be generated for the transaction. // Call newrelic.getTransaction to retrieve a handle on the current transaction. const transactionHandle = newrelic.getTransaction() // This could be a header object from an incoming request as well const headersObject = {} newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction('background task', function executeTransaction() { const transaction = newrelic.getTransaction() // generate the headers transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(headersObject) }) Copy transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(transportType, headers) transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(transportType, headers) Copy Important This API requires distributed tracing to be enabled. For context on how to use this call and its partner call insertDistributedTraceHeaders, first read Enable distributed tracing with agent APIs. transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders is used to instrument the called service for inclusion in a distributed trace. It links the spans in a trace by accepting a payload generated by insertDistributedTraceHeaders or generated by some other W3C Trace Context compliant tracer. This method accepts the headers of an incoming request, looks for W3C Trace Context headers, and if not found, falls back to New Relic distributed trace headers. This method replaces the deprecated (and now removed as of version 7.0.0) acceptDistributedTracePayload method, which only handles New Relic distributed trace payloads. transportType should be one of the following strings: AMQP HTTP HTTPS IronMQ JMS Kafka Other Queue Unknown headers should be an object containing all the headers in the incoming request. The keys must be lowercase. Accept incoming distributed trace headers The following example demonstrates adding distributed trace headers retrieved from a Kafka message. In this example, we assume that the incoming Kafka message has Distributed Trace headers inserted. // incoming Kafka message headers const headersObject = message.headers // Call newrelic.getTransaction to retrieve a handle on the current transaction. const transactionHandle = newrelic.getTransaction() newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction('background task', function executeTransaction() { const transaction = newrelic.getTransaction() // accept the headers transaction.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders('Kafka', headersObject) }) Copy transactionHandle.createDistributedTracePayload() transactionHandle.createDistributedTracePayload() Copy Caution This method is deprecated and was removed in version 7.0.0! Please use insertDistributedTraceHeaders. Important This API requires distributed tracing to be enabled. For instructions on how to use this call, along with its partner call acceptDistributedTracePayload, see Enable distributed tracing with agent APIs. This call is used to implement distributed tracing. It generates a payload that is read by the receiving application with acceptDistributedTracePayload. Important Note: In order to maintain proper ordering of spans in a trace, you must generate the payload in the context of the span that sends it. The DistributedTracePayload object has two available methods used for generating the payload in different formats: DistributedTracePayload#text: returns a JSON representation of the payload. Link a nested background transaction // Call newrelic.getTransaction to retrieve a handle on the current transaction. var transactionHandle = newrelic.getTransaction() var payload = transactionHandle.createDistributedTracePayload() var jsonPayload = payload.text() newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction('background task', function executeTransaction() { var backgroundHandle = newrelic.getTransaction() // Link the nested transaction by accepting the payload with the background transaction's handle backgroundHandle.acceptDistributedTracePayload(jsonPayload) }) Copy DistributedTracePayload#httpSafe: returns a base64 encoded JSON representation of the payload. Place payload on an outgoing request // Call newrelic.getTransaction to retrieve a handle on the current transaction. var transactionHandle = newrelic.getTransaction() var payload = transactionHandle.createDistributedTracePayload() // Place the base64 encoded value on an outbound request header. req.headers[myTracingHeader] = payload.httpSafe() Copy transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTracePayload(payload) transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTracePayload(payload) Copy Caution This method is deprecated and was removed in version 7.0.0! Please use acceptDistributedTraceHeaders. Important This API requires distributed tracing to be enabled. For context on how to use this call and its partner call createDistributedTracePayload, first read Enable distributed tracing with agent APIs. transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTracePayload is used to instrument the called service for inclusion in a distributed trace. It links the spans in a trace by accepting the payload generated by createDistributedTracePayload. transactionHandle.isSampled() transactionHandle.isSampled() Copy Returns whether this trace is being sampled. Other API calls New Relic's Node.js agent includes additional API calls. newrelic.addCustomAttribute(name, value) newrelic.addCustomAttribute(name, value) Copy Set a custom attribute value to be displayed along with the transaction trace in the New Relic UI. This must be called within the context of a transaction so it has a place to set the custom attributes. Custom attributes will appear in APM's transaction trace detail view and in errors for the transaction. Add custom attribute newrelic.addCustomAttribute('attribute1', 'value1') Copy Caution If you want to use your custom attributes, avoid using any of the reserved terms used by NRQL when naming them. newrelic.addCustomAttributes(attributes) newrelic.addCustomAttributes(attributes) Copy Set multiple custom attribute values to be displayed along with the transaction trace in the New Relic UI. The attributes should be passed as a single object. This must be called within the context of a transaction so it has a place to set the custom attributes. Custom attributes will appear in the transaction trace detail view and in errors for the transaction. Adding custom attributes const attributes = { attribute1: 'value1', attribute2: 2 } newrelic.addCustomAttributes(attributes) Copy Caution If you want to use your custom attributes, avoid using any of the reserved terms used by NRQL when naming them. newrelic.addCustomSpanAttribute(name, value) newrelic.addCustomSpanAttribute(name, value) Copy Set a custom span attribute value to be displayed along with a transaction trace span in the New Relic UI. This must be called within the context of an active segment/span so it has a place to set the custom span attributes. Custom span attributes will appear in the Attributes section of the span detail view. Add custom span attribute newrelic.addCustomSpanAttribute('attribute1', 'value') Copy Important This API requires distributed tracing and span events to be enabled. Caution If you want to use your custom span attributes, avoid using any of the reserved terms used by NRQL when naming them. newrelic.addCustomSpanAttributes(attributes) newrelic.addCustomSpanAttributes(attributes) Copy Set multiple custom span attribute values to be displayed along with the transaction trace spans in the New Relic UI. The attributes should be passed as a single object. This must be called within the context of an active segment/span so it has a place to set the custom span attributes. Custom span attributes will appear in the Attributes section of the span detail view. Add custom span attributes const attributes = { attribute1: 'value1', attribute2: 'value2' } newrelic.addCustomSpanAttributes(attributes) Copy Important This API requires distributed tracing and span events to be enabled. Caution If you want to use your custom span attributes, avoid using any of the reserved terms used by NRQL when naming them. newrelic.getBrowserTimingHeader() newrelic.getBrowserTimingHeader() Copy Returns the HTML snippet to be inserted into the header of HTML pages to enable browser monitoring. The HTML will instruct the browser to fetch a small JavaScript file and start the page timer. newrelic.setIgnoreTransaction(ignored) newrelic.setIgnoreTransaction(ignored) Copy Tell the module whether or not to ignore a given request. This allows you to explicitly filter long-polling, irrelevant routes or requests you know will be time-consuming. This also allows you to gather metrics for requests that otherwise would be ignored. To ignore the transaction, set the parameter to true will ignore the transaction. To prevent a transaction from being ignored with this function, pass the parameter false. Passing null or undefined will not change whether the transaction is ignored. Caution This method is deprecated and was removed in version 7.0.0. Please use transactionHandle.ignore() newrelic.noticeError(error, \\[customParameters]) newrelic.noticeError(error, \\[customParameters]) Copy Use this call if your app is doing its own error handling with domains or try/catch clauses, but you want all of the information about how many errors are coming out of the app to be centrally managed. Unlike other Node.js calls, this can be used outside of route handlers, but it will have additional context if called from within transaction scope. Caution Errors recorded using this method do not obey the ignore_status_codes configuration value. newrelic.shutdown(\\[options], callback) newrelic.shutdown(\\[options], callback) Copy Use this method to gracefully shut down the agent. options options.collectPendingData - type boolean - Tell the agent whether to send any pending data to the New Relic collector before shutting down. options.timeout - type number (ms) - The default time before forcing a shutdown. When collectPendingData is true, the agent will wait for a connection before shutting down. This timeout is useful for short lived processes, like AWS Lambda, in order to keep the process from staying open too long, while trying to connect. Example: newrelic.shutdown({collectPendingData: true, timeout: 3000}, (error) => { process.exit() }) Copy newrelic.getLinkingMetadata() newrelic.getLinkingMetadata() Copy Returns key/value pairs which can be used to link traces or entities. It will only contain items with meaningful values. For instance, if distributed tracing is disabled, trace.id will not be included. newrelic.getTraceMetadata() newrelic.getTraceMetadata() Copy Returns and object containing the current trace ID and span ID. Important This API requires distributed tracing to be enabled or an empty object will be returned. Rules for naming and ignoring requests If you do not want to put calls to the New Relic module directly into your application code, you can use pattern-based rules to name requests. There are two sets of rules: one for renaming requests, and one to mark requests to be ignored by New Relic's instrumentation. Here is the structure for rules in New Relic's Node.js agent. rules.name A list of rules of the format {pattern : \"pattern\", name : \"name\"} for matching incoming request URLs to pattern and naming the matching New Relic transaction's name. This acts as a regex replace, where you can set the pattern either as a string, or as a JavaScript regular expression literal, and both pattern and name are required. When passing a regex as a string, escape backslashes, as the agent does not keep them when given as a string in a pattern. Define your configuration rules from the most specific to the most general, as the patterns will be evaluated in order and are terminal in nature. For more information, see the naming guidelines. This can also be set with the environment variable NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES, with multiple rules passed in as a list of comma-delimited JSON object literals: NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES='{\"pattern\":\"^t\",\"name\":\"u\"},{\"pattern\":\"^u\",\"name\":\"t\"}' Copy Optional rules attributes [#optional-rules] Additional optional attributes are available: Optional rules attributes Description terminate_chain Default: true When set to true (default), no further rules will be evaluated if this rule is a match. Setting this to false is useful when multiple rules should be used together. For example, one rule could be replacing a common pattern in many different URLs, while subsequent rule(s) would be more specific. replace_all Default: false When set to true, all matches of the pattern will be replaced. Otherwise, only the first match will be replaced. Using the g flag with regular expression literal will have the same effect. For example: pattern: '[0-9]+', replace_all: true Copy This has the same effect as pattern: /[0-9]+/g. precedence By default the rules are evaluated in order, from first to last. If you prefer to have complete control over the order, you can give each rule a precedence attribute. The precedence is an integer number, and rules are evaluated in ascending order. If precedence is not explicitly defined, it will be set to 500 by default. Additional attributes are ignored. Testing your naming rules [#testing-rules] The Node.js agent comes with a command-line tool for testing naming rules. For more information, run the following command in terminal window in a directory where your app is installed: node node_modules/.bin/newrelic-naming-rules Copy Naming rule examples [#examples-rules] Here are some examples of naming rules and the results. Match full URL pattern: \"^/items/[0-9]+$\", name: \"/items/:id\" Copy will result in: /items/123 => /items/:id /orders/123 => /orders/123 (not replaced since the rule is a full match) Copy Replace first match in URL pattern: \"[0-9]+\", name: \":id\" Copy will result in: /orders/123 => /orders/:id /items/123 => /items/:id /orders/123/items/123 => /orders/:id/items/123 Copy Replace all matches in any URL pattern: \"[0-9]+\", name: \":id\", replace_all: true Copy will result in: /orders/123/items/123 => /orders/:id/items/:id Copy Match group references Using regular expression match group references: pattern: '^/(items|orders)/[0-9]+$', name: '/\\\\1/:id' Copy will result in: /orders/123 => /orders/:id /items/123 => /items/:id Copy rules.ignore This can also be set via the environment variable NEW_RELIC_IGNORING_RULES, with multiple rules passed in as a list of comma-delimited patterns. Currently there is no way to escape commas in patterns. NEW_RELIC_IGNORING_RULES='^/socket\\.io/\\*/xhr-polling,ignore_me' Copy Here are full examples of how rules are included in the configuration file: Naming rule example // newrelic.js exports.config = { // other configuration rules : { name : [ { pattern: \"/tables/name-here\", name: \"/name-hererule1\" } ] } Copy Ignoring rule example If you are using socket.io, you will have a use case for ignoring rules right out of the box. To keep socket.io long-polling from dominating your response-time metrics and affecting the Apdex metrics for your application, add a rule such as: // newrelic.js exports.config = { // other configuration rules : { ignore : [ '^\\/socket\\.io\\/.*\\/xhr-polling' ] } }; Copy API calls for rules Here are the API calls for naming and ignoring rules with New Relic's Node.js agent. newrelic.addNamingRule(pattern, name) Programmatic version of rules.name. Once naming rules are added, they cannot be removed until the Node process is restarted. They can also be added via the Node.js agent's configuration. Both parameters are required. newrelic.addIgnoringRule(pattern) Programmatic version of rules.ignore. Once ignoring rules are added, they cannot be removed until the Node process is restarted. They can also be added via the Node.js agent's configuration. This parameter is required.",

If you don't have one already, start by creating a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Operating systems The Ruby agent supports UNIX-like operating systems such as Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and macOS. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported.

Capability Integration Browser monitoring The Ruby agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see the browser and Ruby agent documentation. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in infrastructure monitoring. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from Synthetics monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

      "body": "Caution Developer mode is deprecated and no longer supported as of Ruby agent version 4.1.0. The New Relic Ruby agent includes Developer mode, a built-in UI for examining details about web transactions in your application. With Developer mode, you can examine the library and database calls made by the controller actions as they are invoked on the Rails instance. The free Developer mode gives you some of the same in-depth transaction visibility you get with New Relic's transaction traces feature. However, it works only in a single Rails instance, and it has much higher overhead than the production version. It is not recommended for use beyond a developer's desktop sandbox. Security considerations The Ruby agent's Developer mode, which is on by default when the RAILS_ENV == \"development\", does not communicate with the New Relic collector in any way. Pie charts are rendered using Google Charts, which involves an HTTP post of aggregate data. Tip The Ruby agent's Production mode, which is on by default when the RAILS_ENV == \"production\" and RAILS_ENV == \"staging\", does communicate with the New Relic site. For more information, see Security. Installation To install Developer mode, install Ruby agent as a plugin or gem. You may also need to set developer_mode to true in your newrelic.yml for the RAILS_ENV in which you are working. Developer mode is on by default only when RAILS_ENV = development. While a newrelic.yml file will be created as part of the installation, it is not necessary to have a valid license key. Known issues Known issues with Developer mode include: Requires Rails 2.3 or higher Developer mode in recent agents only works on Rails 2.3 or higher. It is rack based, and earlier versions of the framework did not incorporate rack. The developer edition installs a middleware in your app that responds to any URL prepended with /newrelic; for example, /newrelic, /newrelic/files/images/foo.png, etc. In some cases the /newrelic URL gets captured by an earlier middleware. In this situation, disable the Developer mode route and include the middleware yourself: At the beginning of the file, in config.ru: require 'newrelic_rpm' require 'new_relic/rack/developer_mode' use NewRelic::Rack::DeveloperMode Copy Incompatible with Pow Developer mode is not supported from Pow, a zero-config Rack server for Mac OS X. Using Developer mode If you run your application on your desktop using thin, WEBrick, or something similar, open the URL /newrelic on your server to see the Developer mode user interface. Caution If you are using Passenger, Unicorn, or other forking application servers on your desktop, you may notice some odd behavior with disappearing data if your application server launches multiple instances. Refer to the Troubleshooting tips, which follow. Developer Mode Breakdown Chart Troubleshooting Troubleshooting tips for Developer mode: Disappearing requests If you have this problem with Unicorn or other multi-worker dispatchers, try limiting the number of workers to 1. Undefined method path for Rack::Request Some users may see an undefined method path for #<Rack::Request>. If you are using Rails version 2.3.2, then you are mostly likely running into a problem with the way the Rack dependency was defined in the Rails package. Either upgrade to 2.3.3 (or higher), or define Rack version 1.0.1 as a dependency in your Gemfile. ActiveRecord reloads Developer mode reloads ActiveRecord method definitions for every reload and reports the time spent defining the methods (such as define_attribute_method). This does not happen in production. To get real results to compare, add the following to the development environment: config.cache_classes = true Copy",

      "body": "New Relic offers several tools to help obtain the information needed to provide useful metrics about your Node.js application. These include: Reading the route names (if used) from the Express and Restify routers Using the API to name the current request, either with simple names or groups of controllers with actions Support rules that are stored in your agent's configuration that can mark requests to be renamed or ignored based on regular expressions matched against the request's raw URLs (also available as API calls) The number of names that New Relic tracks needs to be small enough so that the user experience is robust. It also needs to be large enough to provide the right amount of information (without overwhelming you with data) so that you can identify problem spots in your applications more easily. For more information, see the Node.js agent configuration documentation and the Node.js agent API documentation on Github. Request names The Node.js agent captures the HTTP method along with a potentially parameterized path (such as /user/:id) or a regular expression (such as /^/user/([-0-9a-f]+)$/). These pieces of information become part of the request name. If you have support for slow transaction traces and have enabled capture_params in your config file, the transaction trace will also have the request's parameters and their values attached to it. If you are dissatisfied with the request names that the Node.js agent uses, you can use API calls to create more descriptive names. Tip If grouping your requests under the generic name, then /* is sufficient, and you do not need to customize your configuration file or API calls. Requirements New Relic uses request names to group requests for many charts and tables. The value of these visualizations will drop as the number of different request names increases. For example, do not include potentially dynamic data like GUIDs, numerical IDs, or timestamps in the request names you create. If your request is slow enough to generate a transaction trace, that trace will contain the original URL. If you enable parameter capture, the parameters will also be attached to the trace. Tip Avoid having more than 50 different transaction names. For example, if you have more than a couple hundred different request names, rethink your naming strategy. Avoid metric grouping issues The request naming API helps New Relic avoid problems with trying to handle too many metrics, which sometimes is referred to as \"metric explosion.\" New Relic has several strategies to deal with these issues; the most severe is simply to add offending applications to your deny list. The main reason for you to be careful in using these request-naming tools is to prevent that from happening to your applications. For more information, see Metric grouping issues. Guidelines Define your configuration rules from the most specific to the most general. The first rules listed in your config file or added with the Node.js transaction naming API will be applied first and should be narrowly targeted. More general \"fall-through\" rules should be added toward the end of the list, because they will be evaluated in the order they were configured or added using the Node.js transaction naming API. URL pattern matching An online retailer has a URL pattern like this: /user/customers/all/prospects /user/customers/all/current /user/customers/all/returning /user/customers/John /user/customers/Jane Copy The retailer could create rules like this: // newrelic.js exports.config={ //other configuration rules:{ name:[ { pattern: \"/user/customers/all/prospects/\", name: \"/user/customers/all/prospects\" }, { pattern: \"/user/customers/all/.*\", name: \"/user/customers/all\" }, { pattern: \"/user/customers/.*\", name: \"/user/customers/:customer\" } ] } } Copy With these rules, the retailer would create three transaction names: /user/customers/:customer /user/customers/all /user/customers/all/prospects If the retailer reversed the order, the rules would catch all transactions in :customer, which would not be as useful. Load the request naming API Make sure that loading the New Relic module is the first thing your application does, as it needs to bootstrap itself before the rest of your application loads: var newrelic = require('newrelic'); Copy This returns the request naming API. You can safely require the module from multiple modules in your application, as it only initializes itself once. Request API calls Here is a summary of the Request API calls for New Relic's Node.js agent. newrelic.setTransactionName(name) newrelic.setTransactionName(name) Copy Name the current request, following the request naming requirements. You can call this function anywhere within the context of an HTTP request handler, at any time after handling of the request has started, but before the request has finished. In general, if the request and response objects are in scope, you can set the name. Explicitly calling newrelic.setTransactionName() will override any names set by Express or Restify routes. Also, calls to newrelic.setTransactionName() and newrelic.setControllerName() will overwrite each other. The last one to run before the request ends wins. newrelic.setControllerName(name, \\[action]) newrelic.setControllerName(name, \\[action]) Copy Name the current request using a controller-style pattern, optionally including the current controller action. If the action is omitted, New Relic will include the HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.) as the action. The rules for when you can call newrelic.setControllerName() are the same as they are for newrelic.setTransactionName(), including the request naming requirements. Explicitly calling newrelic.setControllerName() will override any names set by Express or Restify routes. Also, calls to newrelic.setTransactionName() and newrelic.setControllerName() will overwrite each other. The last one to run before the request ends wins. Custom instrumentation API calls Use these API calls to expand your instrumentation with custom instrumentation. newrelic.instrument(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) newrelic.instrument(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) Copy Sets an instrumentation callback for a specific module. The provided onRequire callback will be fired when the given module is loaded with require. The moduleName parameter should be the string that will be passed to require; for example, 'express' or 'amqplib/callback_api'. The optional onError callback is called if the onRequire parameters throws an error. This is useful for debugging your instrumentation. Use this method to: Add instrumentation for modules not currently instrumented by New Relic. Instrument your own code. Replace the Node.js agent's built-in instrumentation with your own. For more information, see New Relic's Node.js instrumentation tutorial on Github. newrelic.instrumentDatastore(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) newrelic.instrumentDatastore(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) Copy Sets an instrumentation callback for a datastore module. This method is just like newrelic.instrument(), except it provides a datastore-specialized shim. For more information, see New Relic's Node.js datastore instrumentation tutorial on Github. newrelic.instrumentLoadedModule(moduleName, moduleInstance) newrelic.instrumentLoadedModule(moduleName, moduleInstance) Copy The instrumentLoadedModule method allows you to add stock instrumentation to specific modules in situations where it's impossible to have require('newrelic'); as the first line of your app's main module. // load the agent const newrelic = require('newrelic') // module loaded before newrelic const expressModule = require('express') // instrument express _after_ the agent has been loaded newrelic.instrumentLoadedModule( 'express', // the module's name, as a string expressModule // the module instance ); Copy Important This method cannot instrument any arbitrary module. Its purpose is to add modules that were missed because the agent was not loaded as the first thing in your program. The instrumentLoadedModule method can only instrument modules the agent would normally instrument. You can see a list of these modules in the agent's lib/instrumentations module. newrelic.instrumentMessages(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) newrelic.instrumentMessages(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) Copy Sets an instrumentation callback for a message service client module. This method is just like newrelic.instrument(), except it provides a message-service-specialized shim. For more information, see New Relic's Node.js message service instrumentation tutorial on Github. newrelic.instrumentWebframework(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) newrelic.instrumentWebframework(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) Copy Sets an instrumentation callback for a web framework module. This method is just like newrelic.instrument(), except it provides a web-framework-specialized shim. For more information, see New Relic's Node.js web framework instrumentation tutorial on Github. newrelic.startWebTransaction(url, handle) newrelic.startWebTransaction(url, handle) Copy Instrument the specified web transaction. Using this API call, you can instrument transactions that New Relic does not automatically detect. The url defines the transaction name and needs to be static. Do not include variable data such as user ID. The handle defines the function you want to instrument. New Relic will capture any metrics that would be captured by auto-instrumentation, as well as manual instrumentation via startSegment(). You must handle custom transactions manually by calling newrelic.getTransaction() at the start of your transaction, and then call transaction.end() when you are finished. New Relic begins timing the transaction when newrelic.startWebTransaction() is called and ends the transaction when transaction.end() is called. You can also return a promise to indicate the end of the transaction. Please note that if this promise rejects, it does not automatically hook into New Relic’s error tracking. This needs to be done manually with noticeError(). newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction(name, \\[group], handle) newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction(name, \\[group], handle) Copy Instrument the specified background transaction. Using this API call, you can expand New Relic's instrumentation to capture data from background transactions. The name defines the transaction name and needs to be static. Do not include variable data such as user ID. The group is optional, and it allows you to group similar jobs together via the transaction type in the user interface. Like name, the group needs to be static. The handle defines a function that includes the entire background job you want to instrument. New Relic will capture any metrics that would be captured by auto-instrumentation, as well as manual instrumentation via startSegment(). You must handle custom transactions manually by calling newrelic.getTransaction() at the start of your transaction, and then call transaction.end() when you are finished. New Relic begins timing the transaction when newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction() is called and ends the transaction when transaction.end() is called. You can also return a promise to indicate the end of the transaction. Please note that if this promise rejects, it does not automatically hook into New Relic’s error tracking. This needs to be done manually with noticeError(). newrelic.getTransaction() newrelic.getTransaction() Copy Returns a handle on the currently executing transaction. This handle can then be used to interact with a given transaction safely from any context. It is best used with newrelic.startWebTransaction() and newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction(). Please refer to the transaction handle section for more details. newrelic.endTransaction() newrelic.endTransaction() Copy End the current web or background custom transaction. This method requires being in the correct transaction context when called. This API call takes no arguments. newrelic.startSegment(name, record, handler, callback) newrelic.startSegment(name, record, handler, callback) Copy Instrument a particular method to improve visibility into a transaction, or optionally turn it into a metric. The name defines a name for the segment. This name will be visible in transaction traces and as a new metric in the New Relic UI. The record flag defines whether the segment should be recorded as a metric. The handler is the function you want to track as a segment. The optional callback is a function passed to the handler to fire after its work is done. The agent begins timing the segment when startSegment is called. The segment is ended when either the handler finishes executing, or callback is fired, if it is provided. Custom metrics API calls Use these API calls to record additional arbitrary metrics: newrelic.recordMetric(name, value) newrelic.recordMetric(name, value) Copy Use recordMetric to record an event-based metric, usually associated with a particular duration. The name must be a string following standard metric naming rules. The value will usually be a number, but it can also be an object. When value is a numeric value, it should represent the magnitude of a measurement associated with an event; for example, the duration for a particular method call. When value is an object, it must contain count, total, min, max, and sumOfSquares keys, all with number values. This form is useful to aggregate metrics on your own and report them periodically; for example, from a setInterval. These values will be aggregated with any previously collected values for the same metric. The names of these keys match the names of the keys used by the platform API. newrelic.incrementMetric(name, \\[amount]) newrelic.incrementMetric(name, \\[amount]) Copy Use incrementMetric to update a metric that acts as a simple counter. The count of the selected metric will be incremented by the specified amount, defaulting to 1. Custom events API calls Use these API calls to record additional events: newrelic.recordCustomEvent(eventType, attributes) newrelic.recordCustomEvent(eventType, attributes) Copy Use recordCustomEvent to record an event-based metric, usually associated with a particular duration. The eventType must be an alphanumeric string less than 255 characters. The attributes must be an object of key and value pairs. The keys must be shorter than 255 characters, and the values must be string, number, or boolean. Recording a custom event The following example demonstrates recording a custom event with multiple attributes. const attributes = { attribute1: 'value1', attribute2: 2 } newrelic.recordCustomEvent('MessagingEvent', attributes) Copy Transaction handle methods This section details the methods provided by the TransactionHandle class instance that can be obtained through newrelic.getTransaction(). Use these methods to interact directly with the current transaction: transactionHandle.end(\\[callback]) transactionHandle.end(\\[callback]) Copy Use transactionHandle.end to end the transaction referenced by the handle instance. The callback is invoked when the transaction has fully ended. The finished transaction passed to the callback as the first argument. transactionHandle.ignore() transactionHandle.ignore() Copy Use transactionHandle.ignore to ignore the transaction referenced by the handle instance. transactionHandle.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(headers) transactionHandle.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(headers) Copy Important This API requires distributed tracing to be enabled. For context on how to use this call and its partner call acceptDistributedTraceHeaders, first read Enable distributed tracing with agent APIs. transactionHandle.insertDistributedTraceHeaders is used to implement distributed tracing. It modifies the headers map that is passed in by adding W3C Trace Context headers and New Relic Distributed Trace headers. The New Relic headers can be disabled with distributed_tracing.exclude_newrelic_header: true in the config. This method replaces the deprecated createDistributedTracePayload method, which only creates New Relic Distributed Trace payloads. Generating distributed trace headers In the following example, by calling insertDistributedTraceHeaders with an empty object, the appropriate Distributed Trace headers and W3C Trace Context headers will be generated for the transaction. // Call newrelic.getTransaction to retrieve a handle on the current transaction. const transactionHandle = newrelic.getTransaction() // This could be a header object from an incoming request as well const headersObject = {} newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction('background task', function executeTransaction() { const transaction = newrelic.getTransaction() // generate the headers transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(headersObject) }) Copy transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(transportType, headers) transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(transportType, headers) Copy Important This API requires distributed tracing to be enabled. For context on how to use this call and its partner call insertDistributedTraceHeaders, first read Enable distributed tracing with agent APIs. transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders is used to instrument the called service for inclusion in a distributed trace. It links the spans in a trace by accepting a payload generated by insertDistributedTraceHeaders or generated by some other W3C Trace Context compliant tracer. This method accepts the headers of an incoming request, looks for W3C Trace Context headers, and if not found, falls back to New Relic distributed trace headers. This method replaces the deprecated (and now removed as of version 7.0.0) acceptDistributedTracePayload method, which only handles New Relic distributed trace payloads. transportType should be one of the following strings: AMQP HTTP HTTPS IronMQ JMS Kafka Other Queue Unknown headers should be an object containing all the headers in the incoming request. The keys must be lowercase. Accept incoming distributed trace headers The following example demonstrates adding distributed trace headers retrieved from a Kafka message. In this example, we assume that the incoming Kafka message has Distributed Trace headers inserted. // incoming Kafka message headers const headersObject = message.headers // Call newrelic.getTransaction to retrieve a handle on the current transaction. const transactionHandle = newrelic.getTransaction() newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction('background task', function executeTransaction() { const transaction = newrelic.getTransaction() // accept the headers transaction.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders('Kafka', headersObject) }) Copy transactionHandle.createDistributedTracePayload() transactionHandle.createDistributedTracePayload() Copy Caution This method is deprecated and was removed in version 7.0.0! Please use insertDistributedTraceHeaders. Important This API requires distributed tracing to be enabled. For instructions on how to use this call, along with its partner call acceptDistributedTracePayload, see Enable distributed tracing with agent APIs. This call is used to implement distributed tracing. It generates a payload that is read by the receiving application with acceptDistributedTracePayload. Important Note: In order to maintain proper ordering of spans in a trace, you must generate the payload in the context of the span that sends it. The DistributedTracePayload object has two available methods used for generating the payload in different formats: DistributedTracePayload#text: returns a JSON representation of the payload. Link a nested background transaction // Call newrelic.getTransaction to retrieve a handle on the current transaction. var transactionHandle = newrelic.getTransaction() var payload = transactionHandle.createDistributedTracePayload() var jsonPayload = payload.text() newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction('background task', function executeTransaction() { var backgroundHandle = newrelic.getTransaction() // Link the nested transaction by accepting the payload with the background transaction's handle backgroundHandle.acceptDistributedTracePayload(jsonPayload) }) Copy DistributedTracePayload#httpSafe: returns a base64 encoded JSON representation of the payload. Place payload on an outgoing request // Call newrelic.getTransaction to retrieve a handle on the current transaction. var transactionHandle = newrelic.getTransaction() var payload = transactionHandle.createDistributedTracePayload() // Place the base64 encoded value on an outbound request header. req.headers[myTracingHeader] = payload.httpSafe() Copy transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTracePayload(payload) transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTracePayload(payload) Copy Caution This method is deprecated and was removed in version 7.0.0! Please use acceptDistributedTraceHeaders. Important This API requires distributed tracing to be enabled. For context on how to use this call and its partner call createDistributedTracePayload, first read Enable distributed tracing with agent APIs. transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTracePayload is used to instrument the called service for inclusion in a distributed trace. It links the spans in a trace by accepting the payload generated by createDistributedTracePayload. transactionHandle.isSampled() transactionHandle.isSampled() Copy Returns whether this trace is being sampled. Other API calls New Relic's Node.js agent includes additional API calls. newrelic.addCustomAttribute(name, value) newrelic.addCustomAttribute(name, value) Copy Set a custom attribute value to be displayed along with the transaction trace in the New Relic UI. This must be called within the context of a transaction so it has a place to set the custom attributes. Custom attributes will appear in APM's transaction trace detail view and in errors for the transaction. Add custom attribute newrelic.addCustomAttribute('attribute1', 'value1') Copy Caution If you want to use your custom attributes, avoid using any of the reserved terms used by NRQL when naming them. newrelic.addCustomAttributes(attributes) newrelic.addCustomAttributes(attributes) Copy Set multiple custom attribute values to be displayed along with the transaction trace in the New Relic UI. The attributes should be passed as a single object. This must be called within the context of a transaction so it has a place to set the custom attributes. Custom attributes will appear in the transaction trace detail view and in errors for the transaction. Adding custom attributes const attributes = { attribute1: 'value1', attribute2: 2 } newrelic.addCustomAttributes(attributes) Copy Caution If you want to use your custom attributes, avoid using any of the reserved terms used by NRQL when naming them. newrelic.addCustomSpanAttribute(name, value) newrelic.addCustomSpanAttribute(name, value) Copy Set a custom span attribute value to be displayed along with a transaction trace span in the New Relic UI. This must be called within the context of an active segment/span so it has a place to set the custom span attributes. Custom span attributes will appear in the Attributes section of the span detail view. Add custom span attribute newrelic.addCustomSpanAttribute('attribute1', 'value') Copy Important This API requires distributed tracing and span events to be enabled. Caution If you want to use your custom span attributes, avoid using any of the reserved terms used by NRQL when naming them. newrelic.addCustomSpanAttributes(attributes) newrelic.addCustomSpanAttributes(attributes) Copy Set multiple custom span attribute values to be displayed along with the transaction trace spans in the New Relic UI. The attributes should be passed as a single object. This must be called within the context of an active segment/span so it has a place to set the custom span attributes. Custom span attributes will appear in the Attributes section of the span detail view. Add custom span attributes const attributes = { attribute1: 'value1', attribute2: 'value2' } newrelic.addCustomSpanAttributes(attributes) Copy Important This API requires distributed tracing and span events to be enabled. Caution If you want to use your custom span attributes, avoid using any of the reserved terms used by NRQL when naming them. newrelic.getBrowserTimingHeader() newrelic.getBrowserTimingHeader() Copy Returns the HTML snippet to be inserted into the header of HTML pages to enable browser monitoring. The HTML will instruct the browser to fetch a small JavaScript file and start the page timer. newrelic.setIgnoreTransaction(ignored) newrelic.setIgnoreTransaction(ignored) Copy Tell the module whether or not to ignore a given request. This allows you to explicitly filter long-polling, irrelevant routes or requests you know will be time-consuming. This also allows you to gather metrics for requests that otherwise would be ignored. To ignore the transaction, set the parameter to true will ignore the transaction. To prevent a transaction from being ignored with this function, pass the parameter false. Passing null or undefined will not change whether the transaction is ignored. Caution This method is deprecated and was removed in version 7.0.0. Please use transactionHandle.ignore() newrelic.noticeError(error, \\[customParameters]) newrelic.noticeError(error, \\[customParameters]) Copy Use this call if your app is doing its own error handling with domains or try/catch clauses, but you want all of the information about how many errors are coming out of the app to be centrally managed. Unlike other Node.js calls, this can be used outside of route handlers, but it will have additional context if called from within transaction scope. Caution Errors recorded using this method do not obey the ignore_status_codes configuration value. newrelic.shutdown(\\[options], callback) newrelic.shutdown(\\[options], callback) Copy Use this method to gracefully shut down the agent. options options.collectPendingData - type boolean - Tell the agent whether to send any pending data to the New Relic collector before shutting down. options.timeout - type number (ms) - The default time before forcing a shutdown. When collectPendingData is true, the agent will wait for a connection before shutting down. This timeout is useful for short lived processes, like AWS Lambda, in order to keep the process from staying open too long, while trying to connect. Example: newrelic.shutdown({collectPendingData: true, timeout: 3000}, (error) => { process.exit() }) Copy newrelic.getLinkingMetadata() newrelic.getLinkingMetadata() Copy Returns key/value pairs which can be used to link traces or entities. It will only contain items with meaningful values. For instance, if distributed tracing is disabled, trace.id will not be included. newrelic.getTraceMetadata() newrelic.getTraceMetadata() Copy Returns and object containing the current trace ID and span ID. Important This API requires distributed tracing to be enabled or an empty object will be returned. Rules for naming and ignoring requests If you do not want to put calls to the New Relic module directly into your application code, you can use pattern-based rules to name requests. There are two sets of rules: one for renaming requests, and one to mark requests to be ignored by New Relic's instrumentation. Here is the structure for rules in New Relic's Node.js agent. rules.name A list of rules of the format {pattern : \"pattern\", name : \"name\"} for matching incoming request URLs to pattern and naming the matching New Relic transaction's name. This acts as a regex replace, where you can set the pattern either as a string, or as a JavaScript regular expression literal, and both pattern and name are required. When passing a regex as a string, escape backslashes, as the agent does not keep them when given as a string in a pattern. Define your configuration rules from the most specific to the most general, as the patterns will be evaluated in order and are terminal in nature. For more information, see the naming guidelines. This can also be set with the environment variable NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES, with multiple rules passed in as a list of comma-delimited JSON object literals: NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES='{\"pattern\":\"^t\",\"name\":\"u\"},{\"pattern\":\"^u\",\"name\":\"t\"}' Copy Optional rules attributes [#optional-rules] Additional optional attributes are available: Optional rules attributes Description terminate_chain Default: true When set to true (default), no further rules will be evaluated if this rule is a match. Setting this to false is useful when multiple rules should be used together. For example, one rule could be replacing a common pattern in many different URLs, while subsequent rule(s) would be more specific. replace_all Default: false When set to true, all matches of the pattern will be replaced. Otherwise, only the first match will be replaced. Using the g flag with regular expression literal will have the same effect. For example: pattern: '[0-9]+', replace_all: true Copy This has the same effect as pattern: /[0-9]+/g. precedence By default the rules are evaluated in order, from first to last. If you prefer to have complete control over the order, you can give each rule a precedence attribute. The precedence is an integer number, and rules are evaluated in ascending order. If precedence is not explicitly defined, it will be set to 500 by default. Additional attributes are ignored. Testing your naming rules [#testing-rules] The Node.js agent comes with a command-line tool for testing naming rules. For more information, run the following command in terminal window in a directory where your app is installed: node node_modules/.bin/newrelic-naming-rules Copy Naming rule examples [#examples-rules] Here are some examples of naming rules and the results. Match full URL pattern: \"^/items/[0-9]+$\", name: \"/items/:id\" Copy will result in: /items/123 => /items/:id /orders/123 => /orders/123 (not replaced since the rule is a full match) Copy Replace first match in URL pattern: \"[0-9]+\", name: \":id\" Copy will result in: /orders/123 => /orders/:id /items/123 => /items/:id /orders/123/items/123 => /orders/:id/items/123 Copy Replace all matches in any URL pattern: \"[0-9]+\", name: \":id\", replace_all: true Copy will result in: /orders/123/items/123 => /orders/:id/items/:id Copy Match group references Using regular expression match group references: pattern: '^/(items|orders)/[0-9]+$', name: '/\\\\1/:id' Copy will result in: /orders/123 => /orders/:id /items/123 => /items/:id Copy rules.ignore This can also be set via the environment variable NEW_RELIC_IGNORING_RULES, with multiple rules passed in as a list of comma-delimited patterns. Currently there is no way to escape commas in patterns. NEW_RELIC_IGNORING_RULES='^/socket\\.io/\\*/xhr-polling,ignore_me' Copy Here are full examples of how rules are included in the configuration file: Naming rule example // newrelic.js exports.config = { // other configuration rules : { name : [ { pattern: \"/tables/name-here\", name: \"/name-hererule1\" } ] } Copy Ignoring rule example If you are using socket.io, you will have a use case for ignoring rules right out of the box. To keep socket.io long-polling from dominating your response-time metrics and affecting the Apdex metrics for your application, add a rule such as: // newrelic.js exports.config = { // other configuration rules : { ignore : [ '^\\/socket\\.io\\/.*\\/xhr-polling' ] } }; Copy API calls for rules Here are the API calls for naming and ignoring rules with New Relic's Node.js agent. newrelic.addNamingRule(pattern, name) Programmatic version of rules.name. Once naming rules are added, they cannot be removed until the Node process is restarted. They can also be added via the Node.js agent's configuration. Both parameters are required. newrelic.addIgnoringRule(pattern) Programmatic version of rules.ignore. Once ignoring rules are added, they cannot be removed until the Node process is restarted. They can also be added via the Node.js agent's configuration. This parameter is required.",

      "body": "Caution Developer mode is deprecated and no longer supported as of Ruby agent version 4.1.0. The New Relic Ruby agent includes Developer mode, a built-in UI for examining details about web transactions in your application. With Developer mode, you can examine the library and database calls made by the controller actions as they are invoked on the Rails instance. The free Developer mode gives you some of the same in-depth transaction visibility you get with New Relic's transaction traces feature. However, it works only in a single Rails instance, and it has much higher overhead than the production version. It is not recommended for use beyond a developer's desktop sandbox. Security considerations The Ruby agent's Developer mode, which is on by default when the RAILS_ENV == \"development\", does not communicate with the New Relic collector in any way. Pie charts are rendered using Google Charts, which involves an HTTP post of aggregate data. Tip The Ruby agent's Production mode, which is on by default when the RAILS_ENV == \"production\" and RAILS_ENV == \"staging\", does communicate with the New Relic site. For more information, see Security. Installation To install Developer mode, install Ruby agent as a plugin or gem. You may also need to set developer_mode to true in your newrelic.yml for the RAILS_ENV in which you are working. Developer mode is on by default only when RAILS_ENV = development. While a newrelic.yml file will be created as part of the installation, it is not necessary to have a valid license key. Known issues Known issues with Developer mode include: Requires Rails 2.3 or higher Developer mode in recent agents only works on Rails 2.3 or higher. It is rack based, and earlier versions of the framework did not incorporate rack. The developer edition installs a middleware in your app that responds to any URL prepended with /newrelic; for example, /newrelic, /newrelic/files/images/foo.png, etc. In some cases the /newrelic URL gets captured by an earlier middleware. In this situation, disable the Developer mode route and include the middleware yourself: At the beginning of the file, in config.ru: require 'newrelic_rpm' require 'new_relic/rack/developer_mode' use NewRelic::Rack::DeveloperMode Copy Incompatible with Pow Developer mode is not supported from Pow, a zero-config Rack server for Mac OS X. Using Developer mode If you run your application on your desktop using thin, WEBrick, or something similar, open the URL /newrelic on your server to see the Developer mode user interface. Caution If you are using Passenger, Unicorn, or other forking application servers on your desktop, you may notice some odd behavior with disappearing data if your application server launches multiple instances. Refer to the Troubleshooting tips, which follow. Developer Mode Breakdown Chart Troubleshooting Troubleshooting tips for Developer mode: Disappearing requests If you have this problem with Unicorn or other multi-worker dispatchers, try limiting the number of workers to 1. Undefined method path for Rack::Request Some users may see an undefined method path for #<Rack::Request>. If you are using Rails version 2.3.2, then you are mostly likely running into a problem with the way the Rack dependency was defined in the Rails package. Either upgrade to 2.3.3 (or higher), or define Rack version 1.0.1 as a dependency in your Gemfile. ActiveRecord reloads Developer mode reloads ActiveRecord method definitions for every reload and reports the time spent defining the methods (such as define_attribute_method). This does not happen in production. To get real results to compare, add the following to the development environment: config.cache_classes = true Copy",

      "body": "New Relic offers several tools to help obtain the information needed to provide useful metrics about your Node.js application. These include: Reading the route names (if used) from the Express and Restify routers Using the API to name the current request, either with simple names or groups of controllers with actions Support rules that are stored in your agent's configuration that can mark requests to be renamed or ignored based on regular expressions matched against the request's raw URLs (also available as API calls) The number of names that New Relic tracks needs to be small enough so that the user experience is robust. It also needs to be large enough to provide the right amount of information (without overwhelming you with data) so that you can identify problem spots in your applications more easily. For more information, see the Node.js agent configuration documentation and the Node.js agent API documentation on Github. Request names The Node.js agent captures the HTTP method along with a potentially parameterized path (such as /user/:id) or a regular expression (such as /^/user/([-0-9a-f]+)$/). These pieces of information become part of the request name. If you have support for slow transaction traces and have enabled capture_params in your config file, the transaction trace will also have the request's parameters and their values attached to it. If you are dissatisfied with the request names that the Node.js agent uses, you can use API calls to create more descriptive names. Tip If grouping your requests under the generic name, then /* is sufficient, and you do not need to customize your configuration file or API calls. Requirements New Relic uses request names to group requests for many charts and tables. The value of these visualizations will drop as the number of different request names increases. For example, do not include potentially dynamic data like GUIDs, numerical IDs, or timestamps in the request names you create. If your request is slow enough to generate a transaction trace, that trace will contain the original URL. If you enable parameter capture, the parameters will also be attached to the trace. Tip Avoid having more than 50 different transaction names. For example, if you have more than a couple hundred different request names, rethink your naming strategy. Avoid metric grouping issues The request naming API helps New Relic avoid problems with trying to handle too many metrics, which sometimes is referred to as \"metric explosion.\" New Relic has several strategies to deal with these issues; the most severe is simply to add offending applications to your deny list. The main reason for you to be careful in using these request-naming tools is to prevent that from happening to your applications. For more information, see Metric grouping issues. Guidelines Define your configuration rules from the most specific to the most general. The first rules listed in your config file or added with the Node.js transaction naming API will be applied first and should be narrowly targeted. More general \"fall-through\" rules should be added toward the end of the list, because they will be evaluated in the order they were configured or added using the Node.js transaction naming API. URL pattern matching An online retailer has a URL pattern like this: /user/customers/all/prospects /user/customers/all/current /user/customers/all/returning /user/customers/John /user/customers/Jane Copy The retailer could create rules like this: // newrelic.js exports.config={ //other configuration rules:{ name:[ { pattern: \"/user/customers/all/prospects/\", name: \"/user/customers/all/prospects\" }, { pattern: \"/user/customers/all/.*\", name: \"/user/customers/all\" }, { pattern: \"/user/customers/.*\", name: \"/user/customers/:customer\" } ] } } Copy With these rules, the retailer would create three transaction names: /user/customers/:customer /user/customers/all /user/customers/all/prospects If the retailer reversed the order, the rules would catch all transactions in :customer, which would not be as useful. Load the request naming API Make sure that loading the New Relic module is the first thing your application does, as it needs to bootstrap itself before the rest of your application loads: var newrelic = require('newrelic'); Copy This returns the request naming API. You can safely require the module from multiple modules in your application, as it only initializes itself once. Request API calls Here is a summary of the Request API calls for New Relic's Node.js agent. newrelic.setTransactionName(name) newrelic.setTransactionName(name) Copy Name the current request, following the request naming requirements. You can call this function anywhere within the context of an HTTP request handler, at any time after handling of the request has started, but before the request has finished. In general, if the request and response objects are in scope, you can set the name. Explicitly calling newrelic.setTransactionName() will override any names set by Express or Restify routes. Also, calls to newrelic.setTransactionName() and newrelic.setControllerName() will overwrite each other. The last one to run before the request ends wins. newrelic.setControllerName(name, \\[action]) newrelic.setControllerName(name, \\[action]) Copy Name the current request using a controller-style pattern, optionally including the current controller action. If the action is omitted, New Relic will include the HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.) as the action. The rules for when you can call newrelic.setControllerName() are the same as they are for newrelic.setTransactionName(), including the request naming requirements. Explicitly calling newrelic.setControllerName() will override any names set by Express or Restify routes. Also, calls to newrelic.setTransactionName() and newrelic.setControllerName() will overwrite each other. The last one to run before the request ends wins. Custom instrumentation API calls Use these API calls to expand your instrumentation with custom instrumentation. newrelic.instrument(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) newrelic.instrument(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) Copy Sets an instrumentation callback for a specific module. The provided onRequire callback will be fired when the given module is loaded with require. The moduleName parameter should be the string that will be passed to require; for example, 'express' or 'amqplib/callback_api'. The optional onError callback is called if the onRequire parameters throws an error. This is useful for debugging your instrumentation. Use this method to: Add instrumentation for modules not currently instrumented by New Relic. Instrument your own code. Replace the Node.js agent's built-in instrumentation with your own. For more information, see New Relic's Node.js instrumentation tutorial on Github. newrelic.instrumentDatastore(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) newrelic.instrumentDatastore(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) Copy Sets an instrumentation callback for a datastore module. This method is just like newrelic.instrument(), except it provides a datastore-specialized shim. For more information, see New Relic's Node.js datastore instrumentation tutorial on Github. newrelic.instrumentLoadedModule(moduleName, moduleInstance) newrelic.instrumentLoadedModule(moduleName, moduleInstance) Copy The instrumentLoadedModule method allows you to add stock instrumentation to specific modules in situations where it's impossible to have require('newrelic'); as the first line of your app's main module. // load the agent const newrelic = require('newrelic') // module loaded before newrelic const expressModule = require('express') // instrument express _after_ the agent has been loaded newrelic.instrumentLoadedModule( 'express', // the module's name, as a string expressModule // the module instance ); Copy Important This method cannot instrument any arbitrary module. Its purpose is to add modules that were missed because the agent was not loaded as the first thing in your program. The instrumentLoadedModule method can only instrument modules the agent would normally instrument. You can see a list of these modules in the agent's lib/instrumentations module. newrelic.instrumentMessages(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) newrelic.instrumentMessages(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) Copy Sets an instrumentation callback for a message service client module. This method is just like newrelic.instrument(), except it provides a message-service-specialized shim. For more information, see New Relic's Node.js message service instrumentation tutorial on Github. newrelic.instrumentWebframework(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) newrelic.instrumentWebframework(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) Copy Sets an instrumentation callback for a web framework module. This method is just like newrelic.instrument(), except it provides a web-framework-specialized shim. For more information, see New Relic's Node.js web framework instrumentation tutorial on Github. newrelic.startWebTransaction(url, handle) newrelic.startWebTransaction(url, handle) Copy Instrument the specified web transaction. Using this API call, you can instrument transactions that New Relic does not automatically detect. The url defines the transaction name and needs to be static. Do not include variable data such as user ID. The handle defines the function you want to instrument. New Relic will capture any metrics that would be captured by auto-instrumentation, as well as manual instrumentation via startSegment(). You must handle custom transactions manually by calling newrelic.getTransaction() at the start of your transaction, and then call transaction.end() when you are finished. New Relic begins timing the transaction when newrelic.startWebTransaction() is called and ends the transaction when transaction.end() is called. You can also return a promise to indicate the end of the transaction. Please note that if this promise rejects, it does not automatically hook into New Relic’s error tracking. This needs to be done manually with noticeError(). newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction(name, \\[group], handle) newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction(name, \\[group], handle) Copy Instrument the specified background transaction. Using this API call, you can expand New Relic's instrumentation to capture data from background transactions. The name defines the transaction name and needs to be static. Do not include variable data such as user ID. The group is optional, and it allows you to group similar jobs together via the transaction type in the user interface. Like name, the group needs to be static. The handle defines a function that includes the entire background job you want to instrument. New Relic will capture any metrics that would be captured by auto-instrumentation, as well as manual instrumentation via startSegment(). You must handle custom transactions manually by calling newrelic.getTransaction() at the start of your transaction, and then call transaction.end() when you are finished. New Relic begins timing the transaction when newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction() is called and ends the transaction when transaction.end() is called. You can also return a promise to indicate the end of the transaction. Please note that if this promise rejects, it does not automatically hook into New Relic’s error tracking. This needs to be done manually with noticeError(). newrelic.getTransaction() newrelic.getTransaction() Copy Returns a handle on the currently executing transaction. This handle can then be used to interact with a given transaction safely from any context. It is best used with newrelic.startWebTransaction() and newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction(). Please refer to the transaction handle section for more details. newrelic.endTransaction() newrelic.endTransaction() Copy End the current web or background custom transaction. This method requires being in the correct transaction context when called. This API call takes no arguments. newrelic.startSegment(name, record, handler, callback) newrelic.startSegment(name, record, handler, callback) Copy Instrument a particular method to improve visibility into a transaction, or optionally turn it into a metric. The name defines a name for the segment. This name will be visible in transaction traces and as a new metric in the New Relic UI. The record flag defines whether the segment should be recorded as a metric. The handler is the function you want to track as a segment. The optional callback is a function passed to the handler to fire after its work is done. The agent begins timing the segment when startSegment is called. The segment is ended when either the handler finishes executing, or callback is fired, if it is provided. Custom metrics API calls Use these API calls to record additional arbitrary metrics: newrelic.recordMetric(name, value) newrelic.recordMetric(name, value) Copy Use recordMetric to record an event-based metric, usually associated with a particular duration. The name must be a string following standard metric naming rules. The value will usually be a number, but it can also be an object. When value is a numeric value, it should represent the magnitude of a measurement associated with an event; for example, the duration for a particular method call. When value is an object, it must contain count, total, min, max, and sumOfSquares keys, all with number values. This form is useful to aggregate metrics on your own and report them periodically; for example, from a setInterval. These values will be aggregated with any previously collected values for the same metric. The names of these keys match the names of the keys used by the platform API. newrelic.incrementMetric(name, \\[amount]) newrelic.incrementMetric(name, \\[amount]) Copy Use incrementMetric to update a metric that acts as a simple counter. The count of the selected metric will be incremented by the specified amount, defaulting to 1. Custom events API calls Use these API calls to record additional events: newrelic.recordCustomEvent(eventType, attributes) newrelic.recordCustomEvent(eventType, attributes) Copy Use recordCustomEvent to record an event-based metric, usually associated with a particular duration. The eventType must be an alphanumeric string less than 255 characters. The attributes must be an object of key and value pairs. The keys must be shorter than 255 characters, and the values must be string, number, or boolean. Recording a custom event The following example demonstrates recording a custom event with multiple attributes. const attributes = { attribute1: 'value1', attribute2: 2 } newrelic.recordCustomEvent('MessagingEvent', attributes) Copy Transaction handle methods This section details the methods provided by the TransactionHandle class instance that can be obtained through newrelic.getTransaction(). Use these methods to interact directly with the current transaction: transactionHandle.end(\\[callback]) transactionHandle.end(\\[callback]) Copy Use transactionHandle.end to end the transaction referenced by the handle instance. The callback is invoked when the transaction has fully ended. The finished transaction passed to the callback as the first argument. transactionHandle.ignore() transactionHandle.ignore() Copy Use transactionHandle.ignore to ignore the transaction referenced by the handle instance. transactionHandle.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(headers) transactionHandle.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(headers) Copy Important This API requires distributed tracing to be enabled. For context on how to use this call and its partner call acceptDistributedTraceHeaders, first read Enable distributed tracing with agent APIs. transactionHandle.insertDistributedTraceHeaders is used to implement distributed tracing. It modifies the headers map that is passed in by adding W3C Trace Context headers and New Relic Distributed Trace headers. The New Relic headers can be disabled with distributed_tracing.exclude_newrelic_header: true in the config. This method replaces the deprecated createDistributedTracePayload method, which only creates New Relic Distributed Trace payloads. Generating distributed trace headers In the following example, by calling insertDistributedTraceHeaders with an empty object, the appropriate Distributed Trace headers and W3C Trace Context headers will be generated for the transaction. // Call newrelic.getTransaction to retrieve a handle on the current transaction. const transactionHandle = newrelic.getTransaction() // This could be a header object from an incoming request as well const headersObject = {} newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction('background task', function executeTransaction() { const transaction = newrelic.getTransaction() // generate the headers transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(headersObject) }) Copy transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(transportType, headers) transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(transportType, headers) Copy Important This API requires distributed tracing to be enabled. For context on how to use this call and its partner call insertDistributedTraceHeaders, first read Enable distributed tracing with agent APIs. transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders is used to instrument the called service for inclusion in a distributed trace. It links the spans in a trace by accepting a payload generated by insertDistributedTraceHeaders or generated by some other W3C Trace Context compliant tracer. This method accepts the headers of an incoming request, looks for W3C Trace Context headers, and if not found, falls back to New Relic distributed trace headers. This method replaces the deprecated (and now removed as of version 7.0.0) acceptDistributedTracePayload method, which only handles New Relic distributed trace payloads. transportType should be one of the following strings: AMQP HTTP HTTPS IronMQ JMS Kafka Other Queue Unknown headers should be an object containing all the headers in the incoming request. The keys must be lowercase. Accept incoming distributed trace headers The following example demonstrates adding distributed trace headers retrieved from a Kafka message. In this example, we assume that the incoming Kafka message has Distributed Trace headers inserted. // incoming Kafka message headers const headersObject = message.headers // Call newrelic.getTransaction to retrieve a handle on the current transaction. const transactionHandle = newrelic.getTransaction() newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction('background task', function executeTransaction() { const transaction = newrelic.getTransaction() // accept the headers transaction.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders('Kafka', headersObject) }) Copy transactionHandle.createDistributedTracePayload() transactionHandle.createDistributedTracePayload() Copy Caution This method is deprecated and was removed in version 7.0.0! Please use insertDistributedTraceHeaders. Important This API requires distributed tracing to be enabled. For instructions on how to use this call, along with its partner call acceptDistributedTracePayload, see Enable distributed tracing with agent APIs. This call is used to implement distributed tracing. It generates a payload that is read by the receiving application with acceptDistributedTracePayload. Important Note: In order to maintain proper ordering of spans in a trace, you must generate the payload in the context of the span that sends it. The DistributedTracePayload object has two available methods used for generating the payload in different formats: DistributedTracePayload#text: returns a JSON representation of the payload. Link a nested background transaction // Call newrelic.getTransaction to retrieve a handle on the current transaction. var transactionHandle = newrelic.getTransaction() var payload = transactionHandle.createDistributedTracePayload() var jsonPayload = payload.text() newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction('background task', function executeTransaction() { var backgroundHandle = newrelic.getTransaction() // Link the nested transaction by accepting the payload with the background transaction's handle backgroundHandle.acceptDistributedTracePayload(jsonPayload) }) Copy DistributedTracePayload#httpSafe: returns a base64 encoded JSON representation of the payload. Place payload on an outgoing request // Call newrelic.getTransaction to retrieve a handle on the current transaction. var transactionHandle = newrelic.getTransaction() var payload = transactionHandle.createDistributedTracePayload() // Place the base64 encoded value on an outbound request header. req.headers[myTracingHeader] = payload.httpSafe() Copy transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTracePayload(payload) transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTracePayload(payload) Copy Caution This method is deprecated and was removed in version 7.0.0! Please use acceptDistributedTraceHeaders. Important This API requires distributed tracing to be enabled. For context on how to use this call and its partner call createDistributedTracePayload, first read Enable distributed tracing with agent APIs. transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTracePayload is used to instrument the called service for inclusion in a distributed trace. It links the spans in a trace by accepting the payload generated by createDistributedTracePayload. transactionHandle.isSampled() transactionHandle.isSampled() Copy Returns whether this trace is being sampled. Other API calls New Relic's Node.js agent includes additional API calls. newrelic.addCustomAttribute(name, value) newrelic.addCustomAttribute(name, value) Copy Set a custom attribute value to be displayed along with the transaction trace in the New Relic UI. This must be called within the context of a transaction so it has a place to set the custom attributes. Custom attributes will appear in APM's transaction trace detail view and in errors for the transaction. Add custom attribute newrelic.addCustomAttribute('attribute1', 'value1') Copy Caution If you want to use your custom attributes, avoid using any of the reserved terms used by NRQL when naming them. newrelic.addCustomAttributes(attributes) newrelic.addCustomAttributes(attributes) Copy Set multiple custom attribute values to be displayed along with the transaction trace in the New Relic UI. The attributes should be passed as a single object. This must be called within the context of a transaction so it has a place to set the custom attributes. Custom attributes will appear in the transaction trace detail view and in errors for the transaction. Adding custom attributes const attributes = { attribute1: 'value1', attribute2: 2 } newrelic.addCustomAttributes(attributes) Copy Caution If you want to use your custom attributes, avoid using any of the reserved terms used by NRQL when naming them. newrelic.addCustomSpanAttribute(name, value) newrelic.addCustomSpanAttribute(name, value) Copy Set a custom span attribute value to be displayed along with a transaction trace span in the New Relic UI. This must be called within the context of an active segment/span so it has a place to set the custom span attributes. Custom span attributes will appear in the Attributes section of the span detail view. Add custom span attribute newrelic.addCustomSpanAttribute('attribute1', 'value') Copy Important This API requires distributed tracing and span events to be enabled. Caution If you want to use your custom span attributes, avoid using any of the reserved terms used by NRQL when naming them. newrelic.addCustomSpanAttributes(attributes) newrelic.addCustomSpanAttributes(attributes) Copy Set multiple custom span attribute values to be displayed along with the transaction trace spans in the New Relic UI. The attributes should be passed as a single object. This must be called within the context of an active segment/span so it has a place to set the custom span attributes. Custom span attributes will appear in the Attributes section of the span detail view. Add custom span attributes const attributes = { attribute1: 'value1', attribute2: 'value2' } newrelic.addCustomSpanAttributes(attributes) Copy Important This API requires distributed tracing and span events to be enabled. Caution If you want to use your custom span attributes, avoid using any of the reserved terms used by NRQL when naming them. newrelic.getBrowserTimingHeader() newrelic.getBrowserTimingHeader() Copy Returns the HTML snippet to be inserted into the header of HTML pages to enable browser monitoring. The HTML will instruct the browser to fetch a small JavaScript file and start the page timer. newrelic.setIgnoreTransaction(ignored) newrelic.setIgnoreTransaction(ignored) Copy Tell the module whether or not to ignore a given request. This allows you to explicitly filter long-polling, irrelevant routes or requests you know will be time-consuming. This also allows you to gather metrics for requests that otherwise would be ignored. To ignore the transaction, set the parameter to true will ignore the transaction. To prevent a transaction from being ignored with this function, pass the parameter false. Passing null or undefined will not change whether the transaction is ignored. Caution This method is deprecated and was removed in version 7.0.0. Please use transactionHandle.ignore() newrelic.noticeError(error, \\[customParameters]) newrelic.noticeError(error, \\[customParameters]) Copy Use this call if your app is doing its own error handling with domains or try/catch clauses, but you want all of the information about how many errors are coming out of the app to be centrally managed. Unlike other Node.js calls, this can be used outside of route handlers, but it will have additional context if called from within transaction scope. Caution Errors recorded using this method do not obey the ignore_status_codes configuration value. newrelic.shutdown(\\[options], callback) newrelic.shutdown(\\[options], callback) Copy Use this method to gracefully shut down the agent. options options.collectPendingData - type boolean - Tell the agent whether to send any pending data to the New Relic collector before shutting down. options.timeout - type number (ms) - The default time before forcing a shutdown. When collectPendingData is true, the agent will wait for a connection before shutting down. This timeout is useful for short lived processes, like AWS Lambda, in order to keep the process from staying open too long, while trying to connect. Example: newrelic.shutdown({collectPendingData: true, timeout: 3000}, (error) => { process.exit() }) Copy newrelic.getLinkingMetadata() newrelic.getLinkingMetadata() Copy Returns key/value pairs which can be used to link traces or entities. It will only contain items with meaningful values. For instance, if distributed tracing is disabled, trace.id will not be included. newrelic.getTraceMetadata() newrelic.getTraceMetadata() Copy Returns and object containing the current trace ID and span ID. Important This API requires distributed tracing to be enabled or an empty object will be returned. Rules for naming and ignoring requests If you do not want to put calls to the New Relic module directly into your application code, you can use pattern-based rules to name requests. There are two sets of rules: one for renaming requests, and one to mark requests to be ignored by New Relic's instrumentation. Here is the structure for rules in New Relic's Node.js agent. rules.name A list of rules of the format {pattern : \"pattern\", name : \"name\"} for matching incoming request URLs to pattern and naming the matching New Relic transaction's name. This acts as a regex replace, where you can set the pattern either as a string, or as a JavaScript regular expression literal, and both pattern and name are required. When passing a regex as a string, escape backslashes, as the agent does not keep them when given as a string in a pattern. Define your configuration rules from the most specific to the most general, as the patterns will be evaluated in order and are terminal in nature. For more information, see the naming guidelines. This can also be set with the environment variable NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES, with multiple rules passed in as a list of comma-delimited JSON object literals: NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES='{\"pattern\":\"^t\",\"name\":\"u\"},{\"pattern\":\"^u\",\"name\":\"t\"}' Copy Optional rules attributes [#optional-rules] Additional optional attributes are available: Optional rules attributes Description terminate_chain Default: true When set to true (default), no further rules will be evaluated if this rule is a match. Setting this to false is useful when multiple rules should be used together. For example, one rule could be replacing a common pattern in many different URLs, while subsequent rule(s) would be more specific. replace_all Default: false When set to true, all matches of the pattern will be replaced. Otherwise, only the first match will be replaced. Using the g flag with regular expression literal will have the same effect. For example: pattern: '[0-9]+', replace_all: true Copy This has the same effect as pattern: /[0-9]+/g. precedence By default the rules are evaluated in order, from first to last. If you prefer to have complete control over the order, you can give each rule a precedence attribute. The precedence is an integer number, and rules are evaluated in ascending order. If precedence is not explicitly defined, it will be set to 500 by default. Additional attributes are ignored. Testing your naming rules [#testing-rules] The Node.js agent comes with a command-line tool for testing naming rules. For more information, run the following command in terminal window in a directory where your app is installed: node node_modules/.bin/newrelic-naming-rules Copy Naming rule examples [#examples-rules] Here are some examples of naming rules and the results. Match full URL pattern: \"^/items/[0-9]+$\", name: \"/items/:id\" Copy will result in: /items/123 => /items/:id /orders/123 => /orders/123 (not replaced since the rule is a full match) Copy Replace first match in URL pattern: \"[0-9]+\", name: \":id\" Copy will result in: /orders/123 => /orders/:id /items/123 => /items/:id /orders/123/items/123 => /orders/:id/items/123 Copy Replace all matches in any URL pattern: \"[0-9]+\", name: \":id\", replace_all: true Copy will result in: /orders/123/items/123 => /orders/:id/items/:id Copy Match group references Using regular expression match group references: pattern: '^/(items|orders)/[0-9]+$', name: '/\\\\1/:id' Copy will result in: /orders/123 => /orders/:id /items/123 => /items/:id Copy rules.ignore This can also be set via the environment variable NEW_RELIC_IGNORING_RULES, with multiple rules passed in as a list of comma-delimited patterns. Currently there is no way to escape commas in patterns. NEW_RELIC_IGNORING_RULES='^/socket\\.io/\\*/xhr-polling,ignore_me' Copy Here are full examples of how rules are included in the configuration file: Naming rule example // newrelic.js exports.config = { // other configuration rules : { name : [ { pattern: \"/tables/name-here\", name: \"/name-hererule1\" } ] } Copy Ignoring rule example If you are using socket.io, you will have a use case for ignoring rules right out of the box. To keep socket.io long-polling from dominating your response-time metrics and affecting the Apdex metrics for your application, add a rule such as: // newrelic.js exports.config = { // other configuration rules : { ignore : [ '^\\/socket\\.io\\/.*\\/xhr-polling' ] } }; Copy API calls for rules Here are the API calls for naming and ignoring rules with New Relic's Node.js agent. newrelic.addNamingRule(pattern, name) Programmatic version of rules.name. Once naming rules are added, they cannot be removed until the Node process is restarted. They can also be added via the Node.js agent's configuration. Both parameters are required. newrelic.addIgnoringRule(pattern) Programmatic version of rules.ignore. Once ignoring rules are added, they cannot be removed until the Node process is restarted. They can also be added via the Node.js agent's configuration. This parameter is required.",

      "body": "Attributes are key-value pairs containing information that determines the properties of an event or transaction. You can view these key-value pairs in some places in the UI, or by querying that data using NRQL. New Relic gives users the ability to customize exactly which attributes will be sent to each of these destinations. You can also collect custom attributes to send additional data to New Relic. Attribute destination flow This diagram illustrates how an agent decides to send attributes to each destination. Agent attribute collection: An agent makes three different decisions when sending an attribute to any New Relic destination based on the relevant property settings. Property names and syntax vary by agent. (The properties in this diagram are specific to the PHP agent, but the general flow is the same for all agents. Property names and syntax vary by agent.) Types of attributes Attributes can be collected in a variety of ways: Message property attributes: These are the properties set on a message received from a queue or topic. HTTP request attributes: These are the parameters for an HTTP request. User attributes: These are attributes provided by the user through each agent's API. Agent attributes: These are attributes captured by the agent; for example, httpResponseCode and httpResponseMessage. Destinations for attributes Collected attributes appear in these locations: Collected attributes Location Transaction traces Each minute transaction traces collect data for your slowest individual HTTP requests. These traces will report attributes collected during the transaction. Traced errors If a transaction results in an error, these traced errors will be reported to APM. A traced error will contain attributes collected during the transaction. Transaction events APM transactions will contain attributes collected during the transaction. Insights page views Browser page views will contain attributes collected during the transaction. However, attributes collected at the end of a transaction may not appear on PageView events. This destination is also called browser monitoring. Span events Span events collected for distributed tracing will contain attributes collected during the span. The following agents support the addition of custom user attributes to span events: Java agent 5.13.0 and above Go agent 3.6.0 and above .NET agent 8.25 and above Node agent 6.10.0 and above PHP agent 9.12.0.268 and above Python agent 5.8.0.136 and above Ruby agent 6.8.0 and above Transaction segments Each segment in a transaction trace will contain attributes recorded for that segment. Viewing request attributes Request attributes are associated with specific transaction traces, browser traces, and errors in APM and dashboards. You can see the attributes recorded with a request when viewing the individual trace or error. Custom attributes can be queried via NRQL exactly like any other attribute. APM > (select an app) > Monitoring > Transactions > (select a transaction) > (select a trace): Here is an example from the Ruby agent of the Request attributes and Custom attributes for a transaction trace. Exact attributes depend on your agent and on your attribute configuration. Limits User attributes, request attributes, and message queue parameters are limited by count and size. Parameter Limitations Transaction Limited to 64 user attributes Attribute key Limited to 256 bytes each If the key is more than 256 bytes, then the attribute will not be recorded. Attribute value Limited to 256 bytes each If the value is greater than 256 bytes, then the attribute value will be truncated. Agent-specific attributes Each APM agent collects custom attributes. The supported attributes depend on the specific agent: C SDK Go Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby",

      "body": "Important APM's configurable security policies is available in limited release for approved New Relic accounts. APM's configurable security policies gives you granular control over configuration options related to your account's data security. This document explains how to enable account-wide security policies and the options available. For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Compatibility and requirements APM agent versions that support this feature include: C SDK: not available Go: 2.1 or higher Java: 4.1 or higher .NET: 8.1 or higher Node.js: 4.1 or higher PHP: 8.1 or higher Python: not available Ruby: 5.2 or higher Enable configurable security policies Caution Security policies apply account-wide. Once enabled, they can only be edited or disabled with the help of New Relic support. If high security mode is enabled for the account(s), do not disable it. Account-level high security mode differs from your APM agent's high security mode, which is set in the configuration file. High security mode and configurable security policies do not apply to Lambda monitoring or use of the New Relic Event API. For the limited release, there is no UI component. If you are participating in the limited release, follow this procedure to set up your accounts: Choose the accounts on which to enable configurable security policies. Choose the configurable security policies options that you want for those accounts. Inform your New Relic sales rep of the options that you have chosen. Ensure your agent versions support this feature. Update agents if necessary. When you receive the security token based on the security policies options that you chose, insert the security token into the agent configuration file(s). See examples. Delete the high security mode enabled flag from your config file(s). High security mode (HSM) at the agent level is different than high security mode at the account level. Be sure to disable HSM in the agent's config file, as explained in this procedure. Having both the security token and the HSM flag will result in the agent disconnecting. Example configuration Here are some example configuration examples for enabling the configurable security policies: Java agent: YAML example The Java agent uses a YAML file for configuration. Here is an example snippet enabling security policies: common: &default_settings license_key: 'YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' app_name: 'YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME' security_policies_token: 'YOUR_TOKEN' production: <<: *default_settings log_level: info Copy .NET agent: XML example The .NET agent uses a XML file for configuration. Here is an example snippet enabling security policies: ... <configuration agentenabled=\"true\" xmlns=\"urn:newrelic-config\"> <service licensekey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\"> <application> <name>YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME</name> </application> <securityPoliciesToken>YOUR_TOKEN</securityPoliciesToken> <log level=\"info\"> </log></service></configuration> ... Copy If you prefer to use an environment variable, it would look like this: NEW_RELIC_SECURITY_POLICIES_TOKEN=YOUR_TOKEN Copy Ruby agent: YAML example The Ruby agent uses a YAML file for configuration. Here is an example snippet enabling security policies: common: &default_settings license_key: 'YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' app_name: 'YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME' security_policies_token: 'YOUR_TOKEN' production: <<: *default_settings log_level: info Copy Available policy options Here are the settings you can choose when creating your policies. Some of these options will not be available for some agents. Setting Effect Database query collection Options: Enabled: Collects obfuscated database query data. Obfuscated queries generally appear along with slow query details in the APM or New Relic One UI. Disabled: Prevents the collection of obfuscated database query data. Raw query data is not collected once configurable security policies is enabled. attributes.include list Go, Java, .NET, Node.js, Ruby only Options: Enabled: attributes.include list functions normally; attribute keys found in the attributes.include list are recorded. Disabled: Ignores the list of allowed attributes listed in the attributes.include property in agent configuration; no intrinsic request parameter attributes will be collected. Whitelisting attributes at the account level is not supported. Raw exception messages Options: Enabled: Allows recording of all raw exception messages. Disabled: Prevents recording of all raw exception messages. The messages may be either obfuscated or completely removed, depending on the agent. Custom events Options: Enabled: Allows the recording of custom events that are created and sent up via an agent API. Disabled: Prevents recording of any custom events collect by an agent API. Custom attributes Options: Enabled: Allows for the collection of custom attributes passed in by the New Relic agent. Disabled: Prevents collection of custom attributes that are collected by the New Relic agent. Custom instrumentation editor Java only Options: Enabled: Allows custom instrumentation of the agent, using the custom instrumentation editor. Disabled: Prevents custom instrumentation of the agent using the custom instrumentation editor. Instrumentation previously done via the editor is also disabled. Access to the custom instrumentation editor is only available to New Relic account Owners and Admins. Message parameters Java and Ruby only Options: Enabled: Allows the collection of message parameters (message.parameters.*). Disabled: Prevents collection of message parameters. Job arguments Ruby only Options: Enabled: Allows the collection of job arguments (job.(type).args.*). Disabled: Prevents the collection of job arguments.

Capability Integration Browser monitoring The Ruby agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see the browser and Ruby agent documentation. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in infrastructure monitoring. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from Synthetics monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

      "body": "Attributes are key-value pairs containing information that determines the properties of an event or transaction. You can view these key-value pairs in some places in the UI, or by querying that data using NRQL. New Relic gives users the ability to customize exactly which attributes will be sent to each of these destinations. You can also collect custom attributes to send additional data to New Relic. Attribute destination flow This diagram illustrates how an agent decides to send attributes to each destination. Agent attribute collection: An agent makes three different decisions when sending an attribute to any New Relic destination based on the relevant property settings. Property names and syntax vary by agent. (The properties in this diagram are specific to the PHP agent, but the general flow is the same for all agents. Property names and syntax vary by agent.) Types of attributes Attributes can be collected in a variety of ways: Message property attributes: These are the properties set on a message received from a queue or topic. HTTP request attributes: These are the parameters for an HTTP request. User attributes: These are attributes provided by the user through each agent's API. Agent attributes: These are attributes captured by the agent; for example, httpResponseCode and httpResponseMessage. Destinations for attributes Collected attributes appear in these locations: Collected attributes Location Transaction traces Each minute transaction traces collect data for your slowest individual HTTP requests. These traces will report attributes collected during the transaction. Traced errors If a transaction results in an error, these traced errors will be reported to APM. A traced error will contain attributes collected during the transaction. Transaction events APM transactions will contain attributes collected during the transaction. Insights page views Browser page views will contain attributes collected during the transaction. However, attributes collected at the end of a transaction may not appear on PageView events. This destination is also called browser monitoring. Span events Span events collected for distributed tracing will contain attributes collected during the span. The following agents support the addition of custom user attributes to span events: Java agent 5.13.0 and above Go agent 3.6.0 and above .NET agent 8.25 and above Node agent 6.10.0 and above PHP agent 9.12.0.268 and above Python agent 5.8.0.136 and above Ruby agent 6.8.0 and above Transaction segments Each segment in a transaction trace will contain attributes recorded for that segment. Viewing request attributes Request attributes are associated with specific transaction traces, browser traces, and errors in APM and dashboards. You can see the attributes recorded with a request when viewing the individual trace or error. Custom attributes can be queried via NRQL exactly like any other attribute. APM > (select an app) > Monitoring > Transactions > (select a transaction) > (select a trace): Here is an example from the Ruby agent of the Request attributes and Custom attributes for a transaction trace. Exact attributes depend on your agent and on your attribute configuration. Limits User attributes, request attributes, and message queue parameters are limited by count and size. Parameter Limitations Transaction Limited to 64 user attributes Attribute key Limited to 256 bytes each If the key is more than 256 bytes, then the attribute will not be recorded. Attribute value Limited to 256 bytes each If the value is greater than 256 bytes, then the attribute value will be truncated. Agent-specific attributes Each APM agent collects custom attributes.

      "body": "Important APM's configurable security policies is available in limited release for approved New Relic accounts. APM's configurable security policies gives you granular control over configuration options related to your account's data security. This document explains how to enable account-wide security policies and the options available. For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Compatibility and requirements APM agent versions that support this feature include: C SDK: not available Go: 2.1 or higher Java: 4.1 or higher .NET: 8.1 or higher Node.js: 4.1 or higher PHP: 8.1 or higher Python: not available Ruby: 5.2 or higher Enable configurable security policies Caution Security policies apply account-wide. Once enabled, they can only be edited or disabled with the help of New Relic support. If high security mode is enabled for the account(s), do not disable it. Account-level high security mode differs from your APM agent's high security mode, which is set in the configuration file. High security mode and configurable security policies do not apply to Lambda monitoring or use of the New Relic Event API. For the limited release, there is no UI component. If you are participating in the limited release, follow this procedure to set up your accounts: Choose the accounts on which to enable configurable security policies. Choose the configurable security policies options that you want for those accounts. Inform your New Relic sales rep of the options that you have chosen. Ensure your agent versions support this feature. Update agents if necessary. When you receive the security token based on the security policies options that you chose, insert the security token into the agent configuration file(s). See examples. Delete the high security mode enabled flag from your config file(s). High security mode (HSM) at the agent level is different than high security mode at the account level. Be sure to disable HSM in the agent's config file, as explained in this procedure. Having both the security token and the HSM flag will result in the agent disconnecting. Example configuration Here are some example configuration examples for enabling the configurable security policies: Java agent: YAML example The Java agent uses a YAML file for configuration. Here is an example snippet enabling security policies: common: &default_settings license_key: 'YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' app_name: 'YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME' security_policies_token: 'YOUR_TOKEN' production: <<: *default_settings log_level: info Copy .NET agent: XML example The .NET agent uses a XML file for configuration. Here is an example snippet enabling security policies: ... <configuration agentenabled=\"true\" xmlns=\"urn:newrelic-config\"> <service licensekey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\"> <application> <name>YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME</name> </application> <securityPoliciesToken>YOUR_TOKEN</securityPoliciesToken> <log level=\"info\"> </log></service></configuration> ... Copy If you prefer to use an environment variable, it would look like this: NEW_RELIC_SECURITY_POLICIES_TOKEN=YOUR_TOKEN Copy Ruby agent: YAML example The Ruby agent uses a YAML file for configuration. Here is an example snippet enabling security policies: common: &default_settings license_key: 'YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' app_name: 'YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME' security_policies_token: 'YOUR_TOKEN' production: <<: *default_settings log_level: info Copy Available policy options Here are the settings you can choose when creating your policies. Some of these options will not be available for some agents. Setting Effect Database query collection Options: Enabled: Collects obfuscated database query data. Obfuscated queries generally appear along with slow query details in the APM or New Relic One UI. Disabled: Prevents the collection of obfuscated database query data. Raw query data is not collected once configurable security policies is enabled. attributes.include list Go, Java, .NET, Node.js, Ruby only Options: Enabled: attributes.include list functions normally; attribute keys found in the attributes.include list are recorded. Disabled: Ignores the list of allowed attributes listed in the attributes.include property in agent configuration; no intrinsic request parameter attributes will be collected. Whitelisting attributes at the account level is not supported. Raw exception messages Options: Enabled: Allows recording of all raw exception messages. Disabled: Prevents recording of all raw exception messages. The messages may be either obfuscated or completely removed, depending on the agent. Custom events Options: Enabled: Allows the recording of custom events that are created and sent up via an agent API. Disabled: Prevents recording of any custom events collect by an agent API. Custom attributes Options: Enabled: Allows for the collection of custom attributes passed in by the New Relic agent. Disabled: Prevents collection of custom attributes that are collected by the New Relic agent. Custom instrumentation editor Java only Options: Enabled: Allows custom instrumentation of the agent, using the custom instrumentation editor. Disabled: Prevents custom instrumentation of the agent using the custom instrumentation editor. Instrumentation previously done via the editor is also disabled. Access to the custom instrumentation editor is only available to New Relic account Owners and Admins. Message parameters Java and Ruby only Options: Enabled: Allows the collection of message parameters (message.parameters.*). Disabled: Prevents collection of message parameters. Job arguments Ruby only Options: Enabled: Allows the collection of job arguments (job.(type).args.*). Disabled: Prevents the collection of job arguments.

Capability Integration Browser monitoring The Ruby agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see the browser and Ruby agent documentation. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in infrastructure monitoring. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from Synthetics monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

      "body": "Important APM's configurable security policies is available in limited release for approved New Relic accounts. APM's configurable security policies gives you granular control over configuration options related to your account's data security. This document explains how to enable account-wide security policies and the options available. For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Compatibility and requirements APM agent versions that support this feature include: C SDK: not available Go: 2.1 or higher Java: 4.1 or higher .NET: 8.1 or higher Node.js: 4.1 or higher PHP: 8.1 or higher Python: not available Ruby: 5.2 or higher Enable configurable security policies Caution Security policies apply account-wide. Once enabled, they can only be edited or disabled with the help of New Relic support. If high security mode is enabled for the account(s), do not disable it. Account-level high security mode differs from your APM agent's high security mode, which is set in the configuration file. High security mode and configurable security policies do not apply to Lambda monitoring or use of the New Relic Event API. For the limited release, there is no UI component. If you are participating in the limited release, follow this procedure to set up your accounts: Choose the accounts on which to enable configurable security policies. Choose the configurable security policies options that you want for those accounts. Inform your New Relic sales rep of the options that you have chosen. Ensure your agent versions support this feature. Update agents if necessary. When you receive the security token based on the security policies options that you chose, insert the security token into the agent configuration file(s). See examples. Delete the high security mode enabled flag from your config file(s). High security mode (HSM) at the agent level is different than high security mode at the account level. Be sure to disable HSM in the agent's config file, as explained in this procedure. Having both the security token and the HSM flag will result in the agent disconnecting. Example configuration Here are some example configuration examples for enabling the configurable security policies: Java agent: YAML example The Java agent uses a YAML file for configuration. Here is an example snippet enabling security policies: common: &default_settings license_key: 'YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' app_name: 'YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME' security_policies_token: 'YOUR_TOKEN' production: <<: *default_settings log_level: info Copy .NET agent: XML example The .NET agent uses a XML file for configuration. Here is an example snippet enabling security policies: ... <configuration agentenabled=\"true\" xmlns=\"urn:newrelic-config\"> <service licensekey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\"> <application> <name>YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME</name> </application> <securityPoliciesToken>YOUR_TOKEN</securityPoliciesToken> <log level=\"info\"> </log></service></configuration> ... Copy If you prefer to use an environment variable, it would look like this: NEW_RELIC_SECURITY_POLICIES_TOKEN=YOUR_TOKEN Copy Ruby agent: YAML example The Ruby agent uses a YAML file for configuration. Here is an example snippet enabling security policies: common: &default_settings license_key: 'YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' app_name: 'YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME' security_policies_token: 'YOUR_TOKEN' production: <<: *default_settings log_level: info Copy Available policy options Here are the settings you can choose when creating your policies. Some of these options will not be available for some agents. Setting Effect Database query collection Options: Enabled: Collects obfuscated database query data. Obfuscated queries generally appear along with slow query details in the APM or New Relic One UI. Disabled: Prevents the collection of obfuscated database query data. Raw query data is not collected once configurable security policies is enabled. attributes.include list Go, Java, .NET, Node.js, Ruby only Options: Enabled: attributes.include list functions normally; attribute keys found in the attributes.include list are recorded. Disabled: Ignores the list of allowed attributes listed in the attributes.include property in agent configuration; no intrinsic request parameter attributes will be collected. Whitelisting attributes at the account level is not supported. Raw exception messages Options: Enabled: Allows recording of all raw exception messages. Disabled: Prevents recording of all raw exception messages. The messages may be either obfuscated or completely removed, depending on the agent. Custom events Options: Enabled: Allows the recording of custom events that are created and sent up via an agent API. Disabled: Prevents recording of any custom events collect by an agent API. Custom attributes Options: Enabled: Allows for the collection of custom attributes passed in by the New Relic agent. Disabled: Prevents collection of custom attributes that are collected by the New Relic agent. Custom instrumentation editor Java only Options: Enabled: Allows custom instrumentation of the agent, using the custom instrumentation editor. Disabled: Prevents custom instrumentation of the agent using the custom instrumentation editor. Instrumentation previously done via the editor is also disabled. Access to the custom instrumentation editor is only available to New Relic account Owners and Admins. Message parameters Java and Ruby only Options: Enabled: Allows the collection of message parameters (message.parameters.*). Disabled: Prevents collection of message parameters. Job arguments Ruby only Options: Enabled: Allows the collection of job arguments (job.(type).args.*). Disabled: Prevents the collection of job arguments. For more help For more information about configuration file settings, refer to your specific agent's documentation.

      "body": "Our Ruby agent automatically instruments several common background job frameworks. You can also customize it to trace any background tasks. Data from background jobs appears in the Transactions page in APM as Non-web transactions. Supported frameworks The following background job frameworks are supported by default in recent versions of the Ruby agent: Resque instrumentation (Ruby agent 3.4.0) Sidekiq instrumentation (Ruby agent 3.6.0) Delayed::Job instrumentation (Ruby agent 2.10) Important JRuby users may see issues with CPU metrics. If you are using these frameworks, monitoring background jobs typically doesn't require additional configuration. Monitor custom background jobs You can instrument custom background jobs to appear in the APM Transactions page as Non-web transactions. To monitor Non-web transactions while using an unsupported framework, you must add custom instrumentation. As an example, a background job periodically runs a task called SalesOrganization#find_new_leads. Add the ControllerInstrumentation module. Use the add_transaction_tracer directive below the method definition Add :category => :task to tell the agent this trace is a Non-web transaction. require 'newrelic_rpm' class SalesOrganization include ::NewRelic::Agent::Instrumentation::ControllerInstrumentation def find_new_leads ... end add_transaction_tracer :find_new_leads, :category => :task end Copy You can pass a string to the :category, but values will only appear on the APM Transactions page if the string begins with OtherTransaction/. Monitor custom background methods Using the Ruby agent API, you can designate specific methods to trace the Non-web transactions. This gathers traces for slow running jobs and associates captured errors to transactions. To instrument a class method, use the class singleton. As an example, a background job periodically runs a task called SalesOrganization#find_new_leads. Add the ControllerInstrumentation module below the method definition. Use the add_transaction_tracer directive Add :category => :task to tell the agent this trace is a Non-web transaction. require 'newrelic_rpm' class SalesOrganization def self.find_new_leads ... end class << self include ::NewRelic::Agent::Instrumentation::ControllerInstrumentation add_transaction_tracer :find_new_leads, :category => :task end end Copy For more information, see Ruby custom metrics. Monitor short-lived processes Make sure the process isn't running before the agent connects to the back-end servers. To do so, make the Ruby agent synchronously connect to New Relic, rather than the default asynchronous behavior. Use manual_start and pass in the :sync_startup => true option: require 'new_relic/agent' NewRelic::Agent.manual_start(:sync_startup => true) Copy Using require 'new_relic/agent' will require the agent's code, and it will make sure the agent doesn't run until you manually start it. If the process is shorter than the agent harvest cycle, you need to manually shut down the agent with ::NewRelic::Agents.shutdown to ensure all queued data is sent. Configure newrelic.yml for background processes Configuring your newrelic.yml depends on the context of the background application. Non-Rails background application If your background app is non-Rails application already running the Ruby agent, copy your newrelic.yml file to the directory where you launch the background job or in the config subdirectory. Make sure it includes your license key. Background jobs that do not run in a Rails context will examine the NEW_RELIC_ENV environment variable to determine which section of the configuration file to read, falling back to the RUBY_ENV, RAILS_ENV, and RACK_ENV environment variables in sequence, and finally defaulting to development if none of these environment variables are set. Background job environment monitored by New Relic If your background job runs in the context of an existing web application that is already monitored with New Relic, the Ruby agent will automatically pick up your existing newrelic.yml file. Background jobs that boot your application's Rails environment will use the RAILS_ENV environment variable in order to determine which section of the newrelic.yml file to read. Report to an alternate application name You can make jobs that run in the context of an existing New Relic web application appear under a different application name in the APM UI. Begin before newrelic_rpm gets required by your worker code. Set the NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME environment variable to the application name to use for your background jobs when starting your background worker processes. This will override the app_name setting in your newrelic.yml. $ NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"My Background Jobs\" ./bin/my_background_worker.rb Copy Ensure the agent starts The Ruby agent will automatically start in most cases as soon as you require 'newrelic_rpm', unless the agent detects a blacklisted executable name, rake task name, or constant. This prevents it from starting during common rake tasks and interactive console sessions. Non-Rails standalone script Standalone scripts running without Rails generally will start the agent as soon as they require 'newrelic_rpm'. If you have a script that forks or daemonizes before it begins its main work, you may want to defer this require call until after the initial setup finishes. Background tasks with daemons gem If you use the daemons gem to start background tasks, the Ruby agent may fail to start and also not emit any logging. This happens because the daemons gem changes the working directory to / before executing your background code. The agent then attempts to resolve the paths to its configuration file and log file relative to the current working directory of the host process. To allow the agent to start in this situation, set environment variables with the locations of the agent configuration file and log file; for example: ENV['NRCONFIG'] ||= File.dirname(__FILE__) + '/../../config/newrelic.yml' ENV['NEW_RELIC_LOG'] ||= File.dirname(__FILE__) + '/../../log/newrelic_agent.log' Copy For more information, see the documentation about controlling agent startup Monitor scripts The agent startup instructions apply when running background jobs in a daemon. If a script executes a single background task and exits, manually shut down the agent with ::NewRelic::Agents.shutdown when the script finishes. This ensures the New Relic collector receives the data. For example: require 'newrelic_rpm' class SalesOrganization include ::NewRelic::Agent::Instrumentation::ControllerInstrumentation def find_new_leads ... end add_transaction_tracer :find_new_leads, :category => :task end SalesOrganization.new.find_new_leads ::NewRelic::Agent.shutdown Copy For more help Additional documentation resources include: Ruby custom metrics (method tracers, metric names, stats, examples Ruby agent API (public API methods for the New Relic Ruby agent)",

You can configure these two settings independently. Resque versions 1.23.1 or higher If you are running Resque 1.23.1 or higher, you should not need to make any code changes outside of the normal agent installation procedures in order for New Relic's Resque instrumentation to work. Exception: If you have leftover calls to NewRelic::Agent methods from your Resque before_first_fork, before_fork, or after_fork hooks from when you were running an older version of Resque, be sure to remove those calls after upgrading to Resque 1.23.1 or higher. Alternate forking modes The resque-multi-job-forks or resque-jobs-per-fork gems change the forking behavior of Resque so that it will not fork for each individual job, but instead fork once per batch of jobs. Similarly, you can set the FORK_PER_JOB environment variable to false in order to completely disable forking in Resque. If you use any of these alternate forking modes in your application, make sure you are running Ruby agent version 3.9.7 or higher. Earlier versions of the Ruby agent do not work correctly with these alternate forking modes. If you are upgrading to 3.9.7 or higher, make sure to remove any direct calls to NewRelic::Agent methods such as manual_start or after_fork that you may have previously been using in order to get the agent to work in these environments. Old Resque versions ( < 1.23.1) It is possible to use New Relic's Ruby agent with Resque versions older than 1.23.1. However, New Relic recommends that you upgrade to Resque 1.23.1 or higher for best results. Many applications use the hooks exposed by Resque (before_fork, after_fork, etc.) in order to inject custom code at critical points during the lifetime of Resque jobs. The New Relic Ruby agent also must use these hooks in order to be able to place its instrumentation. Resque versions before 1.23.1 do not allow hooks to be defined multiple times; the last definition will take precedence. If you cannot upgrade to a Resque version >= 1.23.1 (which allows hooks to be defined multiple times without overwriting each other), you can modify your custom Resque hooks by adding the necessary New Relic code. Here is an example. Example: Modifying custom Resque hooks You may omit definitions for any hooks that you have no custom code for. They will be automatically installed by the agent in this case. Resque.before_first_fork do # ... your custom hook code ... NewRelic::Agent.manual_start(:dispatcher => :resque, :sync_startup => true, :start_channel_listener => true) end Resque.before_fork do |job| # ... your custom hook code ... NewRelic::Agent.register_report_channel(job.object_id) end Resque.after_fork do |job| # ... your custom hook code ... NewRelic::Agent.after_fork(:report_to_channel => job.object_id, :report_instance_busy => false) end Copy Deadlocking jobs Some customers (particularly those with very high job throughput) have reported intermittent deadlocks in their Resque worker processes with the Ruby agent enabled. These deadlocks are due to a bad interaction between the background thread that the Ruby agent uses to send data to New Relic servers and Resque's forking behavior. Use either of these options to resolve these issues: Disable Resque's forking behavior by setting the FORK_PER_JOB environment variable to false when spawning Resque processes. Use the resolv-replace library from Ruby's standard library to replace Ruby's native DNS resolution code with a pure Ruby version. The Ruby agent uses a background thread in the Resque master process to send data to the New Relic collector. In some environments, this thread will acquire a native lock during DNS resolution (when resolving the hostnames of New Relic collectors). If this native lock is held by the background thread while the main Resque master process's main thread calls fork to create a child process, it will still be marked as held in the forked child process. However, since fork only copies the calling thread, the background thread that was holding the native lock will not exist in the child process, and thus the native lock will never be released. If the child process attempts to do any DNS resolution, it will attempt to acquire the same native lock and deadlock. To avoid this Github issue, use resolv-replace instead of Ruby's default DNS resolution path.",

      "body": "Our Ruby agent automatically instruments several common background job frameworks. You can also customize it to trace any background tasks. Data from background jobs appears in the Transactions page in APM as Non-web transactions. Supported frameworks The following background job frameworks are supported by default in recent versions of the Ruby agent: Resque instrumentation (Ruby agent 3.4.0) Sidekiq instrumentation (Ruby agent 3.6.0) Delayed::Job instrumentation (Ruby agent 2.10) Important JRuby users may see issues with CPU metrics. If you are using these frameworks, monitoring background jobs typically doesn't require additional configuration. Monitor custom background jobs You can instrument custom background jobs to appear in the APM Transactions page as Non-web transactions. To monitor Non-web transactions while using an unsupported framework, you must add custom instrumentation. As an example, a background job periodically runs a task called SalesOrganization#find_new_leads. Add the ControllerInstrumentation module. Use the add_transaction_tracer directive below the method definition Add :category => :task to tell the agent this trace is a Non-web transaction. require 'newrelic_rpm' class SalesOrganization include ::NewRelic::Agent::Instrumentation::ControllerInstrumentation def find_new_leads ... end add_transaction_tracer :find_new_leads, :category => :task end Copy You can pass a string to the :category, but values will only appear on the APM Transactions page if the string begins with OtherTransaction/. Monitor custom background methods Using the Ruby agent API, you can designate specific methods to trace the Non-web transactions. This gathers traces for slow running jobs and associates captured errors to transactions. To instrument a class method, use the class singleton. As an example, a background job periodically runs a task called SalesOrganization#find_new_leads. Add the ControllerInstrumentation module below the method definition. Use the add_transaction_tracer directive Add :category => :task to tell the agent this trace is a Non-web transaction. require 'newrelic_rpm' class SalesOrganization def self.find_new_leads ... end class << self include ::NewRelic::Agent::Instrumentation::ControllerInstrumentation add_transaction_tracer :find_new_leads, :category => :task end end Copy For more information, see Ruby custom metrics. Monitor short-lived processes Make sure the process isn't running before the agent connects to the back-end servers. To do so, make the Ruby agent synchronously connect to New Relic, rather than the default asynchronous behavior. Use manual_start and pass in the :sync_startup => true option: require 'new_relic/agent' NewRelic::Agent.manual_start(:sync_startup => true) Copy Using require 'new_relic/agent' will require the agent's code, and it will make sure the agent doesn't run until you manually start it. If the process is shorter than the agent harvest cycle, you need to manually shut down the agent with ::NewRelic::Agents.shutdown to ensure all queued data is sent. Configure newrelic.yml for background processes Configuring your newrelic.yml depends on the context of the background application. Non-Rails background application If your background app is non-Rails application already running the Ruby agent, copy your newrelic.yml file to the directory where you launch the background job or in the config subdirectory. Make sure it includes your license key. Background jobs that do not run in a Rails context will examine the NEW_RELIC_ENV environment variable to determine which section of the configuration file to read, falling back to the RUBY_ENV, RAILS_ENV, and RACK_ENV environment variables in sequence, and finally defaulting to development if none of these environment variables are set. Background job environment monitored by New Relic If your background job runs in the context of an existing web application that is already monitored with New Relic, the Ruby agent will automatically pick up your existing newrelic.yml file. Background jobs that boot your application's Rails environment will use the RAILS_ENV environment variable in order to determine which section of the newrelic.yml file to read. Report to an alternate application name You can make jobs that run in the context of an existing New Relic web application appear under a different application name in the APM UI. Begin before newrelic_rpm gets required by your worker code. Set the NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME environment variable to the application name to use for your background jobs when starting your background worker processes. This will override the app_name setting in your newrelic.yml. $ NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"My Background Jobs\" ./bin/my_background_worker.rb Copy Ensure the agent starts The Ruby agent will automatically start in most cases as soon as you require 'newrelic_rpm', unless the agent detects a blacklisted executable name, rake task name, or constant. This prevents it from starting during common rake tasks and interactive console sessions. Non-Rails standalone script Standalone scripts running without Rails generally will start the agent as soon as they require 'newrelic_rpm'. If you have a script that forks or daemonizes before it begins its main work, you may want to defer this require call until after the initial setup finishes. Background tasks with daemons gem If you use the daemons gem to start background tasks, the Ruby agent may fail to start and also not emit any logging. This happens because the daemons gem changes the working directory to / before executing your background code. The agent then attempts to resolve the paths to its configuration file and log file relative to the current working directory of the host process. To allow the agent to start in this situation, set environment variables with the locations of the agent configuration file and log file; for example: ENV['NRCONFIG'] ||= File.dirname(__FILE__) + '/../../config/newrelic.yml' ENV['NEW_RELIC_LOG'] ||= File.dirname(__FILE__) + '/../../log/newrelic_agent.log' Copy For more information, see the documentation about controlling agent startup Monitor scripts The agent startup instructions apply when running background jobs in a daemon. If a script executes a single background task and exits, manually shut down the agent with ::NewRelic::Agents.shutdown when the script finishes. This ensures the New Relic collector receives the data. For example: require 'newrelic_rpm' class SalesOrganization include ::NewRelic::Agent::Instrumentation::ControllerInstrumentation def find_new_leads ... end add_transaction_tracer :find_new_leads, :category => :task end SalesOrganization.new.find_new_leads ::NewRelic::Agent.shutdown Copy For more help Additional documentation resources include: Ruby custom metrics (method tracers, metric names, stats, examples Ruby agent API (public API methods for the New Relic Ruby agent)",

      "body": "Our Ruby agent automatically instruments several common background job frameworks. You can also customize it to trace any background tasks. Data from background jobs appears in the Transactions page in APM as Non-web transactions. Supported frameworks The following background job frameworks are supported by default in recent versions of the Ruby agent: Resque instrumentation (Ruby agent 3.4.0) Sidekiq instrumentation (Ruby agent 3.6.0) Delayed::Job instrumentation (Ruby agent 2.10) Important JRuby users may see issues with CPU metrics. If you are using these frameworks, monitoring background jobs typically doesn't require additional configuration. Monitor custom background jobs You can instrument custom background jobs to appear in the APM Transactions page as Non-web transactions. To monitor Non-web transactions while using an unsupported framework, you must add custom instrumentation. As an example, a background job periodically runs a task called SalesOrganization#find_new_leads. Add the ControllerInstrumentation module. Use the add_transaction_tracer directive below the method definition Add :category => :task to tell the agent this trace is a Non-web transaction. require 'newrelic_rpm' class SalesOrganization include ::NewRelic::Agent::Instrumentation::ControllerInstrumentation def find_new_leads ... end add_transaction_tracer :find_new_leads, :category => :task end Copy You can pass a string to the :category, but values will only appear on the APM Transactions page if the string begins with OtherTransaction/. Monitor custom background methods Using the Ruby agent API, you can designate specific methods to trace the Non-web transactions. This gathers traces for slow running jobs and associates captured errors to transactions. To instrument a class method, use the class singleton. As an example, a background job periodically runs a task called SalesOrganization#find_new_leads. Add the ControllerInstrumentation module below the method definition. Use the add_transaction_tracer directive Add :category => :task to tell the agent this trace is a Non-web transaction. require 'newrelic_rpm' class SalesOrganization def self.find_new_leads ... end class << self include ::NewRelic::Agent::Instrumentation::ControllerInstrumentation add_transaction_tracer :find_new_leads, :category => :task end end Copy For more information, see Ruby custom metrics. Monitor short-lived processes Make sure the process isn't running before the agent connects to the back-end servers. To do so, make the Ruby agent synchronously connect to New Relic, rather than the default asynchronous behavior. Use manual_start and pass in the :sync_startup => true option: require 'new_relic/agent' NewRelic::Agent.manual_start(:sync_startup => true) Copy Using require 'new_relic/agent' will require the agent's code, and it will make sure the agent doesn't run until you manually start it. If the process is shorter than the agent harvest cycle, you need to manually shut down the agent with ::NewRelic::Agents.shutdown to ensure all queued data is sent. Configure newrelic.yml for background processes Configuring your newrelic.yml depends on the context of the background application. Non-Rails background application If your background app is non-Rails application already running the Ruby agent, copy your newrelic.yml file to the directory where you launch the background job or in the config subdirectory. Make sure it includes your license key. Background jobs that do not run in a Rails context will examine the NEW_RELIC_ENV environment variable to determine which section of the configuration file to read, falling back to the RUBY_ENV, RAILS_ENV, and RACK_ENV environment variables in sequence, and finally defaulting to development if none of these environment variables are set. Background job environment monitored by New Relic If your background job runs in the context of an existing web application that is already monitored with New Relic, the Ruby agent will automatically pick up your existing newrelic.yml file. Background jobs that boot your application's Rails environment will use the RAILS_ENV environment variable in order to determine which section of the newrelic.yml file to read. Report to an alternate application name You can make jobs that run in the context of an existing New Relic web application appear under a different application name in the APM UI. Begin before newrelic_rpm gets required by your worker code. Set the NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME environment variable to the application name to use for your background jobs when starting your background worker processes. This will override the app_name setting in your newrelic.yml. $ NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"My Background Jobs\" ./bin/my_background_worker.rb Copy Ensure the agent starts The Ruby agent will automatically start in most cases as soon as you require 'newrelic_rpm', unless the agent detects a blacklisted executable name, rake task name, or constant. This prevents it from starting during common rake tasks and interactive console sessions. Non-Rails standalone script Standalone scripts running without Rails generally will start the agent as soon as they require 'newrelic_rpm'. If you have a script that forks or daemonizes before it begins its main work, you may want to defer this require call until after the initial setup finishes. Background tasks with daemons gem If you use the daemons gem to start background tasks, the Ruby agent may fail to start and also not emit any logging. This happens because the daemons gem changes the working directory to / before executing your background code. The agent then attempts to resolve the paths to its configuration file and log file relative to the current working directory of the host process. To allow the agent to start in this situation, set environment variables with the locations of the agent configuration file and log file; for example: ENV['NRCONFIG'] ||= File.dirname(__FILE__) + '/../../config/newrelic.yml' ENV['NEW_RELIC_LOG'] ||= File.dirname(__FILE__) + '/../../log/newrelic_agent.log' Copy For more information, see the documentation about controlling agent startup Monitor scripts The agent startup instructions apply when running background jobs in a daemon. If a script executes a single background task and exits, manually shut down the agent with ::NewRelic::Agents.shutdown when the script finishes. This ensures the New Relic collector receives the data. For example: require 'newrelic_rpm' class SalesOrganization include ::NewRelic::Agent::Instrumentation::ControllerInstrumentation def find_new_leads ... end add_transaction_tracer :find_new_leads, :category => :task end SalesOrganization.new.find_new_leads ::NewRelic::Agent.shutdown Copy For more help Additional documentation resources include: Ruby custom metrics (method tracers, metric names, stats, examples Ruby agent API (public API methods for the New Relic Ruby agent)",

Data for background jobs appears in APM's Transactions page, complete with transaction traces and errors, by selecting Non-web transactions as the transaction type. Capture job arguments Starting with Ruby agent version 3.6.9, you can optionally configure the Ruby agent to capture Sidekiq job arguments in transaction traces and traced errors. This can be especially useful in attempting to reproduce failed jobs. By default this feature is off in case your job arguments contain sensitive information. To enable this feature, edit your newrelic.yml as appropriate for your agent version: newrelic_rpm 3.12.0 or higher: attributes.include: job.sidekiq.args.* newrelic_rpm 3.6.9 to 3.11.x: sidekiq.capture_params: true Tip This feature is distinct from the generic capture_params top-level setting, which controls whether HTTP request parameters are captured on transaction traces and traced errors for web requests. You can configure these two settings independently. Troubleshoot Sidekiq jobs If it appears that jobs are not being monitored, review your newrelic_agent.log file generated when the worker starts. It should indicate whether the agent detects Sidekiq and communicates with the server. If you need support, note the exact command line that you used to start Sidekiq.",

      "body": "Our Ruby agent automatically instruments several common background job frameworks. You can also customize it to trace any background tasks. Data from background jobs appears in the Transactions page in APM as Non-web transactions. Supported frameworks The following background job frameworks are supported by default in recent versions of the Ruby agent: Resque instrumentation (Ruby agent 3.4.0) Sidekiq instrumentation (Ruby agent 3.6.0) Delayed::Job instrumentation (Ruby agent 2.10) Important JRuby users may see issues with CPU metrics. If you are using these frameworks, monitoring background jobs typically doesn't require additional configuration. Monitor custom background jobs You can instrument custom background jobs to appear in the APM Transactions page as Non-web transactions. To monitor Non-web transactions while using an unsupported framework, you must add custom instrumentation. As an example, a background job periodically runs a task called SalesOrganization#find_new_leads. Add the ControllerInstrumentation module. Use the add_transaction_tracer directive below the method definition Add :category => :task to tell the agent this trace is a Non-web transaction. require 'newrelic_rpm' class SalesOrganization include ::NewRelic::Agent::Instrumentation::ControllerInstrumentation def find_new_leads ... end add_transaction_tracer :find_new_leads, :category => :task end Copy You can pass a string to the :category, but values will only appear on the APM Transactions page if the string begins with OtherTransaction/. Monitor custom background methods Using the Ruby agent API, you can designate specific methods to trace the Non-web transactions. This gathers traces for slow running jobs and associates captured errors to transactions. To instrument a class method, use the class singleton. As an example, a background job periodically runs a task called SalesOrganization#find_new_leads. Add the ControllerInstrumentation module below the method definition. Use the add_transaction_tracer directive Add :category => :task to tell the agent this trace is a Non-web transaction. require 'newrelic_rpm' class SalesOrganization def self.find_new_leads ... end class << self include ::NewRelic::Agent::Instrumentation::ControllerInstrumentation add_transaction_tracer :find_new_leads, :category => :task end end Copy For more information, see Ruby custom metrics. Monitor short-lived processes Make sure the process isn't running before the agent connects to the back-end servers. To do so, make the Ruby agent synchronously connect to New Relic, rather than the default asynchronous behavior. Use manual_start and pass in the :sync_startup => true option: require 'new_relic/agent' NewRelic::Agent.manual_start(:sync_startup => true) Copy Using require 'new_relic/agent' will require the agent's code, and it will make sure the agent doesn't run until you manually start it. If the process is shorter than the agent harvest cycle, you need to manually shut down the agent with ::NewRelic::Agents.shutdown to ensure all queued data is sent. Configure newrelic.yml for background processes Configuring your newrelic.yml depends on the context of the background application. Non-Rails background application If your background app is non-Rails application already running the Ruby agent, copy your newrelic.yml file to the directory where you launch the background job or in the config subdirectory. Make sure it includes your license key. Background jobs that do not run in a Rails context will examine the NEW_RELIC_ENV environment variable to determine which section of the configuration file to read, falling back to the RUBY_ENV, RAILS_ENV, and RACK_ENV environment variables in sequence, and finally defaulting to development if none of these environment variables are set. Background job environment monitored by New Relic If your background job runs in the context of an existing web application that is already monitored with New Relic, the Ruby agent will automatically pick up your existing newrelic.yml file. Background jobs that boot your application's Rails environment will use the RAILS_ENV environment variable in order to determine which section of the newrelic.yml file to read. Report to an alternate application name You can make jobs that run in the context of an existing New Relic web application appear under a different application name in the APM UI. Begin before newrelic_rpm gets required by your worker code. Set the NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME environment variable to the application name to use for your background jobs when starting your background worker processes. This will override the app_name setting in your newrelic.yml. $ NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"My Background Jobs\" ./bin/my_background_worker.rb Copy Ensure the agent starts The Ruby agent will automatically start in most cases as soon as you require 'newrelic_rpm', unless the agent detects a blacklisted executable name, rake task name, or constant. This prevents it from starting during common rake tasks and interactive console sessions. Non-Rails standalone script Standalone scripts running without Rails generally will start the agent as soon as they require 'newrelic_rpm'. If you have a script that forks or daemonizes before it begins its main work, you may want to defer this require call until after the initial setup finishes. Background tasks with daemons gem If you use the daemons gem to start background tasks, the Ruby agent may fail to start and also not emit any logging. This happens because the daemons gem changes the working directory to / before executing your background code. The agent then attempts to resolve the paths to its configuration file and log file relative to the current working directory of the host process. To allow the agent to start in this situation, set environment variables with the locations of the agent configuration file and log file; for example: ENV['NRCONFIG'] ||= File.dirname(__FILE__) + '/../../config/newrelic.yml' ENV['NEW_RELIC_LOG'] ||= File.dirname(__FILE__) + '/../../log/newrelic_agent.log' Copy For more information, see the documentation about controlling agent startup Monitor scripts The agent startup instructions apply when running background jobs in a daemon. If a script executes a single background task and exits, manually shut down the agent with ::NewRelic::Agents.shutdown when the script finishes. This ensures the New Relic collector receives the data. For example: require 'newrelic_rpm' class SalesOrganization include ::NewRelic::Agent::Instrumentation::ControllerInstrumentation def find_new_leads ... end add_transaction_tracer :find_new_leads, :category => :task end SalesOrganization.new.find_new_leads ::NewRelic::Agent.shutdown Copy For more help Additional documentation resources include: Ruby custom metrics (method tracers, metric names, stats, examples Ruby agent API (public API methods for the New Relic Ruby agent)",

      "body": "In addition to your web application itself, the New Relic Ruby agent can also instrument your Resque jobs. Capturing job arguments Starting with Ruby agent version 3.6.9, you can optionally configure the Ruby agent to capture Resque job arguments in transaction traces and traced errors. This can be especially useful in attempting to reproduce failed jobs. By default this feature is off in case your job arguments contain sensitive information. To enable this feature, edit your newrelic.yml as appropriate for your agent version: For newrelic_rpm 3.12.0 or higher: attributes.include: job.resque.args.* For newrelic_rpm 3.6.9 to 3.11.X: resque.capture_params: true This feature is distinct from the generic capture_params top-level setting, which controls whether HTTP request parameters are captured on transaction traces and traced errors for web requests. You can configure these two settings independently. Resque versions 1.23.1 or higher If you are running Resque 1.23.1 or higher, you should not need to make any code changes outside of the normal agent installation procedures in order for New Relic's Resque instrumentation to work. Exception: If you have leftover calls to NewRelic::Agent methods from your Resque before_first_fork, before_fork, or after_fork hooks from when you were running an older version of Resque, be sure to remove those calls after upgrading to Resque 1.23.1 or higher. Alternate forking modes The resque-multi-job-forks or resque-jobs-per-fork gems change the forking behavior of Resque so that it will not fork for each individual job, but instead fork once per batch of jobs. Similarly, you can set the FORK_PER_JOB environment variable to false in order to completely disable forking in Resque. If you use any of these alternate forking modes in your application, make sure you are running Ruby agent version 3.9.7 or higher. Earlier versions of the Ruby agent do not work correctly with these alternate forking modes. If you are upgrading to 3.9.7 or higher, make sure to remove any direct calls to NewRelic::Agent methods such as manual_start or after_fork that you may have previously been using in order to get the agent to work in these environments. Old Resque versions ( < 1.23.1) It is possible to use New Relic's Ruby agent with Resque versions older than 1.23.1. However, New Relic recommends that you upgrade to Resque 1.23.1 or higher for best results. Many applications use the hooks exposed by Resque (before_fork, after_fork, etc.) in order to inject custom code at critical points during the lifetime of Resque jobs. The New Relic Ruby agent also must use these hooks in order to be able to place its instrumentation. Resque versions before 1.23.1 do not allow hooks to be defined multiple times; the last definition will take precedence. If you cannot upgrade to a Resque version >= 1.23.1 (which allows hooks to be defined multiple times without overwriting each other), you can modify your custom Resque hooks by adding the necessary New Relic code. Here is an example. Example: Modifying custom Resque hooks You may omit definitions for any hooks that you have no custom code for. They will be automatically installed by the agent in this case. Resque.before_first_fork do # ... your custom hook code ... NewRelic::Agent.manual_start(:dispatcher => :resque, :sync_startup => true, :start_channel_listener => true) end Resque.before_fork do |job| # ... your custom hook code ... NewRelic::Agent.register_report_channel(job.object_id) end Resque.after_fork do |job| # ... your custom hook code ... NewRelic::Agent.after_fork(:report_to_channel => job.object_id, :report_instance_busy => false) end Copy Deadlocking jobs Some customers (particularly those with very high job throughput) have reported intermittent deadlocks in their Resque worker processes with the Ruby agent enabled. These deadlocks are due to a bad interaction between the background thread that the Ruby agent uses to send data to New Relic servers and Resque's forking behavior. Use either of these options to resolve these issues: Disable Resque's forking behavior by setting the FORK_PER_JOB environment variable to false when spawning Resque processes. Use the resolv-replace library from Ruby's standard library to replace Ruby's native DNS resolution code with a pure Ruby version. The Ruby agent uses a background thread in the Resque master process to send data to the New Relic collector. In some environments, this thread will acquire a native lock during DNS resolution (when resolving the hostnames of New Relic collectors). If this native lock is held by the background thread while the main Resque master process's main thread calls fork to create a child process, it will still be marked as held in the forked child process. However, since fork only copies the calling thread, the background thread that was holding the native lock will not exist in the child process, and thus the native lock will never be released. If the child process attempts to do any DNS resolution, it will attempt to acquire the same native lock and deadlock. To avoid this Github issue, use resolv-replace instead of Ruby's default DNS resolution path.",

      "body": "Important APM's configurable security policies is available in limited release for approved New Relic accounts. APM's configurable security policies gives you granular control over configuration options related to your account's data security. This document explains how to enable account-wide security policies and the options available. For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Compatibility and requirements APM agent versions that support this feature include: C SDK: not available Go: 2.1 or higher Java: 4.1 or higher .NET: 8.1 or higher Node.js: 4.1 or higher PHP: 8.1 or higher Python: not available Ruby: 5.2 or higher Enable configurable security policies Caution Security policies apply account-wide. Once enabled, they can only be edited or disabled with the help of New Relic support. If high security mode is enabled for the account(s), do not disable it. Account-level high security mode differs from your APM agent's high security mode, which is set in the configuration file. High security mode and configurable security policies do not apply to Lambda monitoring or use of the New Relic Event API. For the limited release, there is no UI component. If you are participating in the limited release, follow this procedure to set up your accounts: Choose the accounts on which to enable configurable security policies. Choose the configurable security policies options that you want for those accounts. Inform your New Relic sales rep of the options that you have chosen. Ensure your agent versions support this feature. Update agents if necessary. When you receive the security token based on the security policies options that you chose, insert the security token into the agent configuration file(s). See examples. Delete the high security mode enabled flag from your config file(s). High security mode (HSM) at the agent level is different than high security mode at the account level. Be sure to disable HSM in the agent's config file, as explained in this procedure. Having both the security token and the HSM flag will result in the agent disconnecting. Example configuration Here are some example configuration examples for enabling the configurable security policies: Java agent: YAML example The Java agent uses a YAML file for configuration.

Capability Integration Browser monitoring The Ruby agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see the browser and Ruby agent documentation. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in infrastructure monitoring. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from Synthetics monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

      "body": "New Relic has APM language agents for C, Go, Java, Node.js, .NET, PHP, Python, and Ruby. Each of these offers several ways to leverage the power of distributed tracing: Quick start for standard distributed tracing (recommended): A fast way to get started Infinite Tracing: An advanced alternative to standard distributed tracing Older APM agents: Tracing options if you have older APM agents Manual instrumentation: Tips if automatic instrumentation doesn't work Tip If you want to get more background before getting started, check out these topics: How span sampling works explains distributed tracing options. Impacts to APM tells you what to expect if you are a current APM user but haven't set up distributed tracing. Quick start for standard distributed tracing (recommended): This is the best approach to set up standard distributed tracing if you haven't installed any APM agents for your services yet, or if you want to instrument additional services. Tip You'll need a New Relic account to set up distributed tracing. If you don't already have one, you can quickly create a free account. Step 1. Identify services Figure out which services you want to instrument so they each send trace data to New Relic. Step 2. Instrument each service with an APM agent We have installation assistants for a variety of languages to help you instrument each service. You should run the installation assistant for each service you want to instrument to ensure that each installation has a unique application name. To start the assistant, click the link for your language: APM: C APM: Golang APM: Java APM: .NET APM: Node.js APM: PHP APM: Python APM: Ruby Tip This quick-start approach with the installation assistant automatically enables distributed tracing for each service you run it on, but if you already have a APM agent that you want to participate in distributed tracing, you'll need to manually enable distributed tracing. See Options for older APM agents. Step 3. View traces After you instrument each of your services with APM agents, generate some traffic in your application so we can capture some traces. Here are two ways to view your traces in the UI: View traces that include a specific service Here's one way you can see traces for a particular service: Go to one.newrelic.com. Click APM in the top menu bar. Click your service. In the left navigation's Monitor section, click Distributed tracing. If you don't see the traces you want, you can filter by the trace.id. View traces across accounts This option allows you to search all traces across all New Relic accounts in your organization that you have access to. Go to one.newrelic.com. Click Browse data in the top menu bar, and then click Traces. Select your entity in the left pane. If you don't see the traces you want, you can filter by the trace.id. For more help finding your traces in the UI: Understand and use the distributed tracing UI Query distributed trace data Set up Infinite Tracing (advanced option) Standard distributed tracing for APM agents (above) captures up to 10% of your traces, but if you want us to analyze all your data and find the most relevant traces, you can set up Infinite Tracing. This alternative to standard distributed tracing is available for all APM language agents except C SDK. Tip To learn more about this feature, see Infinite Tracing. Before beginning, first ensure you meet the requirements. Step 1. Complete the instrumentation for standard distributed tracing in the quick start above The Infinite Tracing setup builds on the instrumentation step from the Quick start for standard distributed tracing. Step 2. Set up the trace observer The trace observer is a New Relic AWS-based service that collects and analyzes all your traces. Follow the instructions in Set up trace observer. When you're done, return here with your trace observer information and continue with the next step to configure the agent. Step 3: Configure the agent for Infinite Tracing Infinite Tracing configuration settings include the standard distributed tracing plus information about the trace observer. Find the settings for your language agent below: C SDK Infinite tracing is not available for C SDK. Go Here's an overview of the settings.

(Optional) Customize Infinite Tracing After you add the agent configuration settings, you should start seeing data in the New Relic UI. After you spend some time analyzing your data, you may want to adjust some of the features of Infinite Tracing: Configure trace observer monitoring Configure span attribute trace filter Configure random trace filter Options for older APM agents If you have older APM agents, use this section to figure out if the distributed tracing features you want are supported. Following the compatibility information is a section showing the basic configuration settings to turn on standard distributed tracing. If your older agent supports Infinite Tracing and you want to set it up, see the steps above.

Manual instrumentation (If automatic instrumentation doesn't work) Recommendation: Before performing any custom instrumentation, read: How distributed tracing works Troubleshoot missing data If a service is not passing the trace header to other services, you can use the distributed tracing payload APIs to instrument the calling service and the called service. The calling service uses an API call to generate a payload, which is accepted by the called service. Instrument the calling service To instrument the calling service: Ensure the version of the APM agent that monitors the calling service supports distributed tracing. Invoke the agent API call for generating a distributed trace payload: C SDK | Go | Java | .NET | Node.js | PHP | Python | Ruby. Important To maintain proper ordering of spans in a trace, ensure you generate the payload in the context of the span that sends it. Add that payload to the call made to the destination service (for example, in a header). (Optional) Identify the call as an external call: C SDK Go Java .NET: n/a Node.js PHP: n/a Python Ruby Instrument the called service To instrument the called service: Ensure the version of the APM agent that monitors the called service supports distributed tracing. If the New Relic agent on the called service does not identify a New Relic transaction, use the agent API to declare a transaction: C SDK One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload() is called, a NULL pointer is returned. To solve this problem, follow the procedures to create a transaction with the C SDK. Go One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when Transaction.InsertDistributedTraceHeaders(h http.Header) is called, no headers are inserted. To create a transaction, see Instrument Go transactions. Java One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when Transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(Headers) is called, no headers are inserted (this API requires agent 6.4.0+). To create a transaction, see Java agent transaction-related APIs. .NET One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: CreateDistributedTracePayload() returns an empty payload. To create a transaction, see Introduction to .NET custom instrumentation. Node.js One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: the Node.js agent logs will report an error similar to this: No transaction found when calling Transaction.acceptDistributedTracePayload. Copy Use startWebTransaction to create a web transaction or startBackgroundTransaction to capture a non-web transaction. PHP One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers() returns false. To create a transaction, see newrelic_start_transaction. Python To tell that a transaction is not in progress: when transaction = current_transaction() is run, transaction is None. Or, if result = accept_distributed_trace_payload(payload) is run, then the result is False. Use background_task to report a non-web transaction. For more on Python instrumentation, see Monitor transactions and segments. Ruby If you are using a Rack-based web framework and have enabled New Relic's Rack instrumentation, the Ruby agent will handle starting a transaction for you. For other use cases, see the add_transaction_tracer API method. Extract the payload from the call that you received (for example, in a header). Invoke the call for accepting the payload: C SDK | Go | Java | .NET | PHP | Node.js | Python | Ruby.",

      "body": "Important APM's configurable security policies is available in limited release for approved New Relic accounts. APM's configurable security policies gives you granular control over configuration options related to your account's data security. This document explains how to enable account-wide security policies and the options available. For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Compatibility and requirements APM agent versions that support this feature include: C SDK: not available Go: 2.1 or higher Java: 4.1 or higher .NET: 8.1 or higher Node.js: 4.1 or higher PHP: 8.1 or higher Python: not available Ruby: 5.2 or higher Enable configurable security policies Caution Security policies apply account-wide. Once enabled, they can only be edited or disabled with the help of New Relic support. If high security mode is enabled for the account(s), do not disable it. Account-level high security mode differs from your APM agent's high security mode, which is set in the configuration file. High security mode and configurable security policies do not apply to Lambda monitoring or use of the New Relic Event API. For the limited release, there is no UI component. If you are participating in the limited release, follow this procedure to set up your accounts: Choose the accounts on which to enable configurable security policies. Choose the configurable security policies options that you want for those accounts. Inform your New Relic sales rep of the options that you have chosen. Ensure your agent versions support this feature. Update agents if necessary. When you receive the security token based on the security policies options that you chose, insert the security token into the agent configuration file(s). See examples. Delete the high security mode enabled flag from your config file(s). High security mode (HSM) at the agent level is different than high security mode at the account level. Be sure to disable HSM in the agent's config file, as explained in this procedure. Having both the security token and the HSM flag will result in the agent disconnecting. Example configuration Here are some example configuration examples for enabling the configurable security policies: Java agent: YAML example The Java agent uses a YAML file for configuration. Here is an example snippet enabling security policies: common: &default_settings license_key: 'YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' app_name: 'YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME' security_policies_token: 'YOUR_TOKEN' production: <<: *default_settings log_level: info Copy .NET agent: XML example The .NET agent uses a XML file for configuration. Here is an example snippet enabling security policies: ... <configuration agentenabled=\"true\" xmlns=\"urn:newrelic-config\"> <service licensekey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\"> <application> <name>YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME</name> </application> <securityPoliciesToken>YOUR_TOKEN</securityPoliciesToken> <log level=\"info\"> </log></service></configuration> ... Copy If you prefer to use an environment variable, it would look like this: NEW_RELIC_SECURITY_POLICIES_TOKEN=YOUR_TOKEN Copy Ruby agent: YAML example The Ruby agent uses a YAML file for configuration. Here is an example snippet enabling security policies: common: &default_settings license_key: 'YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' app_name: 'YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME' security_policies_token: 'YOUR_TOKEN' production: <<: *default_settings log_level: info Copy Available policy options Here are the settings you can choose when creating your policies.

      "body": "New Relic has APM language agents for C, Go, Java, Node.js, .NET, PHP, Python, and Ruby. Each of these offers several ways to leverage the power of distributed tracing: Quick start for standard distributed tracing (recommended): A fast way to get started Infinite Tracing: An advanced alternative to standard distributed tracing Older APM agents: Tracing options if you have older APM agents Manual instrumentation: Tips if automatic instrumentation doesn't work Tip If you want to get more background before getting started, check out these topics: How span sampling works explains distributed tracing options. Impacts to APM tells you what to expect if you are a current APM user but haven't set up distributed tracing. Quick start for standard distributed tracing (recommended): This is the best approach to set up standard distributed tracing if you haven't installed any APM agents for your services yet, or if you want to instrument additional services. Tip You'll need a New Relic account to set up distributed tracing. If you don't already have one, you can quickly create a free account. Step 1. Identify services Figure out which services you want to instrument so they each send trace data to New Relic. Step 2. Instrument each service with an APM agent We have installation assistants for a variety of languages to help you instrument each service. You should run the installation assistant for each service you want to instrument to ensure that each installation has a unique application name. To start the assistant, click the link for your language: APM: C APM: Golang APM: Java APM: .NET APM: Node.js APM: PHP APM: Python APM: Ruby Tip This quick-start approach with the installation assistant automatically enables distributed tracing for each service you run it on, but if you already have a APM agent that you want to participate in distributed tracing, you'll need to manually enable distributed tracing. See Options for older APM agents. Step 3. View traces After you instrument each of your services with APM agents, generate some traffic in your application so we can capture some traces. Here are two ways to view your traces in the UI: View traces that include a specific service Here's one way you can see traces for a particular service: Go to one.newrelic.com. Click APM in the top menu bar. Click your service. In the left navigation's Monitor section, click Distributed tracing. If you don't see the traces you want, you can filter by the trace.id. View traces across accounts This option allows you to search all traces across all New Relic accounts in your organization that you have access to. Go to one.newrelic.com. Click Browse data in the top menu bar, and then click Traces. Select your entity in the left pane. If you don't see the traces you want, you can filter by the trace.id. For more help finding your traces in the UI: Understand and use the distributed tracing UI Query distributed trace data Set up Infinite Tracing (advanced option) Standard distributed tracing for APM agents (above) captures up to 10% of your traces, but if you want us to analyze all your data and find the most relevant traces, you can set up Infinite Tracing. This alternative to standard distributed tracing is available for all APM language agents except C SDK. Tip To learn more about this feature, see Infinite Tracing. Before beginning, first ensure you meet the requirements. Step 1. Complete the instrumentation for standard distributed tracing in the quick start above The Infinite Tracing setup builds on the instrumentation step from the Quick start for standard distributed tracing. Step 2. Set up the trace observer The trace observer is a New Relic AWS-based service that collects and analyzes all your traces. Follow the instructions in Set up trace observer. When you're done, return here with your trace observer information and continue with the next step to configure the agent. Step 3: Configure the agent for Infinite Tracing Infinite Tracing configuration settings include the standard distributed tracing plus information about the trace observer. Find the settings for your language agent below: C SDK Infinite tracing is not available for C SDK. Go Here's an overview of the settings.

For applications using Bundler, additionally include the Infinite Tracing gem in the Gemfile: gem 'newrelic-infinite_tracing' Copy If you're using Rails 3 or higher, or Rails 2.3 in the recommended configuration, Rails will automatically call Bundler.require and cause newrelic-infinite_tracing to be required during startup of your application. If you're using Sinatra or another framework, you must manually call require 'newrelic/infinite_tracing' or manually call Bundler.require.

(Optional) Customize Infinite Tracing After you add the agent configuration settings, you should start seeing data in the New Relic UI. After you spend some time analyzing your data, you may want to adjust some of the features of Infinite Tracing: Configure trace observer monitoring Configure span attribute trace filter Configure random trace filter Options for older APM agents If you have older APM agents, use this section to figure out if the distributed tracing features you want are supported. Following the compatibility information is a section showing the basic configuration settings to turn on standard distributed tracing. If your older agent supports Infinite Tracing and you want to set it up, see the steps above.

Manual instrumentation (If automatic instrumentation doesn't work) Recommendation: Before performing any custom instrumentation, read: How distributed tracing works Troubleshoot missing data If a service is not passing the trace header to other services, you can use the distributed tracing payload APIs to instrument the calling service and the called service. The calling service uses an API call to generate a payload, which is accepted by the called service. Instrument the calling service To instrument the calling service: Ensure the version of the APM agent that monitors the calling service supports distributed tracing. Invoke the agent API call for generating a distributed trace payload: C SDK | Go | Java | .NET | Node.js | PHP | Python | Ruby. Important To maintain proper ordering of spans in a trace, ensure you generate the payload in the context of the span that sends it. Add that payload to the call made to the destination service (for example, in a header). (Optional) Identify the call as an external call: C SDK Go Java .NET: n/a Node.js PHP: n/a Python Ruby Instrument the called service To instrument the called service: Ensure the version of the APM agent that monitors the called service supports distributed tracing. If the New Relic agent on the called service does not identify a New Relic transaction, use the agent API to declare a transaction: C SDK One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload() is called, a NULL pointer is returned. To solve this problem, follow the procedures to create a transaction with the C SDK. Go One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when Transaction.InsertDistributedTraceHeaders(h http.Header) is called, no headers are inserted. To create a transaction, see Instrument Go transactions. Java One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when Transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(Headers) is called, no headers are inserted (this API requires agent 6.4.0+). To create a transaction, see Java agent transaction-related APIs. .NET One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: CreateDistributedTracePayload() returns an empty payload. To create a transaction, see Introduction to .NET custom instrumentation. Node.js One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: the Node.js agent logs will report an error similar to this: No transaction found when calling Transaction.acceptDistributedTracePayload. Copy Use startWebTransaction to create a web transaction or startBackgroundTransaction to capture a non-web transaction. PHP One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers() returns false. To create a transaction, see newrelic_start_transaction. Python To tell that a transaction is not in progress: when transaction = current_transaction() is run, transaction is None. Or, if result = accept_distributed_trace_payload(payload) is run, then the result is False. Use background_task to report a non-web transaction. For more on Python instrumentation, see Monitor transactions and segments. Ruby If you are using a Rack-based web framework and have enabled New Relic's Rack instrumentation, the Ruby agent will handle starting a transaction for you. For other use cases, see the add_transaction_tracer API method. Extract the payload from the call that you received (for example, in a header). Invoke the call for accepting the payload: C SDK | Go | Java | .NET | PHP | Node.js | Python | Ruby.",

      "body": "Important APM's configurable security policies is available in limited release for approved New Relic accounts. APM's configurable security policies gives you granular control over configuration options related to your account's data security. This document explains how to enable account-wide security policies and the options available. For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Compatibility and requirements APM agent versions that support this feature include: C SDK: not available Go: 2.1 or higher Java: 4.1 or higher .NET: 8.1 or higher Node.js: 4.1 or higher PHP: 8.1 or higher Python: not available Ruby: 5.2 or higher Enable configurable security policies Caution Security policies apply account-wide. Once enabled, they can only be edited or disabled with the help of New Relic support. If high security mode is enabled for the account(s), do not disable it. Account-level high security mode differs from your APM agent's high security mode, which is set in the configuration file. High security mode and configurable security policies do not apply to Lambda monitoring or use of the New Relic Event API. For the limited release, there is no UI component. If you are participating in the limited release, follow this procedure to set up your accounts: Choose the accounts on which to enable configurable security policies. Choose the configurable security policies options that you want for those accounts. Inform your New Relic sales rep of the options that you have chosen. Ensure your agent versions support this feature. Update agents if necessary. When you receive the security token based on the security policies options that you chose, insert the security token into the agent configuration file(s). See examples. Delete the high security mode enabled flag from your config file(s). High security mode (HSM) at the agent level is different than high security mode at the account level. Be sure to disable HSM in the agent's config file, as explained in this procedure. Having both the security token and the HSM flag will result in the agent disconnecting. Example configuration Here are some example configuration examples for enabling the configurable security policies: Java agent: YAML example The Java agent uses a YAML file for configuration. Here is an example snippet enabling security policies: common: &default_settings license_key: 'YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' app_name: 'YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME' security_policies_token: 'YOUR_TOKEN' production: <<: *default_settings log_level: info Copy .NET agent: XML example The .NET agent uses a XML file for configuration. Here is an example snippet enabling security policies: ... <configuration agentenabled=\"true\" xmlns=\"urn:newrelic-config\"> <service licensekey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\"> <application> <name>YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME</name> </application> <securityPoliciesToken>YOUR_TOKEN</securityPoliciesToken> <log level=\"info\"> </log></service></configuration> ... Copy If you prefer to use an environment variable, it would look like this: NEW_RELIC_SECURITY_POLICIES_TOKEN=YOUR_TOKEN Copy Ruby agent: YAML example The Ruby agent uses a YAML file for configuration.

Some of these options will not be available for some agents. Setting Effect Database query collection Options: Enabled: Collects obfuscated database query data. Obfuscated queries generally appear along with slow query details in the APM or New Relic One UI. Disabled: Prevents the collection of obfuscated database query data. Raw query data is not collected once configurable security policies is enabled. attributes.include list Go, Java, .NET, Node.js, Ruby only Options: Enabled: attributes.include list functions normally; attribute keys found in the attributes.include list are recorded. Disabled: Ignores the list of allowed attributes listed in the attributes.include property in agent configuration; no intrinsic request parameter attributes will be collected. Whitelisting attributes at the account level is not supported. Raw exception messages Options: Enabled: Allows recording of all raw exception messages. Disabled: Prevents recording of all raw exception messages. The messages may be either obfuscated or completely removed, depending on the agent. Custom events Options: Enabled: Allows the recording of custom events that are created and sent up via an agent API. Disabled: Prevents recording of any custom events collect by an agent API. Custom attributes Options: Enabled: Allows for the collection of custom attributes passed in by the New Relic agent. Disabled: Prevents collection of custom attributes that are collected by the New Relic agent. Custom instrumentation editor Java only Options: Enabled: Allows custom instrumentation of the agent, using the custom instrumentation editor. Disabled: Prevents custom instrumentation of the agent using the custom instrumentation editor. Instrumentation previously done via the editor is also disabled. Access to the custom instrumentation editor is only available to New Relic account Owners and Admins. Message parameters Java and Ruby only Options: Enabled: Allows the collection of message parameters (message.parameters.*). Disabled: Prevents collection of message parameters.

      "body": "New Relic has APM language agents for C, Go, Java, Node.js, .NET, PHP, Python, and Ruby. Each of these offers several ways to leverage the power of distributed tracing: Quick start for standard distributed tracing (recommended): A fast way to get started Infinite Tracing: An advanced alternative to standard distributed tracing Older APM agents: Tracing options if you have older APM agents Manual instrumentation: Tips if automatic instrumentation doesn't work Tip If you want to get more background before getting started, check out these topics: How span sampling works explains distributed tracing options. Impacts to APM tells you what to expect if you are a current APM user but haven't set up distributed tracing. Quick start for standard distributed tracing (recommended): This is the best approach to set up standard distributed tracing if you haven't installed any APM agents for your services yet, or if you want to instrument additional services. Tip You'll need a New Relic account to set up distributed tracing. If you don't already have one, you can quickly create a free account. Step 1. Identify services Figure out which services you want to instrument so they each send trace data to New Relic. Step 2. Instrument each service with an APM agent We have installation assistants for a variety of languages to help you instrument each service. You should run the installation assistant for each service you want to instrument to ensure that each installation has a unique application name. To start the assistant, click the link for your language: APM: C APM: Golang APM: Java APM: .NET APM: Node.js APM: PHP APM: Python APM: Ruby Tip This quick-start approach with the installation assistant automatically enables distributed tracing for each service you run it on, but if you already have a APM agent that you want to participate in distributed tracing, you'll need to manually enable distributed tracing. See Options for older APM agents. Step 3. View traces After you instrument each of your services with APM agents, generate some traffic in your application so we can capture some traces. Here are two ways to view your traces in the UI: View traces that include a specific service Here's one way you can see traces for a particular service: Go to one.newrelic.com. Click APM in the top menu bar. Click your service. In the left navigation's Monitor section, click Distributed tracing. If you don't see the traces you want, you can filter by the trace.id. View traces across accounts This option allows you to search all traces across all New Relic accounts in your organization that you have access to. Go to one.newrelic.com. Click Browse data in the top menu bar, and then click Traces. Select your entity in the left pane. If you don't see the traces you want, you can filter by the trace.id. For more help finding your traces in the UI: Understand and use the distributed tracing UI Query distributed trace data Set up Infinite Tracing (advanced option) Standard distributed tracing for APM agents (above) captures up to 10% of your traces, but if you want us to analyze all your data and find the most relevant traces, you can set up Infinite Tracing. This alternative to standard distributed tracing is available for all APM language agents except C SDK. Tip To learn more about this feature, see Infinite Tracing. Before beginning, first ensure you meet the requirements. Step 1. Complete the instrumentation for standard distributed tracing in the quick start above The Infinite Tracing setup builds on the instrumentation step from the Quick start for standard distributed tracing. Step 2. Set up the trace observer The trace observer is a New Relic AWS-based service that collects and analyzes all your traces. Follow the instructions in Set up trace observer. When you're done, return here with your trace observer information and continue with the next step to configure the agent. Step 3: Configure the agent for Infinite Tracing Infinite Tracing configuration settings include the standard distributed tracing plus information about the trace observer. Find the settings for your language agent below: C SDK Infinite tracing is not available for C SDK. Go Here's an overview of the settings.

For applications using Bundler, additionally include the Infinite Tracing gem in the Gemfile: gem 'newrelic-infinite_tracing' Copy If you're using Rails 3 or higher, or Rails 2.3 in the recommended configuration, Rails will automatically call Bundler.require and cause newrelic-infinite_tracing to be required during startup of your application. If you're using Sinatra or another framework, you must manually call require 'newrelic/infinite_tracing' or manually call Bundler.require.

(Optional) Customize Infinite Tracing After you add the agent configuration settings, you should start seeing data in the New Relic UI. After you spend some time analyzing your data, you may want to adjust some of the features of Infinite Tracing: Configure trace observer monitoring Configure span attribute trace filter Configure random trace filter Options for older APM agents If you have older APM agents, use this section to figure out if the distributed tracing features you want are supported. Following the compatibility information is a section showing the basic configuration settings to turn on standard distributed tracing. If your older agent supports Infinite Tracing and you want to set it up, see the steps above.

Manual instrumentation (If automatic instrumentation doesn't work) Recommendation: Before performing any custom instrumentation, read: How distributed tracing works Troubleshoot missing data If a service is not passing the trace header to other services, you can use the distributed tracing payload APIs to instrument the calling service and the called service. The calling service uses an API call to generate a payload, which is accepted by the called service. Instrument the calling service To instrument the calling service: Ensure the version of the APM agent that monitors the calling service supports distributed tracing. Invoke the agent API call for generating a distributed trace payload: C SDK | Go | Java | .NET | Node.js | PHP | Python | Ruby. Important To maintain proper ordering of spans in a trace, ensure you generate the payload in the context of the span that sends it. Add that payload to the call made to the destination service (for example, in a header). (Optional) Identify the call as an external call: C SDK Go Java .NET: n/a Node.js PHP: n/a Python Ruby Instrument the called service To instrument the called service: Ensure the version of the APM agent that monitors the called service supports distributed tracing. If the New Relic agent on the called service does not identify a New Relic transaction, use the agent API to declare a transaction: C SDK One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload() is called, a NULL pointer is returned. To solve this problem, follow the procedures to create a transaction with the C SDK. Go One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when Transaction.InsertDistributedTraceHeaders(h http.Header) is called, no headers are inserted. To create a transaction, see Instrument Go transactions. Java One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when Transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(Headers) is called, no headers are inserted (this API requires agent 6.4.0+). To create a transaction, see Java agent transaction-related APIs. .NET One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: CreateDistributedTracePayload() returns an empty payload. To create a transaction, see Introduction to .NET custom instrumentation. Node.js One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: the Node.js agent logs will report an error similar to this: No transaction found when calling Transaction.acceptDistributedTracePayload. Copy Use startWebTransaction to create a web transaction or startBackgroundTransaction to capture a non-web transaction. PHP One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers() returns false. To create a transaction, see newrelic_start_transaction. Python To tell that a transaction is not in progress: when transaction = current_transaction() is run, transaction is None. Or, if result = accept_distributed_trace_payload(payload) is run, then the result is False. Use background_task to report a non-web transaction. For more on Python instrumentation, see Monitor transactions and segments. Ruby If you are using a Rack-based web framework and have enabled New Relic's Rack instrumentation, the Ruby agent will handle starting a transaction for you. For other use cases, see the add_transaction_tracer API method. Extract the payload from the call that you received (for example, in a header). Invoke the call for accepting the payload: C SDK | Go | Java | .NET | PHP | Node.js | Python | Ruby.",

      "body": "Caution Developer mode is deprecated and no longer supported as of Ruby agent version 4.1.0. The New Relic Ruby agent includes Developer mode, a built-in UI for examining details about web transactions in your application. With Developer mode, you can examine the library and database calls made by the controller actions as they are invoked on the Rails instance. The free Developer mode gives you some of the same in-depth transaction visibility you get with New Relic's transaction traces feature. However, it works only in a single Rails instance, and it has much higher overhead than the production version. It is not recommended for use beyond a developer's desktop sandbox. Security considerations The Ruby agent's Developer mode, which is on by default when the RAILS_ENV == \"development\", does not communicate with the New Relic collector in any way. Pie charts are rendered using Google Charts, which involves an HTTP post of aggregate data. Tip The Ruby agent's Production mode, which is on by default when the RAILS_ENV == \"production\" and RAILS_ENV == \"staging\", does communicate with the New Relic site. For more information, see Security. Installation To install Developer mode, install Ruby agent as a plugin or gem. You may also need to set developer_mode to true in your newrelic.yml for the RAILS_ENV in which you are working. Developer mode is on by default only when RAILS_ENV = development. While a newrelic.yml file will be created as part of the installation, it is not necessary to have a valid license key. Known issues Known issues with Developer mode include: Requires Rails 2.3 or higher Developer mode in recent agents only works on Rails 2.3 or higher. It is rack based, and earlier versions of the framework did not incorporate rack. The developer edition installs a middleware in your app that responds to any URL prepended with /newrelic; for example, /newrelic, /newrelic/files/images/foo.png, etc. In some cases the /newrelic URL gets captured by an earlier middleware. In this situation, disable the Developer mode route and include the middleware yourself: At the beginning of the file, in config.ru: require 'newrelic_rpm' require 'new_relic/rack/developer_mode' use NewRelic::Rack::DeveloperMode Copy Incompatible with Pow Developer mode is not supported from Pow, a zero-config Rack server for Mac OS X. Using Developer mode If you run your application on your desktop using thin, WEBrick, or something similar, open the URL /newrelic on your server to see the Developer mode user interface. Caution If you are using Passenger, Unicorn, or other forking application servers on your desktop, you may notice some odd behavior with disappearing data if your application server launches multiple instances. Refer to the Troubleshooting tips, which follow. Developer Mode Breakdown Chart Troubleshooting Troubleshooting tips for Developer mode: Disappearing requests If you have this problem with Unicorn or other multi-worker dispatchers, try limiting the number of workers to 1. Undefined method path for Rack::Request Some users may see an undefined method path for #<Rack::Request>. If you are using Rails version 2.3.2, then you are mostly likely running into a problem with the way the Rack dependency was defined in the Rails package. Either upgrade to 2.3.3 (or higher), or define Rack version 1.0.1 as a dependency in your Gemfile. ActiveRecord reloads Developer mode reloads ActiveRecord method definitions for every reload and reports the time spent defining the methods (such as define_attribute_method). This does not happen in production. To get real results to compare, add the following to the development environment: config.cache_classes = true Copy",

Capability Integration Browser monitoring The Ruby agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see the browser and Ruby agent documentation. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in infrastructure monitoring. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from Synthetics monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

      "body": "With the Ruby agent, you can add browser monitoring agent instrumentation to your webpages either automatically or manually. To enable browser monitoring in the UI, follow the procedures to install the browser agent. Then follow the procedures in this section to set up the Ruby agent. Requirements Automatic browser instrumentation is supported for most recent versions of Rails: New Relic Ruby agent (version 3.0.1 or higher) For automatic instrumentation: Rails 2.3 or higher For manual instrumentation: Rails 2.0 to 2.2 Use auto-instrumentation Automatic instrumentation works with Rack, and requires Rails 2.3 or higher. Configure the agent to automatically instrument pages with end user monitoring scripts, by adding or editing the following flag in newrelic.yml. browser_monitoring: auto_instrument: true Copy This is the simplest way to monitor end users. The Ruby agent examines each page from your application and automatically injects the browser JavaScript in the header. Auto-instrumentation works for environments that support Rack. For performance reasons the agent scans only the first 50k of your application's response for the header instrumentation point. In cases where a X-UA-Compatible meta tag is present and the <head> tag is longer than 50k, auto-instrumentation will fail gracefully. Auto-instrumentation will look for an X-UA-Compatible meta tag and insert the JavaScript directly after it. If the auto-instrumentation cannot find an X-UA-Compatible meta tag, it will insert after the opening head tag, and failing that it will insert after the opening body tag. If any of these tags are wrapped in conditionals or comments, the automatic instrumentation will likely fail. If auto-instrumentation fails to correctly instrument your application’s pages, then you must manually instrument via agent API. Manually instrument via agent API If you are using Rails 2.1 to 2.2 or cannot use auto-instrumentation, you can still set up end user monitoring manually by including appropriate scripts in your pages. Use the New Relic Ruby agent's API to generate the script to be inserted into your pages. For example, to modify your application's template to call the agent, use: <head> <%= ::NewRelic::Agent.browser_timing_header rescue \"\" %> ... existing template code ... </head> Copy CSP Nonce support CSP Nonce usage in our browser instrumentation is supported in version 7.1.0+ of the Ruby agent. To use a nonce with the browser instrumentation, you must disable browser monitoring auto instrumentation and use the manual instrumentation via the agent API. You may now pass a nonce as an argument into the API method to allow the agent to insert the nonce into the browser instrumentation. For example, NewRelic::Agent.browser_timing_header(nonce). Troubleshooting If you do not see any browser data being reported, view the HTML source and confirm two blocks of script similar to this in your HTML head: <script type=\"text/javascript\">window.NREUM||(NREUM={});...</script> Copy If these are not present, check the auto-instrumentation settings or the placement of manual instrumentation in your template files. In versions of the Ruby agent prior to 3.7.0, <%=::NewRelic::Agent.browser_timing_footer rescue \"\" %> also needed to be called as close to the bottom of the document as possible. With 3.7.0, all the required script is included by browser_timing_header. browser_timing_footer returns an empty string for compatibility. Disable auto-instrumentation The default value of auto-instrument is true (even when unspecified). To disable auto-instrumentation, set this flag to false. To disable auto-instrumentation only for certain controllers or controller actions, use newrelic_ignore_enduser. Server-side instrumentation will be unaffected by this call.",

      "body": "Caution Developer mode is deprecated and no longer supported as of Ruby agent version 4.1.0. The New Relic Ruby agent includes Developer mode, a built-in UI for examining details about web transactions in your application. With Developer mode, you can examine the library and database calls made by the controller actions as they are invoked on the Rails instance. The free Developer mode gives you some of the same in-depth transaction visibility you get with New Relic's transaction traces feature. However, it works only in a single Rails instance, and it has much higher overhead than the production version. It is not recommended for use beyond a developer's desktop sandbox. Security considerations The Ruby agent's Developer mode, which is on by default when the RAILS_ENV == \"development\", does not communicate with the New Relic collector in any way. Pie charts are rendered using Google Charts, which involves an HTTP post of aggregate data. Tip The Ruby agent's Production mode, which is on by default when the RAILS_ENV == \"production\" and RAILS_ENV == \"staging\", does communicate with the New Relic site. For more information, see Security. Installation To install Developer mode, install Ruby agent as a plugin or gem. You may also need to set developer_mode to true in your newrelic.yml for the RAILS_ENV in which you are working. Developer mode is on by default only when RAILS_ENV = development. While a newrelic.yml file will be created as part of the installation, it is not necessary to have a valid license key. Known issues Known issues with Developer mode include: Requires Rails 2.3 or higher Developer mode in recent agents only works on Rails 2.3 or higher. It is rack based, and earlier versions of the framework did not incorporate rack. The developer edition installs a middleware in your app that responds to any URL prepended with /newrelic; for example, /newrelic, /newrelic/files/images/foo.png, etc. In some cases the /newrelic URL gets captured by an earlier middleware. In this situation, disable the Developer mode route and include the middleware yourself: At the beginning of the file, in config.ru: require 'newrelic_rpm' require 'new_relic/rack/developer_mode' use NewRelic::Rack::DeveloperMode Copy Incompatible with Pow Developer mode is not supported from Pow, a zero-config Rack server for Mac OS X. Using Developer mode If you run your application on your desktop using thin, WEBrick, or something similar, open the URL /newrelic on your server to see the Developer mode user interface.

Capability Integration Browser monitoring The Ruby agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see the browser and Ruby agent documentation. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in infrastructure monitoring. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from Synthetics monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

      "body": "With the Ruby agent, you can add browser monitoring agent instrumentation to your webpages either automatically or manually. To enable browser monitoring in the UI, follow the procedures to install the browser agent. Then follow the procedures in this section to set up the Ruby agent. Requirements Automatic browser instrumentation is supported for most recent versions of Rails: New Relic Ruby agent (version 3.0.1 or higher) For automatic instrumentation: Rails 2.3 or higher For manual instrumentation: Rails 2.0 to 2.2 Use auto-instrumentation Automatic instrumentation works with Rack, and requires Rails 2.3 or higher. Configure the agent to automatically instrument pages with end user monitoring scripts, by adding or editing the following flag in newrelic.yml. browser_monitoring: auto_instrument: true Copy This is the simplest way to monitor end users. The Ruby agent examines each page from your application and automatically injects the browser JavaScript in the header. Auto-instrumentation works for environments that support Rack. For performance reasons the agent scans only the first 50k of your application's response for the header instrumentation point. In cases where a X-UA-Compatible meta tag is present and the <head> tag is longer than 50k, auto-instrumentation will fail gracefully. Auto-instrumentation will look for an X-UA-Compatible meta tag and insert the JavaScript directly after it. If the auto-instrumentation cannot find an X-UA-Compatible meta tag, it will insert after the opening head tag, and failing that it will insert after the opening body tag. If any of these tags are wrapped in conditionals or comments, the automatic instrumentation will likely fail. If auto-instrumentation fails to correctly instrument your application’s pages, then you must manually instrument via agent API. Manually instrument via agent API If you are using Rails 2.1 to 2.2 or cannot use auto-instrumentation, you can still set up end user monitoring manually by including appropriate scripts in your pages. Use the New Relic Ruby agent's API to generate the script to be inserted into your pages. For example, to modify your application's template to call the agent, use: <head> <%= ::NewRelic::Agent.browser_timing_header rescue \"\" %> ... existing template code ... </head> Copy CSP Nonce support CSP Nonce usage in our browser instrumentation is supported in version 7.1.0+ of the Ruby agent. To use a nonce with the browser instrumentation, you must disable browser monitoring auto instrumentation and use the manual instrumentation via the agent API. You may now pass a nonce as an argument into the API method to allow the agent to insert the nonce into the browser instrumentation. For example, NewRelic::Agent.browser_timing_header(nonce). Troubleshooting If you do not see any browser data being reported, view the HTML source and confirm two blocks of script similar to this in your HTML head: <script type=\"text/javascript\">window.NREUM||(NREUM={});...</script> Copy If these are not present, check the auto-instrumentation settings or the placement of manual instrumentation in your template files. In versions of the Ruby agent prior to 3.7.0, <%=::NewRelic::Agent.browser_timing_footer rescue \"\" %> also needed to be called as close to the bottom of the document as possible. With 3.7.0, all the required script is included by browser_timing_header. browser_timing_footer returns an empty string for compatibility. Disable auto-instrumentation The default value of auto-instrument is true (even when unspecified). To disable auto-instrumentation, set this flag to false. To disable auto-instrumentation only for certain controllers or controller actions, use newrelic_ignore_enduser. Server-side instrumentation will be unaffected by this call.",

      "body": "Caution Developer mode is deprecated and no longer supported as of Ruby agent version 4.1.0. The New Relic Ruby agent includes Developer mode, a built-in UI for examining details about web transactions in your application. With Developer mode, you can examine the library and database calls made by the controller actions as they are invoked on the Rails instance. The free Developer mode gives you some of the same in-depth transaction visibility you get with New Relic's transaction traces feature. However, it works only in a single Rails instance, and it has much higher overhead than the production version. It is not recommended for use beyond a developer's desktop sandbox. Security considerations The Ruby agent's Developer mode, which is on by default when the RAILS_ENV == \"development\", does not communicate with the New Relic collector in any way. Pie charts are rendered using Google Charts, which involves an HTTP post of aggregate data. Tip The Ruby agent's Production mode, which is on by default when the RAILS_ENV == \"production\" and RAILS_ENV == \"staging\", does communicate with the New Relic site. For more information, see Security. Installation To install Developer mode, install Ruby agent as a plugin or gem. You may also need to set developer_mode to true in your newrelic.yml for the RAILS_ENV in which you are working. Developer mode is on by default only when RAILS_ENV = development. While a newrelic.yml file will be created as part of the installation, it is not necessary to have a valid license key. Known issues Known issues with Developer mode include: Requires Rails 2.3 or higher Developer mode in recent agents only works on Rails 2.3 or higher. It is rack based, and earlier versions of the framework did not incorporate rack. The developer edition installs a middleware in your app that responds to any URL prepended with /newrelic; for example, /newrelic, /newrelic/files/images/foo.png, etc. In some cases the /newrelic URL gets captured by an earlier middleware. In this situation, disable the Developer mode route and include the middleware yourself: At the beginning of the file, in config.ru: require 'newrelic_rpm' require 'new_relic/rack/developer_mode' use NewRelic::Rack::DeveloperMode Copy Incompatible with Pow Developer mode is not supported from Pow, a zero-config Rack server for Mac OS X. Using Developer mode If you run your application on your desktop using thin, WEBrick, or something similar, open the URL /newrelic on your server to see the Developer mode user interface. Caution If you are using Passenger, Unicorn, or other forking application servers on your desktop, you may notice some odd behavior with disappearing data if your application server launches multiple instances.

      "body": "Caution Developer mode is deprecated and no longer supported as of Ruby agent version 4.1.0. The New Relic Ruby agent includes Developer mode, a built-in UI for examining details about web transactions in your application. With Developer mode, you can examine the library and database calls made by the controller actions as they are invoked on the Rails instance. The free Developer mode gives you some of the same in-depth transaction visibility you get with New Relic's transaction traces feature. However, it works only in a single Rails instance, and it has much higher overhead than the production version. It is not recommended for use beyond a developer's desktop sandbox. Security considerations The Ruby agent's Developer mode, which is on by default when the RAILS_ENV == \"development\", does not communicate with the New Relic collector in any way. Pie charts are rendered using Google Charts, which involves an HTTP post of aggregate data. Tip The Ruby agent's Production mode, which is on by default when the RAILS_ENV == \"production\" and RAILS_ENV == \"staging\", does communicate with the New Relic site. For more information, see Security. Installation To install Developer mode, install Ruby agent as a plugin or gem. You may also need to set developer_mode to true in your newrelic.yml for the RAILS_ENV in which you are working. Developer mode is on by default only when RAILS_ENV = development. While a newrelic.yml file will be created as part of the installation, it is not necessary to have a valid license key. Known issues Known issues with Developer mode include: Requires Rails 2.3 or higher Developer mode in recent agents only works on Rails 2.3 or higher. It is rack based, and earlier versions of the framework did not incorporate rack. The developer edition installs a middleware in your app that responds to any URL prepended with /newrelic; for example, /newrelic, /newrelic/files/images/foo.png, etc. In some cases the /newrelic URL gets captured by an earlier middleware. In this situation, disable the Developer mode route and include the middleware yourself: At the beginning of the file, in config.ru: require 'newrelic_rpm' require 'new_relic/rack/developer_mode' use NewRelic::Rack::DeveloperMode Copy Incompatible with Pow Developer mode is not supported from Pow, a zero-config Rack server for Mac OS X. Using Developer mode If you run your application on your desktop using thin, WEBrick, or something similar, open the URL /newrelic on your server to see the Developer mode user interface. Caution If you are using Passenger, Unicorn, or other forking application servers on your desktop, you may notice some odd behavior with disappearing data if your application server launches multiple instances. Refer to the Troubleshooting tips, which follow. Developer Mode Breakdown Chart Troubleshooting Troubleshooting tips for Developer mode: Disappearing requests If you have this problem with Unicorn or other multi-worker dispatchers, try limiting the number of workers to 1. Undefined method path for Rack::Request Some users may see an undefined method path for #<Rack::Request>. If you are using Rails version 2.3.2, then you are mostly likely running into a problem with the way the Rack dependency was defined in the Rails package. Either upgrade to 2.3.3 (or higher), or define Rack version 1.0.1 as a dependency in your Gemfile. ActiveRecord reloads Developer mode reloads ActiveRecord method definitions for every reload and reports the time spent defining the methods (such as define_attribute_method). This does not happen in production. To get real results to compare, add the following to the development environment: config.cache_classes = true Copy",

The New Relic Ruby agent includes Developer mode, a built-in UI for examining details about web transactions in your application. With Developer mode, you can examine the library and database calls made by the controller actions as they are invoked on the Rails instance. The free Developer mode gives you some of the same in-depth transaction visibility you get with New Relic's transaction traces feature. However, it works only in a single Rails instance, and it has much higher overhead than the production version. It is not recommended for use beyond a developer's desktop sandbox. Security considerations The Ruby agent's Developer mode, which is on by default when the RAILS_ENV == \"development\", does not communicate with the New Relic collector in any way. Pie charts are rendered using Google Charts, which involves an HTTP post of aggregate data. Tip The Ruby agent's Production mode, which is on by default when the RAILS_ENV == \"production\" and RAILS_ENV == \"staging\", does communicate with the New Relic site. For more information, see Security. Installation To install Developer mode, install Ruby agent as a plugin or gem. You may also need to set developer_mode to true in your newrelic.yml for the RAILS_ENV in which you are working. Developer mode is on by default only when RAILS_ENV = development. While a newrelic.yml file will be created as part of the installation, it is not necessary to have a valid license key. Known issues Known issues with Developer mode include: Requires Rails 2.3 or higher Developer mode in recent agents only works on Rails 2.3 or higher. It is rack based, and earlier versions of the framework did not incorporate rack. The developer edition installs a middleware in your app that responds to any URL prepended with /newrelic; for example, /newrelic, /newrelic/files/images/foo.png, etc. In some cases the /newrelic URL gets captured by an earlier middleware. In this situation, disable the Developer mode route and include the middleware yourself: At the beginning of the file, in config.ru: require 'newrelic_rpm' require 'new_relic/rack/developer_mode' use NewRelic::Rack::DeveloperMode Copy Incompatible with Pow Developer mode is not supported from Pow, a zero-config Rack server for Mac OS X. Using Developer mode If you run your application on your desktop using thin, WEBrick, or something similar, open the URL /newrelic on your server to see the Developer mode user interface. Caution If you are using Passenger, Unicorn, or other forking application servers on your desktop, you may notice some odd behavior with disappearing data if your application server launches multiple instances. Refer to the Troubleshooting tips, which follow. Developer Mode Breakdown Chart Troubleshooting Troubleshooting tips for Developer mode: Disappearing requests If you have this problem with Unicorn or other multi-worker dispatchers, try limiting the number of workers to 1. Undefined method path for Rack::Request Some users may see an undefined method path for #<Rack::Request>. If you are using Rails version 2.3.2, then you are mostly likely running into a problem with the way the Rack dependency was defined in the Rails package. Either upgrade to 2.3.3 (or higher), or define Rack version 1.0.1 as a dependency in your Gemfile.

Capability Integration Browser monitoring The Ruby agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see the browser and Ruby agent documentation. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in infrastructure monitoring. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from Synthetics monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

The New Relic Ruby agent can collect information about how much time is spent in garbage collection for applications running on MRI 1.9.2 or higher or Ruby Enterprise Edition, but you must explicitly enable this feature in your application. Important Avoid using garbage collection in production for long periods of time, as it increases overhead. Enable garbage collection instrumentation To activate the feature, add the appropriate call in your application initialization.

      "body": "Caution Developer mode is deprecated and no longer supported as of Ruby agent version 4.1.0. The New Relic Ruby agent includes Developer mode, a built-in UI for examining details about web transactions in your application. With Developer mode, you can examine the library and database calls made by the controller actions as they are invoked on the Rails instance. The free Developer mode gives you some of the same in-depth transaction visibility you get with New Relic's transaction traces feature. However, it works only in a single Rails instance, and it has much higher overhead than the production version. It is not recommended for use beyond a developer's desktop sandbox. Security considerations The Ruby agent's Developer mode, which is on by default when the RAILS_ENV == \"development\", does not communicate with the New Relic collector in any way. Pie charts are rendered using Google Charts, which involves an HTTP post of aggregate data. Tip The Ruby agent's Production mode, which is on by default when the RAILS_ENV == \"production\" and RAILS_ENV == \"staging\", does communicate with the New Relic site. For more information, see Security. Installation To install Developer mode, install Ruby agent as a plugin or gem. You may also need to set developer_mode to true in your newrelic.yml for the RAILS_ENV in which you are working. Developer mode is on by default only when RAILS_ENV = development. While a newrelic.yml file will be created as part of the installation, it is not necessary to have a valid license key. Known issues Known issues with Developer mode include: Requires Rails 2.3 or higher Developer mode in recent agents only works on Rails 2.3 or higher. It is rack based, and earlier versions of the framework did not incorporate rack. The developer edition installs a middleware in your app that responds to any URL prepended with /newrelic; for example, /newrelic, /newrelic/files/images/foo.png, etc. In some cases the /newrelic URL gets captured by an earlier middleware. In this situation, disable the Developer mode route and include the middleware yourself: At the beginning of the file, in config.ru: require 'newrelic_rpm' require 'new_relic/rack/developer_mode' use NewRelic::Rack::DeveloperMode Copy Incompatible with Pow Developer mode is not supported from Pow, a zero-config Rack server for Mac OS X. Using Developer mode If you run your application on your desktop using thin, WEBrick, or something similar, open the URL /newrelic on your server to see the Developer mode user interface. Caution If you are using Passenger, Unicorn, or other forking application servers on your desktop, you may notice some odd behavior with disappearing data if your application server launches multiple instances. Refer to the Troubleshooting tips, which follow. Developer Mode Breakdown Chart Troubleshooting Troubleshooting tips for Developer mode: Disappearing requests If you have this problem with Unicorn or other multi-worker dispatchers, try limiting the number of workers to 1. Undefined method path for Rack::Request Some users may see an undefined method path for #<Rack::Request>. If you are using Rails version 2.3.2, then you are mostly likely running into a problem with the way the Rack dependency was defined in the Rails package. Either upgrade to 2.3.3 (or higher), or define Rack version 1.0.1 as a dependency in your Gemfile. ActiveRecord reloads Developer mode reloads ActiveRecord method definitions for every reload and reports the time spent defining the methods (such as define_attribute_method). This does not happen in production. To get real results to compare, add the following to the development environment: config.cache_classes = true Copy",

The New Relic Ruby agent can collect information about how much time is spent in garbage collection for applications running on MRI 1.9.2 or higher or Ruby Enterprise Edition, but you must explicitly enable this feature in your application. Important Avoid using garbage collection in production for long periods of time, as it increases overhead. Enable garbage collection instrumentation To activate the feature, add the appropriate call in your application initialization. MRI 1.9.2 or higher: GC::Profiler.enable Ruby Enterprise Edition: GC.enable_stats For Rails applications, you can either add this call to an initializer in config/initializers, or add it directly to your config/application.rb file.

The actions in the UI correspond to the pattern expression used to match them. HTTP operations are not distinguished. Multiple matches are all tracked as separate actions. Contents Getting started To set up Sinatra: Install the latest newrelic_rpm gem. In your Sinatra app, immediately below the Sinatra require directive, add: require 'newrelic_rpm' Copy Set RACK_ENV to the environment corresponding to the configuration definitions in your newrelic.yml file; for example, development, staging, production, etc. Note: Developer mode only works with Rails. Middleware installation Ruby agent versions prior to 3.6.3 required manual addition of New Relic middlewares to enable certain features, such as cross application tracing and browser monitoring. For more information about required middlewares, see Rack middlewares, or upgrade to the most recent Ruby agent. Ignoring routes Ruby agent versions 3.6.3 or higher support ignoring certain routes, similar to what was previously available in Rails controller instrumentation. To specify these values, use the same style of routes that you use to define your Sinatra application. For example, to ignore a ping route in a Sinatra app, include the following code in the app: newrelic_ignore '/ping' get '/ping' do # ... end Copy If you want an entire application to be ignored (for example, in a mounted application), call newrelic_ignore without parameters: newrelic_ignore Copy Additionally, newrelic_ignore_apdex and newrelic_ignore_enduser are supported. The newrelic_ignore_apdex call will exclude a given route from consideration in overall Apdex calculations. The newrelic_ignore_enduser call will prevent automatic injection of the page load timing JavaScript when a route is rendered. Padrino Padrino is a framework built on top of Sinatra. Starting with Ruby agent version 3.6.3, New Relic's Sinatra instrumentation works with Padrino versions 0.10.x or higher. Shotgun (not supported) The New Relic Ruby agent will not work with shotgun.

Capability Integration Browser monitoring The Ruby agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see the browser and Ruby agent documentation. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in infrastructure monitoring. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from Synthetics monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

      "body": "The Ruby agent automatically instruments Rack middlewares. If you are unfamiliar with the basics of Rack middlewares, review the resources linked by the Rails on Rack guide. Additionally, the Ruby agent provides some features via Rack middlewares: Cross application traces Auto-instrumentation for browser monitoring New Relic automatically installs these middlewares for Rails and Sinatra. Rack instrumentation The two most common ways to configure Rack middlewares are the Rack::Builder API (most often from config.ru) and Rails' middleware stack configuration: Rack::Builder Middlewares in your config.ru file are configured using Rack::Builder. For the Ruby agent to instrument middlewares from Rack::Builder, your app must run version 1.1.0 or higher of the rack gem. This is the most common use of middlewares with Sinatra or pure-rack applications. Rails middlewares Rails uses its own class (ActionDispatch::MiddlewareStack) instead of Rack::Builder to configure middlewares. Even if you haven't explicitly added middlewares to your Rails application, many components of Rails itself are implemented as middleware, so middleware data will appear by default. The Ruby agent automatically instruments middlewares added via ActionDispatch::MiddlewareStack on Rails 3.0 or higher. For more information about configuring middlewares with Rails, see the Ruby on Rails guide. Viewing middleware data You can view middleware data in APM. In the APM Summary page The main chart on your app's APM Summary page includes a purple bar that shows average time per request spent in all Rack middlewares for your application. APM > (selected application) > Summary: Middleware time appears in purple on your app's main Overview chart. In the APM Transactions page You can also see time for individual middlewares for a specific transaction name from your app's APM Transactions page. APM > (selected application) > Monitor > Transactions > (selected transaction) > Trace details: Here is an example of middleware time for a selected transaction for your app. In APM transaction trace summary Transaction traces also capture detailed middleware call information. APM > (selected application) > Monitor > Transactions > (selected transaction trace): Here is an example of middleware details in a transaction trace. Disabling Rack instrumentation If you do not want to instrument Rack middlewares, you may disable Rack middleware instrumentation with the disable_middleware_instrumentation setting. You can also ignore specific transactions. Installing Ruby agent middlewares manually The Ruby agent's implementation of New Relic's Cross Application Tracing feature uses Rack middleware instrumentation to read and write HTTP headers that are necessary to pass information between monitored applications. If you have disabled middleware instrumentation as described above and want to use cross application tracing, you must manually add the NewRelic::Rack::AgentHooks middleware to your middleware stack. For more information, see Cross application tracing in Ruby. Manual Rack instrumentation Earlier versions of the Ruby agent supported manually instrumenting Rack middlewares via the NewRelic::Agent::Instrumentation::Rack module. This instrumentation is deprecated in Ruby agent versions 3.9.0 or higher, because it is unnecessary with automatic middleware instrumentation. New Relic recommends that you remove references to this module from your code after upgrading to 3.9.0 or higher.",

      "body": "The Ruby agent automatically instruments Rack middlewares. If you are unfamiliar with the basics of Rack middlewares, review the resources linked by the Rails on Rack guide. Additionally, the Ruby agent provides some features via Rack middlewares: Cross application traces Auto-instrumentation for browser monitoring New Relic automatically installs these middlewares for Rails and Sinatra. Rack instrumentation The two most common ways to configure Rack middlewares are the Rack::Builder API (most often from config.ru) and Rails' middleware stack configuration: Rack::Builder Middlewares in your config.ru file are configured using Rack::Builder. For the Ruby agent to instrument middlewares from Rack::Builder, your app must run version 1.1.0 or higher of the rack gem. This is the most common use of middlewares with Sinatra or pure-rack applications. Rails middlewares Rails uses its own class (ActionDispatch::MiddlewareStack) instead of Rack::Builder to configure middlewares. Even if you haven't explicitly added middlewares to your Rails application, many components of Rails itself are implemented as middleware, so middleware data will appear by default. The Ruby agent automatically instruments middlewares added via ActionDispatch::MiddlewareStack on Rails 3.0 or higher. For more information about configuring middlewares with Rails, see the Ruby on Rails guide. Viewing middleware data You can view middleware data in APM. In the APM Summary page The main chart on your app's APM Summary page includes a purple bar that shows average time per request spent in all Rack middlewares for your application. APM > (selected application) > Summary: Middleware time appears in purple on your app's main Overview chart. In the APM Transactions page You can also see time for individual middlewares for a specific transaction name from your app's APM Transactions page. APM > (selected application) > Monitor > Transactions > (selected transaction) > Trace details: Here is an example of middleware time for a selected transaction for your app. In APM transaction trace summary Transaction traces also capture detailed middleware call information. APM > (selected application) > Monitor > Transactions > (selected transaction trace): Here is an example of middleware details in a transaction trace. Disabling Rack instrumentation If you do not want to instrument Rack middlewares, you may disable Rack middleware instrumentation with the disable_middleware_instrumentation setting. You can also ignore specific transactions. Installing Ruby agent middlewares manually The Ruby agent's implementation of New Relic's Cross Application Tracing feature uses Rack middleware instrumentation to read and write HTTP headers that are necessary to pass information between monitored applications. If you have disabled middleware instrumentation as described above and want to use cross application tracing, you must manually add the NewRelic::Rack::AgentHooks middleware to your middleware stack. For more information, see Cross application tracing in Ruby. Manual Rack instrumentation Earlier versions of the Ruby agent supported manually instrumenting Rack middlewares via the NewRelic::Agent::Instrumentation::Rack module. This instrumentation is deprecated in Ruby agent versions 3.9.0 or higher, because it is unnecessary with automatic middleware instrumentation. New Relic recommends that you remove references to this module from your code after upgrading to 3.9.0 or higher.",

The actions in the UI correspond to the pattern expression used to match them. HTTP operations are not distinguished. Multiple matches are all tracked as separate actions. Contents Getting started To set up Sinatra: Install the latest newrelic_rpm gem. In your Sinatra app, immediately below the Sinatra require directive, add: require 'newrelic_rpm' Copy Set RACK_ENV to the environment corresponding to the configuration definitions in your newrelic.yml file; for example, development, staging, production, etc. Note: Developer mode only works with Rails. Middleware installation Ruby agent versions prior to 3.6.3 required manual addition of New Relic middlewares to enable certain features, such as cross application tracing and browser monitoring. For more information about required middlewares, see Rack middlewares, or upgrade to the most recent Ruby agent. Ignoring routes Ruby agent versions 3.6.3 or higher support ignoring certain routes, similar to what was previously available in Rails controller instrumentation. To specify these values, use the same style of routes that you use to define your Sinatra application. For example, to ignore a ping route in a Sinatra app, include the following code in the app: newrelic_ignore '/ping' get '/ping' do # ... end Copy If you want an entire application to be ignored (for example, in a mounted application), call newrelic_ignore without parameters: newrelic_ignore Copy Additionally, newrelic_ignore_apdex and newrelic_ignore_enduser are supported. The newrelic_ignore_apdex call will exclude a given route from consideration in overall Apdex calculations. The newrelic_ignore_enduser call will prevent automatic injection of the page load timing JavaScript when a route is rendered. Padrino Padrino is a framework built on top of Sinatra. Starting with Ruby agent version 3.6.3, New Relic's Sinatra instrumentation works with Padrino versions 0.10.x or higher. Shotgun (not supported) The New Relic Ruby agent will not work with shotgun. It cannot make a connection before the dispatcher process exits. Neither Developer mode nor Monitor mode will work.",

Capability Integration Browser monitoring The Ruby agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see the browser and Ruby agent documentation. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in infrastructure monitoring. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from Synthetics monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

      "body": "Caution Developer mode is deprecated and no longer supported as of Ruby agent version 4.1.0. The New Relic Ruby agent includes Developer mode, a built-in UI for examining details about web transactions in your application. With Developer mode, you can examine the library and database calls made by the controller actions as they are invoked on the Rails instance. The free Developer mode gives you some of the same in-depth transaction visibility you get with New Relic's transaction traces feature. However, it works only in a single Rails instance, and it has much higher overhead than the production version. It is not recommended for use beyond a developer's desktop sandbox. Security considerations The Ruby agent's Developer mode, which is on by default when the RAILS_ENV == \"development\", does not communicate with the New Relic collector in any way. Pie charts are rendered using Google Charts, which involves an HTTP post of aggregate data. Tip The Ruby agent's Production mode, which is on by default when the RAILS_ENV == \"production\" and RAILS_ENV == \"staging\", does communicate with the New Relic site. For more information, see Security. Installation To install Developer mode, install Ruby agent as a plugin or gem. You may also need to set developer_mode to true in your newrelic.yml for the RAILS_ENV in which you are working. Developer mode is on by default only when RAILS_ENV = development. While a newrelic.yml file will be created as part of the installation, it is not necessary to have a valid license key. Known issues Known issues with Developer mode include: Requires Rails 2.3 or higher Developer mode in recent agents only works on Rails 2.3 or higher. It is rack based, and earlier versions of the framework did not incorporate rack. The developer edition installs a middleware in your app that responds to any URL prepended with /newrelic; for example, /newrelic, /newrelic/files/images/foo.png, etc. In some cases the /newrelic URL gets captured by an earlier middleware. In this situation, disable the Developer mode route and include the middleware yourself: At the beginning of the file, in config.ru: require 'newrelic_rpm' require 'new_relic/rack/developer_mode' use NewRelic::Rack::DeveloperMode Copy Incompatible with Pow Developer mode is not supported from Pow, a zero-config Rack server for Mac OS X. Using Developer mode If you run your application on your desktop using thin, WEBrick, or something similar, open the URL /newrelic on your server to see the Developer mode user interface. Caution If you are using Passenger, Unicorn, or other forking application servers on your desktop, you may notice some odd behavior with disappearing data if your application server launches multiple instances. Refer to the Troubleshooting tips, which follow. Developer Mode Breakdown Chart Troubleshooting Troubleshooting tips for Developer mode: Disappearing requests If you have this problem with Unicorn or other multi-worker dispatchers, try limiting the number of workers to 1. Undefined method path for Rack::Request Some users may see an undefined method path for #<Rack::Request>. If you are using Rails version 2.3.2, then you are mostly likely running into a problem with the way the Rack dependency was defined in the Rails package. Either upgrade to 2.3.3 (or higher), or define Rack version 1.0.1 as a dependency in your Gemfile. ActiveRecord reloads Developer mode reloads ActiveRecord method definitions for every reload and reports the time spent defining the methods (such as define_attribute_method). This does not happen in production. To get real results to compare, add the following to the development environment: config.cache_classes = true Copy",

      "body": "Summary This guide covers the major changes between the 6.x and 7.x series of the Ruby agent, issues that may be encountered while upgrading, and how to migrate successfully to version 7.x. Main changes include: Support for Ruby 2.0 and 2.1 is dropped SSL Certificate Bundle is removed Several APIs that were deprecated in various 6.x releases are now removed Auto-instrumentation defaults to prepend over method chaining Auto-instrumentation gets consistent configuration attributes See the milestone for 7.0 target release for more information. Support for Ruby 2.0 and 2.1 is dropped Ruby 2.0 and 2.1 reached EOL in February 2016, and New Relic is following suit with dropping support for these versions in the 7.0 release. There are no known changes that would inherently prevent these versions from continuing to work, but we are no longer guaranteeing the Ruby agent continues to function without issues going forward. If you need Ruby 2.0 or 2.1, then continue to use 6.15.0, which is the last release published to support these Ruby versions. Prepend instrumentation configuration Relevant pull request: Prepend instrumentation #565. Potential issue: The agent fails to initialize and start reporting data. A stack level too deep error message is reported in the logs. Solution: Our configuration and dependency detection mechanism can now be controlled through configuration. By default all auto-instrumented gems/libraries are activated with the prepend strategy. The default configuration setting for these libraries in the absence of any settings appearing in the configuration file is auto, which will pick the best strategy. In the case of a known conflict with prepend strategies, auto instructs the agent to fall back to method-chaining when such conflicts are detected. Below is a complete explanation of our changes to the configuration section for auto-instrumentation using sidekiq as an example. instrumentation: sidekiq: chain Copy Tip The use case for this is when an unknown gem is found to be conflicting. The user is able to revert to method-chaining to deal with the conflict until the agent can be updated to auto-detect and handle the conflict. To disable instrumentation altogether: instrumentation: sidekiq: disable Copy In some cases, we may know specific gems conflict with prepend. To facilitate, we offer by default an auto config option, which automatically degrades to chain in such cases. The default setting in most cases is thus: instrumentation: sidekiq: auto Copy It's possible to force using prepend strategy by specifying it in the config file: instrumentation: sidekiq: prepend Copy Tip The use case for this is when a newer version of the conflicting gem is released and it's known to no longer conflict with prepend strategy. If you encounter stack level too deep errors, see our troubleshooting guide on how to resolve these issues. After working through this troubleshooting guide, you can let us know about the prepend conflict you find by commenting on this GitHub issue. We appreciate your feedback so we may detect and automatically fall back to method-chaining in such scenarios. Modernized auto-instrumentation strategy Ruby introduced prepend as a way to insert method definitions earlier into the method resolution stack in Ruby 2.0 (released in 2013) with the intent that prepend eliminates the need to do method-chaining as a means of patching original gem libraries' implementations with trace/observability logic. Mixing prepend with method-chaining (a.k.a. method _ alias monkey patching) can lead to a known stack level too deep scenario as described in our blog post on the topic. New Relic has previously updated many auto-instrumented libraries over the years to use prepend strategy. The 7.0 release makes prepend the default strategy of choice to auto-instrument over method-chaining, except when known scenarios exist that would lead to triggering stack level too deep errors. A best effort to identify conflicting external gems that would lead to this scenario was made, but there are bound to be others out in the wild that we have not identified. In the past, we had only one way to auto-instrument for most gems and that was method-chaining. With 7.0 release, we can instrument most gems using either method-chaining or prepend and our configuration of all auto-instrumented gems has been updated to reflect this. With the modernization of our auto-instrumentation, we have also introduced new functionality in our dependency detection mechanism to identify conflicting external gems and automatically switch from prepend strategy to method-chaining. This means you no longer have to depend on the maintainers of other gems to make changes to their gem libraries in order to facilitate using the Ruby agent in conjunction with those gems. However, we are not aware of such conflicts until our users report them to us, so only a few of our auto-instrumented libraries can auto-detect these conflicts and auto-switch to method-chaining strategies. We need your help to hear about these scenarios and to add auto-detection to future Ruby agent releases. The SSL Certificate bundle is removed In the early days of Ruby (1.8, 1.9, etc.), integration with OpenSSL and making HTTPS connections was not well-handled. To ensure customers would be able to consistently make HTTPS connections to New Relic's Collector servers, a selection of SSL CA Certificates were bundled and distributed with the Ruby Agent. Over time, the Ruby ecosystem has stabilized and now supports system installed CA Certificates in a standard manner that largely obsoletes the need to bundle and distribute the certificate bundle. The vast majority of certificates bundled have expired or are nearing expiration, so we have decided to remove this dependency from the agent. If you're deploying a Ruby application and agent to a container or server that does not have CA certificates installed, you will need to ensure they're now installed for 7.0+ releases of the agent to make successful HTTPS connections to New Relic servers. For more information, see Remove cert bundle #478. Potential issue: If you're deploying to a host that does not have OpenSSL and system CA certificates installed, you may experience issues connecting to New Relic servers and experience loss of APM data. Solution: New Relic servers require HTTPS, which uses CA certificates to initiate successful connections. These may be installed, and depending on your host, in various ways. The following are helpful links for testing the readiness of your host and installing CA certificates: Troubleshooting SSL Certificate Errors Automated SSL Check Installing CA Certificates How to handle Certificates in Docker If needed, the agent can be configured to use any CA bundle by giving the path to the CA bundle file via configuration: :ca\\_bundle\\_path. Please see Custom SSL certificate for Ruby for more info. Deprecated API's and configuration attributes All deprecated API's have replacement API's that either expand scope and/or improve robustness of the deprecated API.

Solution: Change the following configuration settings: :disable _ active _ record _ 4 => :disable _ active _ record _ notifications :disable _ active _ record _ 5 => :disable _ active _ record _ notifications httpResponseCode Potential issue: The attribute httpResponseCode no longer appears in UI in the traces reported. Solution: httpResponseCode was replaced with http.statusCode. Notice Error (trace _ only) Potential issue: Passing the :trace\\_only option to NewRelic::Agent.notice\\_error no longer works. Solution: Replace :trace\\_only with the :expected attribute. Distributed Tracing APIs Potential issue: Errors are raised in application code while calling the api methods create_distributed_trace_payload and accept_distributed_trace_payload. Solution: Instead, please see insert _ distributed _ trace _ headers and accept _ distributed _ trace _ headers, respectively.",

Capability Integration Browser monitoring The Ruby agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see the browser and Ruby agent documentation. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in infrastructure monitoring. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from Synthetics monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

      "body": "Caution Developer mode is deprecated and no longer supported as of Ruby agent version 4.1.0. The New Relic Ruby agent includes Developer mode, a built-in UI for examining details about web transactions in your application. With Developer mode, you can examine the library and database calls made by the controller actions as they are invoked on the Rails instance. The free Developer mode gives you some of the same in-depth transaction visibility you get with New Relic's transaction traces feature. However, it works only in a single Rails instance, and it has much higher overhead than the production version. It is not recommended for use beyond a developer's desktop sandbox. Security considerations The Ruby agent's Developer mode, which is on by default when the RAILS_ENV == \"development\", does not communicate with the New Relic collector in any way. Pie charts are rendered using Google Charts, which involves an HTTP post of aggregate data. Tip The Ruby agent's Production mode, which is on by default when the RAILS_ENV == \"production\" and RAILS_ENV == \"staging\", does communicate with the New Relic site. For more information, see Security. Installation To install Developer mode, install Ruby agent as a plugin or gem. You may also need to set developer_mode to true in your newrelic.yml for the RAILS_ENV in which you are working. Developer mode is on by default only when RAILS_ENV = development. While a newrelic.yml file will be created as part of the installation, it is not necessary to have a valid license key. Known issues Known issues with Developer mode include: Requires Rails 2.3 or higher Developer mode in recent agents only works on Rails 2.3 or higher. It is rack based, and earlier versions of the framework did not incorporate rack. The developer edition installs a middleware in your app that responds to any URL prepended with /newrelic; for example, /newrelic, /newrelic/files/images/foo.png, etc. In some cases the /newrelic URL gets captured by an earlier middleware. In this situation, disable the Developer mode route and include the middleware yourself: At the beginning of the file, in config.ru: require 'newrelic_rpm' require 'new_relic/rack/developer_mode' use NewRelic::Rack::DeveloperMode Copy Incompatible with Pow Developer mode is not supported from Pow, a zero-config Rack server for Mac OS X. Using Developer mode If you run your application on your desktop using thin, WEBrick, or something similar, open the URL /newrelic on your server to see the Developer mode user interface. Caution If you are using Passenger, Unicorn, or other forking application servers on your desktop, you may notice some odd behavior with disappearing data if your application server launches multiple instances. Refer to the Troubleshooting tips, which follow. Developer Mode Breakdown Chart Troubleshooting Troubleshooting tips for Developer mode: Disappearing requests If you have this problem with Unicorn or other multi-worker dispatchers, try limiting the number of workers to 1. Undefined method path for Rack::Request Some users may see an undefined method path for #<Rack::Request>. If you are using Rails version 2.3.2, then you are mostly likely running into a problem with the way the Rack dependency was defined in the Rails package. Either upgrade to 2.3.3 (or higher), or define Rack version 1.0.1 as a dependency in your Gemfile. ActiveRecord reloads Developer mode reloads ActiveRecord method definitions for every reload and reports the time spent defining the methods (such as define_attribute_method). This does not happen in production. To get real results to compare, add the following to the development environment: config.cache_classes = true Copy",

      "body": "Summary This guide covers the major changes between the 6.x and 7.x series of the Ruby agent, issues that may be encountered while upgrading, and how to migrate successfully to version 7.x. Main changes include: Support for Ruby 2.0 and 2.1 is dropped SSL Certificate Bundle is removed Several APIs that were deprecated in various 6.x releases are now removed Auto-instrumentation defaults to prepend over method chaining Auto-instrumentation gets consistent configuration attributes See the milestone for 7.0 target release for more information. Support for Ruby 2.0 and 2.1 is dropped Ruby 2.0 and 2.1 reached EOL in February 2016, and New Relic is following suit with dropping support for these versions in the 7.0 release. There are no known changes that would inherently prevent these versions from continuing to work, but we are no longer guaranteeing the Ruby agent continues to function without issues going forward. If you need Ruby 2.0 or 2.1, then continue to use 6.15.0, which is the last release published to support these Ruby versions. Prepend instrumentation configuration Relevant pull request: Prepend instrumentation #565. Potential issue: The agent fails to initialize and start reporting data. A stack level too deep error message is reported in the logs. Solution: Our configuration and dependency detection mechanism can now be controlled through configuration. By default all auto-instrumented gems/libraries are activated with the prepend strategy. The default configuration setting for these libraries in the absence of any settings appearing in the configuration file is auto, which will pick the best strategy. In the case of a known conflict with prepend strategies, auto instructs the agent to fall back to method-chaining when such conflicts are detected. Below is a complete explanation of our changes to the configuration section for auto-instrumentation using sidekiq as an example. instrumentation: sidekiq: chain Copy Tip The use case for this is when an unknown gem is found to be conflicting. The user is able to revert to method-chaining to deal with the conflict until the agent can be updated to auto-detect and handle the conflict. To disable instrumentation altogether: instrumentation: sidekiq: disable Copy In some cases, we may know specific gems conflict with prepend. To facilitate, we offer by default an auto config option, which automatically degrades to chain in such cases. The default setting in most cases is thus: instrumentation: sidekiq: auto Copy It's possible to force using prepend strategy by specifying it in the config file: instrumentation: sidekiq: prepend Copy Tip The use case for this is when a newer version of the conflicting gem is released and it's known to no longer conflict with prepend strategy. If you encounter stack level too deep errors, see our troubleshooting guide on how to resolve these issues. After working through this troubleshooting guide, you can let us know about the prepend conflict you find by commenting on this GitHub issue. We appreciate your feedback so we may detect and automatically fall back to method-chaining in such scenarios. Modernized auto-instrumentation strategy Ruby introduced prepend as a way to insert method definitions earlier into the method resolution stack in Ruby 2.0 (released in 2013) with the intent that prepend eliminates the need to do method-chaining as a means of patching original gem libraries' implementations with trace/observability logic. Mixing prepend with method-chaining (a.k.a. method _ alias monkey patching) can lead to a known stack level too deep scenario as described in our blog post on the topic. New Relic has previously updated many auto-instrumented libraries over the years to use prepend strategy. The 7.0 release makes prepend the default strategy of choice to auto-instrument over method-chaining, except when known scenarios exist that would lead to triggering stack level too deep errors. A best effort to identify conflicting external gems that would lead to this scenario was made, but there are bound to be others out in the wild that we have not identified. In the past, we had only one way to auto-instrument for most gems and that was method-chaining. With 7.0 release, we can instrument most gems using either method-chaining or prepend and our configuration of all auto-instrumented gems has been updated to reflect this. With the modernization of our auto-instrumentation, we have also introduced new functionality in our dependency detection mechanism to identify conflicting external gems and automatically switch from prepend strategy to method-chaining. This means you no longer have to depend on the maintainers of other gems to make changes to their gem libraries in order to facilitate using the Ruby agent in conjunction with those gems. However, we are not aware of such conflicts until our users report them to us, so only a few of our auto-instrumented libraries can auto-detect these conflicts and auto-switch to method-chaining strategies. We need your help to hear about these scenarios and to add auto-detection to future Ruby agent releases. The SSL Certificate bundle is removed In the early days of Ruby (1.8, 1.9, etc.), integration with OpenSSL and making HTTPS connections was not well-handled. To ensure customers would be able to consistently make HTTPS connections to New Relic's Collector servers, a selection of SSL CA Certificates were bundled and distributed with the Ruby Agent. Over time, the Ruby ecosystem has stabilized and now supports system installed CA Certificates in a standard manner that largely obsoletes the need to bundle and distribute the certificate bundle. The vast majority of certificates bundled have expired or are nearing expiration, so we have decided to remove this dependency from the agent. If you're deploying a Ruby application and agent to a container or server that does not have CA certificates installed, you will need to ensure they're now installed for 7.0+ releases of the agent to make successful HTTPS connections to New Relic servers. For more information, see Remove cert bundle #478. Potential issue: If you're deploying to a host that does not have OpenSSL and system CA certificates installed, you may experience issues connecting to New Relic servers and experience loss of APM data. Solution: New Relic servers require HTTPS, which uses CA certificates to initiate successful connections. These may be installed, and depending on your host, in various ways. The following are helpful links for testing the readiness of your host and installing CA certificates: Troubleshooting SSL Certificate Errors Automated SSL Check Installing CA Certificates How to handle Certificates in Docker If needed, the agent can be configured to use any CA bundle by giving the path to the CA bundle file via configuration: :ca\\_bundle\\_path. Please see Custom SSL certificate for Ruby for more info. Deprecated API's and configuration attributes All deprecated API's have replacement API's that either expand scope and/or improve robustness of the deprecated API. Relevant pull requests are: Remove references to whitelist and blacklist in codebase #479 Remove deprecated ActiveRecord config options #480 Remove httpResponseCode attribute #481 Remove deprecated option from notice _ error API #597 Remove deprecated distributed trace API methods #598 Denied and allowed lists enabled Potential issue: Black/White listed attributes no longer work. Solution : Change black to denied and white to allowed in your configuration or environment variable settings. :autostart.blacklisted _ constants => :autostart.denylisted _ constants :autostart.blacklisted _ executables => :autostart.denylisted _ executables :autostart.blacklisted _ rake _ tasks => :autostart.denylisted _ rake _ tasks :strip _ exception _ messages.whitelist => :strip _ exception _ messages.allowed _ classes Active Record Potential issue: Disabling older Active Record versions no longer works. Solution: Change the following configuration settings: :disable _ active _ record _ 4 => :disable _ active _ record _ notifications :disable _ active _ record _ 5 => :disable _ active _ record _ notifications httpResponseCode Potential issue: The attribute httpResponseCode no longer appears in UI in the traces reported. Solution: httpResponseCode was replaced with http.statusCode. Notice Error (trace _ only) Potential issue: Passing the :trace\\_only option to NewRelic::Agent.notice\\_error no longer works. Solution: Replace :trace\\_only with the :expected attribute. Distributed Tracing APIs Potential issue: Errors are raised in application code while calling the api methods create_distributed_trace_payload and accept_distributed_trace_payload. Solution: Instead, please see insert _ distributed _ trace _ headers and accept _ distributed _ trace _ headers, respectively.",

      "body": "Caution Developer mode is deprecated and no longer supported as of Ruby agent version 4.1.0. The New Relic Ruby agent includes Developer mode, a built-in UI for examining details about web transactions in your application. With Developer mode, you can examine the library and database calls made by the controller actions as they are invoked on the Rails instance. The free Developer mode gives you some of the same in-depth transaction visibility you get with New Relic's transaction traces feature. However, it works only in a single Rails instance, and it has much higher overhead than the production version. It is not recommended for use beyond a developer's desktop sandbox. Security considerations The Ruby agent's Developer mode, which is on by default when the RAILS_ENV == \"development\", does not communicate with the New Relic collector in any way. Pie charts are rendered using Google Charts, which involves an HTTP post of aggregate data. Tip The Ruby agent's Production mode, which is on by default when the RAILS_ENV == \"production\" and RAILS_ENV == \"staging\", does communicate with the New Relic site. For more information, see Security. Installation To install Developer mode, install Ruby agent as a plugin or gem. You may also need to set developer_mode to true in your newrelic.yml for the RAILS_ENV in which you are working. Developer mode is on by default only when RAILS_ENV = development. While a newrelic.yml file will be created as part of the installation, it is not necessary to have a valid license key. Known issues Known issues with Developer mode include: Requires Rails 2.3 or higher Developer mode in recent agents only works on Rails 2.3 or higher. It is rack based, and earlier versions of the framework did not incorporate rack. The developer edition installs a middleware in your app that responds to any URL prepended with /newrelic; for example, /newrelic, /newrelic/files/images/foo.png, etc. In some cases the /newrelic URL gets captured by an earlier middleware. In this situation, disable the Developer mode route and include the middleware yourself: At the beginning of the file, in config.ru: require 'newrelic_rpm' require 'new_relic/rack/developer_mode' use NewRelic::Rack::DeveloperMode Copy Incompatible with Pow Developer mode is not supported from Pow, a zero-config Rack server for Mac OS X. Using Developer mode If you run your application on your desktop using thin, WEBrick, or something similar, open the URL /newrelic on your server to see the Developer mode user interface. Caution If you are using Passenger, Unicorn, or other forking application servers on your desktop, you may notice some odd behavior with disappearing data if your application server launches multiple instances. Refer to the Troubleshooting tips, which follow. Developer Mode Breakdown Chart Troubleshooting Troubleshooting tips for Developer mode: Disappearing requests If you have this problem with Unicorn or other multi-worker dispatchers, try limiting the number of workers to 1. Undefined method path for Rack::Request Some users may see an undefined method path for #<Rack::Request>. If you are using Rails version 2.3.2, then you are mostly likely running into a problem with the way the Rack dependency was defined in the Rails package. Either upgrade to 2.3.3 (or higher), or define Rack version 1.0.1 as a dependency in your Gemfile. ActiveRecord reloads Developer mode reloads ActiveRecord method definitions for every reload and reports the time spent defining the methods (such as define_attribute_method). This does not happen in production. To get real results to compare, add the following to the development environment: config.cache_classes = true Copy",

      "body": "Summary This guide covers the major changes between the 7.x and 8.x series of the Ruby agent, issues that may be encountered while upgrading, and how to successfully migrate to version 8.x. The main changes include: Changes to the add_method_tracer API method Distributed Tracing is enabled by default Cross Application Tracing is deprecated Removed deprecated API methods and legacy instrumentation See the milestone for 8.0 for more information. Changes to the add_method_tracer API method Metric name parameter accepts Procs; strings no longer interpolated The second argument to add_method_tracer is the name of the metric used to record calls to the traced method. Previously, this string could include Ruby-style interpolation to allow for the metric name to include variables from the method receiver. For example: # old (<= 7.2) add_method_tracer :foo, ‘metric_#{args[0]}’ Copy As of 8.0, this string will no longer be interpolated. To preserve the behavior described above, pass a Proc instead: # new (8.0+) add_method_tracer :foo, -> (*args) { “metric_#{args[0]}” } # note the double-quotes Copy Note that the arity of the Proc passed to add_method_tracer should match the arity of the original traced method (or use a compatible splat). :code_header and :code_footer parameters accept only Procs Similar to metric names, the :code_header and :code_footer options to add_method_tracer were previously given as strings that would be interpolated in the context of the method receiver. In Ruby Agent 8.0, :code_header and :code_footer will only be invoked if given as Procs, as in the example above. Call add_method_tracer once per method Calling add_method_tracer multiple times on the same method will overwrite any previously defined method tracers for that method. There should be only one add_method_tracer line for each traced method. Previously, the agent allowed adding multiple metrics to the same method by invoking add_method_tracer once for each such metric. This can still be done, but the metric names need to be passed as the second argument of add_method_tracer as an array of strings or procs. # old add_method_tracer :foo, ‘metric1’ add_method_tracer :foo, ‘metric2’, push_scope: false add_method_tracer :foo, ‘metric3’, push_scope: false Copy # new add_method_tracer :foo, [‘metric1’, ‘metric2’, ‘metric3’] Copy Note that the first metric name will be created as a scoped metric unless push_scope: false is specified. The following named metrics will be unscoped. Each traced method may only have one scoped metric. Distributed Tracing is enabled by default The default configuration option for distributed_tracing.enabled is set to true for versions 8.0 or higher. To disable distributed tracing, set this configuration option to false in your newrelic.yml. distributed_tracing: enabled: false Copy Cross Application Tracing is deprecated Cross Application Tracing is deprecated in 8.0 and will be removed in a future release. Tip Distributed tracing and cross application tracing cannot be used simultaneously. If both configuration options are enabled, then only distributed tracing is used. To continue using cross application tracing, settings for both distributed tracing and cross application tracing need to be updated in your newrelic.yml. cross_application_tracing: enabled: true distributed_tracing: enabled: false Copy Removed deprecated API methods and legacy instrumentation The following methods had been previously deprecated and are now removed. Removed Replacement disable_transaction_tracing API method disable_all_tracing or ignore_transaction API methods External.start_segment API method Tracer#start_external_request_segment API method Transaction.wrap API method Tracer#in_transaction API method Mongo < 2.1 instrumentation Upgrade to Mongo 2.1 or higher Excon < 0.19.0 instrumentation Upgrade to Excon 0.19.0 or higher",

In this situation, disable the Developer mode route and include the middleware yourself: At the beginning of the file, in config.ru: require 'newrelic_rpm' require 'new_relic/rack/developer_mode' use NewRelic::Rack::DeveloperMode Copy Incompatible with Pow Developer mode is not supported from Pow, a zero-config Rack server for Mac OS X. Using Developer mode If you run your application on your desktop using thin, WEBrick, or something similar, open the URL /newrelic on your server to see the Developer mode user interface. Caution If you are using Passenger, Unicorn, or other forking application servers on your desktop, you may notice some odd behavior with disappearing data if your application server launches multiple instances. Refer to the Troubleshooting tips, which follow. Developer Mode Breakdown Chart Troubleshooting Troubleshooting tips for Developer mode: Disappearing requests If you have this problem with Unicorn or other multi-worker dispatchers, try limiting the number of workers to 1. Undefined method path for Rack::Request Some users may see an undefined method path for #<Rack::Request>. If you are using Rails version 2.3.2, then you are mostly likely running into a problem with the way the Rack dependency was defined in the Rails package. Either upgrade to 2.3.3 (or higher), or define Rack version 1.0.1 as a dependency in your Gemfile. ActiveRecord reloads Developer mode reloads ActiveRecord method definitions for every reload and reports the time spent defining the methods (such as define_attribute_method). This does not happen in production. To get real results to compare, add the following to the development environment: config.cache_classes = true Copy",

      "body": "Summary This guide covers the major changes between the 6.x and 7.x series of the Ruby agent, issues that may be encountered while upgrading, and how to migrate successfully to version 7.x. Main changes include: Support for Ruby 2.0 and 2.1 is dropped SSL Certificate Bundle is removed Several APIs that were deprecated in various 6.x releases are now removed Auto-instrumentation defaults to prepend over method chaining Auto-instrumentation gets consistent configuration attributes See the milestone for 7.0 target release for more information. Support for Ruby 2.0 and 2.1 is dropped Ruby 2.0 and 2.1 reached EOL in February 2016, and New Relic is following suit with dropping support for these versions in the 7.0 release. There are no known changes that would inherently prevent these versions from continuing to work, but we are no longer guaranteeing the Ruby agent continues to function without issues going forward. If you need Ruby 2.0 or 2.1, then continue to use 6.15.0, which is the last release published to support these Ruby versions. Prepend instrumentation configuration Relevant pull request: Prepend instrumentation #565. Potential issue: The agent fails to initialize and start reporting data. A stack level too deep error message is reported in the logs. Solution: Our configuration and dependency detection mechanism can now be controlled through configuration. By default all auto-instrumented gems/libraries are activated with the prepend strategy. The default configuration setting for these libraries in the absence of any settings appearing in the configuration file is auto, which will pick the best strategy. In the case of a known conflict with prepend strategies, auto instructs the agent to fall back to method-chaining when such conflicts are detected. Below is a complete explanation of our changes to the configuration section for auto-instrumentation using sidekiq as an example. instrumentation: sidekiq: chain Copy Tip The use case for this is when an unknown gem is found to be conflicting. The user is able to revert to method-chaining to deal with the conflict until the agent can be updated to auto-detect and handle the conflict. To disable instrumentation altogether: instrumentation: sidekiq: disable Copy In some cases, we may know specific gems conflict with prepend. To facilitate, we offer by default an auto config option, which automatically degrades to chain in such cases. The default setting in most cases is thus: instrumentation: sidekiq: auto Copy It's possible to force using prepend strategy by specifying it in the config file: instrumentation: sidekiq: prepend Copy Tip The use case for this is when a newer version of the conflicting gem is released and it's known to no longer conflict with prepend strategy. If you encounter stack level too deep errors, see our troubleshooting guide on how to resolve these issues. After working through this troubleshooting guide, you can let us know about the prepend conflict you find by commenting on this GitHub issue. We appreciate your feedback so we may detect and automatically fall back to method-chaining in such scenarios. Modernized auto-instrumentation strategy Ruby introduced prepend as a way to insert method definitions earlier into the method resolution stack in Ruby 2.0 (released in 2013) with the intent that prepend eliminates the need to do method-chaining as a means of patching original gem libraries' implementations with trace/observability logic. Mixing prepend with method-chaining (a.k.a. method _ alias monkey patching) can lead to a known stack level too deep scenario as described in our blog post on the topic. New Relic has previously updated many auto-instrumented libraries over the years to use prepend strategy. The 7.0 release makes prepend the default strategy of choice to auto-instrument over method-chaining, except when known scenarios exist that would lead to triggering stack level too deep errors. A best effort to identify conflicting external gems that would lead to this scenario was made, but there are bound to be others out in the wild that we have not identified. In the past, we had only one way to auto-instrument for most gems and that was method-chaining. With 7.0 release, we can instrument most gems using either method-chaining or prepend and our configuration of all auto-instrumented gems has been updated to reflect this. With the modernization of our auto-instrumentation, we have also introduced new functionality in our dependency detection mechanism to identify conflicting external gems and automatically switch from prepend strategy to method-chaining. This means you no longer have to depend on the maintainers of other gems to make changes to their gem libraries in order to facilitate using the Ruby agent in conjunction with those gems. However, we are not aware of such conflicts until our users report them to us, so only a few of our auto-instrumented libraries can auto-detect these conflicts and auto-switch to method-chaining strategies. We need your help to hear about these scenarios and to add auto-detection to future Ruby agent releases. The SSL Certificate bundle is removed In the early days of Ruby (1.8, 1.9, etc.), integration with OpenSSL and making HTTPS connections was not well-handled. To ensure customers would be able to consistently make HTTPS connections to New Relic's Collector servers, a selection of SSL CA Certificates were bundled and distributed with the Ruby Agent. Over time, the Ruby ecosystem has stabilized and now supports system installed CA Certificates in a standard manner that largely obsoletes the need to bundle and distribute the certificate bundle. The vast majority of certificates bundled have expired or are nearing expiration, so we have decided to remove this dependency from the agent. If you're deploying a Ruby application and agent to a container or server that does not have CA certificates installed, you will need to ensure they're now installed for 7.0+ releases of the agent to make successful HTTPS connections to New Relic servers. For more information, see Remove cert bundle #478. Potential issue: If you're deploying to a host that does not have OpenSSL and system CA certificates installed, you may experience issues connecting to New Relic servers and experience loss of APM data. Solution: New Relic servers require HTTPS, which uses CA certificates to initiate successful connections. These may be installed, and depending on your host, in various ways. The following are helpful links for testing the readiness of your host and installing CA certificates: Troubleshooting SSL Certificate Errors Automated SSL Check Installing CA Certificates How to handle Certificates in Docker If needed, the agent can be configured to use any CA bundle by giving the path to the CA bundle file via configuration: :ca\\_bundle\\_path. Please see Custom SSL certificate for Ruby for more info. Deprecated API's and configuration attributes All deprecated API's have replacement API's that either expand scope and/or improve robustness of the deprecated API. Relevant pull requests are: Remove references to whitelist and blacklist in codebase #479 Remove deprecated ActiveRecord config options #480 Remove httpResponseCode attribute #481 Remove deprecated option from notice _ error API #597 Remove deprecated distributed trace API methods #598 Denied and allowed lists enabled Potential issue: Black/White listed attributes no longer work.

Solution: Change the following configuration settings: :disable _ active _ record _ 4 => :disable _ active _ record _ notifications :disable _ active _ record _ 5 => :disable _ active _ record _ notifications httpResponseCode Potential issue: The attribute httpResponseCode no longer appears in UI in the traces reported. Solution: httpResponseCode was replaced with http.statusCode. Notice Error (trace _ only) Potential issue: Passing the :trace\\_only option to NewRelic::Agent.notice\\_error no longer works. Solution: Replace :trace\\_only with the :expected attribute. Distributed Tracing APIs Potential issue: Errors are raised in application code while calling the api methods create_distributed_trace_payload and accept_distributed_trace_payload. Solution: Instead, please see insert _ distributed _ trace _ headers and accept _ distributed _ trace _ headers, respectively.",

Capability Integration Browser monitoring The Ruby agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see the browser and Ruby agent documentation. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in infrastructure monitoring.

      "body": "Caution Developer mode is deprecated and no longer supported as of Ruby agent version 4.1.0. The New Relic Ruby agent includes Developer mode, a built-in UI for examining details about web transactions in your application. With Developer mode, you can examine the library and database calls made by the controller actions as they are invoked on the Rails instance. The free Developer mode gives you some of the same in-depth transaction visibility you get with New Relic's transaction traces feature. However, it works only in a single Rails instance, and it has much higher overhead than the production version. It is not recommended for use beyond a developer's desktop sandbox. Security considerations The Ruby agent's Developer mode, which is on by default when the RAILS_ENV == \"development\", does not communicate with the New Relic collector in any way. Pie charts are rendered using Google Charts, which involves an HTTP post of aggregate data. Tip The Ruby agent's Production mode, which is on by default when the RAILS_ENV == \"production\" and RAILS_ENV == \"staging\", does communicate with the New Relic site. For more information, see Security. Installation To install Developer mode, install Ruby agent as a plugin or gem. You may also need to set developer_mode to true in your newrelic.yml for the RAILS_ENV in which you are working. Developer mode is on by default only when RAILS_ENV = development. While a newrelic.yml file will be created as part of the installation, it is not necessary to have a valid license key. Known issues Known issues with Developer mode include: Requires Rails 2.3 or higher Developer mode in recent agents only works on Rails 2.3 or higher. It is rack based, and earlier versions of the framework did not incorporate rack. The developer edition installs a middleware in your app that responds to any URL prepended with /newrelic; for example, /newrelic, /newrelic/files/images/foo.png, etc. In some cases the /newrelic URL gets captured by an earlier middleware. In this situation, disable the Developer mode route and include the middleware yourself: At the beginning of the file, in config.ru: require 'newrelic_rpm' require 'new_relic/rack/developer_mode' use NewRelic::Rack::DeveloperMode Copy Incompatible with Pow Developer mode is not supported from Pow, a zero-config Rack server for Mac OS X. Using Developer mode If you run your application on your desktop using thin, WEBrick, or something similar, open the URL /newrelic on your server to see the Developer mode user interface. Caution If you are using Passenger, Unicorn, or other forking application servers on your desktop, you may notice some odd behavior with disappearing data if your application server launches multiple instances. Refer to the Troubleshooting tips, which follow. Developer Mode Breakdown Chart Troubleshooting Troubleshooting tips for Developer mode: Disappearing requests If you have this problem with Unicorn or other multi-worker dispatchers, try limiting the number of workers to 1. Undefined method path for Rack::Request Some users may see an undefined method path for #<Rack::Request>. If you are using Rails version 2.3.2, then you are mostly likely running into a problem with the way the Rack dependency was defined in the Rails package. Either upgrade to 2.3.3 (or higher), or define Rack version 1.0.1 as a dependency in your Gemfile.

      "body": "Summary This guide covers the major changes between the 6.x and 7.x series of the Ruby agent, issues that may be encountered while upgrading, and how to migrate successfully to version 7.x. Main changes include: Support for Ruby 2.0 and 2.1 is dropped SSL Certificate Bundle is removed Several APIs that were deprecated in various 6.x releases are now removed Auto-instrumentation defaults to prepend over method chaining Auto-instrumentation gets consistent configuration attributes See the milestone for 7.0 target release for more information. Support for Ruby 2.0 and 2.1 is dropped Ruby 2.0 and 2.1 reached EOL in February 2016, and New Relic is following suit with dropping support for these versions in the 7.0 release. There are no known changes that would inherently prevent these versions from continuing to work, but we are no longer guaranteeing the Ruby agent continues to function without issues going forward. If you need Ruby 2.0 or 2.1, then continue to use 6.15.0, which is the last release published to support these Ruby versions. Prepend instrumentation configuration Relevant pull request: Prepend instrumentation #565. Potential issue: The agent fails to initialize and start reporting data. A stack level too deep error message is reported in the logs. Solution: Our configuration and dependency detection mechanism can now be controlled through configuration. By default all auto-instrumented gems/libraries are activated with the prepend strategy. The default configuration setting for these libraries in the absence of any settings appearing in the configuration file is auto, which will pick the best strategy. In the case of a known conflict with prepend strategies, auto instructs the agent to fall back to method-chaining when such conflicts are detected. Below is a complete explanation of our changes to the configuration section for auto-instrumentation using sidekiq as an example. instrumentation: sidekiq: chain Copy Tip The use case for this is when an unknown gem is found to be conflicting. The user is able to revert to method-chaining to deal with the conflict until the agent can be updated to auto-detect and handle the conflict. To disable instrumentation altogether: instrumentation: sidekiq: disable Copy In some cases, we may know specific gems conflict with prepend. To facilitate, we offer by default an auto config option, which automatically degrades to chain in such cases. The default setting in most cases is thus: instrumentation: sidekiq: auto Copy It's possible to force using prepend strategy by specifying it in the config file: instrumentation: sidekiq: prepend Copy Tip The use case for this is when a newer version of the conflicting gem is released and it's known to no longer conflict with prepend strategy. If you encounter stack level too deep errors, see our troubleshooting guide on how to resolve these issues. After working through this troubleshooting guide, you can let us know about the prepend conflict you find by commenting on this GitHub issue. We appreciate your feedback so we may detect and automatically fall back to method-chaining in such scenarios. Modernized auto-instrumentation strategy Ruby introduced prepend as a way to insert method definitions earlier into the method resolution stack in Ruby 2.0 (released in 2013) with the intent that prepend eliminates the need to do method-chaining as a means of patching original gem libraries' implementations with trace/observability logic. Mixing prepend with method-chaining (a.k.a. method _ alias monkey patching) can lead to a known stack level too deep scenario as described in our blog post on the topic. New Relic has previously updated many auto-instrumented libraries over the years to use prepend strategy. The 7.0 release makes prepend the default strategy of choice to auto-instrument over method-chaining, except when known scenarios exist that would lead to triggering stack level too deep errors. A best effort to identify conflicting external gems that would lead to this scenario was made, but there are bound to be others out in the wild that we have not identified. In the past, we had only one way to auto-instrument for most gems and that was method-chaining. With 7.0 release, we can instrument most gems using either method-chaining or prepend and our configuration of all auto-instrumented gems has been updated to reflect this. With the modernization of our auto-instrumentation, we have also introduced new functionality in our dependency detection mechanism to identify conflicting external gems and automatically switch from prepend strategy to method-chaining. This means you no longer have to depend on the maintainers of other gems to make changes to their gem libraries in order to facilitate using the Ruby agent in conjunction with those gems. However, we are not aware of such conflicts until our users report them to us, so only a few of our auto-instrumented libraries can auto-detect these conflicts and auto-switch to method-chaining strategies. We need your help to hear about these scenarios and to add auto-detection to future Ruby agent releases. The SSL Certificate bundle is removed In the early days of Ruby (1.8, 1.9, etc.), integration with OpenSSL and making HTTPS connections was not well-handled. To ensure customers would be able to consistently make HTTPS connections to New Relic's Collector servers, a selection of SSL CA Certificates were bundled and distributed with the Ruby Agent. Over time, the Ruby ecosystem has stabilized and now supports system installed CA Certificates in a standard manner that largely obsoletes the need to bundle and distribute the certificate bundle. The vast majority of certificates bundled have expired or are nearing expiration, so we have decided to remove this dependency from the agent. If you're deploying a Ruby application and agent to a container or server that does not have CA certificates installed, you will need to ensure they're now installed for 7.0+ releases of the agent to make successful HTTPS connections to New Relic servers. For more information, see Remove cert bundle #478. Potential issue: If you're deploying to a host that does not have OpenSSL and system CA certificates installed, you may experience issues connecting to New Relic servers and experience loss of APM data. Solution: New Relic servers require HTTPS, which uses CA certificates to initiate successful connections. These may be installed, and depending on your host, in various ways. The following are helpful links for testing the readiness of your host and installing CA certificates: Troubleshooting SSL Certificate Errors Automated SSL Check Installing CA Certificates How to handle Certificates in Docker If needed, the agent can be configured to use any CA bundle by giving the path to the CA bundle file via configuration: :ca\\_bundle\\_path. Please see Custom SSL certificate for Ruby for more info. Deprecated API's and configuration attributes All deprecated API's have replacement API's that either expand scope and/or improve robustness of the deprecated API. Relevant pull requests are: Remove references to whitelist and blacklist in codebase #479 Remove deprecated ActiveRecord config options #480 Remove httpResponseCode attribute #481 Remove deprecated option from notice _ error API #597 Remove deprecated distributed trace API methods #598 Denied and allowed lists enabled Potential issue: Black/White listed attributes no longer work.

Solution: httpResponseCode was replaced with http.statusCode. Notice Error (trace _ only) Potential issue: Passing the :trace\\_only option to NewRelic::Agent.notice\\_error no longer works. Solution: Replace :trace\\_only with the :expected attribute. Distributed Tracing APIs Potential issue: Errors are raised in application code while calling the api methods create_distributed_trace_payload and accept_distributed_trace_payload.

      "body": "Caution Developer mode is deprecated and no longer supported as of Ruby agent version 4.1.0. The New Relic Ruby agent includes Developer mode, a built-in UI for examining details about web transactions in your application. With Developer mode, you can examine the library and database calls made by the controller actions as they are invoked on the Rails instance. The free Developer mode gives you some of the same in-depth transaction visibility you get with New Relic's transaction traces feature. However, it works only in a single Rails instance, and it has much higher overhead than the production version. It is not recommended for use beyond a developer's desktop sandbox. Security considerations The Ruby agent's Developer mode, which is on by default when the RAILS_ENV == \"development\", does not communicate with the New Relic collector in any way. Pie charts are rendered using Google Charts, which involves an HTTP post of aggregate data. Tip The Ruby agent's Production mode, which is on by default when the RAILS_ENV == \"production\" and RAILS_ENV == \"staging\", does communicate with the New Relic site. For more information, see Security. Installation To install Developer mode, install Ruby agent as a plugin or gem. You may also need to set developer_mode to true in your newrelic.yml for the RAILS_ENV in which you are working. Developer mode is on by default only when RAILS_ENV = development. While a newrelic.yml file will be created as part of the installation, it is not necessary to have a valid license key. Known issues Known issues with Developer mode include: Requires Rails 2.3 or higher Developer mode in recent agents only works on Rails 2.3 or higher. It is rack based, and earlier versions of the framework did not incorporate rack. The developer edition installs a middleware in your app that responds to any URL prepended with /newrelic; for example, /newrelic, /newrelic/files/images/foo.png, etc. In some cases the /newrelic URL gets captured by an earlier middleware. In this situation, disable the Developer mode route and include the middleware yourself: At the beginning of the file, in config.ru: require 'newrelic_rpm' require 'new_relic/rack/developer_mode' use NewRelic::Rack::DeveloperMode Copy Incompatible with Pow Developer mode is not supported from Pow, a zero-config Rack server for Mac OS X. Using Developer mode If you run your application on your desktop using thin, WEBrick, or something similar, open the URL /newrelic on your server to see the Developer mode user interface. Caution If you are using Passenger, Unicorn, or other forking application servers on your desktop, you may notice some odd behavior with disappearing data if your application server launches multiple instances. Refer to the Troubleshooting tips, which follow. Developer Mode Breakdown Chart Troubleshooting Troubleshooting tips for Developer mode: Disappearing requests If you have this problem with Unicorn or other multi-worker dispatchers, try limiting the number of workers to 1. Undefined method path for Rack::Request Some users may see an undefined method path for #<Rack::Request>. If you are using Rails version 2.3.2, then you are mostly likely running into a problem with the way the Rack dependency was defined in the Rails package. Either upgrade to 2.3.3 (or higher), or define Rack version 1.0.1 as a dependency in your Gemfile. ActiveRecord reloads Developer mode reloads ActiveRecord method definitions for every reload and reports the time spent defining the methods (such as define_attribute_method). This does not happen in production. To get real results to compare, add the following to the development environment: config.cache_classes = true Copy",

      "body": "Summary This guide covers the major changes between the 7.x and 8.x series of the Ruby agent, issues that may be encountered while upgrading, and how to successfully migrate to version 8.x. The main changes include: Changes to the add_method_tracer API method Distributed Tracing is enabled by default Cross Application Tracing is deprecated Removed deprecated API methods and legacy instrumentation See the milestone for 8.0 for more information. Changes to the add_method_tracer API method Metric name parameter accepts Procs; strings no longer interpolated The second argument to add_method_tracer is the name of the metric used to record calls to the traced method. Previously, this string could include Ruby-style interpolation to allow for the metric name to include variables from the method receiver. For example: # old (<= 7.2) add_method_tracer :foo, ‘metric_#{args[0]}’ Copy As of 8.0, this string will no longer be interpolated. To preserve the behavior described above, pass a Proc instead: # new (8.0+) add_method_tracer :foo, -> (*args) { “metric_#{args[0]}” } # note the double-quotes Copy Note that the arity of the Proc passed to add_method_tracer should match the arity of the original traced method (or use a compatible splat). :code_header and :code_footer parameters accept only Procs Similar to metric names, the :code_header and :code_footer options to add_method_tracer were previously given as strings that would be interpolated in the context of the method receiver. In Ruby Agent 8.0, :code_header and :code_footer will only be invoked if given as Procs, as in the example above. Call add_method_tracer once per method Calling add_method_tracer multiple times on the same method will overwrite any previously defined method tracers for that method. There should be only one add_method_tracer line for each traced method. Previously, the agent allowed adding multiple metrics to the same method by invoking add_method_tracer once for each such metric. This can still be done, but the metric names need to be passed as the second argument of add_method_tracer as an array of strings or procs. # old add_method_tracer :foo, ‘metric1’ add_method_tracer :foo, ‘metric2’, push_scope: false add_method_tracer :foo, ‘metric3’, push_scope: false Copy # new add_method_tracer :foo, [‘metric1’, ‘metric2’, ‘metric3’] Copy Note that the first metric name will be created as a scoped metric unless push_scope: false is specified. The following named metrics will be unscoped. Each traced method may only have one scoped metric. Distributed Tracing is enabled by default The default configuration option for distributed_tracing.enabled is set to true for versions 8.0 or higher. To disable distributed tracing, set this configuration option to false in your newrelic.yml. distributed_tracing: enabled: false Copy Cross Application Tracing is deprecated Cross Application Tracing is deprecated in 8.0 and will be removed in a future release. Tip Distributed tracing and cross application tracing cannot be used simultaneously. If both configuration options are enabled, then only distributed tracing is used. To continue using cross application tracing, settings for both distributed tracing and cross application tracing need to be updated in your newrelic.yml. cross_application_tracing: enabled: true distributed_tracing: enabled: false Copy Removed deprecated API methods and legacy instrumentation The following methods had been previously deprecated and are now removed.

Capability Integration Browser monitoring The Ruby agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see the browser and Ruby agent documentation. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in infrastructure monitoring. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from Synthetics monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

      "body": "Caution Developer mode is deprecated and no longer supported as of Ruby agent version 4.1.0. The New Relic Ruby agent includes Developer mode, a built-in UI for examining details about web transactions in your application. With Developer mode, you can examine the library and database calls made by the controller actions as they are invoked on the Rails instance. The free Developer mode gives you some of the same in-depth transaction visibility you get with New Relic's transaction traces feature. However, it works only in a single Rails instance, and it has much higher overhead than the production version. It is not recommended for use beyond a developer's desktop sandbox. Security considerations The Ruby agent's Developer mode, which is on by default when the RAILS_ENV == \"development\", does not communicate with the New Relic collector in any way. Pie charts are rendered using Google Charts, which involves an HTTP post of aggregate data. Tip The Ruby agent's Production mode, which is on by default when the RAILS_ENV == \"production\" and RAILS_ENV == \"staging\", does communicate with the New Relic site. For more information, see Security. Installation To install Developer mode, install Ruby agent as a plugin or gem. You may also need to set developer_mode to true in your newrelic.yml for the RAILS_ENV in which you are working. Developer mode is on by default only when RAILS_ENV = development. While a newrelic.yml file will be created as part of the installation, it is not necessary to have a valid license key. Known issues Known issues with Developer mode include: Requires Rails 2.3 or higher Developer mode in recent agents only works on Rails 2.3 or higher. It is rack based, and earlier versions of the framework did not incorporate rack. The developer edition installs a middleware in your app that responds to any URL prepended with /newrelic; for example, /newrelic, /newrelic/files/images/foo.png, etc. In some cases the /newrelic URL gets captured by an earlier middleware. In this situation, disable the Developer mode route and include the middleware yourself: At the beginning of the file, in config.ru: require 'newrelic_rpm' require 'new_relic/rack/developer_mode' use NewRelic::Rack::DeveloperMode Copy Incompatible with Pow Developer mode is not supported from Pow, a zero-config Rack server for Mac OS X. Using Developer mode If you run your application on your desktop using thin, WEBrick, or something similar, open the URL /newrelic on your server to see the Developer mode user interface. Caution If you are using Passenger, Unicorn, or other forking application servers on your desktop, you may notice some odd behavior with disappearing data if your application server launches multiple instances. Refer to the Troubleshooting tips, which follow. Developer Mode Breakdown Chart Troubleshooting Troubleshooting tips for Developer mode: Disappearing requests If you have this problem with Unicorn or other multi-worker dispatchers, try limiting the number of workers to 1. Undefined method path for Rack::Request Some users may see an undefined method path for #<Rack::Request>. If you are using Rails version 2.3.2, then you are mostly likely running into a problem with the way the Rack dependency was defined in the Rails package. Either upgrade to 2.3.3 (or higher), or define Rack version 1.0.1 as a dependency in your Gemfile. ActiveRecord reloads Developer mode reloads ActiveRecord method definitions for every reload and reports the time spent defining the methods (such as define_attribute_method). This does not happen in production. To get real results to compare, add the following to the development environment: config.cache_classes = true Copy",

      "body": "Attributes are key-value pairs containing information that determines the properties of an event or transaction. You can view these key-value pairs in some places in the UI, or by querying that data using NRQL. New Relic gives users the ability to customize exactly which attributes will be sent to each of these destinations. You can also collect custom attributes to send additional data to New Relic. Attribute destination flow This diagram illustrates how an agent decides to send attributes to each destination. Agent attribute collection: An agent makes three different decisions when sending an attribute to any New Relic destination based on the relevant property settings. Property names and syntax vary by agent. (The properties in this diagram are specific to the PHP agent, but the general flow is the same for all agents. Property names and syntax vary by agent.) Types of attributes Attributes can be collected in a variety of ways: Message property attributes: These are the properties set on a message received from a queue or topic. HTTP request attributes: These are the parameters for an HTTP request. User attributes: These are attributes provided by the user through each agent's API. Agent attributes: These are attributes captured by the agent; for example, httpResponseCode and httpResponseMessage. Destinations for attributes Collected attributes appear in these locations: Collected attributes Location Transaction traces Each minute transaction traces collect data for your slowest individual HTTP requests. These traces will report attributes collected during the transaction. Traced errors If a transaction results in an error, these traced errors will be reported to APM. A traced error will contain attributes collected during the transaction. Transaction events APM transactions will contain attributes collected during the transaction. Insights page views Browser page views will contain attributes collected during the transaction. However, attributes collected at the end of a transaction may not appear on PageView events. This destination is also called browser monitoring. Span events Span events collected for distributed tracing will contain attributes collected during the span. The following agents support the addition of custom user attributes to span events: Java agent 5.13.0 and above Go agent 3.6.0 and above .NET agent 8.25 and above Node agent 6.10.0 and above PHP agent 9.12.0.268 and above Python agent 5.8.0.136 and above Ruby agent 6.8.0 and above Transaction segments Each segment in a transaction trace will contain attributes recorded for that segment. Viewing request attributes Request attributes are associated with specific transaction traces, browser traces, and errors in APM and dashboards. You can see the attributes recorded with a request when viewing the individual trace or error. Custom attributes can be queried via NRQL exactly like any other attribute. APM > (select an app) > Monitoring > Transactions > (select a transaction) > (select a trace): Here is an example from the Ruby agent of the Request attributes and Custom attributes for a transaction trace. Exact attributes depend on your agent and on your attribute configuration. Limits User attributes, request attributes, and message queue parameters are limited by count and size. Parameter Limitations Transaction Limited to 64 user attributes Attribute key Limited to 256 bytes each If the key is more than 256 bytes, then the attribute will not be recorded. Attribute value Limited to 256 bytes each If the value is greater than 256 bytes, then the attribute value will be truncated. Agent-specific attributes Each APM agent collects custom attributes. The supported attributes depend on the specific agent: C SDK Go Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby",

ActiveRecord reloads Developer mode reloads ActiveRecord method definitions for every reload and reports the time spent defining the methods (such as define_attribute_method). This does not happen in production. To get real results to compare, add the following to the development environment: config.cache_classes = true Copy",

      "body": "New Relic has APM language agents for C, Go, Java, Node.js, .NET, PHP, Python, and Ruby. Each of these offers several ways to leverage the power of distributed tracing: Quick start for standard distributed tracing (recommended): A fast way to get started Infinite Tracing: An advanced alternative to standard distributed tracing Older APM agents: Tracing options if you have older APM agents Manual instrumentation: Tips if automatic instrumentation doesn't work Tip If you want to get more background before getting started, check out these topics: How span sampling works explains distributed tracing options. Impacts to APM tells you what to expect if you are a current APM user but haven't set up distributed tracing. Quick start for standard distributed tracing (recommended): This is the best approach to set up standard distributed tracing if you haven't installed any APM agents for your services yet, or if you want to instrument additional services. Tip You'll need a New Relic account to set up distributed tracing. If you don't already have one, you can quickly create a free account. Step 1. Identify services Figure out which services you want to instrument so they each send trace data to New Relic. Step 2. Instrument each service with an APM agent We have installation assistants for a variety of languages to help you instrument each service. You should run the installation assistant for each service you want to instrument to ensure that each installation has a unique application name. To start the assistant, click the link for your language: APM: C APM: Golang APM: Java APM: .NET APM: Node.js APM: PHP APM: Python APM: Ruby Tip This quick-start approach with the installation assistant automatically enables distributed tracing for each service you run it on, but if you already have a APM agent that you want to participate in distributed tracing, you'll need to manually enable distributed tracing. See Options for older APM agents. Step 3. View traces After you instrument each of your services with APM agents, generate some traffic in your application so we can capture some traces. Here are two ways to view your traces in the UI: View traces that include a specific service Here's one way you can see traces for a particular service: Go to one.newrelic.com. Click APM in the top menu bar. Click your service. In the left navigation's Monitor section, click Distributed tracing. If you don't see the traces you want, you can filter by the trace.id. View traces across accounts This option allows you to search all traces across all New Relic accounts in your organization that you have access to. Go to one.newrelic.com. Click Browse data in the top menu bar, and then click Traces. Select your entity in the left pane. If you don't see the traces you want, you can filter by the trace.id. For more help finding your traces in the UI: Understand and use the distributed tracing UI Query distributed trace data Set up Infinite Tracing (advanced option) Standard distributed tracing for APM agents (above) captures up to 10% of your traces, but if you want us to analyze all your data and find the most relevant traces, you can set up Infinite Tracing. This alternative to standard distributed tracing is available for all APM language agents except C SDK. Tip To learn more about this feature, see Infinite Tracing. Before beginning, first ensure you meet the requirements. Step 1. Complete the instrumentation for standard distributed tracing in the quick start above The Infinite Tracing setup builds on the instrumentation step from the Quick start for standard distributed tracing. Step 2. Set up the trace observer The trace observer is a New Relic AWS-based service that collects and analyzes all your traces. Follow the instructions in Set up trace observer. When you're done, return here with your trace observer information and continue with the next step to configure the agent. Step 3: Configure the agent for Infinite Tracing Infinite Tracing configuration settings include the standard distributed tracing plus information about the trace observer. Find the settings for your language agent below: C SDK Infinite tracing is not available for C SDK. Go Here's an overview of the settings.

For applications using Bundler, additionally include the Infinite Tracing gem in the Gemfile: gem 'newrelic-infinite_tracing' Copy If you're using Rails 3 or higher, or Rails 2.3 in the recommended configuration, Rails will automatically call Bundler.require and cause newrelic-infinite_tracing to be required during startup of your application. If you're using Sinatra or another framework, you must manually call require 'newrelic/infinite_tracing' or manually call Bundler.require.

(Optional) Customize Infinite Tracing After you add the agent configuration settings, you should start seeing data in the New Relic UI. After you spend some time analyzing your data, you may want to adjust some of the features of Infinite Tracing: Configure trace observer monitoring Configure span attribute trace filter Configure random trace filter Options for older APM agents If you have older APM agents, use this section to figure out if the distributed tracing features you want are supported. Following the compatibility information is a section showing the basic configuration settings to turn on standard distributed tracing. If your older agent supports Infinite Tracing and you want to set it up, see the steps above.

Manual instrumentation (If automatic instrumentation doesn't work) Recommendation: Before performing any custom instrumentation, read: How distributed tracing works Troubleshoot missing data If a service is not passing the trace header to other services, you can use the distributed tracing payload APIs to instrument the calling service and the called service. The calling service uses an API call to generate a payload, which is accepted by the called service. Instrument the calling service To instrument the calling service: Ensure the version of the APM agent that monitors the calling service supports distributed tracing. Invoke the agent API call for generating a distributed trace payload: C SDK | Go | Java | .NET | Node.js | PHP | Python | Ruby. Important To maintain proper ordering of spans in a trace, ensure you generate the payload in the context of the span that sends it. Add that payload to the call made to the destination service (for example, in a header). (Optional) Identify the call as an external call: C SDK Go Java .NET: n/a Node.js PHP: n/a Python Ruby Instrument the called service To instrument the called service: Ensure the version of the APM agent that monitors the called service supports distributed tracing. If the New Relic agent on the called service does not identify a New Relic transaction, use the agent API to declare a transaction: C SDK One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload() is called, a NULL pointer is returned. To solve this problem, follow the procedures to create a transaction with the C SDK. Go One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when Transaction.InsertDistributedTraceHeaders(h http.Header) is called, no headers are inserted. To create a transaction, see Instrument Go transactions. Java One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when Transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(Headers) is called, no headers are inserted (this API requires agent 6.4.0+). To create a transaction, see Java agent transaction-related APIs. .NET One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: CreateDistributedTracePayload() returns an empty payload. To create a transaction, see Introduction to .NET custom instrumentation. Node.js One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: the Node.js agent logs will report an error similar to this: No transaction found when calling Transaction.acceptDistributedTracePayload. Copy Use startWebTransaction to create a web transaction or startBackgroundTransaction to capture a non-web transaction. PHP One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers() returns false. To create a transaction, see newrelic_start_transaction. Python To tell that a transaction is not in progress: when transaction = current_transaction() is run, transaction is None. Or, if result = accept_distributed_trace_payload(payload) is run, then the result is False. Use background_task to report a non-web transaction. For more on Python instrumentation, see Monitor transactions and segments. Ruby If you are using a Rack-based web framework and have enabled New Relic's Rack instrumentation, the Ruby agent will handle starting a transaction for you. For other use cases, see the add_transaction_tracer API method. Extract the payload from the call that you received (for example, in a header). Invoke the call for accepting the payload: C SDK | Go | Java | .NET | PHP | Node.js | Python | Ruby.",

      "body": "Caution Developer mode is deprecated and no longer supported as of Ruby agent version 4.1.0. The New Relic Ruby agent includes Developer mode, a built-in UI for examining details about web transactions in your application. With Developer mode, you can examine the library and database calls made by the controller actions as they are invoked on the Rails instance. The free Developer mode gives you some of the same in-depth transaction visibility you get with New Relic's transaction traces feature. However, it works only in a single Rails instance, and it has much higher overhead than the production version. It is not recommended for use beyond a developer's desktop sandbox. Security considerations The Ruby agent's Developer mode, which is on by default when the RAILS_ENV == \"development\", does not communicate with the New Relic collector in any way. Pie charts are rendered using Google Charts, which involves an HTTP post of aggregate data. Tip The Ruby agent's Production mode, which is on by default when the RAILS_ENV == \"production\" and RAILS_ENV == \"staging\", does communicate with the New Relic site. For more information, see Security. Installation To install Developer mode, install Ruby agent as a plugin or gem. You may also need to set developer_mode to true in your newrelic.yml for the RAILS_ENV in which you are working. Developer mode is on by default only when RAILS_ENV = development. While a newrelic.yml file will be created as part of the installation, it is not necessary to have a valid license key. Known issues Known issues with Developer mode include: Requires Rails 2.3 or higher Developer mode in recent agents only works on Rails 2.3 or higher. It is rack based, and earlier versions of the framework did not incorporate rack. The developer edition installs a middleware in your app that responds to any URL prepended with /newrelic; for example, /newrelic, /newrelic/files/images/foo.png, etc. In some cases the /newrelic URL gets captured by an earlier middleware. In this situation, disable the Developer mode route and include the middleware yourself: At the beginning of the file, in config.ru: require 'newrelic_rpm' require 'new_relic/rack/developer_mode' use NewRelic::Rack::DeveloperMode Copy Incompatible with Pow Developer mode is not supported from Pow, a zero-config Rack server for Mac OS X. Using Developer mode If you run your application on your desktop using thin, WEBrick, or something similar, open the URL /newrelic on your server to see the Developer mode user interface. Caution If you are using Passenger, Unicorn, or other forking application servers on your desktop, you may notice some odd behavior with disappearing data if your application server launches multiple instances. Refer to the Troubleshooting tips, which follow. Developer Mode Breakdown Chart Troubleshooting Troubleshooting tips for Developer mode: Disappearing requests If you have this problem with Unicorn or other multi-worker dispatchers, try limiting the number of workers to 1. Undefined method path for Rack::Request Some users may see an undefined method path for #<Rack::Request>. If you are using Rails version 2.3.2, then you are mostly likely running into a problem with the way the Rack dependency was defined in the Rails package. Either upgrade to 2.3.3 (or higher), or define Rack version 1.0.1 as a dependency in your Gemfile. ActiveRecord reloads Developer mode reloads ActiveRecord method definitions for every reload and reports the time spent defining the methods (such as define_attribute_method). This does not happen in production. To get real results to compare, add the following to the development environment: config.cache_classes = true Copy",

Capability Integration Browser monitoring The Ruby agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see the browser and Ruby agent documentation. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in infrastructure monitoring. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from Synthetics monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

Each of these offers several ways to leverage the power of distributed tracing: Quick start for standard distributed tracing (recommended): A fast way to get started Infinite Tracing: An advanced alternative to standard distributed tracing Older APM agents: Tracing options if you have older APM agents Manual instrumentation: Tips if automatic instrumentation doesn't work Tip If you want to get more background before getting started, check out these topics: How span sampling works explains distributed tracing options. Impacts to APM tells you what to expect if you are a current APM user but haven't set up distributed tracing. Quick start for standard distributed tracing (recommended): This is the best approach to set up standard distributed tracing if you haven't installed any APM agents for your services yet, or if you want to instrument additional services. Tip You'll need a New Relic account to set up distributed tracing. If you don't already have one, you can quickly create a free account. Step 1. Identify services Figure out which services you want to instrument so they each send trace data to New Relic. Step 2. Instrument each service with an APM agent We have installation assistants for a variety of languages to help you instrument each service. You should run the installation assistant for each service you want to instrument to ensure that each installation has a unique application name. To start the assistant, click the link for your language: APM: C APM: Golang APM: Java APM: .NET APM: Node.js APM: PHP APM: Python APM: Ruby Tip This quick-start approach with the installation assistant automatically enables distributed tracing for each service you run it on, but if you already have a APM agent that you want to participate in distributed tracing, you'll need to manually enable distributed tracing. See Options for older APM agents. Step 3. View traces After you instrument each of your services with APM agents, generate some traffic in your application so we can capture some traces. Here are two ways to view your traces in the UI: View traces that include a specific service Here's one way you can see traces for a particular service: Go to one.newrelic.com. Click APM in the top menu bar. Click your service. In the left navigation's Monitor section, click Distributed tracing. If you don't see the traces you want, you can filter by the trace.id. View traces across accounts This option allows you to search all traces across all New Relic accounts in your organization that you have access to. Go to one.newrelic.com. Click Browse data in the top menu bar, and then click Traces. Select your entity in the left pane. If you don't see the traces you want, you can filter by the trace.id. For more help finding your traces in the UI: Understand and use the distributed tracing UI Query distributed trace data Set up Infinite Tracing (advanced option) Standard distributed tracing for APM agents (above) captures up to 10% of your traces, but if you want us to analyze all your data and find the most relevant traces, you can set up Infinite Tracing. This alternative to standard distributed tracing is available for all APM language agents except C SDK. Tip To learn more about this feature, see Infinite Tracing. Before beginning, first ensure you meet the requirements. Step 1. Complete the instrumentation for standard distributed tracing in the quick start above The Infinite Tracing setup builds on the instrumentation step from the Quick start for standard distributed tracing. Step 2. Set up the trace observer The trace observer is a New Relic AWS-based service that collects and analyzes all your traces. Follow the instructions in Set up trace observer. When you're done, return here with your trace observer information and continue with the next step to configure the agent. Step 3: Configure the agent for Infinite Tracing Infinite Tracing configuration settings include the standard distributed tracing plus information about the trace observer. Find the settings for your language agent below: C SDK Infinite tracing is not available for C SDK. Go Here's an overview of the settings. For more help with configuration, see Enable distributed tracing for your Go applications.

For more help with configuration, see Ruby agent configuration. To set up Infinite Tracing, you need to install the Infinite Tracing gem. The gem is available in rubygems.org. For applications using Bundler, additionally include the Infinite Tracing gem in the Gemfile: gem 'newrelic-infinite_tracing' Copy If you're using Rails 3 or higher, or Rails 2.3 in the recommended configuration, Rails will automatically call Bundler.require and cause newrelic-infinite_tracing to be required during startup of your application. If you're using Sinatra or another framework, you must manually call require 'newrelic/infinite_tracing' or manually call Bundler.require.

(Optional) Customize Infinite Tracing After you add the agent configuration settings, you should start seeing data in the New Relic UI. After you spend some time analyzing your data, you may want to adjust some of the features of Infinite Tracing: Configure trace observer monitoring Configure span attribute trace filter Configure random trace filter Options for older APM agents If you have older APM agents, use this section to figure out if the distributed tracing features you want are supported. Following the compatibility information is a section showing the basic configuration settings to turn on standard distributed tracing. If your older agent supports Infinite Tracing and you want to set it up, see the steps above.

Manual instrumentation (If automatic instrumentation doesn't work) Recommendation: Before performing any custom instrumentation, read: How distributed tracing works Troubleshoot missing data If a service is not passing the trace header to other services, you can use the distributed tracing payload APIs to instrument the calling service and the called service. The calling service uses an API call to generate a payload, which is accepted by the called service. Instrument the calling service To instrument the calling service: Ensure the version of the APM agent that monitors the calling service supports distributed tracing. Invoke the agent API call for generating a distributed trace payload: C SDK | Go | Java | .NET | Node.js | PHP | Python | Ruby. Important To maintain proper ordering of spans in a trace, ensure you generate the payload in the context of the span that sends it. Add that payload to the call made to the destination service (for example, in a header). (Optional) Identify the call as an external call: C SDK Go Java .NET: n/a Node.js PHP: n/a Python Ruby Instrument the called service To instrument the called service: Ensure the version of the APM agent that monitors the called service supports distributed tracing. If the New Relic agent on the called service does not identify a New Relic transaction, use the agent API to declare a transaction: C SDK One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload() is called, a NULL pointer is returned. To solve this problem, follow the procedures to create a transaction with the C SDK. Go One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when Transaction.InsertDistributedTraceHeaders(h http.Header) is called, no headers are inserted. To create a transaction, see Instrument Go transactions. Java One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when Transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(Headers) is called, no headers are inserted (this API requires agent 6.4.0+). To create a transaction, see Java agent transaction-related APIs. .NET One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: CreateDistributedTracePayload() returns an empty payload. To create a transaction, see Introduction to .NET custom instrumentation. Node.js One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: the Node.js agent logs will report an error similar to this: No transaction found when calling Transaction.acceptDistributedTracePayload. Copy Use startWebTransaction to create a web transaction or startBackgroundTransaction to capture a non-web transaction. PHP One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers() returns false. To create a transaction, see newrelic_start_transaction. Python To tell that a transaction is not in progress: when transaction = current_transaction() is run, transaction is None. Or, if result = accept_distributed_trace_payload(payload) is run, then the result is False. Use background_task to report a non-web transaction. For more on Python instrumentation, see Monitor transactions and segments. Ruby If you are using a Rack-based web framework and have enabled New Relic's Rack instrumentation, the Ruby agent will handle starting a transaction for you. For other use cases, see the add_transaction_tracer API method. Extract the payload from the call that you received (for example, in a header). Invoke the call for accepting the payload: C SDK | Go | Java | .NET | PHP | Node.js | Python | Ruby.",

      "body": "Caution Developer mode is deprecated and no longer supported as of Ruby agent version 4.1.0. The New Relic Ruby agent includes Developer mode, a built-in UI for examining details about web transactions in your application. With Developer mode, you can examine the library and database calls made by the controller actions as they are invoked on the Rails instance. The free Developer mode gives you some of the same in-depth transaction visibility you get with New Relic's transaction traces feature. However, it works only in a single Rails instance, and it has much higher overhead than the production version. It is not recommended for use beyond a developer's desktop sandbox. Security considerations The Ruby agent's Developer mode, which is on by default when the RAILS_ENV == \"development\", does not communicate with the New Relic collector in any way. Pie charts are rendered using Google Charts, which involves an HTTP post of aggregate data. Tip The Ruby agent's Production mode, which is on by default when the RAILS_ENV == \"production\" and RAILS_ENV == \"staging\", does communicate with the New Relic site. For more information, see Security. Installation To install Developer mode, install Ruby agent as a plugin or gem. You may also need to set developer_mode to true in your newrelic.yml for the RAILS_ENV in which you are working. Developer mode is on by default only when RAILS_ENV = development. While a newrelic.yml file will be created as part of the installation, it is not necessary to have a valid license key. Known issues Known issues with Developer mode include: Requires Rails 2.3 or higher Developer mode in recent agents only works on Rails 2.3 or higher. It is rack based, and earlier versions of the framework did not incorporate rack. The developer edition installs a middleware in your app that responds to any URL prepended with /newrelic; for example, /newrelic, /newrelic/files/images/foo.png, etc. In some cases the /newrelic URL gets captured by an earlier middleware. In this situation, disable the Developer mode route and include the middleware yourself: At the beginning of the file, in config.ru: require 'newrelic_rpm' require 'new_relic/rack/developer_mode' use NewRelic::Rack::DeveloperMode Copy Incompatible with Pow Developer mode is not supported from Pow, a zero-config Rack server for Mac OS X. Using Developer mode If you run your application on your desktop using thin, WEBrick, or something similar, open the URL /newrelic on your server to see the Developer mode user interface. Caution If you are using Passenger, Unicorn, or other forking application servers on your desktop, you may notice some odd behavior with disappearing data if your application server launches multiple instances. Refer to the Troubleshooting tips, which follow. Developer Mode Breakdown Chart Troubleshooting Troubleshooting tips for Developer mode: Disappearing requests If you have this problem with Unicorn or other multi-worker dispatchers, try limiting the number of workers to 1. Undefined method path for Rack::Request Some users may see an undefined method path for #<Rack::Request>. If you are using Rails version 2.3.2, then you are mostly likely running into a problem with the way the Rack dependency was defined in the Rails package. Either upgrade to 2.3.3 (or higher), or define Rack version 1.0.1 as a dependency in your Gemfile. ActiveRecord reloads Developer mode reloads ActiveRecord method definitions for every reload and reports the time spent defining the methods (such as define_attribute_method). This does not happen in production. To get real results to compare, add the following to the development environment: config.cache_classes = true Copy",

After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see the browser and Ruby agent documentation. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in infrastructure monitoring.

Quick start for standard distributed tracing (recommended): This is the best approach to set up standard distributed tracing if you haven't installed any APM agents for your services yet, or if you want to instrument additional services. Tip You'll need a New Relic account to set up distributed tracing. If you don't already have one, you can quickly create a free account. Step 1. Identify services Figure out which services you want to instrument so they each send trace data to New Relic. Step 2. Instrument each service with an APM agent We have installation assistants for a variety of languages to help you instrument each service. You should run the installation assistant for each service you want to instrument to ensure that each installation has a unique application name. To start the assistant, click the link for your language: APM: C APM: Golang APM: Java APM: .NET APM: Node.js APM: PHP APM: Python APM: Ruby Tip This quick-start approach with the installation assistant automatically enables distributed tracing for each service you run it on, but if you already have a APM agent that you want to participate in distributed tracing, you'll need to manually enable distributed tracing. See Options for older APM agents. Step 3. View traces After you instrument each of your services with APM agents, generate some traffic in your application so we can capture some traces. Here are two ways to view your traces in the UI: View traces that include a specific service Here's one way you can see traces for a particular service: Go to one.newrelic.com. Click APM in the top menu bar. Click your service. In the left navigation's Monitor section, click Distributed tracing. If you don't see the traces you want, you can filter by the trace.id. View traces across accounts This option allows you to search all traces across all New Relic accounts in your organization that you have access to. Go to one.newrelic.com. Click Browse data in the top menu bar, and then click Traces. Select your entity in the left pane. If you don't see the traces you want, you can filter by the trace.id. For more help finding your traces in the UI: Understand and use the distributed tracing UI Query distributed trace data Set up Infinite Tracing (advanced option) Standard distributed tracing for APM agents (above) captures up to 10% of your traces, but if you want us to analyze all your data and find the most relevant traces, you can set up Infinite Tracing. This alternative to standard distributed tracing is available for all APM language agents except C SDK. Tip To learn more about this feature, see Infinite Tracing. Before beginning, first ensure you meet the requirements. Step 1. Complete the instrumentation for standard distributed tracing in the quick start above The Infinite Tracing setup builds on the instrumentation step from the Quick start for standard distributed tracing. Step 2. Set up the trace observer The trace observer is a New Relic AWS-based service that collects and analyzes all your traces. Follow the instructions in Set up trace observer. When you're done, return here with your trace observer information and continue with the next step to configure the agent. Step 3: Configure the agent for Infinite Tracing Infinite Tracing configuration settings include the standard distributed tracing plus information about the trace observer. Find the settings for your language agent below: C SDK Infinite tracing is not available for C SDK. Go Here's an overview of the settings.

For more help with configuration, see Ruby agent configuration. To set up Infinite Tracing, you need to install the Infinite Tracing gem. The gem is available in rubygems.org. For applications using Bundler, additionally include the Infinite Tracing gem in the Gemfile: gem 'newrelic-infinite_tracing' Copy If you're using Rails 3 or higher, or Rails 2.3 in the recommended configuration, Rails will automatically call Bundler.require and cause newrelic-infinite_tracing to be required during startup of your application. If you're using Sinatra or another framework, you must manually call require 'newrelic/infinite_tracing' or manually call Bundler.require.

(Optional) Customize Infinite Tracing After you add the agent configuration settings, you should start seeing data in the New Relic UI. After you spend some time analyzing your data, you may want to adjust some of the features of Infinite Tracing: Configure trace observer monitoring Configure span attribute trace filter Configure random trace filter Options for older APM agents If you have older APM agents, use this section to figure out if the distributed tracing features you want are supported. Following the compatibility information is a section showing the basic configuration settings to turn on standard distributed tracing.

Manual instrumentation (If automatic instrumentation doesn't work) Recommendation: Before performing any custom instrumentation, read: How distributed tracing works Troubleshoot missing data If a service is not passing the trace header to other services, you can use the distributed tracing payload APIs to instrument the calling service and the called service. The calling service uses an API call to generate a payload, which is accepted by the called service. Instrument the calling service To instrument the calling service: Ensure the version of the APM agent that monitors the calling service supports distributed tracing. Invoke the agent API call for generating a distributed trace payload: C SDK | Go | Java | .NET | Node.js | PHP | Python | Ruby. Important To maintain proper ordering of spans in a trace, ensure you generate the payload in the context of the span that sends it. Add that payload to the call made to the destination service (for example, in a header). (Optional) Identify the call as an external call: C SDK Go Java .NET: n/a Node.js PHP: n/a Python Ruby Instrument the called service To instrument the called service: Ensure the version of the APM agent that monitors the called service supports distributed tracing. If the New Relic agent on the called service does not identify a New Relic transaction, use the agent API to declare a transaction: C SDK One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload() is called, a NULL pointer is returned. To solve this problem, follow the procedures to create a transaction with the C SDK. Go One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when Transaction.InsertDistributedTraceHeaders(h http.Header) is called, no headers are inserted. To create a transaction, see Instrument Go transactions. Java One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when Transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(Headers) is called, no headers are inserted (this API requires agent 6.4.0+). To create a transaction, see Java agent transaction-related APIs. .NET One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: CreateDistributedTracePayload() returns an empty payload. To create a transaction, see Introduction to .NET custom instrumentation. Node.js One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: the Node.js agent logs will report an error similar to this: No transaction found when calling Transaction.acceptDistributedTracePayload. Copy Use startWebTransaction to create a web transaction or startBackgroundTransaction to capture a non-web transaction. PHP One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers() returns false. To create a transaction, see newrelic_start_transaction. Python To tell that a transaction is not in progress: when transaction = current_transaction() is run, transaction is None. Or, if result = accept_distributed_trace_payload(payload) is run, then the result is False. Use background_task to report a non-web transaction. For more on Python instrumentation, see Monitor transactions and segments. Ruby If you are using a Rack-based web framework and have enabled New Relic's Rack instrumentation, the Ruby agent will handle starting a transaction for you. For other use cases, see the add_transaction_tracer API method. Extract the payload from the call that you received (for example, in a header). Invoke the call for accepting the payload: C SDK | Go | Java | .NET | PHP | Node.js | Python | Ruby.",

      "body": "Caution Developer mode is deprecated and no longer supported as of Ruby agent version 4.1.0. The New Relic Ruby agent includes Developer mode, a built-in UI for examining details about web transactions in your application. With Developer mode, you can examine the library and database calls made by the controller actions as they are invoked on the Rails instance. The free Developer mode gives you some of the same in-depth transaction visibility you get with New Relic's transaction traces feature. However, it works only in a single Rails instance, and it has much higher overhead than the production version. It is not recommended for use beyond a developer's desktop sandbox. Security considerations The Ruby agent's Developer mode, which is on by default when the RAILS_ENV == \"development\", does not communicate with the New Relic collector in any way. Pie charts are rendered using Google Charts, which involves an HTTP post of aggregate data. Tip The Ruby agent's Production mode, which is on by default when the RAILS_ENV == \"production\" and RAILS_ENV == \"staging\", does communicate with the New Relic site. For more information, see Security. Installation To install Developer mode, install Ruby agent as a plugin or gem. You may also need to set developer_mode to true in your newrelic.yml for the RAILS_ENV in which you are working. Developer mode is on by default only when RAILS_ENV = development. While a newrelic.yml file will be created as part of the installation, it is not necessary to have a valid license key. Known issues Known issues with Developer mode include: Requires Rails 2.3 or higher Developer mode in recent agents only works on Rails 2.3 or higher. It is rack based, and earlier versions of the framework did not incorporate rack. The developer edition installs a middleware in your app that responds to any URL prepended with /newrelic; for example, /newrelic, /newrelic/files/images/foo.png, etc. In some cases the /newrelic URL gets captured by an earlier middleware. In this situation, disable the Developer mode route and include the middleware yourself: At the beginning of the file, in config.ru: require 'newrelic_rpm' require 'new_relic/rack/developer_mode' use NewRelic::Rack::DeveloperMode Copy Incompatible with Pow Developer mode is not supported from Pow, a zero-config Rack server for Mac OS X. Using Developer mode If you run your application on your desktop using thin, WEBrick, or something similar, open the URL /newrelic on your server to see the Developer mode user interface. Caution If you are using Passenger, Unicorn, or other forking application servers on your desktop, you may notice some odd behavior with disappearing data if your application server launches multiple instances. Refer to the Troubleshooting tips, which follow. Developer Mode Breakdown Chart Troubleshooting Troubleshooting tips for Developer mode: Disappearing requests If you have this problem with Unicorn or other multi-worker dispatchers, try limiting the number of workers to 1. Undefined method path for Rack::Request Some users may see an undefined method path for #<Rack::Request>. If you are using Rails version 2.3.2, then you are mostly likely running into a problem with the way the Rack dependency was defined in the Rails package. Either upgrade to 2.3.3 (or higher), or define Rack version 1.0.1 as a dependency in your Gemfile. ActiveRecord reloads Developer mode reloads ActiveRecord method definitions for every reload and reports the time spent defining the methods (such as define_attribute_method). This does not happen in production. To get real results to compare, add the following to the development environment: config.cache_classes = true Copy",

Capability Integration Browser monitoring The Ruby agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see the browser and Ruby agent documentation. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in infrastructure monitoring. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from Synthetics monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

      "body": "New Relic has APM language agents for C, Go, Java, Node.js, .NET, PHP, Python, and Ruby. Each of these offers several ways to leverage the power of distributed tracing: Quick start for standard distributed tracing (recommended): A fast way to get started Infinite Tracing: An advanced alternative to standard distributed tracing Older APM agents: Tracing options if you have older APM agents Manual instrumentation: Tips if automatic instrumentation doesn't work Tip If you want to get more background before getting started, check out these topics: How span sampling works explains distributed tracing options. Impacts to APM tells you what to expect if you are a current APM user but haven't set up distributed tracing. Quick start for standard distributed tracing (recommended): This is the best approach to set up standard distributed tracing if you haven't installed any APM agents for your services yet, or if you want to instrument additional services. Tip You'll need a New Relic account to set up distributed tracing. If you don't already have one, you can quickly create a free account. Step 1. Identify services Figure out which services you want to instrument so they each send trace data to New Relic. Step 2. Instrument each service with an APM agent We have installation assistants for a variety of languages to help you instrument each service. You should run the installation assistant for each service you want to instrument to ensure that each installation has a unique application name. To start the assistant, click the link for your language: APM: C APM: Golang APM: Java APM: .NET APM: Node.js APM: PHP APM: Python APM: Ruby Tip This quick-start approach with the installation assistant automatically enables distributed tracing for each service you run it on, but if you already have a APM agent that you want to participate in distributed tracing, you'll need to manually enable distributed tracing. See Options for older APM agents. Step 3. View traces After you instrument each of your services with APM agents, generate some traffic in your application so we can capture some traces. Here are two ways to view your traces in the UI: View traces that include a specific service Here's one way you can see traces for a particular service: Go to one.newrelic.com. Click APM in the top menu bar. Click your service. In the left navigation's Monitor section, click Distributed tracing. If you don't see the traces you want, you can filter by the trace.id. View traces across accounts This option allows you to search all traces across all New Relic accounts in your organization that you have access to. Go to one.newrelic.com. Click Browse data in the top menu bar, and then click Traces. Select your entity in the left pane. If you don't see the traces you want, you can filter by the trace.id. For more help finding your traces in the UI: Understand and use the distributed tracing UI Query distributed trace data Set up Infinite Tracing (advanced option) Standard distributed tracing for APM agents (above) captures up to 10% of your traces, but if you want us to analyze all your data and find the most relevant traces, you can set up Infinite Tracing. This alternative to standard distributed tracing is available for all APM language agents except C SDK. Tip To learn more about this feature, see Infinite Tracing. Before beginning, first ensure you meet the requirements. Step 1. Complete the instrumentation for standard distributed tracing in the quick start above The Infinite Tracing setup builds on the instrumentation step from the Quick start for standard distributed tracing. Step 2. Set up the trace observer The trace observer is a New Relic AWS-based service that collects and analyzes all your traces. Follow the instructions in Set up trace observer. When you're done, return here with your trace observer information and continue with the next step to configure the agent. Step 3: Configure the agent for Infinite Tracing Infinite Tracing configuration settings include the standard distributed tracing plus information about the trace observer. Find the settings for your language agent below: C SDK Infinite tracing is not available for C SDK. Go Here's an overview of the settings.

(Optional) Customize Infinite Tracing After you add the agent configuration settings, you should start seeing data in the New Relic UI. After you spend some time analyzing your data, you may want to adjust some of the features of Infinite Tracing: Configure trace observer monitoring Configure span attribute trace filter Configure random trace filter Options for older APM agents If you have older APM agents, use this section to figure out if the distributed tracing features you want are supported. Following the compatibility information is a section showing the basic configuration settings to turn on standard distributed tracing. If your older agent supports Infinite Tracing and you want to set it up, see the steps above.

Manual instrumentation (If automatic instrumentation doesn't work) Recommendation: Before performing any custom instrumentation, read: How distributed tracing works Troubleshoot missing data If a service is not passing the trace header to other services, you can use the distributed tracing payload APIs to instrument the calling service and the called service. The calling service uses an API call to generate a payload, which is accepted by the called service. Instrument the calling service To instrument the calling service: Ensure the version of the APM agent that monitors the calling service supports distributed tracing. Invoke the agent API call for generating a distributed trace payload: C SDK | Go | Java | .NET | Node.js | PHP | Python | Ruby. Important To maintain proper ordering of spans in a trace, ensure you generate the payload in the context of the span that sends it. Add that payload to the call made to the destination service (for example, in a header). (Optional) Identify the call as an external call: C SDK Go Java .NET: n/a Node.js PHP: n/a Python Ruby Instrument the called service To instrument the called service: Ensure the version of the APM agent that monitors the called service supports distributed tracing. If the New Relic agent on the called service does not identify a New Relic transaction, use the agent API to declare a transaction: C SDK One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload() is called, a NULL pointer is returned. To solve this problem, follow the procedures to create a transaction with the C SDK. Go One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when Transaction.InsertDistributedTraceHeaders(h http.Header) is called, no headers are inserted. To create a transaction, see Instrument Go transactions. Java One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when Transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(Headers) is called, no headers are inserted (this API requires agent 6.4.0+). To create a transaction, see Java agent transaction-related APIs. .NET One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: CreateDistributedTracePayload() returns an empty payload. To create a transaction, see Introduction to .NET custom instrumentation. Node.js One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: the Node.js agent logs will report an error similar to this: No transaction found when calling Transaction.acceptDistributedTracePayload. Copy Use startWebTransaction to create a web transaction or startBackgroundTransaction to capture a non-web transaction. PHP One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers() returns false. To create a transaction, see newrelic_start_transaction. Python To tell that a transaction is not in progress: when transaction = current_transaction() is run, transaction is None. Or, if result = accept_distributed_trace_payload(payload) is run, then the result is False. Use background_task to report a non-web transaction. For more on Python instrumentation, see Monitor transactions and segments. Ruby If you are using a Rack-based web framework and have enabled New Relic's Rack instrumentation, the Ruby agent will handle starting a transaction for you. For other use cases, see the add_transaction_tracer API method. Extract the payload from the call that you received (for example, in a header). Invoke the call for accepting the payload: C SDK | Go | Java | .NET | PHP | Node.js | Python | Ruby.",

      "body": "Caution Developer mode is deprecated and no longer supported as of Ruby agent version 4.1.0. The New Relic Ruby agent includes Developer mode, a built-in UI for examining details about web transactions in your application. With Developer mode, you can examine the library and database calls made by the controller actions as they are invoked on the Rails instance. The free Developer mode gives you some of the same in-depth transaction visibility you get with New Relic's transaction traces feature. However, it works only in a single Rails instance, and it has much higher overhead than the production version. It is not recommended for use beyond a developer's desktop sandbox. Security considerations The Ruby agent's Developer mode, which is on by default when the RAILS_ENV == \"development\", does not communicate with the New Relic collector in any way. Pie charts are rendered using Google Charts, which involves an HTTP post of aggregate data. Tip The Ruby agent's Production mode, which is on by default when the RAILS_ENV == \"production\" and RAILS_ENV == \"staging\", does communicate with the New Relic site. For more information, see Security. Installation To install Developer mode, install Ruby agent as a plugin or gem. You may also need to set developer_mode to true in your newrelic.yml for the RAILS_ENV in which you are working. Developer mode is on by default only when RAILS_ENV = development. While a newrelic.yml file will be created as part of the installation, it is not necessary to have a valid license key. Known issues Known issues with Developer mode include: Requires Rails 2.3 or higher Developer mode in recent agents only works on Rails 2.3 or higher. It is rack based, and earlier versions of the framework did not incorporate rack. The developer edition installs a middleware in your app that responds to any URL prepended with /newrelic; for example, /newrelic, /newrelic/files/images/foo.png, etc. In some cases the /newrelic URL gets captured by an earlier middleware. In this situation, disable the Developer mode route and include the middleware yourself: At the beginning of the file, in config.ru: require 'newrelic_rpm' require 'new_relic/rack/developer_mode' use NewRelic::Rack::DeveloperMode Copy Incompatible with Pow Developer mode is not supported from Pow, a zero-config Rack server for Mac OS X. Using Developer mode If you run your application on your desktop using thin, WEBrick, or something similar, open the URL /newrelic on your server to see the Developer mode user interface. Caution If you are using Passenger, Unicorn, or other forking application servers on your desktop, you may notice some odd behavior with disappearing data if your application server launches multiple instances. Refer to the Troubleshooting tips, which follow. Developer Mode Breakdown Chart Troubleshooting Troubleshooting tips for Developer mode: Disappearing requests If you have this problem with Unicorn or other multi-worker dispatchers, try limiting the number of workers to 1. Undefined method path for Rack::Request Some users may see an undefined method path for #<Rack::Request>. If you are using Rails version 2.3.2, then you are mostly likely running into a problem with the way the Rack dependency was defined in the Rails package. Either upgrade to 2.3.3 (or higher), or define Rack version 1.0.1 as a dependency in your Gemfile. ActiveRecord reloads Developer mode reloads ActiveRecord method definitions for every reload and reports the time spent defining the methods (such as define_attribute_method). This does not happen in production. To get real results to compare, add the following to the development environment: config.cache_classes = true Copy",

      "body": "New Relic has APM language agents for C, Go, Java, Node.js, .NET, PHP, Python, and Ruby. Each of these offers several ways to leverage the power of distributed tracing: Quick start for standard distributed tracing (recommended): A fast way to get started Infinite Tracing: An advanced alternative to standard distributed tracing Older APM agents: Tracing options if you have older APM agents Manual instrumentation: Tips if automatic instrumentation doesn't work Tip If you want to get more background before getting started, check out these topics: How span sampling works explains distributed tracing options. Impacts to APM tells you what to expect if you are a current APM user but haven't set up distributed tracing. Quick start for standard distributed tracing (recommended): This is the best approach to set up standard distributed tracing if you haven't installed any APM agents for your services yet, or if you want to instrument additional services. Tip You'll need a New Relic account to set up distributed tracing. If you don't already have one, you can quickly create a free account. Step 1. Identify services Figure out which services you want to instrument so they each send trace data to New Relic. Step 2. Instrument each service with an APM agent We have installation assistants for a variety of languages to help you instrument each service. You should run the installation assistant for each service you want to instrument to ensure that each installation has a unique application name. To start the assistant, click the link for your language: APM: C APM: Golang APM: Java APM: .NET APM: Node.js APM: PHP APM: Python APM: Ruby Tip This quick-start approach with the installation assistant automatically enables distributed tracing for each service you run it on, but if you already have a APM agent that you want to participate in distributed tracing, you'll need to manually enable distributed tracing. See Options for older APM agents. Step 3. View traces After you instrument each of your services with APM agents, generate some traffic in your application so we can capture some traces. Here are two ways to view your traces in the UI: View traces that include a specific service Here's one way you can see traces for a particular service: Go to one.newrelic.com. Click APM in the top menu bar. Click your service. In the left navigation's Monitor section, click Distributed tracing. If you don't see the traces you want, you can filter by the trace.id. View traces across accounts This option allows you to search all traces across all New Relic accounts in your organization that you have access to. Go to one.newrelic.com. Click Browse data in the top menu bar, and then click Traces. Select your entity in the left pane. If you don't see the traces you want, you can filter by the trace.id. For more help finding your traces in the UI: Understand and use the distributed tracing UI Query distributed trace data Set up Infinite Tracing (advanced option) Standard distributed tracing for APM agents (above) captures up to 10% of your traces, but if you want us to analyze all your data and find the most relevant traces, you can set up Infinite Tracing. This alternative to standard distributed tracing is available for all APM language agents except C SDK. Tip To learn more about this feature, see Infinite Tracing. Before beginning, first ensure you meet the requirements. Step 1. Complete the instrumentation for standard distributed tracing in the quick start above The Infinite Tracing setup builds on the instrumentation step from the Quick start for standard distributed tracing. Step 2. Set up the trace observer The trace observer is a New Relic AWS-based service that collects and analyzes all your traces. Follow the instructions in Set up trace observer. When you're done, return here with your trace observer information and continue with the next step to configure the agent. Step 3: Configure the agent for Infinite Tracing Infinite Tracing configuration settings include the standard distributed tracing plus information about the trace observer. Find the settings for your language agent below: C SDK Infinite tracing is not available for C SDK. Go Here's an overview of the settings.

(Optional) Customize Infinite Tracing After you add the agent configuration settings, you should start seeing data in the New Relic UI. After you spend some time analyzing your data, you may want to adjust some of the features of Infinite Tracing: Configure trace observer monitoring Configure span attribute trace filter Configure random trace filter Options for older APM agents If you have older APM agents, use this section to figure out if the distributed tracing features you want are supported. Following the compatibility information is a section showing the basic configuration settings to turn on standard distributed tracing. If your older agent supports Infinite Tracing and you want to set it up, see the steps above.

Manual instrumentation (If automatic instrumentation doesn't work) Recommendation: Before performing any custom instrumentation, read: How distributed tracing works Troubleshoot missing data If a service is not passing the trace header to other services, you can use the distributed tracing payload APIs to instrument the calling service and the called service. The calling service uses an API call to generate a payload, which is accepted by the called service. Instrument the calling service To instrument the calling service: Ensure the version of the APM agent that monitors the calling service supports distributed tracing. Invoke the agent API call for generating a distributed trace payload: C SDK | Go | Java | .NET | Node.js | PHP | Python | Ruby. Important To maintain proper ordering of spans in a trace, ensure you generate the payload in the context of the span that sends it. Add that payload to the call made to the destination service (for example, in a header). (Optional) Identify the call as an external call: C SDK Go Java .NET: n/a Node.js PHP: n/a Python Ruby Instrument the called service To instrument the called service: Ensure the version of the APM agent that monitors the called service supports distributed tracing. If the New Relic agent on the called service does not identify a New Relic transaction, use the agent API to declare a transaction: C SDK One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload() is called, a NULL pointer is returned. To solve this problem, follow the procedures to create a transaction with the C SDK. Go One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when Transaction.InsertDistributedTraceHeaders(h http.Header) is called, no headers are inserted. To create a transaction, see Instrument Go transactions. Java One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when Transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(Headers) is called, no headers are inserted (this API requires agent 6.4.0+). To create a transaction, see Java agent transaction-related APIs. .NET One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: CreateDistributedTracePayload() returns an empty payload. To create a transaction, see Introduction to .NET custom instrumentation. Node.js One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: the Node.js agent logs will report an error similar to this: No transaction found when calling Transaction.acceptDistributedTracePayload. Copy Use startWebTransaction to create a web transaction or startBackgroundTransaction to capture a non-web transaction. PHP One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers() returns false. To create a transaction, see newrelic_start_transaction. Python To tell that a transaction is not in progress: when transaction = current_transaction() is run, transaction is None. Or, if result = accept_distributed_trace_payload(payload) is run, then the result is False. Use background_task to report a non-web transaction. For more on Python instrumentation, see Monitor transactions and segments. Ruby If you are using a Rack-based web framework and have enabled New Relic's Rack instrumentation, the Ruby agent will handle starting a transaction for you. For other use cases, see the add_transaction_tracer API method. Extract the payload from the call that you received (for example, in a header). Invoke the call for accepting the payload: C SDK | Go | Java | .NET | PHP | Node.js | Python | Ruby.",

      "body": "Caution Developer mode is deprecated and no longer supported as of Ruby agent version 4.1.0. The New Relic Ruby agent includes Developer mode, a built-in UI for examining details about web transactions in your application. With Developer mode, you can examine the library and database calls made by the controller actions as they are invoked on the Rails instance. The free Developer mode gives you some of the same in-depth transaction visibility you get with New Relic's transaction traces feature. However, it works only in a single Rails instance, and it has much higher overhead than the production version. It is not recommended for use beyond a developer's desktop sandbox. Security considerations The Ruby agent's Developer mode, which is on by default when the RAILS_ENV == \"development\", does not communicate with the New Relic collector in any way. Pie charts are rendered using Google Charts, which involves an HTTP post of aggregate data. Tip The Ruby agent's Production mode, which is on by default when the RAILS_ENV == \"production\" and RAILS_ENV == \"staging\", does communicate with the New Relic site. For more information, see Security. Installation To install Developer mode, install Ruby agent as a plugin or gem. You may also need to set developer_mode to true in your newrelic.yml for the RAILS_ENV in which you are working. Developer mode is on by default only when RAILS_ENV = development. While a newrelic.yml file will be created as part of the installation, it is not necessary to have a valid license key. Known issues Known issues with Developer mode include: Requires Rails 2.3 or higher Developer mode in recent agents only works on Rails 2.3 or higher. It is rack based, and earlier versions of the framework did not incorporate rack. The developer edition installs a middleware in your app that responds to any URL prepended with /newrelic; for example, /newrelic, /newrelic/files/images/foo.png, etc. In some cases the /newrelic URL gets captured by an earlier middleware. In this situation, disable the Developer mode route and include the middleware yourself: At the beginning of the file, in config.ru: require 'newrelic_rpm' require 'new_relic/rack/developer_mode' use NewRelic::Rack::DeveloperMode Copy Incompatible with Pow Developer mode is not supported from Pow, a zero-config Rack server for Mac OS X. Using Developer mode If you run your application on your desktop using thin, WEBrick, or something similar, open the URL /newrelic on your server to see the Developer mode user interface. Caution If you are using Passenger, Unicorn, or other forking application servers on your desktop, you may notice some odd behavior with disappearing data if your application server launches multiple instances. Refer to the Troubleshooting tips, which follow. Developer Mode Breakdown Chart Troubleshooting Troubleshooting tips for Developer mode: Disappearing requests If you have this problem with Unicorn or other multi-worker dispatchers, try limiting the number of workers to 1. Undefined method path for Rack::Request Some users may see an undefined method path for #<Rack::Request>. If you are using Rails version 2.3.2, then you are mostly likely running into a problem with the way the Rack dependency was defined in the Rails package. Either upgrade to 2.3.3 (or higher), or define Rack version 1.0.1 as a dependency in your Gemfile. ActiveRecord reloads Developer mode reloads ActiveRecord method definitions for every reload and reports the time spent defining the methods (such as define_attribute_method). This does not happen in production. To get real results to compare, add the following to the development environment: config.cache_classes = true Copy",

Capability Integration Browser monitoring The Ruby agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see the browser and Ruby agent documentation. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in infrastructure monitoring. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from Synthetics monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

Each of these offers several ways to leverage the power of distributed tracing: Quick start for standard distributed tracing (recommended): A fast way to get started Infinite Tracing: An advanced alternative to standard distributed tracing Older APM agents: Tracing options if you have older APM agents Manual instrumentation: Tips if automatic instrumentation doesn't work Tip If you want to get more background before getting started, check out these topics: How span sampling works explains distributed tracing options. Impacts to APM tells you what to expect if you are a current APM user but haven't set up distributed tracing. Quick start for standard distributed tracing (recommended): This is the best approach to set up standard distributed tracing if you haven't installed any APM agents for your services yet, or if you want to instrument additional services. Tip You'll need a New Relic account to set up distributed tracing. If you don't already have one, you can quickly create a free account. Step 1. Identify services Figure out which services you want to instrument so they each send trace data to New Relic. Step 2. Instrument each service with an APM agent We have installation assistants for a variety of languages to help you instrument each service. You should run the installation assistant for each service you want to instrument to ensure that each installation has a unique application name. To start the assistant, click the link for your language: APM: C APM: Golang APM: Java APM: .NET APM: Node.js APM: PHP APM: Python APM: Ruby Tip This quick-start approach with the installation assistant automatically enables distributed tracing for each service you run it on, but if you already have a APM agent that you want to participate in distributed tracing, you'll need to manually enable distributed tracing. See Options for older APM agents. Step 3. View traces After you instrument each of your services with APM agents, generate some traffic in your application so we can capture some traces. Here are two ways to view your traces in the UI: View traces that include a specific service Here's one way you can see traces for a particular service: Go to one.newrelic.com. Click APM in the top menu bar. Click your service. In the left navigation's Monitor section, click Distributed tracing. If you don't see the traces you want, you can filter by the trace.id. View traces across accounts This option allows you to search all traces across all New Relic accounts in your organization that you have access to. Go to one.newrelic.com. Click Browse data in the top menu bar, and then click Traces. Select your entity in the left pane. If you don't see the traces you want, you can filter by the trace.id. For more help finding your traces in the UI: Understand and use the distributed tracing UI Query distributed trace data Set up Infinite Tracing (advanced option) Standard distributed tracing for APM agents (above) captures up to 10% of your traces, but if you want us to analyze all your data and find the most relevant traces, you can set up Infinite Tracing. This alternative to standard distributed tracing is available for all APM language agents except C SDK. Tip To learn more about this feature, see Infinite Tracing. Before beginning, first ensure you meet the requirements. Step 1. Complete the instrumentation for standard distributed tracing in the quick start above The Infinite Tracing setup builds on the instrumentation step from the Quick start for standard distributed tracing. Step 2. Set up the trace observer The trace observer is a New Relic AWS-based service that collects and analyzes all your traces. Follow the instructions in Set up trace observer. When you're done, return here with your trace observer information and continue with the next step to configure the agent. Step 3: Configure the agent for Infinite Tracing Infinite Tracing configuration settings include the standard distributed tracing plus information about the trace observer. Find the settings for your language agent below: C SDK Infinite tracing is not available for C SDK. Go Here's an overview of the settings. For more help with configuration, see Enable distributed tracing for your Go applications.

For applications using Bundler, additionally include the Infinite Tracing gem in the Gemfile: gem 'newrelic-infinite_tracing' Copy If you're using Rails 3 or higher, or Rails 2.3 in the recommended configuration, Rails will automatically call Bundler.require and cause newrelic-infinite_tracing to be required during startup of your application. If you're using Sinatra or another framework, you must manually call require 'newrelic/infinite_tracing' or manually call Bundler.require.

(Optional) Customize Infinite Tracing After you add the agent configuration settings, you should start seeing data in the New Relic UI. After you spend some time analyzing your data, you may want to adjust some of the features of Infinite Tracing: Configure trace observer monitoring Configure span attribute trace filter Configure random trace filter Options for older APM agents If you have older APM agents, use this section to figure out if the distributed tracing features you want are supported.

Manual instrumentation (If automatic instrumentation doesn't work) Recommendation: Before performing any custom instrumentation, read: How distributed tracing works Troubleshoot missing data If a service is not passing the trace header to other services, you can use the distributed tracing payload APIs to instrument the calling service and the called service. The calling service uses an API call to generate a payload, which is accepted by the called service. Instrument the calling service To instrument the calling service: Ensure the version of the APM agent that monitors the calling service supports distributed tracing. Invoke the agent API call for generating a distributed trace payload: C SDK | Go | Java | .NET | Node.js | PHP | Python | Ruby. Important To maintain proper ordering of spans in a trace, ensure you generate the payload in the context of the span that sends it. Add that payload to the call made to the destination service (for example, in a header). (Optional) Identify the call as an external call: C SDK Go Java .NET: n/a Node.js PHP: n/a Python Ruby Instrument the called service To instrument the called service: Ensure the version of the APM agent that monitors the called service supports distributed tracing. If the New Relic agent on the called service does not identify a New Relic transaction, use the agent API to declare a transaction: C SDK One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload() is called, a NULL pointer is returned. To solve this problem, follow the procedures to create a transaction with the C SDK. Go One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when Transaction.InsertDistributedTraceHeaders(h http.Header) is called, no headers are inserted. To create a transaction, see Instrument Go transactions. Java One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when Transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(Headers) is called, no headers are inserted (this API requires agent 6.4.0+). To create a transaction, see Java agent transaction-related APIs. .NET One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: CreateDistributedTracePayload() returns an empty payload. To create a transaction, see Introduction to .NET custom instrumentation. Node.js One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: the Node.js agent logs will report an error similar to this: No transaction found when calling Transaction.acceptDistributedTracePayload. Copy Use startWebTransaction to create a web transaction or startBackgroundTransaction to capture a non-web transaction. PHP One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers() returns false. To create a transaction, see newrelic_start_transaction. Python To tell that a transaction is not in progress: when transaction = current_transaction() is run, transaction is None. Or, if result = accept_distributed_trace_payload(payload) is run, then the result is False. Use background_task to report a non-web transaction. For more on Python instrumentation, see Monitor transactions and segments. Ruby If you are using a Rack-based web framework and have enabled New Relic's Rack instrumentation, the Ruby agent will handle starting a transaction for you. For other use cases, see the add_transaction_tracer API method. Extract the payload from the call that you received (for example, in a header). Invoke the call for accepting the payload: C SDK | Go | Java | .NET | PHP | Node.js | Python | Ruby.",

The actions in the UI correspond to the pattern expression used to match them. HTTP operations are not distinguished. Multiple matches are all tracked as separate actions. Contents Getting started To set up Sinatra: Install the latest newrelic_rpm gem. In your Sinatra app, immediately below the Sinatra require directive, add: require 'newrelic_rpm' Copy Set RACK_ENV to the environment corresponding to the configuration definitions in your newrelic.yml file; for example, development, staging, production, etc. Note: Developer mode only works with Rails. Middleware installation Ruby agent versions prior to 3.6.3 required manual addition of New Relic middlewares to enable certain features, such as cross application tracing and browser monitoring. For more information about required middlewares, see Rack middlewares, or upgrade to the most recent Ruby agent. Ignoring routes Ruby agent versions 3.6.3 or higher support ignoring certain routes, similar to what was previously available in Rails controller instrumentation. To specify these values, use the same style of routes that you use to define your Sinatra application. For example, to ignore a ping route in a Sinatra app, include the following code in the app: newrelic_ignore '/ping' get '/ping' do # ... end Copy If you want an entire application to be ignored (for example, in a mounted application), call newrelic_ignore without parameters: newrelic_ignore Copy Additionally, newrelic_ignore_apdex and newrelic_ignore_enduser are supported. The newrelic_ignore_apdex call will exclude a given route from consideration in overall Apdex calculations. The newrelic_ignore_enduser call will prevent automatic injection of the page load timing JavaScript when a route is rendered. Padrino Padrino is a framework built on top of Sinatra. Starting with Ruby agent version 3.6.3, New Relic's Sinatra instrumentation works with Padrino versions 0.10.x or higher. Shotgun (not supported) The New Relic Ruby agent will not work with shotgun. It cannot make a connection before the dispatcher process exits. Neither Developer mode nor Monitor mode will work.",

Additionally, the Ruby agent provides some features via Rack middlewares: Cross application traces Auto-instrumentation for browser monitoring New Relic automatically installs these middlewares for Rails and Sinatra. Rack instrumentation The two most common ways to configure Rack middlewares are the Rack::Builder API (most often from config.ru) and Rails' middleware stack configuration: Rack::Builder Middlewares in your config.ru file are configured using Rack::Builder. For the Ruby agent to instrument middlewares from Rack::Builder, your app must run version 1.1.0 or higher of the rack gem. This is the most common use of middlewares with Sinatra or pure-rack applications. Rails middlewares Rails uses its own class (ActionDispatch::MiddlewareStack) instead of Rack::Builder to configure middlewares. Even if you haven't explicitly added middlewares to your Rails application, many components of Rails itself are implemented as middleware, so middleware data will appear by default. The Ruby agent automatically instruments middlewares added via ActionDispatch::MiddlewareStack on Rails 3.0 or higher. For more information about configuring middlewares with Rails, see the Ruby on Rails guide. Viewing middleware data You can view middleware data in APM. In the APM Summary page The main chart on your app's APM Summary page includes a purple bar that shows average time per request spent in all Rack middlewares for your application. APM > (selected application) > Summary: Middleware time appears in purple on your app's main Overview chart. In the APM Transactions page You can also see time for individual middlewares for a specific transaction name from your app's APM Transactions page. APM > (selected application) > Monitor > Transactions > (selected transaction) > Trace details: Here is an example of middleware time for a selected transaction for your app. In APM transaction trace summary Transaction traces also capture detailed middleware call information. APM > (selected application) > Monitor > Transactions > (selected transaction trace): Here is an example of middleware details in a transaction trace. Disabling Rack instrumentation If you do not want to instrument Rack middlewares, you may disable Rack middleware instrumentation with the disable_middleware_instrumentation setting. You can also ignore specific transactions. Installing Ruby agent middlewares manually The Ruby agent's implementation of New Relic's Cross Application Tracing feature uses Rack middleware instrumentation to read and write HTTP headers that are necessary to pass information between monitored applications. If you have disabled middleware instrumentation as described above and want to use cross application tracing, you must manually add the NewRelic::Rack::AgentHooks middleware to your middleware stack. For more information, see Cross application tracing in Ruby. Manual Rack instrumentation Earlier versions of the Ruby agent supported manually instrumenting Rack middlewares via the NewRelic::Agent::Instrumentation::Rack module. This instrumentation is deprecated in Ruby agent versions 3.9.0 or higher, because it is unnecessary with automatic middleware instrumentation. New Relic recommends that you remove references to this module from your code after upgrading to 3.9.0 or higher.",

The actions in the UI correspond to the pattern expression used to match them. HTTP operations are not distinguished. Multiple matches are all tracked as separate actions. Contents Getting started To set up Sinatra: Install the latest newrelic_rpm gem. In your Sinatra app, immediately below the Sinatra require directive, add: require 'newrelic_rpm' Copy Set RACK_ENV to the environment corresponding to the configuration definitions in your newrelic.yml file; for example, development, staging, production, etc. Note: Developer mode only works with Rails. Middleware installation Ruby agent versions prior to 3.6.3 required manual addition of New Relic middlewares to enable certain features, such as cross application tracing and browser monitoring. For more information about required middlewares, see Rack middlewares, or upgrade to the most recent Ruby agent. Ignoring routes Ruby agent versions 3.6.3 or higher support ignoring certain routes, similar to what was previously available in Rails controller instrumentation. To specify these values, use the same style of routes that you use to define your Sinatra application. For example, to ignore a ping route in a Sinatra app, include the following code in the app: newrelic_ignore '/ping' get '/ping' do # ... end Copy If you want an entire application to be ignored (for example, in a mounted application), call newrelic_ignore without parameters: newrelic_ignore Copy Additionally, newrelic_ignore_apdex and newrelic_ignore_enduser are supported. The newrelic_ignore_apdex call will exclude a given route from consideration in overall Apdex calculations. The newrelic_ignore_enduser call will prevent automatic injection of the page load timing JavaScript when a route is rendered. Padrino Padrino is a framework built on top of Sinatra. Starting with Ruby agent version 3.6.3, New Relic's Sinatra instrumentation works with Padrino versions 0.10.x or higher. Shotgun (not supported) The New Relic Ruby agent will not work with shotgun. It cannot make a connection before the dispatcher process exits. Neither Developer mode nor Monitor mode will work.",

Capability Integration Browser monitoring The Ruby agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see the browser and Ruby agent documentation. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in infrastructure monitoring. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from Synthetics monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

New Relic does not recommend running Mongo instrumentation via these gems alongside the Ruby agent's built-in Mongo support. This might double-count metrics such as overall database time. Also, the rpm_contrib and newrelic_mongo gems both use a distinct setting that can be used to disable them if removing those gems entirely isn't possible in your environment.

      "body": "Caution Developer mode is deprecated and no longer supported as of Ruby agent version 4.1.0. The New Relic Ruby agent includes Developer mode, a built-in UI for examining details about web transactions in your application. With Developer mode, you can examine the library and database calls made by the controller actions as they are invoked on the Rails instance. The free Developer mode gives you some of the same in-depth transaction visibility you get with New Relic's transaction traces feature. However, it works only in a single Rails instance, and it has much higher overhead than the production version. It is not recommended for use beyond a developer's desktop sandbox. Security considerations The Ruby agent's Developer mode, which is on by default when the RAILS_ENV == \"development\", does not communicate with the New Relic collector in any way. Pie charts are rendered using Google Charts, which involves an HTTP post of aggregate data. Tip The Ruby agent's Production mode, which is on by default when the RAILS_ENV == \"production\" and RAILS_ENV == \"staging\", does communicate with the New Relic site. For more information, see Security. Installation To install Developer mode, install Ruby agent as a plugin or gem. You may also need to set developer_mode to true in your newrelic.yml for the RAILS_ENV in which you are working. Developer mode is on by default only when RAILS_ENV = development. While a newrelic.yml file will be created as part of the installation, it is not necessary to have a valid license key. Known issues Known issues with Developer mode include: Requires Rails 2.3 or higher Developer mode in recent agents only works on Rails 2.3 or higher. It is rack based, and earlier versions of the framework did not incorporate rack. The developer edition installs a middleware in your app that responds to any URL prepended with /newrelic; for example, /newrelic, /newrelic/files/images/foo.png, etc. In some cases the /newrelic URL gets captured by an earlier middleware. In this situation, disable the Developer mode route and include the middleware yourself: At the beginning of the file, in config.ru: require 'newrelic_rpm' require 'new_relic/rack/developer_mode' use NewRelic::Rack::DeveloperMode Copy Incompatible with Pow Developer mode is not supported from Pow, a zero-config Rack server for Mac OS X. Using Developer mode If you run your application on your desktop using thin, WEBrick, or something similar, open the URL /newrelic on your server to see the Developer mode user interface. Caution If you are using Passenger, Unicorn, or other forking application servers on your desktop, you may notice some odd behavior with disappearing data if your application server launches multiple instances. Refer to the Troubleshooting tips, which follow. Developer Mode Breakdown Chart Troubleshooting Troubleshooting tips for Developer mode: Disappearing requests If you have this problem with Unicorn or other multi-worker dispatchers, try limiting the number of workers to 1. Undefined method path for Rack::Request Some users may see an undefined method path for #<Rack::Request>. If you are using Rails version 2.3.2, then you are mostly likely running into a problem with the way the Rack dependency was defined in the Rails package. Either upgrade to 2.3.3 (or higher), or define Rack version 1.0.1 as a dependency in your Gemfile. ActiveRecord reloads Developer mode reloads ActiveRecord method definitions for every reload and reports the time spent defining the methods (such as define_attribute_method). This does not happen in production. To get real results to compare, add the following to the development environment: config.cache_classes = true Copy",

You can view these key-value pairs in some places in the UI, or by querying that data using NRQL. New Relic gives users the ability to customize exactly which attributes will be sent to each of these destinations. You can also collect custom attributes to send additional data to New Relic. Attribute destination flow This diagram illustrates how an agent decides to send attributes to each destination. Agent attribute collection: An agent makes three different decisions when sending an attribute to any New Relic destination based on the relevant property settings. Property names and syntax vary by agent. (The properties in this diagram are specific to the PHP agent, but the general flow is the same for all agents. Property names and syntax vary by agent.) Types of attributes Attributes can be collected in a variety of ways: Message property attributes: These are the properties set on a message received from a queue or topic. HTTP request attributes: These are the parameters for an HTTP request. User attributes: These are attributes provided by the user through each agent's API. Agent attributes: These are attributes captured by the agent; for example, httpResponseCode and httpResponseMessage. Destinations for attributes Collected attributes appear in these locations: Collected attributes Location Transaction traces Each minute transaction traces collect data for your slowest individual HTTP requests. These traces will report attributes collected during the transaction. Traced errors If a transaction results in an error, these traced errors will be reported to APM. A traced error will contain attributes collected during the transaction. Transaction events APM transactions will contain attributes collected during the transaction. Insights page views Browser page views will contain attributes collected during the transaction. However, attributes collected at the end of a transaction may not appear on PageView events. This destination is also called browser monitoring. Span events Span events collected for distributed tracing will contain attributes collected during the span. The following agents support the addition of custom user attributes to span events: Java agent 5.13.0 and above Go agent 3.6.0 and above .NET agent 8.25 and above Node agent 6.10.0 and above PHP agent 9.12.0.268 and above Python agent 5.8.0.136 and above Ruby agent 6.8.0 and above Transaction segments Each segment in a transaction trace will contain attributes recorded for that segment. Viewing request attributes Request attributes are associated with specific transaction traces, browser traces, and errors in APM and dashboards. You can see the attributes recorded with a request when viewing the individual trace or error. Custom attributes can be queried via NRQL exactly like any other attribute. APM > (select an app) > Monitoring > Transactions > (select a transaction) > (select a trace): Here is an example from the Ruby agent of the Request attributes and Custom attributes for a transaction trace. Exact attributes depend on your agent and on your attribute configuration. Limits User attributes, request attributes, and message queue parameters are limited by count and size.

The New Relic Ruby agent includes Developer mode, a built-in UI for examining details about web transactions in your application. With Developer mode, you can examine the library and database calls made by the controller actions as they are invoked on the Rails instance. The free Developer mode gives you some of the same in-depth transaction visibility you get with New Relic's transaction traces feature. However, it works only in a single Rails instance, and it has much higher overhead than the production version. It is not recommended for use beyond a developer's desktop sandbox. Security considerations The Ruby agent's Developer mode, which is on by default when the RAILS_ENV == \"development\", does not communicate with the New Relic collector in any way. Pie charts are rendered using Google Charts, which involves an HTTP post of aggregate data. Tip The Ruby agent's Production mode, which is on by default when the RAILS_ENV == \"production\" and RAILS_ENV == \"staging\", does communicate with the New Relic site. For more information, see Security. Installation To install Developer mode, install Ruby agent as a plugin or gem. You may also need to set developer_mode to true in your newrelic.yml for the RAILS_ENV in which you are working. Developer mode is on by default only when RAILS_ENV = development. While a newrelic.yml file will be created as part of the installation, it is not necessary to have a valid license key. Known issues Known issues with Developer mode include: Requires Rails 2.3 or higher Developer mode in recent agents only works on Rails 2.3 or higher. It is rack based, and earlier versions of the framework did not incorporate rack. The developer edition installs a middleware in your app that responds to any URL prepended with /newrelic; for example, /newrelic, /newrelic/files/images/foo.png, etc. In some cases the /newrelic URL gets captured by an earlier middleware. In this situation, disable the Developer mode route and include the middleware yourself: At the beginning of the file, in config.ru: require 'newrelic_rpm' require 'new_relic/rack/developer_mode' use NewRelic::Rack::DeveloperMode Copy Incompatible with Pow Developer mode is not supported from Pow, a zero-config Rack server for Mac OS X. Using Developer mode If you run your application on your desktop using thin, WEBrick, or something similar, open the URL /newrelic on your server to see the Developer mode user interface. Caution If you are using Passenger, Unicorn, or other forking application servers on your desktop, you may notice some odd behavior with disappearing data if your application server launches multiple instances. Refer to the Troubleshooting tips, which follow. Developer Mode Breakdown Chart Troubleshooting Troubleshooting tips for Developer mode: Disappearing requests If you have this problem with Unicorn or other multi-worker dispatchers, try limiting the number of workers to 1. Undefined method path for Rack::Request Some users may see an undefined method path for #<Rack::Request>. If you are using Rails version 2.3.2, then you are mostly likely running into a problem with the way the Rack dependency was defined in the Rails package. Either upgrade to 2.3.3 (or higher), or define Rack version 1.0.1 as a dependency in your Gemfile. ActiveRecord reloads Developer mode reloads ActiveRecord method definitions for every reload and reports the time spent defining the methods (such as define_attribute_method). This does not happen in production. To get real results to compare, add the following to the development environment: config.cache_classes = true Copy",

Capability Integration Browser monitoring The Ruby agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see the browser and Ruby agent documentation. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in infrastructure monitoring. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from Synthetics monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

Refer to the Troubleshooting tips, which follow. Developer Mode Breakdown Chart Troubleshooting Troubleshooting tips for Developer mode: Disappearing requests If you have this problem with Unicorn or other multi-worker dispatchers, try limiting the number of workers to 1. Undefined method path for Rack::Request Some users may see an undefined method path for #<Rack::Request>. If you are using Rails version 2.3.2, then you are mostly likely running into a problem with the way the Rack dependency was defined in the Rails package. Either upgrade to 2.3.3 (or higher), or define Rack version 1.0.1 as a dependency in your Gemfile.

Capability Integration Browser monitoring The Ruby agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see the browser and Ruby agent documentation. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in infrastructure monitoring. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from Synthetics monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

      "body": "Attributes are key-value pairs containing information that determines the properties of an event or transaction. You can view these key-value pairs in some places in the UI, or by querying that data using NRQL. New Relic gives users the ability to customize exactly which attributes will be sent to each of these destinations. You can also collect custom attributes to send additional data to New Relic. Attribute destination flow This diagram illustrates how an agent decides to send attributes to each destination. Agent attribute collection: An agent makes three different decisions when sending an attribute to any New Relic destination based on the relevant property settings. Property names and syntax vary by agent. (The properties in this diagram are specific to the PHP agent, but the general flow is the same for all agents. Property names and syntax vary by agent.) Types of attributes Attributes can be collected in a variety of ways: Message property attributes: These are the properties set on a message received from a queue or topic. HTTP request attributes: These are the parameters for an HTTP request. User attributes: These are attributes provided by the user through each agent's API. Agent attributes: These are attributes captured by the agent; for example, httpResponseCode and httpResponseMessage. Destinations for attributes Collected attributes appear in these locations: Collected attributes Location Transaction traces Each minute transaction traces collect data for your slowest individual HTTP requests. These traces will report attributes collected during the transaction. Traced errors If a transaction results in an error, these traced errors will be reported to APM. A traced error will contain attributes collected during the transaction. Transaction events APM transactions will contain attributes collected during the transaction. Insights page views Browser page views will contain attributes collected during the transaction. However, attributes collected at the end of a transaction may not appear on PageView events. This destination is also called browser monitoring. Span events Span events collected for distributed tracing will contain attributes collected during the span. The following agents support the addition of custom user attributes to span events: Java agent 5.13.0 and above Go agent 3.6.0 and above .NET agent 8.25 and above Node agent 6.10.0 and above PHP agent 9.12.0.268 and above Python agent 5.8.0.136 and above Ruby agent 6.8.0 and above Transaction segments Each segment in a transaction trace will contain attributes recorded for that segment. Viewing request attributes Request attributes are associated with specific transaction traces, browser traces, and errors in APM and dashboards. You can see the attributes recorded with a request when viewing the individual trace or error. Custom attributes can be queried via NRQL exactly like any other attribute. APM > (select an app) > Monitoring > Transactions > (select a transaction) > (select a trace): Here is an example from the Ruby agent of the Request attributes and Custom attributes for a transaction trace. Exact attributes depend on your agent and on your attribute configuration. Limits User attributes, request attributes, and message queue parameters are limited by count and size. Parameter Limitations Transaction Limited to 64 user attributes Attribute key Limited to 256 bytes each If the key is more than 256 bytes, then the attribute will not be recorded. Attribute value Limited to 256 bytes each If the value is greater than 256 bytes, then the attribute value will be truncated. Agent-specific attributes Each APM agent collects custom attributes. The supported attributes depend on the specific agent: C SDK Go Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby",

      "body": "Caution Developer mode is deprecated and no longer supported as of Ruby agent version 4.1.0. The New Relic Ruby agent includes Developer mode, a built-in UI for examining details about web transactions in your application. With Developer mode, you can examine the library and database calls made by the controller actions as they are invoked on the Rails instance. The free Developer mode gives you some of the same in-depth transaction visibility you get with New Relic's transaction traces feature. However, it works only in a single Rails instance, and it has much higher overhead than the production version. It is not recommended for use beyond a developer's desktop sandbox. Security considerations The Ruby agent's Developer mode, which is on by default when the RAILS_ENV == \"development\", does not communicate with the New Relic collector in any way. Pie charts are rendered using Google Charts, which involves an HTTP post of aggregate data. Tip The Ruby agent's Production mode, which is on by default when the RAILS_ENV == \"production\" and RAILS_ENV == \"staging\", does communicate with the New Relic site. For more information, see Security. Installation To install Developer mode, install Ruby agent as a plugin or gem. You may also need to set developer_mode to true in your newrelic.yml for the RAILS_ENV in which you are working. Developer mode is on by default only when RAILS_ENV = development. While a newrelic.yml file will be created as part of the installation, it is not necessary to have a valid license key. Known issues Known issues with Developer mode include: Requires Rails 2.3 or higher Developer mode in recent agents only works on Rails 2.3 or higher. It is rack based, and earlier versions of the framework did not incorporate rack. The developer edition installs a middleware in your app that responds to any URL prepended with /newrelic; for example, /newrelic, /newrelic/files/images/foo.png, etc. In some cases the /newrelic URL gets captured by an earlier middleware. In this situation, disable the Developer mode route and include the middleware yourself: At the beginning of the file, in config.ru: require 'newrelic_rpm' require 'new_relic/rack/developer_mode' use NewRelic::Rack::DeveloperMode Copy Incompatible with Pow Developer mode is not supported from Pow, a zero-config Rack server for Mac OS X. Using Developer mode If you run your application on your desktop using thin, WEBrick, or something similar, open the URL /newrelic on your server to see the Developer mode user interface. Caution If you are using Passenger, Unicorn, or other forking application servers on your desktop, you may notice some odd behavior with disappearing data if your application server launches multiple instances.

      "body": "Attributes are key-value pairs containing information that determines the properties of an event or transaction. You can view these key-value pairs in some places in the UI, or by querying that data using NRQL. New Relic gives users the ability to customize exactly which attributes will be sent to each of these destinations. You can also collect custom attributes to send additional data to New Relic. Attribute destination flow This diagram illustrates how an agent decides to send attributes to each destination. Agent attribute collection: An agent makes three different decisions when sending an attribute to any New Relic destination based on the relevant property settings. Property names and syntax vary by agent. (The properties in this diagram are specific to the PHP agent, but the general flow is the same for all agents. Property names and syntax vary by agent.) Types of attributes Attributes can be collected in a variety of ways: Message property attributes: These are the properties set on a message received from a queue or topic. HTTP request attributes: These are the parameters for an HTTP request. User attributes: These are attributes provided by the user through each agent's API. Agent attributes: These are attributes captured by the agent; for example, httpResponseCode and httpResponseMessage. Destinations for attributes Collected attributes appear in these locations: Collected attributes Location Transaction traces Each minute transaction traces collect data for your slowest individual HTTP requests. These traces will report attributes collected during the transaction. Traced errors If a transaction results in an error, these traced errors will be reported to APM. A traced error will contain attributes collected during the transaction. Transaction events APM transactions will contain attributes collected during the transaction. Insights page views Browser page views will contain attributes collected during the transaction. However, attributes collected at the end of a transaction may not appear on PageView events. This destination is also called browser monitoring. Span events Span events collected for distributed tracing will contain attributes collected during the span. The following agents support the addition of custom user attributes to span events: Java agent 5.13.0 and above Go agent 3.6.0 and above .NET agent 8.25 and above Node agent 6.10.0 and above PHP agent 9.12.0.268 and above Python agent 5.8.0.136 and above Ruby agent 6.8.0 and above Transaction segments Each segment in a transaction trace will contain attributes recorded for that segment. Viewing request attributes Request attributes are associated with specific transaction traces, browser traces, and errors in APM and dashboards. You can see the attributes recorded with a request when viewing the individual trace or error. Custom attributes can be queried via NRQL exactly like any other attribute. APM > (select an app) > Monitoring > Transactions > (select a transaction) > (select a trace): Here is an example from the Ruby agent of the Request attributes and Custom attributes for a transaction trace. Exact attributes depend on your agent and on your attribute configuration. Limits User attributes, request attributes, and message queue parameters are limited by count and size. Parameter Limitations Transaction Limited to 64 user attributes Attribute key Limited to 256 bytes each If the key is more than 256 bytes, then the attribute will not be recorded. Attribute value Limited to 256 bytes each If the value is greater than 256 bytes, then the attribute value will be truncated. Agent-specific attributes Each APM agent collects custom attributes. The supported attributes depend on the specific agent: C SDK Go Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby",

      "body": "Caution Developer mode is deprecated and no longer supported as of Ruby agent version 4.1.0. The New Relic Ruby agent includes Developer mode, a built-in UI for examining details about web transactions in your application. With Developer mode, you can examine the library and database calls made by the controller actions as they are invoked on the Rails instance. The free Developer mode gives you some of the same in-depth transaction visibility you get with New Relic's transaction traces feature. However, it works only in a single Rails instance, and it has much higher overhead than the production version. It is not recommended for use beyond a developer's desktop sandbox. Security considerations The Ruby agent's Developer mode, which is on by default when the RAILS_ENV == \"development\", does not communicate with the New Relic collector in any way. Pie charts are rendered using Google Charts, which involves an HTTP post of aggregate data. Tip The Ruby agent's Production mode, which is on by default when the RAILS_ENV == \"production\" and RAILS_ENV == \"staging\", does communicate with the New Relic site. For more information, see Security. Installation To install Developer mode, install Ruby agent as a plugin or gem. You may also need to set developer_mode to true in your newrelic.yml for the RAILS_ENV in which you are working. Developer mode is on by default only when RAILS_ENV = development. While a newrelic.yml file will be created as part of the installation, it is not necessary to have a valid license key. Known issues Known issues with Developer mode include: Requires Rails 2.3 or higher Developer mode in recent agents only works on Rails 2.3 or higher. It is rack based, and earlier versions of the framework did not incorporate rack. The developer edition installs a middleware in your app that responds to any URL prepended with /newrelic; for example, /newrelic, /newrelic/files/images/foo.png, etc. In some cases the /newrelic URL gets captured by an earlier middleware. In this situation, disable the Developer mode route and include the middleware yourself: At the beginning of the file, in config.ru: require 'newrelic_rpm' require 'new_relic/rack/developer_mode' use NewRelic::Rack::DeveloperMode Copy Incompatible with Pow Developer mode is not supported from Pow, a zero-config Rack server for Mac OS X. Using Developer mode If you run your application on your desktop using thin, WEBrick, or something similar, open the URL /newrelic on your server to see the Developer mode user interface. Caution If you are using Passenger, Unicorn, or other forking application servers on your desktop, you may notice some odd behavior with disappearing data if your application server launches multiple instances. Refer to the Troubleshooting tips, which follow. Developer Mode Breakdown Chart Troubleshooting Troubleshooting tips for Developer mode: Disappearing requests If you have this problem with Unicorn or other multi-worker dispatchers, try limiting the number of workers to 1. Undefined method path for Rack::Request Some users may see an undefined method path for #<Rack::Request>. If you are using Rails version 2.3.2, then you are mostly likely running into a problem with the way the Rack dependency was defined in the Rails package. Either upgrade to 2.3.3 (or higher), or define Rack version 1.0.1 as a dependency in your Gemfile. ActiveRecord reloads Developer mode reloads ActiveRecord method definitions for every reload and reports the time spent defining the methods (such as define_attribute_method). This does not happen in production. To get real results to compare, add the following to the development environment: config.cache_classes = true Copy",

Types of attributes Attributes can be collected in a variety of ways: Message property attributes: These are the properties set on a message received from a queue or topic. HTTP request attributes: These are the parameters for an HTTP request. User attributes: These are attributes provided by the user through each agent's API. Agent attributes: These are attributes captured by the agent; for example, httpResponseCode and httpResponseMessage. Destinations for attributes Collected attributes appear in these locations: Collected attributes Location Transaction traces Each minute transaction traces collect data for your slowest individual HTTP requests. These traces will report attributes collected during the transaction. Traced errors If a transaction results in an error, these traced errors will be reported to APM. A traced error will contain attributes collected during the transaction. Transaction events APM transactions will contain attributes collected during the transaction. Insights page views Browser page views will contain attributes collected during the transaction. However, attributes collected at the end of a transaction may not appear on PageView events. This destination is also called browser monitoring. Span events Span events collected for distributed tracing will contain attributes collected during the span. The following agents support the addition of custom user attributes to span events: Java agent 5.13.0 and above Go agent 3.6.0 and above .NET agent 8.25 and above Node agent 6.10.0 and above PHP agent 9.12.0.268 and above Python agent 5.8.0.136 and above Ruby agent 6.8.0 and above Transaction segments Each segment in a transaction trace will contain attributes recorded for that segment. Viewing request attributes Request attributes are associated with specific transaction traces, browser traces, and errors in APM and dashboards. You can see the attributes recorded with a request when viewing the individual trace or error. Custom attributes can be queried via NRQL exactly like any other attribute. APM > (select an app) > Monitoring > Transactions > (select a transaction) > (select a trace): Here is an example from the Ruby agent of the Request attributes and Custom attributes for a transaction trace. Exact attributes depend on your agent and on your attribute configuration. Limits User attributes, request attributes, and message queue parameters are limited by count and size. Parameter Limitations Transaction Limited to 64 user attributes Attribute key Limited to 256 bytes each If the key is more than 256 bytes, then the attribute will not be recorded. Attribute value Limited to 256 bytes each If the value is greater than 256 bytes, then the attribute value will be truncated. Agent-specific attributes Each APM agent collects custom attributes.

The New Relic Ruby agent includes Developer mode, a built-in UI for examining details about web transactions in your application. With Developer mode, you can examine the library and database calls made by the controller actions as they are invoked on the Rails instance. The free Developer mode gives you some of the same in-depth transaction visibility you get with New Relic's transaction traces feature. However, it works only in a single Rails instance, and it has much higher overhead than the production version. It is not recommended for use beyond a developer's desktop sandbox. Security considerations The Ruby agent's Developer mode, which is on by default when the RAILS_ENV == \"development\", does not communicate with the New Relic collector in any way. Pie charts are rendered using Google Charts, which involves an HTTP post of aggregate data. Tip The Ruby agent's Production mode, which is on by default when the RAILS_ENV == \"production\" and RAILS_ENV == \"staging\", does communicate with the New Relic site. For more information, see Security. Installation To install Developer mode, install Ruby agent as a plugin or gem. You may also need to set developer_mode to true in your newrelic.yml for the RAILS_ENV in which you are working. Developer mode is on by default only when RAILS_ENV = development. While a newrelic.yml file will be created as part of the installation, it is not necessary to have a valid license key. Known issues Known issues with Developer mode include: Requires Rails 2.3 or higher Developer mode in recent agents only works on Rails 2.3 or higher. It is rack based, and earlier versions of the framework did not incorporate rack. The developer edition installs a middleware in your app that responds to any URL prepended with /newrelic; for example, /newrelic, /newrelic/files/images/foo.png, etc. In some cases the /newrelic URL gets captured by an earlier middleware. In this situation, disable the Developer mode route and include the middleware yourself: At the beginning of the file, in config.ru: require 'newrelic_rpm' require 'new_relic/rack/developer_mode' use NewRelic::Rack::DeveloperMode Copy Incompatible with Pow Developer mode is not supported from Pow, a zero-config Rack server for Mac OS X. Using Developer mode If you run your application on your desktop using thin, WEBrick, or something similar, open the URL /newrelic on your server to see the Developer mode user interface. Caution If you are using Passenger, Unicorn, or other forking application servers on your desktop, you may notice some odd behavior with disappearing data if your application server launches multiple instances. Refer to the Troubleshooting tips, which follow. Developer Mode Breakdown Chart Troubleshooting Troubleshooting tips for Developer mode: Disappearing requests If you have this problem with Unicorn or other multi-worker dispatchers, try limiting the number of workers to 1. Undefined method path for Rack::Request Some users may see an undefined method path for #<Rack::Request>. If you are using Rails version 2.3.2, then you are mostly likely running into a problem with the way the Rack dependency was defined in the Rails package. Either upgrade to 2.3.3 (or higher), or define Rack version 1.0.1 as a dependency in your Gemfile. ActiveRecord reloads Developer mode reloads ActiveRecord method definitions for every reload and reports the time spent defining the methods (such as define_attribute_method). This does not happen in production. To get real results to compare, add the following to the development environment: config.cache_classes = true Copy",

Capability Integration Browser monitoring The Ruby agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see the browser and Ruby agent documentation. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in infrastructure monitoring. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from Synthetics monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

Capability Integration Browser monitoring The Ruby agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see the browser and Ruby agent documentation. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in infrastructure monitoring. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from Synthetics monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

      "body": "Attributes are key-value pairs containing information that determines the properties of an event or transaction. You can view these key-value pairs in some places in the UI, or by querying that data using NRQL. New Relic gives users the ability to customize exactly which attributes will be sent to each of these destinations. You can also collect custom attributes to send additional data to New Relic. Attribute destination flow This diagram illustrates how an agent decides to send attributes to each destination. Agent attribute collection: An agent makes three different decisions when sending an attribute to any New Relic destination based on the relevant property settings. Property names and syntax vary by agent. (The properties in this diagram are specific to the PHP agent, but the general flow is the same for all agents. Property names and syntax vary by agent.) Types of attributes Attributes can be collected in a variety of ways: Message property attributes: These are the properties set on a message received from a queue or topic. HTTP request attributes: These are the parameters for an HTTP request. User attributes: These are attributes provided by the user through each agent's API. Agent attributes: These are attributes captured by the agent; for example, httpResponseCode and httpResponseMessage. Destinations for attributes Collected attributes appear in these locations: Collected attributes Location Transaction traces Each minute transaction traces collect data for your slowest individual HTTP requests. These traces will report attributes collected during the transaction. Traced errors If a transaction results in an error, these traced errors will be reported to APM. A traced error will contain attributes collected during the transaction. Transaction events APM transactions will contain attributes collected during the transaction. Insights page views Browser page views will contain attributes collected during the transaction. However, attributes collected at the end of a transaction may not appear on PageView events. This destination is also called browser monitoring. Span events Span events collected for distributed tracing will contain attributes collected during the span. The following agents support the addition of custom user attributes to span events: Java agent 5.13.0 and above Go agent 3.6.0 and above .NET agent 8.25 and above Node agent 6.10.0 and above PHP agent 9.12.0.268 and above Python agent 5.8.0.136 and above Ruby agent 6.8.0 and above Transaction segments Each segment in a transaction trace will contain attributes recorded for that segment. Viewing request attributes Request attributes are associated with specific transaction traces, browser traces, and errors in APM and dashboards. You can see the attributes recorded with a request when viewing the individual trace or error. Custom attributes can be queried via NRQL exactly like any other attribute. APM > (select an app) > Monitoring > Transactions > (select a transaction) > (select a trace): Here is an example from the Ruby agent of the Request attributes and Custom attributes for a transaction trace. Exact attributes depend on your agent and on your attribute configuration. Limits User attributes, request attributes, and message queue parameters are limited by count and size. Parameter Limitations Transaction Limited to 64 user attributes Attribute key Limited to 256 bytes each If the key is more than 256 bytes, then the attribute will not be recorded. Attribute value Limited to 256 bytes each If the value is greater than 256 bytes, then the attribute value will be truncated. Agent-specific attributes Each APM agent collects custom attributes. The supported attributes depend on the specific agent: C SDK Go Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby",

      "body": "Caution Developer mode is deprecated and no longer supported as of Ruby agent version 4.1.0. The New Relic Ruby agent includes Developer mode, a built-in UI for examining details about web transactions in your application. With Developer mode, you can examine the library and database calls made by the controller actions as they are invoked on the Rails instance. The free Developer mode gives you some of the same in-depth transaction visibility you get with New Relic's transaction traces feature. However, it works only in a single Rails instance, and it has much higher overhead than the production version. It is not recommended for use beyond a developer's desktop sandbox. Security considerations The Ruby agent's Developer mode, which is on by default when the RAILS_ENV == \"development\", does not communicate with the New Relic collector in any way. Pie charts are rendered using Google Charts, which involves an HTTP post of aggregate data. Tip The Ruby agent's Production mode, which is on by default when the RAILS_ENV == \"production\" and RAILS_ENV == \"staging\", does communicate with the New Relic site. For more information, see Security. Installation To install Developer mode, install Ruby agent as a plugin or gem. You may also need to set developer_mode to true in your newrelic.yml for the RAILS_ENV in which you are working. Developer mode is on by default only when RAILS_ENV = development. While a newrelic.yml file will be created as part of the installation, it is not necessary to have a valid license key. Known issues Known issues with Developer mode include: Requires Rails 2.3 or higher Developer mode in recent agents only works on Rails 2.3 or higher. It is rack based, and earlier versions of the framework did not incorporate rack. The developer edition installs a middleware in your app that responds to any URL prepended with /newrelic; for example, /newrelic, /newrelic/files/images/foo.png, etc. In some cases the /newrelic URL gets captured by an earlier middleware. In this situation, disable the Developer mode route and include the middleware yourself: At the beginning of the file, in config.ru: require 'newrelic_rpm' require 'new_relic/rack/developer_mode' use NewRelic::Rack::DeveloperMode Copy Incompatible with Pow Developer mode is not supported from Pow, a zero-config Rack server for Mac OS X.

      "body": "Attributes are key-value pairs containing information that determines the properties of an event or transaction. You can view these key-value pairs in some places in the UI, or by querying that data using NRQL. New Relic gives users the ability to customize exactly which attributes will be sent to each of these destinations. You can also collect custom attributes to send additional data to New Relic. Attribute destination flow This diagram illustrates how an agent decides to send attributes to each destination. Agent attribute collection: An agent makes three different decisions when sending an attribute to any New Relic destination based on the relevant property settings. Property names and syntax vary by agent. (The properties in this diagram are specific to the PHP agent, but the general flow is the same for all agents. Property names and syntax vary by agent.) Types of attributes Attributes can be collected in a variety of ways: Message property attributes: These are the properties set on a message received from a queue or topic. HTTP request attributes: These are the parameters for an HTTP request. User attributes: These are attributes provided by the user through each agent's API. Agent attributes: These are attributes captured by the agent; for example, httpResponseCode and httpResponseMessage. Destinations for attributes Collected attributes appear in these locations: Collected attributes Location Transaction traces Each minute transaction traces collect data for your slowest individual HTTP requests. These traces will report attributes collected during the transaction. Traced errors If a transaction results in an error, these traced errors will be reported to APM. A traced error will contain attributes collected during the transaction. Transaction events APM transactions will contain attributes collected during the transaction. Insights page views Browser page views will contain attributes collected during the transaction. However, attributes collected at the end of a transaction may not appear on PageView events. This destination is also called browser monitoring. Span events Span events collected for distributed tracing will contain attributes collected during the span. The following agents support the addition of custom user attributes to span events: Java agent 5.13.0 and above Go agent 3.6.0 and above .NET agent 8.25 and above Node agent 6.10.0 and above PHP agent 9.12.0.268 and above Python agent 5.8.0.136 and above Ruby agent 6.8.0 and above Transaction segments Each segment in a transaction trace will contain attributes recorded for that segment. Viewing request attributes Request attributes are associated with specific transaction traces, browser traces, and errors in APM and dashboards. You can see the attributes recorded with a request when viewing the individual trace or error. Custom attributes can be queried via NRQL exactly like any other attribute. APM > (select an app) > Monitoring > Transactions > (select a transaction) > (select a trace): Here is an example from the Ruby agent of the Request attributes and Custom attributes for a transaction trace. Exact attributes depend on your agent and on your attribute configuration. Limits User attributes, request attributes, and message queue parameters are limited by count and size. Parameter Limitations Transaction Limited to 64 user attributes Attribute key Limited to 256 bytes each If the key is more than 256 bytes, then the attribute will not be recorded. Attribute value Limited to 256 bytes each If the value is greater than 256 bytes, then the attribute value will be truncated. Agent-specific attributes Each APM agent collects custom attributes. The supported attributes depend on the specific agent: C SDK Go Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby",

      "body": "Caution Developer mode is deprecated and no longer supported as of Ruby agent version 4.1.0. The New Relic Ruby agent includes Developer mode, a built-in UI for examining details about web transactions in your application. With Developer mode, you can examine the library and database calls made by the controller actions as they are invoked on the Rails instance. The free Developer mode gives you some of the same in-depth transaction visibility you get with New Relic's transaction traces feature. However, it works only in a single Rails instance, and it has much higher overhead than the production version. It is not recommended for use beyond a developer's desktop sandbox. Security considerations The Ruby agent's Developer mode, which is on by default when the RAILS_ENV == \"development\", does not communicate with the New Relic collector in any way. Pie charts are rendered using Google Charts, which involves an HTTP post of aggregate data. Tip The Ruby agent's Production mode, which is on by default when the RAILS_ENV == \"production\" and RAILS_ENV == \"staging\", does communicate with the New Relic site. For more information, see Security. Installation To install Developer mode, install Ruby agent as a plugin or gem. You may also need to set developer_mode to true in your newrelic.yml for the RAILS_ENV in which you are working. Developer mode is on by default only when RAILS_ENV = development. While a newrelic.yml file will be created as part of the installation, it is not necessary to have a valid license key. Known issues Known issues with Developer mode include: Requires Rails 2.3 or higher Developer mode in recent agents only works on Rails 2.3 or higher. It is rack based, and earlier versions of the framework did not incorporate rack. The developer edition installs a middleware in your app that responds to any URL prepended with /newrelic; for example, /newrelic, /newrelic/files/images/foo.png, etc. In some cases the /newrelic URL gets captured by an earlier middleware. In this situation, disable the Developer mode route and include the middleware yourself: At the beginning of the file, in config.ru: require 'newrelic_rpm' require 'new_relic/rack/developer_mode' use NewRelic::Rack::DeveloperMode Copy Incompatible with Pow Developer mode is not supported from Pow, a zero-config Rack server for Mac OS X. Using Developer mode If you run your application on your desktop using thin, WEBrick, or something similar, open the URL /newrelic on your server to see the Developer mode user interface. Caution If you are using Passenger, Unicorn, or other forking application servers on your desktop, you may notice some odd behavior with disappearing data if your application server launches multiple instances. Refer to the Troubleshooting tips, which follow. Developer Mode Breakdown Chart Troubleshooting Troubleshooting tips for Developer mode: Disappearing requests If you have this problem with Unicorn or other multi-worker dispatchers, try limiting the number of workers to 1. Undefined method path for Rack::Request Some users may see an undefined method path for #<Rack::Request>. If you are using Rails version 2.3.2, then you are mostly likely running into a problem with the way the Rack dependency was defined in the Rails package. Either upgrade to 2.3.3 (or higher), or define Rack version 1.0.1 as a dependency in your Gemfile. ActiveRecord reloads Developer mode reloads ActiveRecord method definitions for every reload and reports the time spent defining the methods (such as define_attribute_method). This does not happen in production. To get real results to compare, add the following to the development environment: config.cache_classes = true Copy",

Types of attributes Attributes can be collected in a variety of ways: Message property attributes: These are the properties set on a message received from a queue or topic. HTTP request attributes: These are the parameters for an HTTP request. User attributes: These are attributes provided by the user through each agent's API. Agent attributes: These are attributes captured by the agent; for example, httpResponseCode and httpResponseMessage. Destinations for attributes Collected attributes appear in these locations: Collected attributes Location Transaction traces Each minute transaction traces collect data for your slowest individual HTTP requests. These traces will report attributes collected during the transaction. Traced errors If a transaction results in an error, these traced errors will be reported to APM. A traced error will contain attributes collected during the transaction. Transaction events APM transactions will contain attributes collected during the transaction. Insights page views Browser page views will contain attributes collected during the transaction. However, attributes collected at the end of a transaction may not appear on PageView events. This destination is also called browser monitoring. Span events Span events collected for distributed tracing will contain attributes collected during the span. The following agents support the addition of custom user attributes to span events: Java agent 5.13.0 and above Go agent 3.6.0 and above .NET agent 8.25 and above Node agent 6.10.0 and above PHP agent 9.12.0.268 and above Python agent 5.8.0.136 and above Ruby agent 6.8.0 and above Transaction segments Each segment in a transaction trace will contain attributes recorded for that segment. Viewing request attributes Request attributes are associated with specific transaction traces, browser traces, and errors in APM and dashboards. You can see the attributes recorded with a request when viewing the individual trace or error. Custom attributes can be queried via NRQL exactly like any other attribute. APM > (select an app) > Monitoring > Transactions > (select a transaction) > (select a trace): Here is an example from the Ruby agent of the Request attributes and Custom attributes for a transaction trace. Exact attributes depend on your agent and on your attribute configuration. Limits User attributes, request attributes, and message queue parameters are limited by count and size. Parameter Limitations Transaction Limited to 64 user attributes Attribute key Limited to 256 bytes each If the key is more than 256 bytes, then the attribute will not be recorded. Attribute value Limited to 256 bytes each If the value is greater than 256 bytes, then the attribute value will be truncated. Agent-specific attributes Each APM agent collects custom attributes.

The New Relic Ruby agent includes Developer mode, a built-in UI for examining details about web transactions in your application. With Developer mode, you can examine the library and database calls made by the controller actions as they are invoked on the Rails instance. The free Developer mode gives you some of the same in-depth transaction visibility you get with New Relic's transaction traces feature. However, it works only in a single Rails instance, and it has much higher overhead than the production version. It is not recommended for use beyond a developer's desktop sandbox. Security considerations The Ruby agent's Developer mode, which is on by default when the RAILS_ENV == \"development\", does not communicate with the New Relic collector in any way. Pie charts are rendered using Google Charts, which involves an HTTP post of aggregate data. Tip The Ruby agent's Production mode, which is on by default when the RAILS_ENV == \"production\" and RAILS_ENV == \"staging\", does communicate with the New Relic site. For more information, see Security. Installation To install Developer mode, install Ruby agent as a plugin or gem. You may also need to set developer_mode to true in your newrelic.yml for the RAILS_ENV in which you are working. Developer mode is on by default only when RAILS_ENV = development. While a newrelic.yml file will be created as part of the installation, it is not necessary to have a valid license key. Known issues Known issues with Developer mode include: Requires Rails 2.3 or higher Developer mode in recent agents only works on Rails 2.3 or higher. It is rack based, and earlier versions of the framework did not incorporate rack. The developer edition installs a middleware in your app that responds to any URL prepended with /newrelic; for example, /newrelic, /newrelic/files/images/foo.png, etc. In some cases the /newrelic URL gets captured by an earlier middleware. In this situation, disable the Developer mode route and include the middleware yourself: At the beginning of the file, in config.ru: require 'newrelic_rpm' require 'new_relic/rack/developer_mode' use NewRelic::Rack::DeveloperMode Copy Incompatible with Pow Developer mode is not supported from Pow, a zero-config Rack server for Mac OS X. Using Developer mode If you run your application on your desktop using thin, WEBrick, or something similar, open the URL /newrelic on your server to see the Developer mode user interface. Caution If you are using Passenger, Unicorn, or other forking application servers on your desktop, you may notice some odd behavior with disappearing data if your application server launches multiple instances. Refer to the Troubleshooting tips, which follow. Developer Mode Breakdown Chart Troubleshooting Troubleshooting tips for Developer mode: Disappearing requests If you have this problem with Unicorn or other multi-worker dispatchers, try limiting the number of workers to 1. Undefined method path for Rack::Request Some users may see an undefined method path for #<Rack::Request>. If you are using Rails version 2.3.2, then you are mostly likely running into a problem with the way the Rack dependency was defined in the Rails package. Either upgrade to 2.3.3 (or higher), or define Rack version 1.0.1 as a dependency in your Gemfile. ActiveRecord reloads Developer mode reloads ActiveRecord method definitions for every reload and reports the time spent defining the methods (such as define_attribute_method). This does not happen in production. To get real results to compare, add the following to the development environment: config.cache_classes = true Copy",

Capability Integration Browser monitoring The Ruby agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see the browser and Ruby agent documentation. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in infrastructure monitoring. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from Synthetics monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

Capability Integration Browser monitoring The Ruby agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see the browser and Ruby agent documentation. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in infrastructure monitoring. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from Synthetics monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

      "body": "Attributes are key-value pairs containing information that determines the properties of an event or transaction. You can view these key-value pairs in some places in the UI, or by querying that data using NRQL. New Relic gives users the ability to customize exactly which attributes will be sent to each of these destinations. You can also collect custom attributes to send additional data to New Relic. Attribute destination flow This diagram illustrates how an agent decides to send attributes to each destination. Agent attribute collection: An agent makes three different decisions when sending an attribute to any New Relic destination based on the relevant property settings. Property names and syntax vary by agent. (The properties in this diagram are specific to the PHP agent, but the general flow is the same for all agents. Property names and syntax vary by agent.) Types of attributes Attributes can be collected in a variety of ways: Message property attributes: These are the properties set on a message received from a queue or topic. HTTP request attributes: These are the parameters for an HTTP request. User attributes: These are attributes provided by the user through each agent's API. Agent attributes: These are attributes captured by the agent; for example, httpResponseCode and httpResponseMessage. Destinations for attributes Collected attributes appear in these locations: Collected attributes Location Transaction traces Each minute transaction traces collect data for your slowest individual HTTP requests. These traces will report attributes collected during the transaction. Traced errors If a transaction results in an error, these traced errors will be reported to APM. A traced error will contain attributes collected during the transaction. Transaction events APM transactions will contain attributes collected during the transaction. Insights page views Browser page views will contain attributes collected during the transaction. However, attributes collected at the end of a transaction may not appear on PageView events. This destination is also called browser monitoring. Span events Span events collected for distributed tracing will contain attributes collected during the span. The following agents support the addition of custom user attributes to span events: Java agent 5.13.0 and above Go agent 3.6.0 and above .NET agent 8.25 and above Node agent 6.10.0 and above PHP agent 9.12.0.268 and above Python agent 5.8.0.136 and above Ruby agent 6.8.0 and above Transaction segments Each segment in a transaction trace will contain attributes recorded for that segment. Viewing request attributes Request attributes are associated with specific transaction traces, browser traces, and errors in APM and dashboards. You can see the attributes recorded with a request when viewing the individual trace or error. Custom attributes can be queried via NRQL exactly like any other attribute. APM > (select an app) > Monitoring > Transactions > (select a transaction) > (select a trace): Here is an example from the Ruby agent of the Request attributes and Custom attributes for a transaction trace. Exact attributes depend on your agent and on your attribute configuration. Limits User attributes, request attributes, and message queue parameters are limited by count and size. Parameter Limitations Transaction Limited to 64 user attributes Attribute key Limited to 256 bytes each If the key is more than 256 bytes, then the attribute will not be recorded. Attribute value Limited to 256 bytes each If the value is greater than 256 bytes, then the attribute value will be truncated. Agent-specific attributes Each APM agent collects custom attributes. The supported attributes depend on the specific agent: C SDK Go Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby",

      "body": "Caution Developer mode is deprecated and no longer supported as of Ruby agent version 4.1.0. The New Relic Ruby agent includes Developer mode, a built-in UI for examining details about web transactions in your application. With Developer mode, you can examine the library and database calls made by the controller actions as they are invoked on the Rails instance. The free Developer mode gives you some of the same in-depth transaction visibility you get with New Relic's transaction traces feature. However, it works only in a single Rails instance, and it has much higher overhead than the production version. It is not recommended for use beyond a developer's desktop sandbox. Security considerations The Ruby agent's Developer mode, which is on by default when the RAILS_ENV == \"development\", does not communicate with the New Relic collector in any way. Pie charts are rendered using Google Charts, which involves an HTTP post of aggregate data. Tip The Ruby agent's Production mode, which is on by default when the RAILS_ENV == \"production\" and RAILS_ENV == \"staging\", does communicate with the New Relic site. For more information, see Security. Installation To install Developer mode, install Ruby agent as a plugin or gem. You may also need to set developer_mode to true in your newrelic.yml for the RAILS_ENV in which you are working. Developer mode is on by default only when RAILS_ENV = development. While a newrelic.yml file will be created as part of the installation, it is not necessary to have a valid license key. Known issues Known issues with Developer mode include: Requires Rails 2.3 or higher Developer mode in recent agents only works on Rails 2.3 or higher. It is rack based, and earlier versions of the framework did not incorporate rack. The developer edition installs a middleware in your app that responds to any URL prepended with /newrelic; for example, /newrelic, /newrelic/files/images/foo.png, etc. In some cases the /newrelic URL gets captured by an earlier middleware. In this situation, disable the Developer mode route and include the middleware yourself: At the beginning of the file, in config.ru: require 'newrelic_rpm' require 'new_relic/rack/developer_mode' use NewRelic::Rack::DeveloperMode Copy Incompatible with Pow Developer mode is not supported from Pow, a zero-config Rack server for Mac OS X.

Capability Integration Browser monitoring The Ruby agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see the browser and Ruby agent documentation. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in infrastructure monitoring. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from Synthetics monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

      "body": "Attributes are key-value pairs containing information that determines the properties of an event or transaction. You can view these key-value pairs in some places in the UI, or by querying that data using NRQL. New Relic gives users the ability to customize exactly which attributes will be sent to each of these destinations. You can also collect custom attributes to send additional data to New Relic. Attribute destination flow This diagram illustrates how an agent decides to send attributes to each destination. Agent attribute collection: An agent makes three different decisions when sending an attribute to any New Relic destination based on the relevant property settings. Property names and syntax vary by agent. (The properties in this diagram are specific to the PHP agent, but the general flow is the same for all agents. Property names and syntax vary by agent.) Types of attributes Attributes can be collected in a variety of ways: Message property attributes: These are the properties set on a message received from a queue or topic. HTTP request attributes: These are the parameters for an HTTP request. User attributes: These are attributes provided by the user through each agent's API. Agent attributes: These are attributes captured by the agent; for example, httpResponseCode and httpResponseMessage. Destinations for attributes Collected attributes appear in these locations: Collected attributes Location Transaction traces Each minute transaction traces collect data for your slowest individual HTTP requests. These traces will report attributes collected during the transaction. Traced errors If a transaction results in an error, these traced errors will be reported to APM. A traced error will contain attributes collected during the transaction. Transaction events APM transactions will contain attributes collected during the transaction. Insights page views Browser page views will contain attributes collected during the transaction. However, attributes collected at the end of a transaction may not appear on PageView events. This destination is also called browser monitoring. Span events Span events collected for distributed tracing will contain attributes collected during the span. The following agents support the addition of custom user attributes to span events: Java agent 5.13.0 and above Go agent 3.6.0 and above .NET agent 8.25 and above Node agent 6.10.0 and above PHP agent 9.12.0.268 and above Python agent 5.8.0.136 and above Ruby agent 6.8.0 and above Transaction segments Each segment in a transaction trace will contain attributes recorded for that segment. Viewing request attributes Request attributes are associated with specific transaction traces, browser traces, and errors in APM and dashboards. You can see the attributes recorded with a request when viewing the individual trace or error. Custom attributes can be queried via NRQL exactly like any other attribute. APM > (select an app) > Monitoring > Transactions > (select a transaction) > (select a trace): Here is an example from the Ruby agent of the Request attributes and Custom attributes for a transaction trace. Exact attributes depend on your agent and on your attribute configuration. Limits User attributes, request attributes, and message queue parameters are limited by count and size. Parameter Limitations Transaction Limited to 64 user attributes Attribute key Limited to 256 bytes each If the key is more than 256 bytes, then the attribute will not be recorded. Attribute value Limited to 256 bytes each If the value is greater than 256 bytes, then the attribute value will be truncated. Agent-specific attributes Each APM agent collects custom attributes. The supported attributes depend on the specific agent: C SDK Go Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby",

      "body": "BETA FEATURE This feature is currently in beta. With Incident Workflows, you identify the Policy you want to be alerted on. When the policy gets violated, the violation triggers the workflow, and violation attributes are transferred into the notification creation. Custom variables are violation-related properties you can use as part of the configuration of a workflow action. You can retrieve Information about the alert, condition, violation, and entity by using double curly brackets:: {{variable_name}}. Use custom variables in a filter statement To get information about the entity that violated a condition, you can use custom variables as part of the where statement of the query. For example, to get the state of the EC2 instance use: SELECT latest(ec2State) FROM ComputeSample where provider = 'Ec2Instance' where entityName = `{{entity.name}}' Copy This query returns a single value (for example, stopped), as the query only uses a single field. The variable entity.name is the identifier of the entity. You can use any other entity properties in the same way. Workflow data enrichment examples You can use custom variables to enrich your workflow data queries in different ways: Query for when application traffic drops There are times when you want to know when traffic to your application drops. You can use the { { entity.name}} variable in place of your application's name. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction WHERE appName = '{{entity.name}}' since 10 minutes ago Copy Query for transaction failures There are times when you want to know when your application transactions have failed. This query shows the latest HTTP status code responses filtered by the { { entity.name}} variable that violated your alert policy threshold. From Transaction select latest(httpResponseCode), average(duration) where appName = '{{entity.name}}' Copy Query for Kubernetes consumption overview Use a query like this to get the number of entities and their ingest times within a Kubernetes pod. By identifying what entities have large ingest times, you can begin to address that issue and find a potential remedy. SELECT uniqueCount(displayName), sum(nr.ingestTimeMs) from K8sServiceSample where entityName = '{{entity.name}}' since 1 hour ago.

      "body": "BETA FEATURE This feature is currently in beta. With incident workflow control when and where you want to receive notifications about issues, tunnel the right information to the relevant person or team, and enrich your issue's notifications with additional New Relic data. Add a Workflow The Workflows feature is located under the Alerts & AI menu. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left navigation under Enrich and Respond click Workflow, then click Add a workflow. Tip The maximum workflows you can add per environment is 1000 Name your workflow. This field is mandatory and needs to be unique Workflows filters the issues you want to send to the relevant destination. You can send all issues by selecting Send all issues or you can build a query to filter the right issues. Build a query by selecting an attribute, operator and value/s to narrow down the right issues you want to be passed on. Optional: Enrichments Enrichments can give additional context on alert notifications by adding NRQL query results to them The workflows enrich tool is similar to the query builder. The NRQL query's results are included in the notification message. If you create queries for your workflows, they run in real time and the query results are the value of the enricher. You can save any valid query into your workflow, even if they return an empty result, but you must run the query before saving the enrichment. You can also query with issue-specific variables; for example {{entities.ids}} Note: the query name needs to be unique because you will use the name to decide how to include the result in the payload of the notification that will be sent by the workflow. Important The maximum number of enrichments per workflow is 10. The maximum number of variables an enrichment can contain is 1. Notifier In order to save and activate a Workflow you need to include a notifier. Setting up a notifier requires having a notification destination configured. You can either set it up through the Destination menu item, or through the Create new destination item in the destination selection drop down in each destination channel screen. A notification destination includes the credentials required to send a notification to a third party platform and an option to customize the message sent by mapping fields from our issues to fields in the destination platform. Note: each notifier allows for extensive customization tailored to your needs. Examples can be found below Click “update message” once completing the notifier requirements, then complete the workflow by clicking activate. Tip In any destination channel, start typing and a variable menu will open up. You will see the names of the variables, that at runtime will be replaced with the variable’s value/s. In order to use the enrichers’ results use their name. Variables To get information about the entity that violated a condition, you can use variables as part of the where statement of the query. For example, to get a list of error logs for a specific issue use: FROM log SELECT * where service.name = {{ entities.names }} AND level = ‘error’ LIMIT 10 Copy This query returns the last 10 error logs for each notification sent for the entities that are associated with the issue. This would give you additional context as to what may have gone wrong and likely help you solve the issue faster. You can use any other entity properties in the same way. An example of how to populate the field Important Note: In order to attain the value in the JSON format, you must specify the word JSON. Otherwise, you will get a comma delimited list (e.g. {{ json entities.Ids}} ). For more variable options to find additional context, a comprehensive list of variables can be found here: Key Display Name (First word will be used for grouping) accumulations.origin Issue Origin accumulations.source Issue Source activatedAt Issue Activated At dataMLModules.components Machine Learning Components dataMLModules.suggestedResponders Machine Learning Suggested Responder dataMLModules.goldenSignals Machine Learning Golden Signals annotations.description Issue Description annotations.title Issue Title closedAt Issue ClosedAt createdAt Issue CreatedAt entities.ids Impacted Entities IDs entities.types Impacted Entities Types entities.names Impacted Entities Names entities.kinds Impacted Entities Kinds incidentIds Incident IDs isCorrelated Issue Is Correlated issueId Issue ID labels.accountIds Issue Environment Associated Account ID labels.aggregationKeys Labels Alerts Aggregation Key labels.conditionNames Labels Alert Condition Names labels.originalAccountIds Labels Account IDs labels.policyIds Labels Alert Policy IDs labels.policyNames Labels Alert Policy Names priority Issue Priority state Issue State status Issue Status totalIncidents Incident Count triggerEvent Issue Notification Trigger Event triggeredAt Issue Triggered At updatedAt Issue Updated At workflowName Workflow Name Destinations Destinations are unique identifiers and credentials for third-party systems. The destination you choose is the location where we send notifications. Destinations are located under the Alerts and AI menu. Add a Destination Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left navigation under Enrich and Respond , then click Destinations. Select one of the destination types at the top of the destinations management screen. Webhook destination Use the webhook notifier to send notification messages to any endpoint. The webhook configuration requires: A unique destination name The endpoint url of the target application Authorization which can be ‘basic authentication or a ‘bearer token’ Basic authentication allows users to provide the username and password associated with your HTTP endpoint, which will populate in the header. Bearer token involves security tokens, where the token is a cryptic string. The user must send this token in the authorization header when requesting protected resources To test your webhook, click ‘test connection’ on the bottom right. There’s a retry mechanism that is triggered a few times with exponential backoff for a couple of minutes once an error occurs. If we reach the retry limit, the Webhook will get auto-disabled. ServiceNow incidents destination Using ServiceNow as a notifier enables you to push valuable issues into new ServiceNow incidents. With two-way integrations, you can also make sure that status updates of ServiceNow incidents are mirrored back to New Relic. The ServiceNow notifier requires: Unique notifier name ServiceNow domain endpoint A username and password Optional: enable two-way integration Important The Servicenow user details should have read permissions for the tables: sys_dictionary, sys_choice, sys_user, change_request Optional: enable two-way integration You can configure a two-way integration with ServiceNow incidents so that when state updates for the incident (resolved or closed), it triggers an update in the corresponding New Relic Issue state. Here are some important things to remember when configuring the two-way integration: The following steps are required to enable two-way integration: Check Allow two-way integration when you create the Notifier. Open and download this XML file(which includes the business rule for Incident Workflows). In the ServiceNow sidebar menu, go to System Definition > Business Rule. Click the menu icon in one of the column headers, select Import XML, and upload the XML file you downloaded. We create a New Relic API-key in the SNOW ‘api_key_credentials’ table. If you want two-way integration, the user used for setting the destination also needs write permissions to the table: api_key_credentials After you enable two-way integration, an incident state in ServiceNow changes to Resolved or Closed, and the corresponding workflow incident changes to Closed. Test your notifier to make sure everything is running smoothly and you are receiving your Alerts and Issues. Jira destination Using Jira as a notifier enables you to push valuable issues into a new Jira Cloud ticket. With two-way integration you can also make sure that state-updates are mirrored back to New Relic. Atlassian Jira notifiers need: Notifier name Jira url endpoint A username Jira API key After you enable two-way integration, an incident on Jira changes to Resolved or Closed, and the corresponding workflow incident changes to Closed. Finally, test your notifier to make sure everything is running smoothly and you are receiving your Alerts and Issues. If everything is connecting correctly, you will receive a ‘connection successful’ message.",

Configure anomaly detection for your browser applications, mobile applications, infrastructure hosts, and nearly anything you want to monitor. Requirements Expanded anomaly detection is available as a limited beta. You can request access here. Why it matters When starting to configure alert conditions for a variety of applications and hosts, it can be difficult to know what you’ll want to be notified about ahead of time. Anomaly detection helps you distinguish between what’s typical performance in your system and where you’re starting to have trouble. Instead of creating your alert conditions manually, you can simply tell us what you want to monitor. Anomaly detection will help you identify baseline performance in your system and flags anomalous activity in your system. Get started with anomaly detection To get started with expanded anomaly detection: From one.newrelic.com, go to Alerts & AI > Proactive Detection > Settings. Click the Custom tab, and then click + Add a configuration. Select the account you want to use to record anomaly data, then select the workload or entities you’d like to monitor. Select the detection sensitivity. We recommend Low sensitivity so that you don’t see too many anomalies. Finally, name your configuration and save. Detect anomalies with a faceted NRQL query To detect anomalies with a faceted NRQL query: From one.newrelic.com, go to Alerts & AI > Proactive Detection > Settings. Click the Custom tab, and then click + Add a configuration. Click Use a query instead. You may need to select an account, if you have more than one. Add one or more queries with a FACET clause. Name the query and confirm the facets you want to monitor for anomalies. Select the detection sensitivity. We recommend Low sensitivity so that you don’t see too many anomalies. Finally, name the configuration and save. See your anomalies in one place When you set up anomaly detection, New Relic starts analyzing the golden signals of your entities and workloads. Anomalies appear in your activity feeds throughout New Relic One and the Anomalies tab as soon as they’re detected. Click any anomaly to get more detail about it, including analysis and context for the anomaly. Tip For this limited release, anomaly detection won’t generate notifications. However, you can configure a NRQL alert condition for the NrAiAnomaly event. To view anomalies, from one.newrelic.com, go to Alerts & AI > Issues & activity > Anomalies. Query anomaly data Detected anomalies are written to the NrAiAnomaly event in your NRDB account. You can learn more about this event and how to query it here. Reduce the number of detected anomalies If you’re seeing too many anomalies, the first step is to make sure your sensitivity level is set to Low. If it’s already set to Low, you can define specific thresholds to distinguish between normal and anomalous behavior. To define custom thresholds: From one.newrelic.com, go to Alerts & AI > Proactive Detection > Settings. Click the Custom tab and the configuration you want to modify. Select an entity or workload, and then change the sensitivity level. You can use custom sensitivity to define specific thresholds for different entity types.",

      "body": "With Applied Intelligence's Proactive Detection, anomalies from your APM-monitored applications are automatically surfaced in our activity streams and anomalies feed. Each anomaly can be clicked on to bring up an automatic analysis. You can have notifications for anomalies delivered in Slack, or you can set up a webhook to deliver messages when you need them. These events are available for querying, creating custom dashboards, and alerting. By creating a Proactive Detection configuration (a group of apps you’re interested in), you can then add this configuration as a source, and have anomalies automatically correlated with other data sources via Incident Intelligence. Requirements To use Proactive Detection, ensure you have: An APM agent installed for at least one applications. To receive notifications in Slack, you'll need to ask your IT administrator to install the Applied Intelligence application in your Slack workspace. For more on data limits, see Data limits. Why it matters With Proactive Detection, Applied Intelligence delivers insights about anomalies in your production system, along with an automatic analysis of the anomaly. It’s enabled automatically, at no additional cost. When an anomaly is detected, you can view it in the Applied Intelligence anomalies feed, or we'll send notifications directly to your Slack channel or a webhook. How it works Proactive Detection uses the following methods to detect anomalies in your app data: Proactive Detection monitors metric data reported by an APM agent, building a model of your typical application dynamics, and focuses on key golden signals: throughput, response time, and errors. If one of these golden signals shows anomalous behavior, the system flags it and tracks recovery to normal behavior. The system adapts to changes in your data, and continuously updates models based on new data. Automatically on: By default, Proactive Detection monitors all your APM applications, with no action required by you. When an anomaly is detected, it's automatically surfaced in various activity streams, the Applied Intelligence anomalies feed and is available for querying via NRQL. Receiving notifications: We send notifications when we detect anomalous changes in throughput, error rate, or response time. The notifications are sent to selected Slack channels, or sent via webhook. When the anomaly goes back to normal, a recovery message is sent. If you don't want to receive notifications, you still have access to the data via NRQL query. Anomaly analysis: For each anomaly, we provide a link in Slack to an analyze anomaly page. This page generates automatic insights into the anomaly. The page is also available from the anomalies tab, which lists recent anomalies. This page uses your existing APM and Proactive Detection data to provide explanations as to the cause of the anomaly. Activity stream: Inside various activity streams such as the New Relic One homepage, APM Summary page, Lookout and Explorer, you'll see relevant anomalies from your APM-monitored applications. Clicking on any of the anomaly events in the activity stream brings up the analysis page for that anomaly. Applications will not always generate anomalies, so it can be normal to not receive any detections. Set up notifications for Proactive Detection Proactive Detection is enabled automatically, at no additional cost. To receive notifications or to have a configuration (group of apps) that you can add as a source for Incident Intelligence, you will need to create a Proactive Detection configuration. You can create a configuration in the Proactive Detection UI: From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI. Under Proactive Detection, click Settings. Click Add a configuration. Input the following information into the form: Choose a name for your configuration that helps you easily identify it from others in your account. Select an account. Select up to 1,000 applications. Note that certain applications with low throughput might not be good candidates for Proactive Detection, as they can be more sensitive to smaller amounts of data fluctuation. Optional: select the golden signals you'd like to monitor for anomalies. Optional: connect to Incident Intelligence. Set up for Slack To use Proactive Detection with Slack: Select Slack. Choose which Slack channel receives notifications. You can select any existing public or private channel. This prompts the workflow to add the Applied Intelligence Slack application to your selected channel. To create a new channel, do that directly in Slack first. Tip If you experience an error when assigning Slack channels, make sure that the New Relic AI Slack application has been added to your Slack workspace. Save the configuration. You can modify the applications for each configuration at any time by selecting the configuration in the configuration table. Set up for webhooks To use Proactive Detection with webhooks: Select Webhook. Input the following information into the form: Provide the webhook URL. Provide optional custom headers. Choose to edit the custom payload, or enable using the default payload. Save the configuration. You can modify the applications for each configuration at any time by selecting the configuration in the configuration table. Set up without notifications To use Proactive Detection when you don't need to receive notifications: Select No notifications. Save the configuration. You can modify the applications for each configuration at any time by selecting the configuration in the configuration table. Mute notifications (Slack only) In Slack, detections coming from specific applications can be muted temporarily or permanently. The entire channel can also be muted temporarily. This is useful in the case of an incident or when the channel should otherwise not be interrupted. To mute in Slack, select Mute this app’s warnings or Mute all warnings, then select the duration. We will resume sending notifications for any detections once the muting duration has completed. Muting an application permanently removes it from the configuration. To add it back in, go to one.newrelic.com, in the top nav click Alerts & AI, then click Proactive Detection, and select the configuration to edit. Muting Proactive Detection notifications does not affect alerts. Use Proactive Detection Slack messages Each anomaly message has several key pieces of information you can use to learn more about and start troubleshooting the potential issue: The application name and a link to more information about it in New Relic One. The metric experiencing an anomaly and a link to its details in New Relic One. A graph of the metric over time to provide a visual understanding of the anomaly’s behavior and degree. An Analyze button that navigates to an analysis page in Applied Intelligence that identifies key attributes that are unique to the anomaly, anomalies found upstream or downstream, and any other relevant signals. Once an anomaly has returned to normal, we send a recovery notification with the option to provide feedback. Your feedback provides our development team with input to help us improve detection quality. In the case of feedback provided on throughput anomalies, an evaluation is run each hour based on feedback to fit a more suitable model. If we helped you, you can select Yes or No. View overview of anomalies In addition to notifications for anomalies that give you information via Slack or webhook, you can view more information about the anomalies in your environment via the Anomalies tab on the Alerts & AI Overview page. That tab provides a list of all the recent anomalies from every configuration in the selected account, and you can select an anomaly for a detailed analysis. Anomaly visibility settings Anomalies are displayed in various New Relic activity streams and in the Applied Intelligence anomalies feed. You can customize what is displayed using the anomaly visibility settings (for example, hiding throughput anomalies on an activity stream but keeping them in the anomalies feed). To find these settings: from Alerts & AI, under Proactive Detection, click Settings. Notes on using these settings: These settings are applied at the user level. Changes you make won’t affect others users in your organization. Regardless of these settings, the anomalies are still reported and available for NRQL querying. Details on these UI sections: AI overview and anomalies tab: Use the AI overview and anomalies tab setting to hide anomalies from the AI overview and anomalies tab setting. Please note you also can use filters specific to these views as well. Global activity stream: Use the global activity stream section to customize what anomalies are shown in the various New Relic activity streams, including the New Relic One homepage, APM Summary, and Lookout. Anomaly types: Use the check boxes here to hide specific types of anomalies. For example uncheck Web throughput and Non-web throughput anomalies to hide these types of anomalies from both the activity streams and the AI overview and anomalies tab. (Note they are still reported and available for querying.) Query anomaly data You can use NRQL to query and chart your Proactive Detection data using the NrAiAnomaly event. For example: FROM NrAiAnomaly SELECT * Important This data has previously been attached to the ProactiveDetection event. That event will be deprecated on April 7, 2021. If you use ProactiveDetection in your custom charts, you should convert those queries to using NrAiAnomaly. Here are important attributes attached to this event: Attribute Description closeTime timestamp The time when the anomaly ended. Example: 1615304100000. configurationType string The type of configuration monitoring the event. If at least one configuration is monitoring the entity, this is set to configuration. Otherwise, it's set to automatic. entity.accountId number The New Relic account ID to which the entity belongs. entity.domain number The domain of the entity (currently only APM but will change with future functionality). entity.guid string The GUID of the entity. This is used to identify and retrieve data about the entity via NerdGraph. Identical to entityGuid. entityGuid string The GUID of the entity. This is used to identify and retrieve data about the entity via NerdGraph. Identical to entity.guid. entity.name string The name of the entity whose data was determined to be anomalous. Identical to entityName. Example: Laura's coffee service. entityName string The name of the entity whose data was determined to be anomalous. Identical to entity.name. entity.type string The type of entity (currently only APPLICATION but will change with future functionality). evaluationType string This is always anomaly. event string Indicates whether it's the beginning (open) or end (close) of the anomalous data. openTime timestamp The time when the anomaly opened. Example: 1615303740000. signalType string The type of data that was analyzed. For example, error_rate or response_time.non_web. timestamp timestamp The time at which the event was written. title string Description of the anomaly. Example: Error rate was much higher than normal. Add anomalies as source in Incident Intelligence By integrating Incident Intelligence with your Proactive Detection anomalies, you can get context and correlations. To learn about doing this in Incident Intelligence, see Configure sources. You can also select Connect to Incident Intelligence from inside of a configuration. Webhook payload and examples Proactive Detection sends the event body in JSON format via HTTPS POST. The system expects the endpoint to return a successful HTTP code (2xx). If you use webhooks to configure Proactive Detection, use these examples of the webhook body format and JSON schema. Attribute Description category enum The category of data that was analyzed. Categories include web throughput, non-web throughput, web transactions, non-web transactions, and error class. data list The time series data leading up to the detection. data[].timestamp number The timestamp of the data point in milliseconds since the Unix epoch. Example: 1584366819000 data[].unit string The unit describing the value of the data point. Data units include count, milliseconds, and error_rate. data[].value number The value of the data point.

      "body": "BETA FEATURE This feature is currently in beta. With Incident Workflows, you identify the Policy you want to be alerted on. When the policy gets violated, the violation triggers the workflow, and violation attributes are transferred into the notification creation. Custom variables are violation-related properties you can use as part of the configuration of a workflow action. You can retrieve Information about the alert, condition, violation, and entity by using double curly brackets:: {{variable_name}}. Use custom variables in a filter statement To get information about the entity that violated a condition, you can use custom variables as part of the where statement of the query. For example, to get the state of the EC2 instance use: SELECT latest(ec2State) FROM ComputeSample where provider = 'Ec2Instance' where entityName = `{{entity.name}}' Copy This query returns a single value (for example, stopped), as the query only uses a single field. The variable entity.name is the identifier of the entity. You can use any other entity properties in the same way. Workflow data enrichment examples You can use custom variables to enrich your workflow data queries in different ways: Query for when application traffic drops There are times when you want to know when traffic to your application drops. You can use the { { entity.name}} variable in place of your application's name. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction WHERE appName = '{{entity.name}}' since 10 minutes ago Copy Query for transaction failures There are times when you want to know when your application transactions have failed. This query shows the latest HTTP status code responses filtered by the { { entity.name}} variable that violated your alert policy threshold. From Transaction select latest(httpResponseCode), average(duration) where appName = '{{entity.name}}' Copy Query for Kubernetes consumption overview Use a query like this to get the number of entities and their ingest times within a Kubernetes pod. By identifying what entities have large ingest times, you can begin to address that issue and find a potential remedy.

      "body": "BETA FEATURE This feature is currently in beta. With incident workflow control when and where you want to receive notifications about issues, tunnel the right information to the relevant person or team, and enrich your issue's notifications with additional New Relic data. Add a Workflow The Workflows feature is located under the Alerts & AI menu. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left navigation under Enrich and Respond click Workflow, then click Add a workflow. Tip The maximum workflows you can add per environment is 1000 Name your workflow. This field is mandatory and needs to be unique Workflows filters the issues you want to send to the relevant destination. You can send all issues by selecting Send all issues or you can build a query to filter the right issues. Build a query by selecting an attribute, operator and value/s to narrow down the right issues you want to be passed on. Optional: Enrichments Enrichments can give additional context on alert notifications by adding NRQL query results to them The workflows enrich tool is similar to the query builder. The NRQL query's results are included in the notification message. If you create queries for your workflows, they run in real time and the query results are the value of the enricher. You can save any valid query into your workflow, even if they return an empty result, but you must run the query before saving the enrichment. You can also query with issue-specific variables; for example {{entities.ids}} Note: the query name needs to be unique because you will use the name to decide how to include the result in the payload of the notification that will be sent by the workflow. Important The maximum number of enrichments per workflow is 10. The maximum number of variables an enrichment can contain is 1. Notifier In order to save and activate a Workflow you need to include a notifier. Setting up a notifier requires having a notification destination configured. You can either set it up through the Destination menu item, or through the Create new destination item in the destination selection drop down in each destination channel screen. A notification destination includes the credentials required to send a notification to a third party platform and an option to customize the message sent by mapping fields from our issues to fields in the destination platform. Note: each notifier allows for extensive customization tailored to your needs. Examples can be found below Click “update message” once completing the notifier requirements, then complete the workflow by clicking activate. Tip In any destination channel, start typing and a variable menu will open up. You will see the names of the variables, that at runtime will be replaced with the variable’s value/s. In order to use the enrichers’ results use their name. Variables To get information about the entity that violated a condition, you can use variables as part of the where statement of the query. For example, to get a list of error logs for a specific issue use: FROM log SELECT * where service.name = {{ entities.names }} AND level = ‘error’ LIMIT 10 Copy This query returns the last 10 error logs for each notification sent for the entities that are associated with the issue. This would give you additional context as to what may have gone wrong and likely help you solve the issue faster. You can use any other entity properties in the same way.

The destination you choose is the location where we send notifications. Destinations are located under the Alerts and AI menu. Add a Destination Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left navigation under Enrich and Respond , then click Destinations. Select one of the destination types at the top of the destinations management screen. Webhook destination Use the webhook notifier to send notification messages to any endpoint. The webhook configuration requires: A unique destination name The endpoint url of the target application Authorization which can be ‘basic authentication or a ‘bearer token’ Basic authentication allows users to provide the username and password associated with your HTTP endpoint, which will populate in the header. Bearer token involves security tokens, where the token is a cryptic string. The user must send this token in the authorization header when requesting protected resources To test your webhook, click ‘test connection’ on the bottom right. There’s a retry mechanism that is triggered a few times with exponential backoff for a couple of minutes once an error occurs. If we reach the retry limit, the Webhook will get auto-disabled. ServiceNow incidents destination Using ServiceNow as a notifier enables you to push valuable issues into new ServiceNow incidents. With two-way integrations, you can also make sure that status updates of ServiceNow incidents are mirrored back to New Relic. The ServiceNow notifier requires: Unique notifier name ServiceNow domain endpoint A username and password Optional: enable two-way integration Important The Servicenow user details should have read permissions for the tables: sys_dictionary, sys_choice, sys_user, change_request Optional: enable two-way integration You can configure a two-way integration with ServiceNow incidents so that when state updates for the incident (resolved or closed), it triggers an update in the corresponding New Relic Issue state. Here are some important things to remember when configuring the two-way integration: The following steps are required to enable two-way integration: Check Allow two-way integration when you create the Notifier. Open and download this XML file(which includes the business rule for Incident Workflows). In the ServiceNow sidebar menu, go to System Definition > Business Rule. Click the menu icon in one of the column headers, select Import XML, and upload the XML file you downloaded. We create a New Relic API-key in the SNOW ‘api_key_credentials’ table. If you want two-way integration, the user used for setting the destination also needs write permissions to the table: api_key_credentials After you enable two-way integration, an incident state in ServiceNow changes to Resolved or Closed, and the corresponding workflow incident changes to Closed. Test your notifier to make sure everything is running smoothly and you are receiving your Alerts and Issues. Jira destination Using Jira as a notifier enables you to push valuable issues into a new Jira Cloud ticket. With two-way integration you can also make sure that state-updates are mirrored back to New Relic. Atlassian Jira notifiers need: Notifier name Jira url endpoint A username Jira API key After you enable two-way integration, an incident on Jira changes to Resolved or Closed, and the corresponding workflow incident changes to Closed. Finally, test your notifier to make sure everything is running smoothly and you are receiving your Alerts and Issues. If everything is connecting correctly, you will receive a ‘connection successful’ message.",

      "body": "With Applied Intelligence's Proactive Detection, anomalies from your APM-monitored applications are automatically surfaced in our activity streams and anomalies feed. Each anomaly can be clicked on to bring up an automatic analysis. You can have notifications for anomalies delivered in Slack, or you can set up a webhook to deliver messages when you need them. These events are available for querying, creating custom dashboards, and alerting. By creating a Proactive Detection configuration (a group of apps you’re interested in), you can then add this configuration as a source, and have anomalies automatically correlated with other data sources via Incident Intelligence. Requirements To use Proactive Detection, ensure you have: An APM agent installed for at least one applications. To receive notifications in Slack, you'll need to ask your IT administrator to install the Applied Intelligence application in your Slack workspace. For more on data limits, see Data limits. Why it matters With Proactive Detection, Applied Intelligence delivers insights about anomalies in your production system, along with an automatic analysis of the anomaly. It’s enabled automatically, at no additional cost. When an anomaly is detected, you can view it in the Applied Intelligence anomalies feed, or we'll send notifications directly to your Slack channel or a webhook. How it works Proactive Detection uses the following methods to detect anomalies in your app data: Proactive Detection monitors metric data reported by an APM agent, building a model of your typical application dynamics, and focuses on key golden signals: throughput, response time, and errors. If one of these golden signals shows anomalous behavior, the system flags it and tracks recovery to normal behavior. The system adapts to changes in your data, and continuously updates models based on new data. Automatically on: By default, Proactive Detection monitors all your APM applications, with no action required by you. When an anomaly is detected, it's automatically surfaced in various activity streams, the Applied Intelligence anomalies feed and is available for querying via NRQL. Receiving notifications: We send notifications when we detect anomalous changes in throughput, error rate, or response time. The notifications are sent to selected Slack channels, or sent via webhook. When the anomaly goes back to normal, a recovery message is sent. If you don't want to receive notifications, you still have access to the data via NRQL query. Anomaly analysis: For each anomaly, we provide a link in Slack to an analyze anomaly page. This page generates automatic insights into the anomaly. The page is also available from the anomalies tab, which lists recent anomalies. This page uses your existing APM and Proactive Detection data to provide explanations as to the cause of the anomaly. Activity stream: Inside various activity streams such as the New Relic One homepage, APM Summary page, Lookout and Explorer, you'll see relevant anomalies from your APM-monitored applications. Clicking on any of the anomaly events in the activity stream brings up the analysis page for that anomaly. Applications will not always generate anomalies, so it can be normal to not receive any detections. Set up notifications for Proactive Detection Proactive Detection is enabled automatically, at no additional cost. To receive notifications or to have a configuration (group of apps) that you can add as a source for Incident Intelligence, you will need to create a Proactive Detection configuration. You can create a configuration in the Proactive Detection UI: From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI. Under Proactive Detection, click Settings. Click Add a configuration. Input the following information into the form: Choose a name for your configuration that helps you easily identify it from others in your account. Select an account. Select up to 1,000 applications. Note that certain applications with low throughput might not be good candidates for Proactive Detection, as they can be more sensitive to smaller amounts of data fluctuation. Optional: select the golden signals you'd like to monitor for anomalies. Optional: connect to Incident Intelligence. Set up for Slack To use Proactive Detection with Slack: Select Slack. Choose which Slack channel receives notifications. You can select any existing public or private channel. This prompts the workflow to add the Applied Intelligence Slack application to your selected channel. To create a new channel, do that directly in Slack first. Tip If you experience an error when assigning Slack channels, make sure that the New Relic AI Slack application has been added to your Slack workspace. Save the configuration. You can modify the applications for each configuration at any time by selecting the configuration in the configuration table. Set up for webhooks To use Proactive Detection with webhooks: Select Webhook. Input the following information into the form: Provide the webhook URL. Provide optional custom headers. Choose to edit the custom payload, or enable using the default payload. Save the configuration. You can modify the applications for each configuration at any time by selecting the configuration in the configuration table. Set up without notifications To use Proactive Detection when you don't need to receive notifications: Select No notifications. Save the configuration. You can modify the applications for each configuration at any time by selecting the configuration in the configuration table. Mute notifications (Slack only) In Slack, detections coming from specific applications can be muted temporarily or permanently. The entire channel can also be muted temporarily. This is useful in the case of an incident or when the channel should otherwise not be interrupted. To mute in Slack, select Mute this app’s warnings or Mute all warnings, then select the duration. We will resume sending notifications for any detections once the muting duration has completed. Muting an application permanently removes it from the configuration. To add it back in, go to one.newrelic.com, in the top nav click Alerts & AI, then click Proactive Detection, and select the configuration to edit. Muting Proactive Detection notifications does not affect alerts. Use Proactive Detection Slack messages Each anomaly message has several key pieces of information you can use to learn more about and start troubleshooting the potential issue: The application name and a link to more information about it in New Relic One. The metric experiencing an anomaly and a link to its details in New Relic One. A graph of the metric over time to provide a visual understanding of the anomaly’s behavior and degree. An Analyze button that navigates to an analysis page in Applied Intelligence that identifies key attributes that are unique to the anomaly, anomalies found upstream or downstream, and any other relevant signals. Once an anomaly has returned to normal, we send a recovery notification with the option to provide feedback. Your feedback provides our development team with input to help us improve detection quality. In the case of feedback provided on throughput anomalies, an evaluation is run each hour based on feedback to fit a more suitable model. If we helped you, you can select Yes or No. View overview of anomalies In addition to notifications for anomalies that give you information via Slack or webhook, you can view more information about the anomalies in your environment via the Anomalies tab on the Alerts & AI Overview page. That tab provides a list of all the recent anomalies from every configuration in the selected account, and you can select an anomaly for a detailed analysis. Anomaly visibility settings Anomalies are displayed in various New Relic activity streams and in the Applied Intelligence anomalies feed. You can customize what is displayed using the anomaly visibility settings (for example, hiding throughput anomalies on an activity stream but keeping them in the anomalies feed). To find these settings: from Alerts & AI, under Proactive Detection, click Settings. Notes on using these settings: These settings are applied at the user level. Changes you make won’t affect others users in your organization. Regardless of these settings, the anomalies are still reported and available for NRQL querying. Details on these UI sections: AI overview and anomalies tab: Use the AI overview and anomalies tab setting to hide anomalies from the AI overview and anomalies tab setting. Please note you also can use filters specific to these views as well. Global activity stream: Use the global activity stream section to customize what anomalies are shown in the various New Relic activity streams, including the New Relic One homepage, APM Summary, and Lookout. Anomaly types: Use the check boxes here to hide specific types of anomalies. For example uncheck Web throughput and Non-web throughput anomalies to hide these types of anomalies from both the activity streams and the AI overview and anomalies tab. (Note they are still reported and available for querying.) Query anomaly data You can use NRQL to query and chart your Proactive Detection data using the NrAiAnomaly event. For example: FROM NrAiAnomaly SELECT * Important This data has previously been attached to the ProactiveDetection event. That event will be deprecated on April 7, 2021. If you use ProactiveDetection in your custom charts, you should convert those queries to using NrAiAnomaly. Here are important attributes attached to this event: Attribute Description closeTime timestamp The time when the anomaly ended. Example: 1615304100000. configurationType string The type of configuration monitoring the event. If at least one configuration is monitoring the entity, this is set to configuration. Otherwise, it's set to automatic. entity.accountId number The New Relic account ID to which the entity belongs. entity.domain number The domain of the entity (currently only APM but will change with future functionality). entity.guid string The GUID of the entity. This is used to identify and retrieve data about the entity via NerdGraph. Identical to entityGuid. entityGuid string The GUID of the entity. This is used to identify and retrieve data about the entity via NerdGraph. Identical to entity.guid. entity.name string The name of the entity whose data was determined to be anomalous. Identical to entityName. Example: Laura's coffee service. entityName string The name of the entity whose data was determined to be anomalous. Identical to entity.name. entity.type string The type of entity (currently only APPLICATION but will change with future functionality). evaluationType string This is always anomaly. event string Indicates whether it's the beginning (open) or end (close) of the anomalous data. openTime timestamp The time when the anomaly opened. Example: 1615303740000. signalType string The type of data that was analyzed. For example, error_rate or response_time.non_web. timestamp timestamp The time at which the event was written. title string Description of the anomaly. Example: Error rate was much higher than normal. Add anomalies as source in Incident Intelligence By integrating Incident Intelligence with your Proactive Detection anomalies, you can get context and correlations. To learn about doing this in Incident Intelligence, see Configure sources. You can also select Connect to Incident Intelligence from inside of a configuration. Webhook payload and examples Proactive Detection sends the event body in JSON format via HTTPS POST. The system expects the endpoint to return a successful HTTP code (2xx). If you use webhooks to configure Proactive Detection, use these examples of the webhook body format and JSON schema. Attribute Description category enum The category of data that was analyzed. Categories include web throughput, non-web throughput, web transactions, non-web transactions, and error class. data list The time series data leading up to the detection. data[].timestamp number The timestamp of the data point in milliseconds since the Unix epoch. Example: 1584366819000 data[].unit string The unit describing the value of the data point. Data units include count, milliseconds, and error_rate. data[].value number The value of the data point.

      "body": "BETA FEATURE This feature is currently in beta. With Incident Workflows, you identify the Policy you want to be alerted on. When the policy gets violated, the violation triggers the workflow, and violation attributes are transferred into the notification creation. Custom variables are violation-related properties you can use as part of the configuration of a workflow action. You can retrieve Information about the alert, condition, violation, and entity by using double curly brackets:: {{variable_name}}. Use custom variables in a filter statement To get information about the entity that violated a condition, you can use custom variables as part of the where statement of the query. For example, to get the state of the EC2 instance use: SELECT latest(ec2State) FROM ComputeSample where provider = 'Ec2Instance' where entityName = `{{entity.name}}' Copy This query returns a single value (for example, stopped), as the query only uses a single field. The variable entity.name is the identifier of the entity. You can use any other entity properties in the same way. Workflow data enrichment examples You can use custom variables to enrich your workflow data queries in different ways: Query for when application traffic drops There are times when you want to know when traffic to your application drops. You can use the { { entity.name}} variable in place of your application's name. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction WHERE appName = '{{entity.name}}' since 10 minutes ago Copy Query for transaction failures There are times when you want to know when your application transactions have failed. This query shows the latest HTTP status code responses filtered by the { { entity.name}} variable that violated your alert policy threshold. From Transaction select latest(httpResponseCode), average(duration) where appName = '{{entity.name}}' Copy Query for Kubernetes consumption overview Use a query like this to get the number of entities and their ingest times within a Kubernetes pod. By identifying what entities have large ingest times, you can begin to address that issue and find a potential remedy.

You can save any valid query into your workflow, even if they return an empty result, but you must run the query before saving the enrichment. You can also query with issue-specific variables; for example {{entities.ids}} Note: the query name needs to be unique because you will use the name to decide how to include the result in the payload of the notification that will be sent by the workflow. Important The maximum number of enrichments per workflow is 10. The maximum number of variables an enrichment can contain is 1. Notifier In order to save and activate a Workflow you need to include a notifier. Setting up a notifier requires having a notification destination configured. You can either set it up through the Destination menu item, or through the Create new destination item in the destination selection drop down in each destination channel screen. A notification destination includes the credentials required to send a notification to a third party platform and an option to customize the message sent by mapping fields from our issues to fields in the destination platform. Note: each notifier allows for extensive customization tailored to your needs. Examples can be found below Click “update message” once completing the notifier requirements, then complete the workflow by clicking activate. Tip In any destination channel, start typing and a variable menu will open up. You will see the names of the variables, that at runtime will be replaced with the variable’s value/s. In order to use the enrichers’ results use their name. Variables To get information about the entity that violated a condition, you can use variables as part of the where statement of the query. For example, to get a list of error logs for a specific issue use: FROM log SELECT * where service.name = {{ entities.names }} AND level = ‘error’ LIMIT 10 Copy This query returns the last 10 error logs for each notification sent for the entities that are associated with the issue. This would give you additional context as to what may have gone wrong and likely help you solve the issue faster. You can use any other entity properties in the same way. An example of how to populate the field Important Note: In order to attain the value in the JSON format, you must specify the word JSON. Otherwise, you will get a comma delimited list (e.g. {{ json entities.Ids}} ). For more variable options to find additional context, a comprehensive list of variables can be found here: Key Display Name (First word will be used for grouping) accumulations.origin Issue Origin accumulations.source Issue Source activatedAt Issue Activated At dataMLModules.components Machine Learning Components dataMLModules.suggestedResponders Machine Learning Suggested Responder dataMLModules.goldenSignals Machine Learning Golden Signals annotations.description Issue Description annotations.title Issue Title closedAt Issue ClosedAt createdAt Issue CreatedAt entities.ids Impacted Entities IDs entities.types Impacted Entities Types entities.names Impacted Entities Names entities.kinds Impacted Entities Kinds incidentIds Incident IDs isCorrelated Issue Is Correlated issueId Issue ID labels.accountIds Issue Environment Associated Account ID labels.aggregationKeys Labels Alerts Aggregation Key labels.conditionNames Labels Alert Condition Names labels.originalAccountIds Labels Account IDs labels.policyIds Labels Alert Policy IDs labels.policyNames Labels Alert Policy Names priority Issue Priority state Issue State status Issue Status totalIncidents Incident Count triggerEvent Issue Notification Trigger Event triggeredAt Issue Triggered At updatedAt Issue Updated At workflowName Workflow Name Destinations Destinations are unique identifiers and credentials for third-party systems. The destination you choose is the location where we send notifications. Destinations are located under the Alerts and AI menu. Add a Destination Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left navigation under Enrich and Respond , then click Destinations. Select one of the destination types at the top of the destinations management screen. Webhook destination Use the webhook notifier to send notification messages to any endpoint. The webhook configuration requires: A unique destination name The endpoint url of the target application Authorization which can be ‘basic authentication or a ‘bearer token’ Basic authentication allows users to provide the username and password associated with your HTTP endpoint, which will populate in the header. Bearer token involves security tokens, where the token is a cryptic string. The user must send this token in the authorization header when requesting protected resources To test your webhook, click ‘test connection’ on the bottom right. There’s a retry mechanism that is triggered a few times with exponential backoff for a couple of minutes once an error occurs. If we reach the retry limit, the Webhook will get auto-disabled. ServiceNow incidents destination Using ServiceNow as a notifier enables you to push valuable issues into new ServiceNow incidents. With two-way integrations, you can also make sure that status updates of ServiceNow incidents are mirrored back to New Relic. The ServiceNow notifier requires: Unique notifier name ServiceNow domain endpoint A username and password Optional: enable two-way integration Important The Servicenow user details should have read permissions for the tables: sys_dictionary, sys_choice, sys_user, change_request Optional: enable two-way integration You can configure a two-way integration with ServiceNow incidents so that when state updates for the incident (resolved or closed), it triggers an update in the corresponding New Relic Issue state. Here are some important things to remember when configuring the two-way integration: The following steps are required to enable two-way integration: Check Allow two-way integration when you create the Notifier. Open and download this XML file(which includes the business rule for Incident Workflows). In the ServiceNow sidebar menu, go to System Definition > Business Rule. Click the menu icon in one of the column headers, select Import XML, and upload the XML file you downloaded. We create a New Relic API-key in the SNOW ‘api_key_credentials’ table. If you want two-way integration, the user used for setting the destination also needs write permissions to the table: api_key_credentials After you enable two-way integration, an incident state in ServiceNow changes to Resolved or Closed, and the corresponding workflow incident changes to Closed. Test your notifier to make sure everything is running smoothly and you are receiving your Alerts and Issues. Jira destination Using Jira as a notifier enables you to push valuable issues into a new Jira Cloud ticket. With two-way integration you can also make sure that state-updates are mirrored back to New Relic. Atlassian Jira notifiers need: Notifier name Jira url endpoint A username Jira API key After you enable two-way integration, an incident on Jira changes to Resolved or Closed, and the corresponding workflow incident changes to Closed. Finally, test your notifier to make sure everything is running smoothly and you are receiving your Alerts and Issues. If everything is connecting correctly, you will receive a ‘connection successful’ message.",

      "body": "With Applied Intelligence's Proactive Detection, anomalies from your APM-monitored applications are automatically surfaced in our activity streams and anomalies feed. Each anomaly can be clicked on to bring up an automatic analysis. You can have notifications for anomalies delivered in Slack, or you can set up a webhook to deliver messages when you need them. These events are available for querying, creating custom dashboards, and alerting. By creating a Proactive Detection configuration (a group of apps you’re interested in), you can then add this configuration as a source, and have anomalies automatically correlated with other data sources via Incident Intelligence. Requirements To use Proactive Detection, ensure you have: An APM agent installed for at least one applications. To receive notifications in Slack, you'll need to ask your IT administrator to install the Applied Intelligence application in your Slack workspace. For more on data limits, see Data limits. Why it matters With Proactive Detection, Applied Intelligence delivers insights about anomalies in your production system, along with an automatic analysis of the anomaly. It’s enabled automatically, at no additional cost. When an anomaly is detected, you can view it in the Applied Intelligence anomalies feed, or we'll send notifications directly to your Slack channel or a webhook. How it works Proactive Detection uses the following methods to detect anomalies in your app data: Proactive Detection monitors metric data reported by an APM agent, building a model of your typical application dynamics, and focuses on key golden signals: throughput, response time, and errors. If one of these golden signals shows anomalous behavior, the system flags it and tracks recovery to normal behavior. The system adapts to changes in your data, and continuously updates models based on new data. Automatically on: By default, Proactive Detection monitors all your APM applications, with no action required by you. When an anomaly is detected, it's automatically surfaced in various activity streams, the Applied Intelligence anomalies feed and is available for querying via NRQL. Receiving notifications: We send notifications when we detect anomalous changes in throughput, error rate, or response time. The notifications are sent to selected Slack channels, or sent via webhook. When the anomaly goes back to normal, a recovery message is sent. If you don't want to receive notifications, you still have access to the data via NRQL query. Anomaly analysis: For each anomaly, we provide a link in Slack to an analyze anomaly page. This page generates automatic insights into the anomaly. The page is also available from the anomalies tab, which lists recent anomalies. This page uses your existing APM and Proactive Detection data to provide explanations as to the cause of the anomaly. Activity stream: Inside various activity streams such as the New Relic One homepage, APM Summary page, Lookout and Explorer, you'll see relevant anomalies from your APM-monitored applications. Clicking on any of the anomaly events in the activity stream brings up the analysis page for that anomaly. Applications will not always generate anomalies, so it can be normal to not receive any detections. Set up notifications for Proactive Detection Proactive Detection is enabled automatically, at no additional cost. To receive notifications or to have a configuration (group of apps) that you can add as a source for Incident Intelligence, you will need to create a Proactive Detection configuration. You can create a configuration in the Proactive Detection UI: From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI. Under Proactive Detection, click Settings. Click Add a configuration. Input the following information into the form: Choose a name for your configuration that helps you easily identify it from others in your account. Select an account. Select up to 1,000 applications. Note that certain applications with low throughput might not be good candidates for Proactive Detection, as they can be more sensitive to smaller amounts of data fluctuation. Optional: select the golden signals you'd like to monitor for anomalies. Optional: connect to Incident Intelligence. Set up for Slack To use Proactive Detection with Slack: Select Slack. Choose which Slack channel receives notifications. You can select any existing public or private channel. This prompts the workflow to add the Applied Intelligence Slack application to your selected channel. To create a new channel, do that directly in Slack first. Tip If you experience an error when assigning Slack channels, make sure that the New Relic AI Slack application has been added to your Slack workspace. Save the configuration. You can modify the applications for each configuration at any time by selecting the configuration in the configuration table. Set up for webhooks To use Proactive Detection with webhooks: Select Webhook. Input the following information into the form: Provide the webhook URL. Provide optional custom headers. Choose to edit the custom payload, or enable using the default payload. Save the configuration. You can modify the applications for each configuration at any time by selecting the configuration in the configuration table. Set up without notifications To use Proactive Detection when you don't need to receive notifications: Select No notifications. Save the configuration. You can modify the applications for each configuration at any time by selecting the configuration in the configuration table. Mute notifications (Slack only) In Slack, detections coming from specific applications can be muted temporarily or permanently. The entire channel can also be muted temporarily. This is useful in the case of an incident or when the channel should otherwise not be interrupted. To mute in Slack, select Mute this app’s warnings or Mute all warnings, then select the duration. We will resume sending notifications for any detections once the muting duration has completed. Muting an application permanently removes it from the configuration. To add it back in, go to one.newrelic.com, in the top nav click Alerts & AI, then click Proactive Detection, and select the configuration to edit. Muting Proactive Detection notifications does not affect alerts. Use Proactive Detection Slack messages Each anomaly message has several key pieces of information you can use to learn more about and start troubleshooting the potential issue: The application name and a link to more information about it in New Relic One. The metric experiencing an anomaly and a link to its details in New Relic One. A graph of the metric over time to provide a visual understanding of the anomaly’s behavior and degree. An Analyze button that navigates to an analysis page in Applied Intelligence that identifies key attributes that are unique to the anomaly, anomalies found upstream or downstream, and any other relevant signals. Once an anomaly has returned to normal, we send a recovery notification with the option to provide feedback. Your feedback provides our development team with input to help us improve detection quality. In the case of feedback provided on throughput anomalies, an evaluation is run each hour based on feedback to fit a more suitable model. If we helped you, you can select Yes or No. View overview of anomalies In addition to notifications for anomalies that give you information via Slack or webhook, you can view more information about the anomalies in your environment via the Anomalies tab on the Alerts & AI Overview page. That tab provides a list of all the recent anomalies from every configuration in the selected account, and you can select an anomaly for a detailed analysis. Anomaly visibility settings Anomalies are displayed in various New Relic activity streams and in the Applied Intelligence anomalies feed. You can customize what is displayed using the anomaly visibility settings (for example, hiding throughput anomalies on an activity stream but keeping them in the anomalies feed). To find these settings: from Alerts & AI, under Proactive Detection, click Settings. Notes on using these settings: These settings are applied at the user level. Changes you make won’t affect others users in your organization. Regardless of these settings, the anomalies are still reported and available for NRQL querying. Details on these UI sections: AI overview and anomalies tab: Use the AI overview and anomalies tab setting to hide anomalies from the AI overview and anomalies tab setting. Please note you also can use filters specific to these views as well. Global activity stream: Use the global activity stream section to customize what anomalies are shown in the various New Relic activity streams, including the New Relic One homepage, APM Summary, and Lookout. Anomaly types: Use the check boxes here to hide specific types of anomalies. For example uncheck Web throughput and Non-web throughput anomalies to hide these types of anomalies from both the activity streams and the AI overview and anomalies tab. (Note they are still reported and available for querying.) Query anomaly data You can use NRQL to query and chart your Proactive Detection data using the NrAiAnomaly event. For example: FROM NrAiAnomaly SELECT * Important This data has previously been attached to the ProactiveDetection event. That event will be deprecated on April 7, 2021. If you use ProactiveDetection in your custom charts, you should convert those queries to using NrAiAnomaly. Here are important attributes attached to this event: Attribute Description closeTime timestamp The time when the anomaly ended. Example: 1615304100000. configurationType string The type of configuration monitoring the event. If at least one configuration is monitoring the entity, this is set to configuration. Otherwise, it's set to automatic. entity.accountId number The New Relic account ID to which the entity belongs. entity.domain number The domain of the entity (currently only APM but will change with future functionality). entity.guid string The GUID of the entity. This is used to identify and retrieve data about the entity via NerdGraph. Identical to entityGuid. entityGuid string The GUID of the entity. This is used to identify and retrieve data about the entity via NerdGraph. Identical to entity.guid. entity.name string The name of the entity whose data was determined to be anomalous. Identical to entityName. Example: Laura's coffee service. entityName string The name of the entity whose data was determined to be anomalous. Identical to entity.name. entity.type string The type of entity (currently only APPLICATION but will change with future functionality). evaluationType string This is always anomaly. event string Indicates whether it's the beginning (open) or end (close) of the anomalous data. openTime timestamp The time when the anomaly opened. Example: 1615303740000. signalType string The type of data that was analyzed. For example, error_rate or response_time.non_web. timestamp timestamp The time at which the event was written. title string Description of the anomaly. Example: Error rate was much higher than normal. Add anomalies as source in Incident Intelligence By integrating Incident Intelligence with your Proactive Detection anomalies, you can get context and correlations. To learn about doing this in Incident Intelligence, see Configure sources. You can also select Connect to Incident Intelligence from inside of a configuration. Webhook payload and examples Proactive Detection sends the event body in JSON format via HTTPS POST. The system expects the endpoint to return a successful HTTP code (2xx). If you use webhooks to configure Proactive Detection, use these examples of the webhook body format and JSON schema. Attribute Description category enum The category of data that was analyzed. Categories include web throughput, non-web throughput, web transactions, non-web transactions, and error class. data list The time series data leading up to the detection. data[].timestamp number The timestamp of the data point in milliseconds since the Unix epoch. Example: 1584366819000 data[].unit string The unit describing the value of the data point. Data units include count, milliseconds, and error_rate. data[].value number The value of the data point. Example: 1.52 detectionType enum The type of data that was analyzed. Types include latency, throughput, and error_rate. entity object The entity that reported the unusual data. entity.accountId number The ID for the entity's account. entity.domain enum The domain for the entity.

      "body": "BETA FEATURE This feature is currently in beta. With Incident Workflows, you identify the Policy you want to be alerted on. When the policy gets violated, the violation triggers the workflow, and violation attributes are transferred into the notification creation. Custom variables are violation-related properties you can use as part of the configuration of a workflow action. You can retrieve Information about the alert, condition, violation, and entity by using double curly brackets:: {{variable_name}}. Use custom variables in a filter statement To get information about the entity that violated a condition, you can use custom variables as part of the where statement of the query. For example, to get the state of the EC2 instance use: SELECT latest(ec2State) FROM ComputeSample where provider = 'Ec2Instance' where entityName = `{{entity.name}}' Copy This query returns a single value (for example, stopped), as the query only uses a single field. The variable entity.name is the identifier of the entity. You can use any other entity properties in the same way. Workflow data enrichment examples You can use custom variables to enrich your workflow data queries in different ways: Query for when application traffic drops There are times when you want to know when traffic to your application drops. You can use the { { entity.name}} variable in place of your application's name. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction WHERE appName = '{{entity.name}}' since 10 minutes ago Copy Query for transaction failures There are times when you want to know when your application transactions have failed. This query shows the latest HTTP status code responses filtered by the { { entity.name}} variable that violated your alert policy threshold. From Transaction select latest(httpResponseCode), average(duration) where appName = '{{entity.name}}' Copy Query for Kubernetes consumption overview Use a query like this to get the number of entities and their ingest times within a Kubernetes pod. By identifying what entities have large ingest times, you can begin to address that issue and find a potential remedy.

      "body": "BETA FEATURE This feature is currently in beta. With incident workflow control when and where you want to receive notifications about issues, tunnel the right information to the relevant person or team, and enrich your issue's notifications with additional New Relic data. Add a Workflow The Workflows feature is located under the Alerts & AI menu. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left navigation under Enrich and Respond click Workflow, then click Add a workflow. Tip The maximum workflows you can add per environment is 1000 Name your workflow. This field is mandatory and needs to be unique Workflows filters the issues you want to send to the relevant destination. You can send all issues by selecting Send all issues or you can build a query to filter the right issues. Build a query by selecting an attribute, operator and value/s to narrow down the right issues you want to be passed on. Optional: Enrichments Enrichments can give additional context on alert notifications by adding NRQL query results to them The workflows enrich tool is similar to the query builder. The NRQL query's results are included in the notification message. If you create queries for your workflows, they run in real time and the query results are the value of the enricher. You can save any valid query into your workflow, even if they return an empty result, but you must run the query before saving the enrichment. You can also query with issue-specific variables; for example {{entities.ids}} Note: the query name needs to be unique because you will use the name to decide how to include the result in the payload of the notification that will be sent by the workflow. Important The maximum number of enrichments per workflow is 10. The maximum number of variables an enrichment can contain is 1. Notifier In order to save and activate a Workflow you need to include a notifier. Setting up a notifier requires having a notification destination configured. You can either set it up through the Destination menu item, or through the Create new destination item in the destination selection drop down in each destination channel screen. A notification destination includes the credentials required to send a notification to a third party platform and an option to customize the message sent by mapping fields from our issues to fields in the destination platform. Note: each notifier allows for extensive customization tailored to your needs. Examples can be found below Click “update message” once completing the notifier requirements, then complete the workflow by clicking activate. Tip In any destination channel, start typing and a variable menu will open up. You will see the names of the variables, that at runtime will be replaced with the variable’s value/s. In order to use the enrichers’ results use their name. Variables To get information about the entity that violated a condition, you can use variables as part of the where statement of the query. For example, to get a list of error logs for a specific issue use: FROM log SELECT * where service.name = {{ entities.names }} AND level = ‘error’ LIMIT 10 Copy This query returns the last 10 error logs for each notification sent for the entities that are associated with the issue. This would give you additional context as to what may have gone wrong and likely help you solve the issue faster. You can use any other entity properties in the same way. An example of how to populate the field Important Note: In order to attain the value in the JSON format, you must specify the word JSON. Otherwise, you will get a comma delimited list (e.g. {{ json entities.Ids}} ). For more variable options to find additional context, a comprehensive list of variables can be found here: Key Display Name (First word will be used for grouping) accumulations.origin Issue Origin accumulations.source Issue Source activatedAt Issue Activated At dataMLModules.components Machine Learning Components dataMLModules.suggestedResponders Machine Learning Suggested Responder dataMLModules.goldenSignals Machine Learning Golden Signals annotations.description Issue Description annotations.title Issue Title closedAt Issue ClosedAt createdAt Issue CreatedAt entities.ids Impacted Entities IDs entities.types Impacted Entities Types entities.names Impacted Entities Names entities.kinds Impacted Entities Kinds incidentIds Incident IDs isCorrelated Issue Is Correlated issueId Issue ID labels.accountIds Issue Environment Associated Account ID labels.aggregationKeys Labels Alerts Aggregation Key labels.conditionNames Labels Alert Condition Names labels.originalAccountIds Labels Account IDs labels.policyIds Labels Alert Policy IDs labels.policyNames Labels Alert Policy Names priority Issue Priority state Issue State status Issue Status totalIncidents Incident Count triggerEvent Issue Notification Trigger Event triggeredAt Issue Triggered At updatedAt Issue Updated At workflowName Workflow Name Destinations Destinations are unique identifiers and credentials for third-party systems. The destination you choose is the location where we send notifications. Destinations are located under the Alerts and AI menu. Add a Destination Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left navigation under Enrich and Respond , then click Destinations. Select one of the destination types at the top of the destinations management screen. Webhook destination Use the webhook notifier to send notification messages to any endpoint. The webhook configuration requires: A unique destination name The endpoint url of the target application Authorization which can be ‘basic authentication or a ‘bearer token’ Basic authentication allows users to provide the username and password associated with your HTTP endpoint, which will populate in the header. Bearer token involves security tokens, where the token is a cryptic string. The user must send this token in the authorization header when requesting protected resources To test your webhook, click ‘test connection’ on the bottom right. There’s a retry mechanism that is triggered a few times with exponential backoff for a couple of minutes once an error occurs. If we reach the retry limit, the Webhook will get auto-disabled. ServiceNow incidents destination Using ServiceNow as a notifier enables you to push valuable issues into new ServiceNow incidents. With two-way integrations, you can also make sure that status updates of ServiceNow incidents are mirrored back to New Relic. The ServiceNow notifier requires: Unique notifier name ServiceNow domain endpoint A username and password Optional: enable two-way integration Important The Servicenow user details should have read permissions for the tables: sys_dictionary, sys_choice, sys_user, change_request Optional: enable two-way integration You can configure a two-way integration with ServiceNow incidents so that when state updates for the incident (resolved or closed), it triggers an update in the corresponding New Relic Issue state. Here are some important things to remember when configuring the two-way integration: The following steps are required to enable two-way integration: Check Allow two-way integration when you create the Notifier. Open and download this XML file(which includes the business rule for Incident Workflows). In the ServiceNow sidebar menu, go to System Definition > Business Rule. Click the menu icon in one of the column headers, select Import XML, and upload the XML file you downloaded. We create a New Relic API-key in the SNOW ‘api_key_credentials’ table. If you want two-way integration, the user used for setting the destination also needs write permissions to the table: api_key_credentials After you enable two-way integration, an incident state in ServiceNow changes to Resolved or Closed, and the corresponding workflow incident changes to Closed. Test your notifier to make sure everything is running smoothly and you are receiving your Alerts and Issues. Jira destination Using Jira as a notifier enables you to push valuable issues into a new Jira Cloud ticket. With two-way integration you can also make sure that state-updates are mirrored back to New Relic. Atlassian Jira notifiers need: Notifier name Jira url endpoint A username Jira API key After you enable two-way integration, an incident on Jira changes to Resolved or Closed, and the corresponding workflow incident changes to Closed. Finally, test your notifier to make sure everything is running smoothly and you are receiving your Alerts and Issues. If everything is connecting correctly, you will receive a ‘connection successful’ message.",

      "body": "With Applied Intelligence's Proactive Detection, anomalies from your APM-monitored applications are automatically surfaced in our activity streams and anomalies feed. Each anomaly can be clicked on to bring up an automatic analysis. You can have notifications for anomalies delivered in Slack, or you can set up a webhook to deliver messages when you need them. These events are available for querying, creating custom dashboards, and alerting. By creating a Proactive Detection configuration (a group of apps you’re interested in), you can then add this configuration as a source, and have anomalies automatically correlated with other data sources via Incident Intelligence. Requirements To use Proactive Detection, ensure you have: An APM agent installed for at least one applications. To receive notifications in Slack, you'll need to ask your IT administrator to install the Applied Intelligence application in your Slack workspace. For more on data limits, see Data limits. Why it matters With Proactive Detection, Applied Intelligence delivers insights about anomalies in your production system, along with an automatic analysis of the anomaly. It’s enabled automatically, at no additional cost. When an anomaly is detected, you can view it in the Applied Intelligence anomalies feed, or we'll send notifications directly to your Slack channel or a webhook. How it works Proactive Detection uses the following methods to detect anomalies in your app data: Proactive Detection monitors metric data reported by an APM agent, building a model of your typical application dynamics, and focuses on key golden signals: throughput, response time, and errors. If one of these golden signals shows anomalous behavior, the system flags it and tracks recovery to normal behavior. The system adapts to changes in your data, and continuously updates models based on new data. Automatically on: By default, Proactive Detection monitors all your APM applications, with no action required by you. When an anomaly is detected, it's automatically surfaced in various activity streams, the Applied Intelligence anomalies feed and is available for querying via NRQL. Receiving notifications: We send notifications when we detect anomalous changes in throughput, error rate, or response time. The notifications are sent to selected Slack channels, or sent via webhook. When the anomaly goes back to normal, a recovery message is sent. If you don't want to receive notifications, you still have access to the data via NRQL query. Anomaly analysis: For each anomaly, we provide a link in Slack to an analyze anomaly page. This page generates automatic insights into the anomaly. The page is also available from the anomalies tab, which lists recent anomalies. This page uses your existing APM and Proactive Detection data to provide explanations as to the cause of the anomaly. Activity stream: Inside various activity streams such as the New Relic One homepage, APM Summary page, Lookout and Explorer, you'll see relevant anomalies from your APM-monitored applications. Clicking on any of the anomaly events in the activity stream brings up the analysis page for that anomaly. Applications will not always generate anomalies, so it can be normal to not receive any detections. Set up notifications for Proactive Detection Proactive Detection is enabled automatically, at no additional cost. To receive notifications or to have a configuration (group of apps) that you can add as a source for Incident Intelligence, you will need to create a Proactive Detection configuration. You can create a configuration in the Proactive Detection UI: From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI. Under Proactive Detection, click Settings. Click Add a configuration. Input the following information into the form: Choose a name for your configuration that helps you easily identify it from others in your account. Select an account. Select up to 1,000 applications. Note that certain applications with low throughput might not be good candidates for Proactive Detection, as they can be more sensitive to smaller amounts of data fluctuation. Optional: select the golden signals you'd like to monitor for anomalies. Optional: connect to Incident Intelligence. Set up for Slack To use Proactive Detection with Slack: Select Slack. Choose which Slack channel receives notifications. You can select any existing public or private channel. This prompts the workflow to add the Applied Intelligence Slack application to your selected channel. To create a new channel, do that directly in Slack first. Tip If you experience an error when assigning Slack channels, make sure that the New Relic AI Slack application has been added to your Slack workspace. Save the configuration. You can modify the applications for each configuration at any time by selecting the configuration in the configuration table. Set up for webhooks To use Proactive Detection with webhooks: Select Webhook. Input the following information into the form: Provide the webhook URL. Provide optional custom headers. Choose to edit the custom payload, or enable using the default payload. Save the configuration. You can modify the applications for each configuration at any time by selecting the configuration in the configuration table. Set up without notifications To use Proactive Detection when you don't need to receive notifications: Select No notifications. Save the configuration. You can modify the applications for each configuration at any time by selecting the configuration in the configuration table. Mute notifications (Slack only) In Slack, detections coming from specific applications can be muted temporarily or permanently. The entire channel can also be muted temporarily. This is useful in the case of an incident or when the channel should otherwise not be interrupted. To mute in Slack, select Mute this app’s warnings or Mute all warnings, then select the duration. We will resume sending notifications for any detections once the muting duration has completed. Muting an application permanently removes it from the configuration. To add it back in, go to one.newrelic.com, in the top nav click Alerts & AI, then click Proactive Detection, and select the configuration to edit. Muting Proactive Detection notifications does not affect alerts. Use Proactive Detection Slack messages Each anomaly message has several key pieces of information you can use to learn more about and start troubleshooting the potential issue: The application name and a link to more information about it in New Relic One. The metric experiencing an anomaly and a link to its details in New Relic One. A graph of the metric over time to provide a visual understanding of the anomaly’s behavior and degree. An Analyze button that navigates to an analysis page in Applied Intelligence that identifies key attributes that are unique to the anomaly, anomalies found upstream or downstream, and any other relevant signals. Once an anomaly has returned to normal, we send a recovery notification with the option to provide feedback. Your feedback provides our development team with input to help us improve detection quality. In the case of feedback provided on throughput anomalies, an evaluation is run each hour based on feedback to fit a more suitable model. If we helped you, you can select Yes or No. View overview of anomalies In addition to notifications for anomalies that give you information via Slack or webhook, you can view more information about the anomalies in your environment via the Anomalies tab on the Alerts & AI Overview page. That tab provides a list of all the recent anomalies from every configuration in the selected account, and you can select an anomaly for a detailed analysis. Anomaly visibility settings Anomalies are displayed in various New Relic activity streams and in the Applied Intelligence anomalies feed. You can customize what is displayed using the anomaly visibility settings (for example, hiding throughput anomalies on an activity stream but keeping them in the anomalies feed). To find these settings: from Alerts & AI, under Proactive Detection, click Settings. Notes on using these settings: These settings are applied at the user level. Changes you make won’t affect others users in your organization. Regardless of these settings, the anomalies are still reported and available for NRQL querying. Details on these UI sections: AI overview and anomalies tab: Use the AI overview and anomalies tab setting to hide anomalies from the AI overview and anomalies tab setting. Please note you also can use filters specific to these views as well. Global activity stream: Use the global activity stream section to customize what anomalies are shown in the various New Relic activity streams, including the New Relic One homepage, APM Summary, and Lookout. Anomaly types: Use the check boxes here to hide specific types of anomalies. For example uncheck Web throughput and Non-web throughput anomalies to hide these types of anomalies from both the activity streams and the AI overview and anomalies tab. (Note they are still reported and available for querying.) Query anomaly data You can use NRQL to query and chart your Proactive Detection data using the NrAiAnomaly event. For example: FROM NrAiAnomaly SELECT * Important This data has previously been attached to the ProactiveDetection event. That event will be deprecated on April 7, 2021. If you use ProactiveDetection in your custom charts, you should convert those queries to using NrAiAnomaly. Here are important attributes attached to this event: Attribute Description closeTime timestamp The time when the anomaly ended. Example: 1615304100000. configurationType string The type of configuration monitoring the event. If at least one configuration is monitoring the entity, this is set to configuration. Otherwise, it's set to automatic. entity.accountId number The New Relic account ID to which the entity belongs. entity.domain number The domain of the entity (currently only APM but will change with future functionality). entity.guid string The GUID of the entity. This is used to identify and retrieve data about the entity via NerdGraph. Identical to entityGuid. entityGuid string The GUID of the entity. This is used to identify and retrieve data about the entity via NerdGraph. Identical to entity.guid. entity.name string The name of the entity whose data was determined to be anomalous. Identical to entityName. Example: Laura's coffee service. entityName string The name of the entity whose data was determined to be anomalous. Identical to entity.name. entity.type string The type of entity (currently only APPLICATION but will change with future functionality). evaluationType string This is always anomaly. event string Indicates whether it's the beginning (open) or end (close) of the anomalous data. openTime timestamp The time when the anomaly opened. Example: 1615303740000. signalType string The type of data that was analyzed. For example, error_rate or response_time.non_web. timestamp timestamp The time at which the event was written. title string Description of the anomaly. Example: Error rate was much higher than normal. Add anomalies as source in Incident Intelligence By integrating Incident Intelligence with your Proactive Detection anomalies, you can get context and correlations. To learn about doing this in Incident Intelligence, see Configure sources. You can also select Connect to Incident Intelligence from inside of a configuration. Webhook payload and examples Proactive Detection sends the event body in JSON format via HTTPS POST. The system expects the endpoint to return a successful HTTP code (2xx). If you use webhooks to configure Proactive Detection, use these examples of the webhook body format and JSON schema. Attribute Description category enum The category of data that was analyzed. Categories include web throughput, non-web throughput, web transactions, non-web transactions, and error class. data list The time series data leading up to the detection. data[].timestamp number The timestamp of the data point in milliseconds since the Unix epoch. Example: 1584366819000 data[].unit string The unit describing the value of the data point. Data units include count, milliseconds, and error_rate. data[].value number The value of the data point. Example: 1.52 detectionType enum The type of data that was analyzed. Types include latency, throughput, and error_rate. entity object The entity that reported the unusual data. entity.accountId number The ID for the entity's account. entity.domain enum The domain for the entity. Example: APM. entity.domainId string The id used to uniquely identify the entity within the domain. entity.guid string The guid used to uniquely identify the entity across all products. entity.name string The name of the entity. Example: Laura’s coffee service entity.link string A link to view the entity.

      "body": "BETA FEATURE This feature is currently in beta. With Incident Workflows, you identify the Policy you want to be alerted on. When the policy gets violated, the violation triggers the workflow, and violation attributes are transferred into the notification creation. Custom variables are violation-related properties you can use as part of the configuration of a workflow action. You can retrieve Information about the alert, condition, violation, and entity by using double curly brackets:: {{variable_name}}. Use custom variables in a filter statement To get information about the entity that violated a condition, you can use custom variables as part of the where statement of the query. For example, to get the state of the EC2 instance use: SELECT latest(ec2State) FROM ComputeSample where provider = 'Ec2Instance' where entityName = `{{entity.name}}' Copy This query returns a single value (for example, stopped), as the query only uses a single field. The variable entity.name is the identifier of the entity. You can use any other entity properties in the same way. Workflow data enrichment examples You can use custom variables to enrich your workflow data queries in different ways: Query for when application traffic drops There are times when you want to know when traffic to your application drops. You can use the { { entity.name}} variable in place of your application's name. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction WHERE appName = '{{entity.name}}' since 10 minutes ago Copy Query for transaction failures There are times when you want to know when your application transactions have failed. This query shows the latest HTTP status code responses filtered by the { { entity.name}} variable that violated your alert policy threshold. From Transaction select latest(httpResponseCode), average(duration) where appName = '{{entity.name}}' Copy Query for Kubernetes consumption overview Use a query like this to get the number of entities and their ingest times within a Kubernetes pod. By identifying what entities have large ingest times, you can begin to address that issue and find a potential remedy. SELECT uniqueCount(displayName), sum(nr.ingestTimeMs) from K8sServiceSample where entityName = '{{entity.name}}' since 1 hour ago.

      "body": "BETA FEATURE This feature is currently in beta. With incident workflow control when and where you want to receive notifications about issues, tunnel the right information to the relevant person or team, and enrich your issue's notifications with additional New Relic data. Add a Workflow The Workflows feature is located under the Alerts & AI menu. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left navigation under Enrich and Respond click Workflow, then click Add a workflow. Tip The maximum workflows you can add per environment is 1000 Name your workflow. This field is mandatory and needs to be unique Workflows filters the issues you want to send to the relevant destination. You can send all issues by selecting Send all issues or you can build a query to filter the right issues. Build a query by selecting an attribute, operator and value/s to narrow down the right issues you want to be passed on. Optional: Enrichments Enrichments can give additional context on alert notifications by adding NRQL query results to them The workflows enrich tool is similar to the query builder. The NRQL query's results are included in the notification message. If you create queries for your workflows, they run in real time and the query results are the value of the enricher. You can save any valid query into your workflow, even if they return an empty result, but you must run the query before saving the enrichment. You can also query with issue-specific variables; for example {{entities.ids}} Note: the query name needs to be unique because you will use the name to decide how to include the result in the payload of the notification that will be sent by the workflow. Important The maximum number of enrichments per workflow is 10. The maximum number of variables an enrichment can contain is 1. Notifier In order to save and activate a Workflow you need to include a notifier. Setting up a notifier requires having a notification destination configured. You can either set it up through the Destination menu item, or through the Create new destination item in the destination selection drop down in each destination channel screen. A notification destination includes the credentials required to send a notification to a third party platform and an option to customize the message sent by mapping fields from our issues to fields in the destination platform. Note: each notifier allows for extensive customization tailored to your needs. Examples can be found below Click “update message” once completing the notifier requirements, then complete the workflow by clicking activate. Tip In any destination channel, start typing and a variable menu will open up. You will see the names of the variables, that at runtime will be replaced with the variable’s value/s. In order to use the enrichers’ results use their name. Variables To get information about the entity that violated a condition, you can use variables as part of the where statement of the query. For example, to get a list of error logs for a specific issue use: FROM log SELECT * where service.name = {{ entities.names }} AND level = ‘error’ LIMIT 10 Copy This query returns the last 10 error logs for each notification sent for the entities that are associated with the issue. This would give you additional context as to what may have gone wrong and likely help you solve the issue faster. You can use any other entity properties in the same way. An example of how to populate the field Important Note: In order to attain the value in the JSON format, you must specify the word JSON. Otherwise, you will get a comma delimited list (e.g. {{ json entities.Ids}} ). For more variable options to find additional context, a comprehensive list of variables can be found here: Key Display Name (First word will be used for grouping) accumulations.origin Issue Origin accumulations.source Issue Source activatedAt Issue Activated At dataMLModules.components Machine Learning Components dataMLModules.suggestedResponders Machine Learning Suggested Responder dataMLModules.goldenSignals Machine Learning Golden Signals annotations.description Issue Description annotations.title Issue Title closedAt Issue ClosedAt createdAt Issue CreatedAt entities.ids Impacted Entities IDs entities.types Impacted Entities Types entities.names Impacted Entities Names entities.kinds Impacted Entities Kinds incidentIds Incident IDs isCorrelated Issue Is Correlated issueId Issue ID labels.accountIds Issue Environment Associated Account ID labels.aggregationKeys Labels Alerts Aggregation Key labels.conditionNames Labels Alert Condition Names labels.originalAccountIds Labels Account IDs labels.policyIds Labels Alert Policy IDs labels.policyNames Labels Alert Policy Names priority Issue Priority state Issue State status Issue Status totalIncidents Incident Count triggerEvent Issue Notification Trigger Event triggeredAt Issue Triggered At updatedAt Issue Updated At workflowName Workflow Name Destinations Destinations are unique identifiers and credentials for third-party systems. The destination you choose is the location where we send notifications. Destinations are located under the Alerts and AI menu. Add a Destination Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left navigation under Enrich and Respond , then click Destinations. Select one of the destination types at the top of the destinations management screen. Webhook destination Use the webhook notifier to send notification messages to any endpoint. The webhook configuration requires: A unique destination name The endpoint url of the target application Authorization which can be ‘basic authentication or a ‘bearer token’ Basic authentication allows users to provide the username and password associated with your HTTP endpoint, which will populate in the header. Bearer token involves security tokens, where the token is a cryptic string. The user must send this token in the authorization header when requesting protected resources To test your webhook, click ‘test connection’ on the bottom right. There’s a retry mechanism that is triggered a few times with exponential backoff for a couple of minutes once an error occurs. If we reach the retry limit, the Webhook will get auto-disabled. ServiceNow incidents destination Using ServiceNow as a notifier enables you to push valuable issues into new ServiceNow incidents. With two-way integrations, you can also make sure that status updates of ServiceNow incidents are mirrored back to New Relic. The ServiceNow notifier requires: Unique notifier name ServiceNow domain endpoint A username and password Optional: enable two-way integration Important The Servicenow user details should have read permissions for the tables: sys_dictionary, sys_choice, sys_user, change_request Optional: enable two-way integration You can configure a two-way integration with ServiceNow incidents so that when state updates for the incident (resolved or closed), it triggers an update in the corresponding New Relic Issue state. Here are some important things to remember when configuring the two-way integration: The following steps are required to enable two-way integration: Check Allow two-way integration when you create the Notifier. Open and download this XML file(which includes the business rule for Incident Workflows). In the ServiceNow sidebar menu, go to System Definition > Business Rule. Click the menu icon in one of the column headers, select Import XML, and upload the XML file you downloaded. We create a New Relic API-key in the SNOW ‘api_key_credentials’ table. If you want two-way integration, the user used for setting the destination also needs write permissions to the table: api_key_credentials After you enable two-way integration, an incident state in ServiceNow changes to Resolved or Closed, and the corresponding workflow incident changes to Closed. Test your notifier to make sure everything is running smoothly and you are receiving your Alerts and Issues. Jira destination Using Jira as a notifier enables you to push valuable issues into a new Jira Cloud ticket. With two-way integration you can also make sure that state-updates are mirrored back to New Relic. Atlassian Jira notifiers need: Notifier name Jira url endpoint A username Jira API key After you enable two-way integration, an incident on Jira changes to Resolved or Closed, and the corresponding workflow incident changes to Closed. Finally, test your notifier to make sure everything is running smoothly and you are receiving your Alerts and Issues. If everything is connecting correctly, you will receive a ‘connection successful’ message.",

      "body": "With Applied Intelligence's Proactive Detection, anomalies from your APM-monitored applications are automatically surfaced in our activity streams and anomalies feed. Each anomaly can be clicked on to bring up an automatic analysis. You can have notifications for anomalies delivered in Slack, or you can set up a webhook to deliver messages when you need them. These events are available for querying, creating custom dashboards, and alerting. By creating a Proactive Detection configuration (a group of apps you’re interested in), you can then add this configuration as a source, and have anomalies automatically correlated with other data sources via Incident Intelligence. Requirements To use Proactive Detection, ensure you have: An APM agent installed for at least one applications. To receive notifications in Slack, you'll need to ask your IT administrator to install the Applied Intelligence application in your Slack workspace. For more on data limits, see Data limits. Why it matters With Proactive Detection, Applied Intelligence delivers insights about anomalies in your production system, along with an automatic analysis of the anomaly. It’s enabled automatically, at no additional cost. When an anomaly is detected, you can view it in the Applied Intelligence anomalies feed, or we'll send notifications directly to your Slack channel or a webhook. How it works Proactive Detection uses the following methods to detect anomalies in your app data: Proactive Detection monitors metric data reported by an APM agent, building a model of your typical application dynamics, and focuses on key golden signals: throughput, response time, and errors. If one of these golden signals shows anomalous behavior, the system flags it and tracks recovery to normal behavior. The system adapts to changes in your data, and continuously updates models based on new data. Automatically on: By default, Proactive Detection monitors all your APM applications, with no action required by you. When an anomaly is detected, it's automatically surfaced in various activity streams, the Applied Intelligence anomalies feed and is available for querying via NRQL. Receiving notifications: We send notifications when we detect anomalous changes in throughput, error rate, or response time. The notifications are sent to selected Slack channels, or sent via webhook. When the anomaly goes back to normal, a recovery message is sent. If you don't want to receive notifications, you still have access to the data via NRQL query. Anomaly analysis: For each anomaly, we provide a link in Slack to an analyze anomaly page. This page generates automatic insights into the anomaly. The page is also available from the anomalies tab, which lists recent anomalies. This page uses your existing APM and Proactive Detection data to provide explanations as to the cause of the anomaly. Activity stream: Inside various activity streams such as the New Relic One homepage, APM Summary page, Lookout and Explorer, you'll see relevant anomalies from your APM-monitored applications. Clicking on any of the anomaly events in the activity stream brings up the analysis page for that anomaly. Applications will not always generate anomalies, so it can be normal to not receive any detections. Set up notifications for Proactive Detection Proactive Detection is enabled automatically, at no additional cost. To receive notifications or to have a configuration (group of apps) that you can add as a source for Incident Intelligence, you will need to create a Proactive Detection configuration. You can create a configuration in the Proactive Detection UI: From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI. Under Proactive Detection, click Settings. Click Add a configuration. Input the following information into the form: Choose a name for your configuration that helps you easily identify it from others in your account. Select an account. Select up to 1,000 applications. Note that certain applications with low throughput might not be good candidates for Proactive Detection, as they can be more sensitive to smaller amounts of data fluctuation. Optional: select the golden signals you'd like to monitor for anomalies. Optional: connect to Incident Intelligence. Set up for Slack To use Proactive Detection with Slack: Select Slack. Choose which Slack channel receives notifications. You can select any existing public or private channel. This prompts the workflow to add the Applied Intelligence Slack application to your selected channel. To create a new channel, do that directly in Slack first. Tip If you experience an error when assigning Slack channels, make sure that the New Relic AI Slack application has been added to your Slack workspace. Save the configuration. You can modify the applications for each configuration at any time by selecting the configuration in the configuration table. Set up for webhooks To use Proactive Detection with webhooks: Select Webhook. Input the following information into the form: Provide the webhook URL. Provide optional custom headers. Choose to edit the custom payload, or enable using the default payload. Save the configuration. You can modify the applications for each configuration at any time by selecting the configuration in the configuration table. Set up without notifications To use Proactive Detection when you don't need to receive notifications: Select No notifications. Save the configuration. You can modify the applications for each configuration at any time by selecting the configuration in the configuration table. Mute notifications (Slack only) In Slack, detections coming from specific applications can be muted temporarily or permanently. The entire channel can also be muted temporarily. This is useful in the case of an incident or when the channel should otherwise not be interrupted. To mute in Slack, select Mute this app’s warnings or Mute all warnings, then select the duration. We will resume sending notifications for any detections once the muting duration has completed. Muting an application permanently removes it from the configuration. To add it back in, go to one.newrelic.com, in the top nav click Alerts & AI, then click Proactive Detection, and select the configuration to edit. Muting Proactive Detection notifications does not affect alerts. Use Proactive Detection Slack messages Each anomaly message has several key pieces of information you can use to learn more about and start troubleshooting the potential issue: The application name and a link to more information about it in New Relic One. The metric experiencing an anomaly and a link to its details in New Relic One. A graph of the metric over time to provide a visual understanding of the anomaly’s behavior and degree. An Analyze button that navigates to an analysis page in Applied Intelligence that identifies key attributes that are unique to the anomaly, anomalies found upstream or downstream, and any other relevant signals. Once an anomaly has returned to normal, we send a recovery notification with the option to provide feedback. Your feedback provides our development team with input to help us improve detection quality. In the case of feedback provided on throughput anomalies, an evaluation is run each hour based on feedback to fit a more suitable model. If we helped you, you can select Yes or No. View overview of anomalies In addition to notifications for anomalies that give you information via Slack or webhook, you can view more information about the anomalies in your environment via the Anomalies tab on the Alerts & AI Overview page. That tab provides a list of all the recent anomalies from every configuration in the selected account, and you can select an anomaly for a detailed analysis. Anomaly visibility settings Anomalies are displayed in various New Relic activity streams and in the Applied Intelligence anomalies feed. You can customize what is displayed using the anomaly visibility settings (for example, hiding throughput anomalies on an activity stream but keeping them in the anomalies feed). To find these settings: from Alerts & AI, under Proactive Detection, click Settings. Notes on using these settings: These settings are applied at the user level. Changes you make won’t affect others users in your organization. Regardless of these settings, the anomalies are still reported and available for NRQL querying. Details on these UI sections: AI overview and anomalies tab: Use the AI overview and anomalies tab setting to hide anomalies from the AI overview and anomalies tab setting. Please note you also can use filters specific to these views as well. Global activity stream: Use the global activity stream section to customize what anomalies are shown in the various New Relic activity streams, including the New Relic One homepage, APM Summary, and Lookout. Anomaly types: Use the check boxes here to hide specific types of anomalies. For example uncheck Web throughput and Non-web throughput anomalies to hide these types of anomalies from both the activity streams and the AI overview and anomalies tab. (Note they are still reported and available for querying.) Query anomaly data You can use NRQL to query and chart your Proactive Detection data using the NrAiAnomaly event. For example: FROM NrAiAnomaly SELECT * Important This data has previously been attached to the ProactiveDetection event. That event will be deprecated on April 7, 2021. If you use ProactiveDetection in your custom charts, you should convert those queries to using NrAiAnomaly. Here are important attributes attached to this event: Attribute Description closeTime timestamp The time when the anomaly ended. Example: 1615304100000. configurationType string The type of configuration monitoring the event. If at least one configuration is monitoring the entity, this is set to configuration. Otherwise, it's set to automatic. entity.accountId number The New Relic account ID to which the entity belongs. entity.domain number The domain of the entity (currently only APM but will change with future functionality). entity.guid string The GUID of the entity. This is used to identify and retrieve data about the entity via NerdGraph. Identical to entityGuid. entityGuid string The GUID of the entity. This is used to identify and retrieve data about the entity via NerdGraph. Identical to entity.guid. entity.name string The name of the entity whose data was determined to be anomalous. Identical to entityName. Example: Laura's coffee service. entityName string The name of the entity whose data was determined to be anomalous. Identical to entity.name. entity.type string The type of entity (currently only APPLICATION but will change with future functionality). evaluationType string This is always anomaly. event string Indicates whether it's the beginning (open) or end (close) of the anomalous data. openTime timestamp The time when the anomaly opened. Example: 1615303740000. signalType string The type of data that was analyzed. For example, error_rate or response_time.non_web. timestamp timestamp The time at which the event was written. title string Description of the anomaly. Example: Error rate was much higher than normal. Add anomalies as source in Incident Intelligence By integrating Incident Intelligence with your Proactive Detection anomalies, you can get context and correlations. To learn about doing this in Incident Intelligence, see Configure sources. You can also select Connect to Incident Intelligence from inside of a configuration. Webhook payload and examples Proactive Detection sends the event body in JSON format via HTTPS POST. The system expects the endpoint to return a successful HTTP code (2xx). If you use webhooks to configure Proactive Detection, use these examples of the webhook body format and JSON schema. Attribute Description category enum The category of data that was analyzed. Categories include web throughput, non-web throughput, web transactions, non-web transactions, and error class. data list The time series data leading up to the detection. data[].timestamp number The timestamp of the data point in milliseconds since the Unix epoch. Example: 1584366819000 data[].unit string The unit describing the value of the data point. Data units include count, milliseconds, and error_rate. data[].value number The value of the data point. Example: 1.52 detectionType enum The type of data that was analyzed. Types include latency, throughput, and error_rate. entity object The entity that reported the unusual data. entity.accountId number The ID for the entity's account. entity.domain enum The domain for the entity. Example: APM. entity.domainId string The id used to uniquely identify the entity within the domain. entity.guid string The guid used to uniquely identify the entity across all products. entity.name string The name of the entity. Example: Laura’s coffee service entity.link string A link to view the entity.

      "body": "BETA FEATURE This feature is currently in beta. With Incident Workflows, you identify the Policy you want to be alerted on. When the policy gets violated, the violation triggers the workflow, and violation attributes are transferred into the notification creation. Custom variables are violation-related properties you can use as part of the configuration of a workflow action. You can retrieve Information about the alert, condition, violation, and entity by using double curly brackets:: {{variable_name}}. Use custom variables in a filter statement To get information about the entity that violated a condition, you can use custom variables as part of the where statement of the query. For example, to get the state of the EC2 instance use: SELECT latest(ec2State) FROM ComputeSample where provider = 'Ec2Instance' where entityName = `{{entity.name}}' Copy This query returns a single value (for example, stopped), as the query only uses a single field. The variable entity.name is the identifier of the entity. You can use any other entity properties in the same way. Workflow data enrichment examples You can use custom variables to enrich your workflow data queries in different ways: Query for when application traffic drops There are times when you want to know when traffic to your application drops. You can use the { { entity.name}} variable in place of your application's name. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction WHERE appName = '{{entity.name}}' since 10 minutes ago Copy Query for transaction failures There are times when you want to know when your application transactions have failed. This query shows the latest HTTP status code responses filtered by the { { entity.name}} variable that violated your alert policy threshold. From Transaction select latest(httpResponseCode), average(duration) where appName = '{{entity.name}}' Copy Query for Kubernetes consumption overview Use a query like this to get the number of entities and their ingest times within a Kubernetes pod. By identifying what entities have large ingest times, you can begin to address that issue and find a potential remedy.

      "body": "BETA FEATURE This feature is currently in beta. With incident workflow control when and where you want to receive notifications about issues, tunnel the right information to the relevant person or team, and enrich your issue's notifications with additional New Relic data. Add a Workflow The Workflows feature is located under the Alerts & AI menu. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left navigation under Enrich and Respond click Workflow, then click Add a workflow. Tip The maximum workflows you can add per environment is 1000 Name your workflow. This field is mandatory and needs to be unique Workflows filters the issues you want to send to the relevant destination. You can send all issues by selecting Send all issues or you can build a query to filter the right issues. Build a query by selecting an attribute, operator and value/s to narrow down the right issues you want to be passed on. Optional: Enrichments Enrichments can give additional context on alert notifications by adding NRQL query results to them The workflows enrich tool is similar to the query builder. The NRQL query's results are included in the notification message. If you create queries for your workflows, they run in real time and the query results are the value of the enricher. You can save any valid query into your workflow, even if they return an empty result, but you must run the query before saving the enrichment. You can also query with issue-specific variables; for example {{entities.ids}} Note: the query name needs to be unique because you will use the name to decide how to include the result in the payload of the notification that will be sent by the workflow. Important The maximum number of enrichments per workflow is 10. The maximum number of variables an enrichment can contain is 1. Notifier In order to save and activate a Workflow you need to include a notifier. Setting up a notifier requires having a notification destination configured. You can either set it up through the Destination menu item, or through the Create new destination item in the destination selection drop down in each destination channel screen. A notification destination includes the credentials required to send a notification to a third party platform and an option to customize the message sent by mapping fields from our issues to fields in the destination platform. Note: each notifier allows for extensive customization tailored to your needs. Examples can be found below Click “update message” once completing the notifier requirements, then complete the workflow by clicking activate. Tip In any destination channel, start typing and a variable menu will open up. You will see the names of the variables, that at runtime will be replaced with the variable’s value/s. In order to use the enrichers’ results use their name. Variables To get information about the entity that violated a condition, you can use variables as part of the where statement of the query. For example, to get a list of error logs for a specific issue use: FROM log SELECT * where service.name = {{ entities.names }} AND level = ‘error’ LIMIT 10 Copy This query returns the last 10 error logs for each notification sent for the entities that are associated with the issue. This would give you additional context as to what may have gone wrong and likely help you solve the issue faster. You can use any other entity properties in the same way. An example of how to populate the field Important Note: In order to attain the value in the JSON format, you must specify the word JSON. Otherwise, you will get a comma delimited list (e.g. {{ json entities.Ids}} ). For more variable options to find additional context, a comprehensive list of variables can be found here: Key Display Name (First word will be used for grouping) accumulations.origin Issue Origin accumulations.source Issue Source activatedAt Issue Activated At dataMLModules.components Machine Learning Components dataMLModules.suggestedResponders Machine Learning Suggested Responder dataMLModules.goldenSignals Machine Learning Golden Signals annotations.description Issue Description annotations.title Issue Title closedAt Issue ClosedAt createdAt Issue CreatedAt entities.ids Impacted Entities IDs entities.types Impacted Entities Types entities.names Impacted Entities Names entities.kinds Impacted Entities Kinds incidentIds Incident IDs isCorrelated Issue Is Correlated issueId Issue ID labels.accountIds Issue Environment Associated Account ID labels.aggregationKeys Labels Alerts Aggregation Key labels.conditionNames Labels Alert Condition Names labels.originalAccountIds Labels Account IDs labels.policyIds Labels Alert Policy IDs labels.policyNames Labels Alert Policy Names priority Issue Priority state Issue State status Issue Status totalIncidents Incident Count triggerEvent Issue Notification Trigger Event triggeredAt Issue Triggered At updatedAt Issue Updated At workflowName Workflow Name Destinations Destinations are unique identifiers and credentials for third-party systems. The destination you choose is the location where we send notifications. Destinations are located under the Alerts and AI menu. Add a Destination Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left navigation under Enrich and Respond , then click Destinations. Select one of the destination types at the top of the destinations management screen. Webhook destination Use the webhook notifier to send notification messages to any endpoint. The webhook configuration requires: A unique destination name The endpoint url of the target application Authorization which can be ‘basic authentication or a ‘bearer token’ Basic authentication allows users to provide the username and password associated with your HTTP endpoint, which will populate in the header. Bearer token involves security tokens, where the token is a cryptic string. The user must send this token in the authorization header when requesting protected resources To test your webhook, click ‘test connection’ on the bottom right. There’s a retry mechanism that is triggered a few times with exponential backoff for a couple of minutes once an error occurs. If we reach the retry limit, the Webhook will get auto-disabled. ServiceNow incidents destination Using ServiceNow as a notifier enables you to push valuable issues into new ServiceNow incidents. With two-way integrations, you can also make sure that status updates of ServiceNow incidents are mirrored back to New Relic. The ServiceNow notifier requires: Unique notifier name ServiceNow domain endpoint A username and password Optional: enable two-way integration Important The Servicenow user details should have read permissions for the tables: sys_dictionary, sys_choice, sys_user, change_request Optional: enable two-way integration You can configure a two-way integration with ServiceNow incidents so that when state updates for the incident (resolved or closed), it triggers an update in the corresponding New Relic Issue state. Here are some important things to remember when configuring the two-way integration: The following steps are required to enable two-way integration: Check Allow two-way integration when you create the Notifier. Open and download this XML file(which includes the business rule for Incident Workflows). In the ServiceNow sidebar menu, go to System Definition > Business Rule. Click the menu icon in one of the column headers, select Import XML, and upload the XML file you downloaded. We create a New Relic API-key in the SNOW ‘api_key_credentials’ table. If you want two-way integration, the user used for setting the destination also needs write permissions to the table: api_key_credentials After you enable two-way integration, an incident state in ServiceNow changes to Resolved or Closed, and the corresponding workflow incident changes to Closed. Test your notifier to make sure everything is running smoothly and you are receiving your Alerts and Issues. Jira destination Using Jira as a notifier enables you to push valuable issues into a new Jira Cloud ticket. With two-way integration you can also make sure that state-updates are mirrored back to New Relic. Atlassian Jira notifiers need: Notifier name Jira url endpoint A username Jira API key After you enable two-way integration, an incident on Jira changes to Resolved or Closed, and the corresponding workflow incident changes to Closed. Finally, test your notifier to make sure everything is running smoothly and you are receiving your Alerts and Issues. If everything is connecting correctly, you will receive a ‘connection successful’ message.",

      "body": "Important This feature is a limited release. We’ve expanded anomaly detection coverage beyond your APM applications. Configure anomaly detection for your browser applications, mobile applications, infrastructure hosts, and nearly anything you want to monitor. Requirements Expanded anomaly detection is available as a limited beta. You can request access here. Why it matters When starting to configure alert conditions for a variety of applications and hosts, it can be difficult to know what you’ll want to be notified about ahead of time. Anomaly detection helps you distinguish between what’s typical performance in your system and where you’re starting to have trouble. Instead of creating your alert conditions manually, you can simply tell us what you want to monitor. Anomaly detection will help you identify baseline performance in your system and flags anomalous activity in your system. Get started with anomaly detection To get started with expanded anomaly detection: From one.newrelic.com, go to Alerts & AI > Proactive Detection > Settings. Click the Custom tab, and then click + Add a configuration. Select the account you want to use to record anomaly data, then select the workload or entities you’d like to monitor. Select the detection sensitivity. We recommend Low sensitivity so that you don’t see too many anomalies. Finally, name your configuration and save. Detect anomalies with a faceted NRQL query To detect anomalies with a faceted NRQL query: From one.newrelic.com, go to Alerts & AI > Proactive Detection > Settings. Click the Custom tab, and then click + Add a configuration. Click Use a query instead. You may need to select an account, if you have more than one. Add one or more queries with a FACET clause. Name the query and confirm the facets you want to monitor for anomalies. Select the detection sensitivity. We recommend Low sensitivity so that you don’t see too many anomalies. Finally, name the configuration and save. See your anomalies in one place When you set up anomaly detection, New Relic starts analyzing the golden signals of your entities and workloads. Anomalies appear in your activity feeds throughout New Relic One and the Anomalies tab as soon as they’re detected. Click any anomaly to get more detail about it, including analysis and context for the anomaly. Tip For this limited release, anomaly detection won’t generate notifications. However, you can configure a NRQL alert condition for the NrAiAnomaly event. To view anomalies, from one.newrelic.com, go to Alerts & AI > Issues & activity > Anomalies. Query anomaly data Detected anomalies are written to the NrAiAnomaly event in your NRDB account. You can learn more about this event and how to query it here. Reduce the number of detected anomalies If you’re seeing too many anomalies, the first step is to make sure your sensitivity level is set to Low. If it’s already set to Low, you can define specific thresholds to distinguish between normal and anomalous behavior. To define custom thresholds: From one.newrelic.com, go to Alerts & AI > Proactive Detection > Settings. Click the Custom tab and the configuration you want to modify. Select an entity or workload, and then change the sensitivity level. You can use custom sensitivity to define specific thresholds for different entity types.",

      "body": "With Applied Intelligence's Proactive Detection, anomalies from your APM-monitored applications are automatically surfaced in our activity streams and anomalies feed. Each anomaly can be clicked on to bring up an automatic analysis. You can have notifications for anomalies delivered in Slack, or you can set up a webhook to deliver messages when you need them. These events are available for querying, creating custom dashboards, and alerting. By creating a Proactive Detection configuration (a group of apps you’re interested in), you can then add this configuration as a source, and have anomalies automatically correlated with other data sources via Incident Intelligence. Requirements To use Proactive Detection, ensure you have: An APM agent installed for at least one applications. To receive notifications in Slack, you'll need to ask your IT administrator to install the Applied Intelligence application in your Slack workspace. For more on data limits, see Data limits. Why it matters With Proactive Detection, Applied Intelligence delivers insights about anomalies in your production system, along with an automatic analysis of the anomaly. It’s enabled automatically, at no additional cost. When an anomaly is detected, you can view it in the Applied Intelligence anomalies feed, or we'll send notifications directly to your Slack channel or a webhook. How it works Proactive Detection uses the following methods to detect anomalies in your app data: Proactive Detection monitors metric data reported by an APM agent, building a model of your typical application dynamics, and focuses on key golden signals: throughput, response time, and errors. If one of these golden signals shows anomalous behavior, the system flags it and tracks recovery to normal behavior. The system adapts to changes in your data, and continuously updates models based on new data. Automatically on: By default, Proactive Detection monitors all your APM applications, with no action required by you. When an anomaly is detected, it's automatically surfaced in various activity streams, the Applied Intelligence anomalies feed and is available for querying via NRQL. Receiving notifications: We send notifications when we detect anomalous changes in throughput, error rate, or response time. The notifications are sent to selected Slack channels, or sent via webhook. When the anomaly goes back to normal, a recovery message is sent. If you don't want to receive notifications, you still have access to the data via NRQL query. Anomaly analysis: For each anomaly, we provide a link in Slack to an analyze anomaly page. This page generates automatic insights into the anomaly. The page is also available from the anomalies tab, which lists recent anomalies. This page uses your existing APM and Proactive Detection data to provide explanations as to the cause of the anomaly. Activity stream: Inside various activity streams such as the New Relic One homepage, APM Summary page, Lookout and Explorer, you'll see relevant anomalies from your APM-monitored applications. Clicking on any of the anomaly events in the activity stream brings up the analysis page for that anomaly. Applications will not always generate anomalies, so it can be normal to not receive any detections. Set up notifications for Proactive Detection Proactive Detection is enabled automatically, at no additional cost. To receive notifications or to have a configuration (group of apps) that you can add as a source for Incident Intelligence, you will need to create a Proactive Detection configuration. You can create a configuration in the Proactive Detection UI: From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI. Under Proactive Detection, click Settings. Click Add a configuration. Input the following information into the form: Choose a name for your configuration that helps you easily identify it from others in your account. Select an account. Select up to 1,000 applications. Note that certain applications with low throughput might not be good candidates for Proactive Detection, as they can be more sensitive to smaller amounts of data fluctuation. Optional: select the golden signals you'd like to monitor for anomalies. Optional: connect to Incident Intelligence. Set up for Slack To use Proactive Detection with Slack: Select Slack. Choose which Slack channel receives notifications. You can select any existing public or private channel. This prompts the workflow to add the Applied Intelligence Slack application to your selected channel. To create a new channel, do that directly in Slack first. Tip If you experience an error when assigning Slack channels, make sure that the New Relic AI Slack application has been added to your Slack workspace. Save the configuration. You can modify the applications for each configuration at any time by selecting the configuration in the configuration table. Set up for webhooks To use Proactive Detection with webhooks: Select Webhook. Input the following information into the form: Provide the webhook URL. Provide optional custom headers. Choose to edit the custom payload, or enable using the default payload. Save the configuration. You can modify the applications for each configuration at any time by selecting the configuration in the configuration table. Set up without notifications To use Proactive Detection when you don't need to receive notifications: Select No notifications. Save the configuration. You can modify the applications for each configuration at any time by selecting the configuration in the configuration table. Mute notifications (Slack only) In Slack, detections coming from specific applications can be muted temporarily or permanently. The entire channel can also be muted temporarily. This is useful in the case of an incident or when the channel should otherwise not be interrupted. To mute in Slack, select Mute this app’s warnings or Mute all warnings, then select the duration. We will resume sending notifications for any detections once the muting duration has completed. Muting an application permanently removes it from the configuration. To add it back in, go to one.newrelic.com, in the top nav click Alerts & AI, then click Proactive Detection, and select the configuration to edit. Muting Proactive Detection notifications does not affect alerts. Use Proactive Detection Slack messages Each anomaly message has several key pieces of information you can use to learn more about and start troubleshooting the potential issue: The application name and a link to more information about it in New Relic One. The metric experiencing an anomaly and a link to its details in New Relic One. A graph of the metric over time to provide a visual understanding of the anomaly’s behavior and degree. An Analyze button that navigates to an analysis page in Applied Intelligence that identifies key attributes that are unique to the anomaly, anomalies found upstream or downstream, and any other relevant signals. Once an anomaly has returned to normal, we send a recovery notification with the option to provide feedback. Your feedback provides our development team with input to help us improve detection quality. In the case of feedback provided on throughput anomalies, an evaluation is run each hour based on feedback to fit a more suitable model. If we helped you, you can select Yes or No. View overview of anomalies In addition to notifications for anomalies that give you information via Slack or webhook, you can view more information about the anomalies in your environment via the Anomalies tab on the Alerts & AI Overview page. That tab provides a list of all the recent anomalies from every configuration in the selected account, and you can select an anomaly for a detailed analysis. Anomaly visibility settings Anomalies are displayed in various New Relic activity streams and in the Applied Intelligence anomalies feed. You can customize what is displayed using the anomaly visibility settings (for example, hiding throughput anomalies on an activity stream but keeping them in the anomalies feed). To find these settings: from Alerts & AI, under Proactive Detection, click Settings. Notes on using these settings: These settings are applied at the user level. Changes you make won’t affect others users in your organization. Regardless of these settings, the anomalies are still reported and available for NRQL querying. Details on these UI sections: AI overview and anomalies tab: Use the AI overview and anomalies tab setting to hide anomalies from the AI overview and anomalies tab setting. Please note you also can use filters specific to these views as well. Global activity stream: Use the global activity stream section to customize what anomalies are shown in the various New Relic activity streams, including the New Relic One homepage, APM Summary, and Lookout. Anomaly types: Use the check boxes here to hide specific types of anomalies. For example uncheck Web throughput and Non-web throughput anomalies to hide these types of anomalies from both the activity streams and the AI overview and anomalies tab. (Note they are still reported and available for querying.) Query anomaly data You can use NRQL to query and chart your Proactive Detection data using the NrAiAnomaly event. For example: FROM NrAiAnomaly SELECT * Important This data has previously been attached to the ProactiveDetection event. That event will be deprecated on April 7, 2021. If you use ProactiveDetection in your custom charts, you should convert those queries to using NrAiAnomaly. Here are important attributes attached to this event: Attribute Description closeTime timestamp The time when the anomaly ended. Example: 1615304100000. configurationType string The type of configuration monitoring the event. If at least one configuration is monitoring the entity, this is set to configuration. Otherwise, it's set to automatic. entity.accountId number The New Relic account ID to which the entity belongs. entity.domain number The domain of the entity (currently only APM but will change with future functionality). entity.guid string The GUID of the entity.

      "body": "BETA FEATURE This feature is currently in beta. With Incident Workflows, you identify the Policy you want to be alerted on. When the policy gets violated, the violation triggers the workflow, and violation attributes are transferred into the notification creation. Custom variables are violation-related properties you can use as part of the configuration of a workflow action. You can retrieve Information about the alert, condition, violation, and entity by using double curly brackets:: {{variable_name}}. Use custom variables in a filter statement To get information about the entity that violated a condition, you can use custom variables as part of the where statement of the query. For example, to get the state of the EC2 instance use: SELECT latest(ec2State) FROM ComputeSample where provider = 'Ec2Instance' where entityName = `{{entity.name}}' Copy This query returns a single value (for example, stopped), as the query only uses a single field. The variable entity.name is the identifier of the entity. You can use any other entity properties in the same way. Workflow data enrichment examples You can use custom variables to enrich your workflow data queries in different ways: Query for when application traffic drops There are times when you want to know when traffic to your application drops. You can use the { { entity.name}} variable in place of your application's name. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction WHERE appName = '{{entity.name}}' since 10 minutes ago Copy Query for transaction failures There are times when you want to know when your application transactions have failed. This query shows the latest HTTP status code responses filtered by the { { entity.name}} variable that violated your alert policy threshold. From Transaction select latest(httpResponseCode), average(duration) where appName = '{{entity.name}}' Copy Query for Kubernetes consumption overview Use a query like this to get the number of entities and their ingest times within a Kubernetes pod. By identifying what entities have large ingest times, you can begin to address that issue and find a potential remedy. SELECT uniqueCount(displayName), sum(nr.ingestTimeMs) from K8sServiceSample where entityName = '{{entity.name}}' since 1 hour ago.

Configure anomaly detection for your browser applications, mobile applications, infrastructure hosts, and nearly anything you want to monitor. Requirements Expanded anomaly detection is available as a limited beta. You can request access here. Why it matters When starting to configure alert conditions for a variety of applications and hosts, it can be difficult to know what you’ll want to be notified about ahead of time. Anomaly detection helps you distinguish between what’s typical performance in your system and where you’re starting to have trouble. Instead of creating your alert conditions manually, you can simply tell us what you want to monitor. Anomaly detection will help you identify baseline performance in your system and flags anomalous activity in your system. Get started with anomaly detection To get started with expanded anomaly detection: From one.newrelic.com, go to Alerts & AI > Proactive Detection > Settings. Click the Custom tab, and then click + Add a configuration. Select the account you want to use to record anomaly data, then select the workload or entities you’d like to monitor. Select the detection sensitivity. We recommend Low sensitivity so that you don’t see too many anomalies. Finally, name your configuration and save. Detect anomalies with a faceted NRQL query To detect anomalies with a faceted NRQL query: From one.newrelic.com, go to Alerts & AI > Proactive Detection > Settings. Click the Custom tab, and then click + Add a configuration. Click Use a query instead. You may need to select an account, if you have more than one. Add one or more queries with a FACET clause. Name the query and confirm the facets you want to monitor for anomalies. Select the detection sensitivity. We recommend Low sensitivity so that you don’t see too many anomalies. Finally, name the configuration and save. See your anomalies in one place When you set up anomaly detection, New Relic starts analyzing the golden signals of your entities and workloads. Anomalies appear in your activity feeds throughout New Relic One and the Anomalies tab as soon as they’re detected. Click any anomaly to get more detail about it, including analysis and context for the anomaly. Tip For this limited release, anomaly detection won’t generate notifications. However, you can configure a NRQL alert condition for the NrAiAnomaly event. To view anomalies, from one.newrelic.com, go to Alerts & AI > Issues & activity > Anomalies. Query anomaly data Detected anomalies are written to the NrAiAnomaly event in your NRDB account. You can learn more about this event and how to query it here. Reduce the number of detected anomalies If you’re seeing too many anomalies, the first step is to make sure your sensitivity level is set to Low. If it’s already set to Low, you can define specific thresholds to distinguish between normal and anomalous behavior. To define custom thresholds: From one.newrelic.com, go to Alerts & AI > Proactive Detection > Settings. Click the Custom tab and the configuration you want to modify. Select an entity or workload, and then change the sensitivity level. You can use custom sensitivity to define specific thresholds for different entity types.",

If you don't want to receive notifications, you still have access to the data via NRQL query. Anomaly analysis: For each anomaly, we provide a link in Slack to an analyze anomaly page. This page generates automatic insights into the anomaly. The page is also available from the anomalies tab, which lists recent anomalies. This page uses your existing APM and Proactive Detection data to provide explanations as to the cause of the anomaly. Activity stream: Inside various activity streams such as the New Relic One homepage, APM Summary page, Lookout and Explorer, you'll see relevant anomalies from your APM-monitored applications. Clicking on any of the anomaly events in the activity stream brings up the analysis page for that anomaly. Applications will not always generate anomalies, so it can be normal to not receive any detections. Set up notifications for Proactive Detection Proactive Detection is enabled automatically, at no additional cost. To receive notifications or to have a configuration (group of apps) that you can add as a source for Incident Intelligence, you will need to create a Proactive Detection configuration. You can create a configuration in the Proactive Detection UI: From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI. Under Proactive Detection, click Settings. Click Add a configuration. Input the following information into the form: Choose a name for your configuration that helps you easily identify it from others in your account. Select an account. Select up to 1,000 applications. Note that certain applications with low throughput might not be good candidates for Proactive Detection, as they can be more sensitive to smaller amounts of data fluctuation. Optional: select the golden signals you'd like to monitor for anomalies. Optional: connect to Incident Intelligence. Set up for Slack To use Proactive Detection with Slack: Select Slack. Choose which Slack channel receives notifications. You can select any existing public or private channel. This prompts the workflow to add the Applied Intelligence Slack application to your selected channel. To create a new channel, do that directly in Slack first. Tip If you experience an error when assigning Slack channels, make sure that the New Relic AI Slack application has been added to your Slack workspace. Save the configuration. You can modify the applications for each configuration at any time by selecting the configuration in the configuration table. Set up for webhooks To use Proactive Detection with webhooks: Select Webhook. Input the following information into the form: Provide the webhook URL. Provide optional custom headers. Choose to edit the custom payload, or enable using the default payload. Save the configuration. You can modify the applications for each configuration at any time by selecting the configuration in the configuration table. Set up without notifications To use Proactive Detection when you don't need to receive notifications: Select No notifications. Save the configuration. You can modify the applications for each configuration at any time by selecting the configuration in the configuration table. Mute notifications (Slack only) In Slack, detections coming from specific applications can be muted temporarily or permanently. The entire channel can also be muted temporarily. This is useful in the case of an incident or when the channel should otherwise not be interrupted. To mute in Slack, select Mute this app’s warnings or Mute all warnings, then select the duration. We will resume sending notifications for any detections once the muting duration has completed. Muting an application permanently removes it from the configuration. To add it back in, go to one.newrelic.com, in the top nav click Alerts & AI, then click Proactive Detection, and select the configuration to edit. Muting Proactive Detection notifications does not affect alerts. Use Proactive Detection Slack messages Each anomaly message has several key pieces of information you can use to learn more about and start troubleshooting the potential issue: The application name and a link to more information about it in New Relic One. The metric experiencing an anomaly and a link to its details in New Relic One. A graph of the metric over time to provide a visual understanding of the anomaly’s behavior and degree. An Analyze button that navigates to an analysis page in Applied Intelligence that identifies key attributes that are unique to the anomaly, anomalies found upstream or downstream, and any other relevant signals. Once an anomaly has returned to normal, we send a recovery notification with the option to provide feedback. Your feedback provides our development team with input to help us improve detection quality. In the case of feedback provided on throughput anomalies, an evaluation is run each hour based on feedback to fit a more suitable model. If we helped you, you can select Yes or No. View overview of anomalies In addition to notifications for anomalies that give you information via Slack or webhook, you can view more information about the anomalies in your environment via the Anomalies tab on the Alerts & AI Overview page. That tab provides a list of all the recent anomalies from every configuration in the selected account, and you can select an anomaly for a detailed analysis. Anomaly visibility settings Anomalies are displayed in various New Relic activity streams and in the Applied Intelligence anomalies feed. You can customize what is displayed using the anomaly visibility settings (for example, hiding throughput anomalies on an activity stream but keeping them in the anomalies feed). To find these settings: from Alerts & AI, under Proactive Detection, click Settings. Notes on using these settings: These settings are applied at the user level. Changes you make won’t affect others users in your organization. Regardless of these settings, the anomalies are still reported and available for NRQL querying. Details on these UI sections: AI overview and anomalies tab: Use the AI overview and anomalies tab setting to hide anomalies from the AI overview and anomalies tab setting. Please note you also can use filters specific to these views as well. Global activity stream: Use the global activity stream section to customize what anomalies are shown in the various New Relic activity streams, including the New Relic One homepage, APM Summary, and Lookout. Anomaly types: Use the check boxes here to hide specific types of anomalies. For example uncheck Web throughput and Non-web throughput anomalies to hide these types of anomalies from both the activity streams and the AI overview and anomalies tab. (Note they are still reported and available for querying.) Query anomaly data You can use NRQL to query and chart your Proactive Detection data using the NrAiAnomaly event. For example: FROM NrAiAnomaly SELECT * Important This data has previously been attached to the ProactiveDetection event. That event will be deprecated on April 7, 2021. If you use ProactiveDetection in your custom charts, you should convert those queries to using NrAiAnomaly. Here are important attributes attached to this event: Attribute Description closeTime timestamp The time when the anomaly ended. Example: 1615304100000. configurationType string The type of configuration monitoring the event. If at least one configuration is monitoring the entity, this is set to configuration. Otherwise, it's set to automatic. entity.accountId number The New Relic account ID to which the entity belongs. entity.domain number The domain of the entity (currently only APM but will change with future functionality). entity.guid string The GUID of the entity.

      "body": "With Applied Intelligence's Proactive Detection, anomalies from your APM-monitored applications are automatically surfaced in our activity streams and anomalies feed. Each anomaly can be clicked on to bring up an automatic analysis. You can have notifications for anomalies delivered in Slack, or you can set up a webhook to deliver messages when you need them. These events are available for querying, creating custom dashboards, and alerting. By creating a Proactive Detection configuration (a group of apps you’re interested in), you can then add this configuration as a source, and have anomalies automatically correlated with other data sources via Incident Intelligence. Requirements To use Proactive Detection, ensure you have: An APM agent installed for at least one applications. To receive notifications in Slack, you'll need to ask your IT administrator to install the Applied Intelligence application in your Slack workspace. For more on data limits, see Data limits. Why it matters With Proactive Detection, Applied Intelligence delivers insights about anomalies in your production system, along with an automatic analysis of the anomaly. It’s enabled automatically, at no additional cost. When an anomaly is detected, you can view it in the Applied Intelligence anomalies feed, or we'll send notifications directly to your Slack channel or a webhook. How it works Proactive Detection uses the following methods to detect anomalies in your app data: Proactive Detection monitors metric data reported by an APM agent, building a model of your typical application dynamics, and focuses on key golden signals: throughput, response time, and errors. If one of these golden signals shows anomalous behavior, the system flags it and tracks recovery to normal behavior. The system adapts to changes in your data, and continuously updates models based on new data. Automatically on: By default, Proactive Detection monitors all your APM applications, with no action required by you. When an anomaly is detected, it's automatically surfaced in various activity streams, the Applied Intelligence anomalies feed and is available for querying via NRQL. Receiving notifications: We send notifications when we detect anomalous changes in throughput, error rate, or response time. The notifications are sent to selected Slack channels, or sent via webhook. When the anomaly goes back to normal, a recovery message is sent. If you don't want to receive notifications, you still have access to the data via NRQL query. Anomaly analysis: For each anomaly, we provide a link in Slack to an analyze anomaly page.

      "body": "Applied Intelligence (AI) is our AIOps solution for DevOps, site reliability engineers, and on-call teams. At its core, Applied Intelligence helps you find, troubleshoot, and resolve problems more quickly. Specifically, it’s a hybrid machine learning engine that reduces alert noise, correlates incidents, and automatically detects anomalies. By applying machine learning to your data and feedback, Applied Intelligence is designed to improve functionality and deliver smarter context over time. After connecting your data sources to Applied Intelligence, it looks for potential problems and improves based on your feedback. Why use Applied Intelligence? How you respond to an incident can mean thousands of dollars or clicks for your company. Applied Intelligence helps you solve problems faster. Feature Description Troubleshoot and respond to incidents Our solution helps you understand your incidents and gives you ideas for what to do next. Here are a few examples: Automatically classifies incidents based on the golden signals of site reliability engineering. Identifies entities in your stack that may relate to the underlying issue. Suggests responses for incidents based on historical context. Less noise, more focus As tools and systems become more complex, alert noise can overwhelm DevOps and SRE teams. Applied Intelligence correlates related incidents and suppresses noise, so you're only notified when human action is required. Incidents with a hybrid approach Applied Intelligence streamlines your incidents by combining its built-in inputs with your knowledge and feedback. Over time, the system delivers more accurate insights. For example: Our correlation and classification engine adjusts based on your feedback. The system automatically suggests new correlation rules based on your production data. You can create custom logic using the decision builder. Automatic anomaly detection Applied Intelligence provides automatic anomaly detection on all your APM-monitored applications. We detect anomalies in throughput, latency, and error rate, with no action required from you. Benefits include: No setup required. See anomalies surfaced automatically in the anomalies feed. See them in various New Relic activity streams (for example, on the New Relic One home page). Ability to run NRQL queries of anomalies and create custom dashboards with that data. Determine root causes with Incident Intelligence As part of Applied Intelligence, Incident Intelligence helps you correlate incident events and reduce noise in your environment. With it, you can get an overview of all your issues, see suggested responders, and configure your own correlation logic. To get started, see Incident Intelligence. Find unknowns with Proactive Detection Another feature of Applied Intelligence is Proactive Detection. Proactive Detection is, by default, always on and detecting anomalies. These anomalies are surfaced in the Applied Intelligence anomalies feed, New Relic One activity streams, and can be queried, alerted on, and added to dashboards. Anomalies can be sent to Slack or via webhooks, and/or added as a source for Incident Intelligence correlation and issue notification. Proactive Detection also provides automatic analysis of anomalies and alerts via the analysis page. To get started, see Proactive Detection.",

      "body": "BETA FEATURE This feature is currently in beta. With Incident Workflows, you identify the Policy you want to be alerted on. When the policy gets violated, the violation triggers the workflow, and violation attributes are transferred into the notification creation. Custom variables are violation-related properties you can use as part of the configuration of a workflow action. You can retrieve Information about the alert, condition, violation, and entity by using double curly brackets:: {{variable_name}}. Use custom variables in a filter statement To get information about the entity that violated a condition, you can use custom variables as part of the where statement of the query. For example, to get the state of the EC2 instance use: SELECT latest(ec2State) FROM ComputeSample where provider = 'Ec2Instance' where entityName = `{{entity.name}}' Copy This query returns a single value (for example, stopped), as the query only uses a single field. The variable entity.name is the identifier of the entity. You can use any other entity properties in the same way. Workflow data enrichment examples You can use custom variables to enrich your workflow data queries in different ways: Query for when application traffic drops There are times when you want to know when traffic to your application drops. You can use the { { entity.name}} variable in place of your application's name. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction WHERE appName = '{{entity.name}}' since 10 minutes ago Copy Query for transaction failures There are times when you want to know when your application transactions have failed. This query shows the latest HTTP status code responses filtered by the { { entity.name}} variable that violated your alert policy threshold. From Transaction select latest(httpResponseCode), average(duration) where appName = '{{entity.name}}' Copy Query for Kubernetes consumption overview Use a query like this to get the number of entities and their ingest times within a Kubernetes pod. By identifying what entities have large ingest times, you can begin to address that issue and find a potential remedy. SELECT uniqueCount(displayName), sum(nr.ingestTimeMs) from K8sServiceSample where entityName = '{{entity.name}}' since 1 hour ago.

      "body": "Important This feature is a limited release. We’ve expanded anomaly detection coverage beyond your APM applications. Configure anomaly detection for your browser applications, mobile applications, infrastructure hosts, and nearly anything you want to monitor. Requirements Expanded anomaly detection is available as a limited beta. You can request access here. Why it matters When starting to configure alert conditions for a variety of applications and hosts, it can be difficult to know what you’ll want to be notified about ahead of time. Anomaly detection helps you distinguish between what’s typical performance in your system and where you’re starting to have trouble. Instead of creating your alert conditions manually, you can simply tell us what you want to monitor. Anomaly detection will help you identify baseline performance in your system and flags anomalous activity in your system. Get started with anomaly detection To get started with expanded anomaly detection: From one.newrelic.com, go to Alerts & AI > Proactive Detection > Settings. Click the Custom tab, and then click + Add a configuration. Select the account you want to use to record anomaly data, then select the workload or entities you’d like to monitor. Select the detection sensitivity. We recommend Low sensitivity so that you don’t see too many anomalies. Finally, name your configuration and save. Detect anomalies with a faceted NRQL query To detect anomalies with a faceted NRQL query: From one.newrelic.com, go to Alerts & AI > Proactive Detection > Settings. Click the Custom tab, and then click + Add a configuration. Click Use a query instead. You may need to select an account, if you have more than one. Add one or more queries with a FACET clause. Name the query and confirm the facets you want to monitor for anomalies. Select the detection sensitivity. We recommend Low sensitivity so that you don’t see too many anomalies. Finally, name the configuration and save. See your anomalies in one place When you set up anomaly detection, New Relic starts analyzing the golden signals of your entities and workloads. Anomalies appear in your activity feeds throughout New Relic One and the Anomalies tab as soon as they’re detected. Click any anomaly to get more detail about it, including analysis and context for the anomaly. Tip For this limited release, anomaly detection won’t generate notifications. However, you can configure a NRQL alert condition for the NrAiAnomaly event. To view anomalies, from one.newrelic.com, go to Alerts & AI > Issues & activity > Anomalies. Query anomaly data Detected anomalies are written to the NrAiAnomaly event in your NRDB account. You can learn more about this event and how to query it here. Reduce the number of detected anomalies If you’re seeing too many anomalies, the first step is to make sure your sensitivity level is set to Low. If it’s already set to Low, you can define specific thresholds to distinguish between normal and anomalous behavior. To define custom thresholds: From one.newrelic.com, go to Alerts & AI > Proactive Detection > Settings. Click the Custom tab and the configuration you want to modify. Select an entity or workload, and then change the sensitivity level. You can use custom sensitivity to define specific thresholds for different entity types.",

      "body": "Applied Intelligence (AI) is our AIOps solution for DevOps, site reliability engineers, and on-call teams. At its core, Applied Intelligence helps you find, troubleshoot, and resolve problems more quickly. Specifically, it’s a hybrid machine learning engine that reduces alert noise, correlates incidents, and automatically detects anomalies. By applying machine learning to your data and feedback, Applied Intelligence is designed to improve functionality and deliver smarter context over time. After connecting your data sources to Applied Intelligence, it looks for potential problems and improves based on your feedback. Why use Applied Intelligence? How you respond to an incident can mean thousands of dollars or clicks for your company. Applied Intelligence helps you solve problems faster. Feature Description Troubleshoot and respond to incidents Our solution helps you understand your incidents and gives you ideas for what to do next. Here are a few examples: Automatically classifies incidents based on the golden signals of site reliability engineering. Identifies entities in your stack that may relate to the underlying issue. Suggests responses for incidents based on historical context. Less noise, more focus As tools and systems become more complex, alert noise can overwhelm DevOps and SRE teams. Applied Intelligence correlates related incidents and suppresses noise, so you're only notified when human action is required. Incidents with a hybrid approach Applied Intelligence streamlines your incidents by combining its built-in inputs with your knowledge and feedback. Over time, the system delivers more accurate insights. For example: Our correlation and classification engine adjusts based on your feedback. The system automatically suggests new correlation rules based on your production data. You can create custom logic using the decision builder. Automatic anomaly detection Applied Intelligence provides automatic anomaly detection on all your APM-monitored applications. We detect anomalies in throughput, latency, and error rate, with no action required from you. Benefits include: No setup required. See anomalies surfaced automatically in the anomalies feed.

      "body": "BETA FEATURE This feature is currently in beta. With incident workflow control when and where you want to receive notifications about issues, tunnel the right information to the relevant person or team, and enrich your issue's notifications with additional New Relic data. Add a Workflow The Workflows feature is located under the Alerts & AI menu. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left navigation under Enrich and Respond click Workflow, then click Add a workflow. Tip The maximum workflows you can add per environment is 1000 Name your workflow. This field is mandatory and needs to be unique Workflows filters the issues you want to send to the relevant destination. You can send all issues by selecting Send all issues or you can build a query to filter the right issues. Build a query by selecting an attribute, operator and value/s to narrow down the right issues you want to be passed on. Optional: Enrichments Enrichments can give additional context on alert notifications by adding NRQL query results to them The workflows enrich tool is similar to the query builder. The NRQL query's results are included in the notification message. If you create queries for your workflows, they run in real time and the query results are the value of the enricher. You can save any valid query into your workflow, even if they return an empty result, but you must run the query before saving the enrichment. You can also query with issue-specific variables; for example {{entities.ids}} Note: the query name needs to be unique because you will use the name to decide how to include the result in the payload of the notification that will be sent by the workflow. Important The maximum number of enrichments per workflow is 10. The maximum number of variables an enrichment can contain is 1. Notifier In order to save and activate a Workflow you need to include a notifier. Setting up a notifier requires having a notification destination configured. You can either set it up through the Destination menu item, or through the Create new destination item in the destination selection drop down in each destination channel screen. A notification destination includes the credentials required to send a notification to a third party platform and an option to customize the message sent by mapping fields from our issues to fields in the destination platform. Note: each notifier allows for extensive customization tailored to your needs. Examples can be found below Click “update message” once completing the notifier requirements, then complete the workflow by clicking activate. Tip In any destination channel, start typing and a variable menu will open up. You will see the names of the variables, that at runtime will be replaced with the variable’s value/s. In order to use the enrichers’ results use their name. Variables To get information about the entity that violated a condition, you can use variables as part of the where statement of the query. For example, to get a list of error logs for a specific issue use: FROM log SELECT * where service.name = {{ entities.names }} AND level = ‘error’ LIMIT 10 Copy This query returns the last 10 error logs for each notification sent for the entities that are associated with the issue. This would give you additional context as to what may have gone wrong and likely help you solve the issue faster. You can use any other entity properties in the same way. An example of how to populate the field Important Note: In order to attain the value in the JSON format, you must specify the word JSON. Otherwise, you will get a comma delimited list (e.g. {{ json entities.Ids}} ). For more variable options to find additional context, a comprehensive list of variables can be found here: Key Display Name (First word will be used for grouping) accumulations.origin Issue Origin accumulations.source Issue Source activatedAt Issue Activated At dataMLModules.components Machine Learning Components dataMLModules.suggestedResponders Machine Learning Suggested Responder dataMLModules.goldenSignals Machine Learning Golden Signals annotations.description Issue Description annotations.title Issue Title closedAt Issue ClosedAt createdAt Issue CreatedAt entities.ids Impacted Entities IDs entities.types Impacted Entities Types entities.names Impacted Entities Names entities.kinds Impacted Entities Kinds incidentIds Incident IDs isCorrelated Issue Is Correlated issueId Issue ID labels.accountIds Issue Environment Associated Account ID labels.aggregationKeys Labels Alerts Aggregation Key labels.conditionNames Labels Alert Condition Names labels.originalAccountIds Labels Account IDs labels.policyIds Labels Alert Policy IDs labels.policyNames Labels Alert Policy Names priority Issue Priority state Issue State status Issue Status totalIncidents Incident Count triggerEvent Issue Notification Trigger Event triggeredAt Issue Triggered At updatedAt Issue Updated At workflowName Workflow Name Destinations Destinations are unique identifiers and credentials for third-party systems. The destination you choose is the location where we send notifications. Destinations are located under the Alerts and AI menu. Add a Destination Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left navigation under Enrich and Respond , then click Destinations. Select one of the destination types at the top of the destinations management screen. Webhook destination Use the webhook notifier to send notification messages to any endpoint. The webhook configuration requires: A unique destination name The endpoint url of the target application Authorization which can be ‘basic authentication or a ‘bearer token’ Basic authentication allows users to provide the username and password associated with your HTTP endpoint, which will populate in the header. Bearer token involves security tokens, where the token is a cryptic string. The user must send this token in the authorization header when requesting protected resources To test your webhook, click ‘test connection’ on the bottom right. There’s a retry mechanism that is triggered a few times with exponential backoff for a couple of minutes once an error occurs. If we reach the retry limit, the Webhook will get auto-disabled. ServiceNow incidents destination Using ServiceNow as a notifier enables you to push valuable issues into new ServiceNow incidents. With two-way integrations, you can also make sure that status updates of ServiceNow incidents are mirrored back to New Relic. The ServiceNow notifier requires: Unique notifier name ServiceNow domain endpoint A username and password Optional: enable two-way integration Important The Servicenow user details should have read permissions for the tables: sys_dictionary, sys_choice, sys_user, change_request Optional: enable two-way integration You can configure a two-way integration with ServiceNow incidents so that when state updates for the incident (resolved or closed), it triggers an update in the corresponding New Relic Issue state. Here are some important things to remember when configuring the two-way integration: The following steps are required to enable two-way integration: Check Allow two-way integration when you create the Notifier. Open and download this XML file(which includes the business rule for Incident Workflows). In the ServiceNow sidebar menu, go to System Definition > Business Rule. Click the menu icon in one of the column headers, select Import XML, and upload the XML file you downloaded. We create a New Relic API-key in the SNOW ‘api_key_credentials’ table. If you want two-way integration, the user used for setting the destination also needs write permissions to the table: api_key_credentials After you enable two-way integration, an incident state in ServiceNow changes to Resolved or Closed, and the corresponding workflow incident changes to Closed. Test your notifier to make sure everything is running smoothly and you are receiving your Alerts and Issues. Jira destination Using Jira as a notifier enables you to push valuable issues into a new Jira Cloud ticket. With two-way integration you can also make sure that state-updates are mirrored back to New Relic. Atlassian Jira notifiers need: Notifier name Jira url endpoint A username Jira API key After you enable two-way integration, an incident on Jira changes to Resolved or Closed, and the corresponding workflow incident changes to Closed. Finally, test your notifier to make sure everything is running smoothly and you are receiving your Alerts and Issues. If everything is connecting correctly, you will receive a ‘connection successful’ message.",

      "body": "Important This feature is a limited release. We’ve expanded anomaly detection coverage beyond your APM applications. Configure anomaly detection for your browser applications, mobile applications, infrastructure hosts, and nearly anything you want to monitor. Requirements Expanded anomaly detection is available as a limited beta. You can request access here. Why it matters When starting to configure alert conditions for a variety of applications and hosts, it can be difficult to know what you’ll want to be notified about ahead of time. Anomaly detection helps you distinguish between what’s typical performance in your system and where you’re starting to have trouble. Instead of creating your alert conditions manually, you can simply tell us what you want to monitor. Anomaly detection will help you identify baseline performance in your system and flags anomalous activity in your system. Get started with anomaly detection To get started with expanded anomaly detection: From one.newrelic.com, go to Alerts & AI > Proactive Detection > Settings. Click the Custom tab, and then click + Add a configuration. Select the account you want to use to record anomaly data, then select the workload or entities you’d like to monitor. Select the detection sensitivity. We recommend Low sensitivity so that you don’t see too many anomalies. Finally, name your configuration and save. Detect anomalies with a faceted NRQL query To detect anomalies with a faceted NRQL query: From one.newrelic.com, go to Alerts & AI > Proactive Detection > Settings. Click the Custom tab, and then click + Add a configuration. Click Use a query instead. You may need to select an account, if you have more than one. Add one or more queries with a FACET clause. Name the query and confirm the facets you want to monitor for anomalies. Select the detection sensitivity. We recommend Low sensitivity so that you don’t see too many anomalies. Finally, name the configuration and save. See your anomalies in one place When you set up anomaly detection, New Relic starts analyzing the golden signals of your entities and workloads. Anomalies appear in your activity feeds throughout New Relic One and the Anomalies tab as soon as they’re detected. Click any anomaly to get more detail about it, including analysis and context for the anomaly. Tip For this limited release, anomaly detection won’t generate notifications. However, you can configure a NRQL alert condition for the NrAiAnomaly event. To view anomalies, from one.newrelic.com, go to Alerts & AI > Issues & activity > Anomalies. Query anomaly data Detected anomalies are written to the NrAiAnomaly event in your NRDB account. You can learn more about this event and how to query it here. Reduce the number of detected anomalies If you’re seeing too many anomalies, the first step is to make sure your sensitivity level is set to Low. If it’s already set to Low, you can define specific thresholds to distinguish between normal and anomalous behavior. To define custom thresholds: From one.newrelic.com, go to Alerts & AI > Proactive Detection > Settings. Click the Custom tab and the configuration you want to modify. Select an entity or workload, and then change the sensitivity level. You can use custom sensitivity to define specific thresholds for different entity types.",

      "body": "You can use NRQL queries to create alert conditions. Once you've defined your signal, you can further define your warning and critical threshold levels. This determines when an alerts violation is created. Read on to learn more about how to do this. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Click NRQL, and then Next, define thresholds. Tip For more information on key concepts relating to NRQL alert conditions and streaming alerts, see Streaming alerts: key terms and concepts. Create a NRQL alert condition To create a NRQL alert condition for a policy: On one.newrelic.com, in the header click Alerts & AI, then in the left sidebar click Policies. Select an existing policy or click New alert policy to create a new policy. Click Add a condition. Under Select a product click NRQL, and then click Next, define thresholds. Create a condition from a chart You can use a chart to create a NRQL alert condition. To create a NRQL alerts condition from a chart, click the chart menu , then click Create alert condition. Once you've named and customized your condition, you can add it to an existing policy or create a new one. Caution A small number of our older charts don't include the option to create an alert condition. NRQL alert syntax Here's the basic syntax for creating all NRQL alert conditions. The FACET clause is required for outlier threshold types. It's optional for static and baseline. SELECT function(attribute) FROM Event WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Copy Clause Notes SELECT function(attribute) Required Supported functions that return numbers include: apdex average count latest max min percentage percentile sum uniqueCount Tip If you use the percentile aggregator in a faceted alert condition with many facets, this may cause the following error to appear: An error occurred while fetching chart data. If you see this error, use average instead. FROM data type Required Only one data type can be targeted. Supported data types: Event Metric (RAW data points will be returned) WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Use the WHERE clause to specify a series of one or more conditions. All the operators are supported. FACET attribute Required for outlier conditions Include an optional FACET clause in your NRQL syntax depending on the threshold type: static or baseline. Use the FACET clause to separate your results by attribute and alert on each attribute independently. No LIMIT clause is allowed, but all queries will receive the maximum number of facets possible. Faceted queries can return a maximum of 5000 values for static and baseline conditions and a maximum of 500 values for outlier conditions. Important If the query returns more than the maximum number of values, the alert condition can't be created. If you create the condition and the query returns more than this number later, the alert will fail. Modify your query so that it returns a fewer number of values. Reformatting incompatible NRQL Some elements of NRQL used in charts don’t make sense in the streaming context of alerts. Here’s a list of the most common incompatible elements and suggestions for reformatting a NRQL alert query to achieve the same effect. Element Notes SINCE and UNTIL Example: SELECT percentile(largestContentfulPaint, 75) FROM PageViewTiming WHERE (appId = 837807) SINCE yesterday Copy NRQL Alerting produces a never-ending stream of windowed query results, so the SINCE and UNTIL keywords to scope the query to a point in time are not compatible. As a convenience, we automatically strip SINCE and UNTIL from a query when creating a NRQL Alert Condition from the context of a chart. TIMESERIES In NRQL queries, the TIMESERIES clause is used to return data as a time series broken out by a specified period of time. For NRQL alerts, the equivalent property of a signal is the aggregation window. histogram() The histogram() aggregation function is used to generate histograms. histogram() is not compatible with NRQL alerting: histogram aggregations can not be formatted as a time series. To create an alert from a portion of a histogram (e.g. 95th percentile), use the percentile() aggregation function. Multiple Aggregation Functions Each alert condition can only target a single aggregated stream of data. To alert on multiple streams simultaneously, you’ll need to decompose them into individual conditions within the same policy. Original Query: SELECT count(foo), average(bar), max(baz) from Transaction Copy Decomposed: SELECT count(foo) from Transaction SELECT average(bar) from Transaction SELECT max(baz) from Transaction Copy COMPARE WITH The COMPARE WITH clause is used to compare the values for two different time ranges. This type of query is incompatible with NRQL alerting. We recommend using a Baseline Alert Condition to dynamically detect deviations for a particular signal. SLIDE BY The SLIDE BY clause supports a feature known as sliding windows. With sliding windows, SLIDE BY data is gathered into \"windows\" of time that overlap with each other. These windows can help to smooth out line graphs with a lot of variation in cases where the rolling aggregate (such as a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. Sliding windows are not currently supported in NRQL alerts. LIMIT In NRQL queries, the LIMIT clause is used to control the amount of data a query returns, either the maximum number of facet values returned by FACET queries or the maximum number of items returned by SELECT * queries. LIMIT is not compatible with NRQL alerting: evaluation is always performed on the full result set. NRQL alert threshold examples Here are some common use cases for NRQL alert conditions. These queries will work for static and baseline threshold types. The outlier threshold type will require additional FACET clauses. Alert on specific segments of your data Create constrained alerts that target a specific segment of your data, such as a few key customers or a range of data. Use the WHERE clause to define those conditions. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction WHERE account_id in (91290, 102021, 20230) Copy SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction WHERE name LIKE 'Controller/checkout/%' Copy Alert on Nth percentile of your data Create alerts when an Nth percentile of your data hits a specified threshold; for example, maintaining SLA service levels. Since we evaluate the NRQL query in one-minute time windows, percentiles will be calculated for each minute separately. SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentile(databaseDuration, 75) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on max, min, avg of your data Create alerts when your data hits a certain maximum, minimum, or average; for example, ensuring that a duration or response time does not pass a certain threshold. SELECT max(duration) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on a percentage of your data Create alerts when a proportion of your data goes above or below a certain threshold. SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE duration > 2) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE httpResponseCode = '500') FROM Transaction Copy Alert on Apdex with any T-value Create alerts on Apdex, applying your own T-value for certain transactions. For example, get an alert notification when your Apdex for a T-value of 500ms on transactions for production apps goes below 0.8. SELECT apdex(duration, t:0.5) FROM Transaction WHERE appName like '%prod%' Copy Alert conditions and query order of operations By default, the aggregation window is 1 minute, but you can change the window to suit your needs. Whatever the aggregation window, New Relic will collect data for that window using the function in the NRQL alert condition’s query. The query is parsed and executed by our systems in the following order: FROM clause – which event type needs to be grabbed? WHERE clause – what can be filtered out? SELECT clause – what information needs to be returned from the now-filtered data set? Example: null value returned Let's say this is your alert condition query: SELECT count(*) FROM SyntheticCheck WHERE monitorName = 'My Cool Monitor' AND result = 'FAILURE' Copy If there are no failures for the aggregation window: The system will execute the FROM clause by grabbing all SyntheticCheck events on your account. Then it will execute the WHERE clause to filter through those events by looking only for the ones that match the monitor name and result specified. If there are still events left to scan through after completing the FROM and WHERE operations, the SELECT clause will be executed. If there are no remaining events, the SELECT clause will not be executed. This means that aggregators like count() and uniqueCount() will never return a zero value. When there is a count of 0, the SELECT clause is ignored and no data is returned, resulting in a value of NULL. Example: zero value returned If you have a data source delivering legitimate numeric zeroes, the query will return zero values and not null values. Let's say this is your alert condition query, and that MyCoolEvent is an attribute that can sometimes return a zero value. SELECT average(MyCoolAttribute) FROM MyCoolEvent Copy If, in the aggregation window being evaluated, there's at least one instance of MyCoolEvent and if the average value of all MyCoolAttribute attributes from that window is equal to zero, then a 0 value will be returned. If there are no MyCoolEvent events during that minute, then a NULL will be returned due to the order of operations. Tip For more information about this topic, you can check out our blog post on troubleshooting for zero versus null values. Tip You can determine how null values will be handled by adjusting loss of signal and gap filling settings in the Alert Conditions UI. Tip You can avoid NULL values entirely with a query order of operations shortcut. Do this by using a filter sub-clause, then including all filter elements within that sub-clause. The main body of the query will run and return data, at which point the SELECT clause will then run and apply the filter elements. The query will return a value of 0 if the filter elements result in no matching data. Here's an example: SELECT filter(count(*), WHERE result = 'SUCCESS' AND monitorName = 'My Favorite Monitor') FROM SyntheticCheck Copy Nested aggregation NRQL alerts Nested aggregation queries are a powerful way to query your data. However, they have a few restrictions that are important to note. Nested queries with a non-faceted innermost query are not currently supported Without a FACET, the inner query produces a single result, giving the outer query nothing to aggregate. If you're using a nested query, make sure your inner query is faceted. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu) ​​​​​ Copy Queries at all levels must have the same aggregation window size With an alert aggregation window of 1 minute, the inner query would produce two smaller windows of 30 seconds. In theory, these two windows could be aggregated by the outer query. However, this is not currently supported. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu TIMESERIES 30 seconds)​​ Copy Signal loss is not yet supported for nested queries For more information on signal loss, see NerdGraph API: Loss of signal and gap filling. Nested queries containing 'WITH METRIC_FORMAT' in the inner query are not currently supported You can't use a nested query containing the WITH METRIC_FORMAT in the inner query to create NRQL alert conditions. NRQL condition creation tips Here are some tips for creating and using a NRQL condition: Topic Tips Condition threshold types NRQL condition threshold types include static, baseline, and outlier. Create a description For NRQL conditions, you can create a custom description to add to each violation. Descriptions can be enhanced with variable substitution based on metadata in the specific violation. For details, see Description Query results Queries must return a number. The condition evaluates the returned number against the thresholds you've set. Time period As with all alert conditions, NRQL conditions evaluate one single minute at a time. The implicit SINCE ... UNTIL clause specifying which minute to evaluate is controlled by your Evaluation offset setting. Since very recent data may be incomplete, you may want to query data from 3 minutes ago or longer, especially for: Applications that run on multiple hosts. SyntheticCheck data: Timeouts can take 3 minutes, so 5 minutes or more is recommended. Also, if a query will generate intermittent data, consider using the sum of query results option. Lost signal threshold (loss of signal detection) You can use loss of signal detection to alert on when your data (a telemetry signal) should be considered lost. A signal loss can indicate that a service or entity is no longer online or that a periodic job failed to run. You can also use this to make sure that violations for sporadic data, such as error counts, are closed when no signal is coming in. Advanced signal settings These settings give you options for better handling continuous, streaming data signals that may sometimes be missing. These settings include the aggregation window, the evaluation offset, and an option for filling data gaps. For more on using these, see Advanced signal settings. Condition settings Use the Condition settings to: Create a concise, descriptive condition name. Provide a custom violation description for the condition that will be included in violations and notifications. Add the runbook URL to include your organization's procedures for handling incidents. You may also add this information to the custom violation description. Limits on conditions See the maximum values. Health status NRQL alert conditions don't affect an entity's health status display. Examples For more information, see: Expected NRQL syntax Examples of NRQL condition queries Alert threshold types When you create a NRQL alert, you can choose from different types of thresholds: NRQL alert threshold types Description Static This is the simplest type of NRQL threshold. It allows you to create a condition based on a NRQL query that returns a numeric value. Optional: Include a FACET clause. Baseline (Dynamic) Uses a self-adjusting condition based on the past behavior of the monitored values. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type. Outlier Looks for group behavior and values that are outliers from those groups. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type, but requires a FACET clause. Sum of query results (limited or intermittent data) Important Available only for static (basic) threshold types. If a query returns intermittent or limited data, it may be difficult to set a meaningful threshold. Missing or limited data will sometimes generate false positives or false negatives. You can use loss of signal, aggregation duration, and gap filling settings to minimize these false notifications. To avoid this problem when using the static threshold type, you can set the selector to sum of query results. This lets you set the alert on an aggregated sum instead of a value from a single harvest cycle. Up to two hours of one-minute data checks can be aggregated. The duration you select determines the width of the rolling sum and the preview chart will update accordingly. Set the loss of signal threshold Loss of signal occurs when no data matches the NRQL condition over a specific period of time. You can set your loss of signal threshold duration and and also what happens when the threshold is crossed. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Loss of signal is only available for NRQL conditions. You may also manage these settings using the GraphQL API (recommended), or the REST API. Go here for specific GraphQL API examples. Loss of signal settings: Loss of signal settings include a time duration and two possible actions. Signal loss expiration time UI label: Signal is lost after: GraphQL Node: expiration.expirationDuration Expiration duration is a timer that starts and resets when we receive a data point in the streaming alerts pipeline. If we don't receive another data point before your 'expiration time' expires, we consider that signal to be lost. This can be because no data is being sent to New Relic or the WHERE clause of your NRQL query is filtering that data out before it is streamed to the alerts pipeline. The loss of signal expiration time is independent of the threshold duration and triggers as soon as the timer expires. The maximum expiration duration is 48 hours. This is helpful when monitoring for the execution of infrequent jobs. The minimum is 30 seconds, but we recommend using at least 3-5 minutes. Loss of signal actions Once a signal is considered lost, you can close open violations, open new violations, or both. Close all current open violations: This closes all open violations that are related to a specific signal. It won't necessarily close all violations for a condition. If you're alerting on an ephemeral service, or on a sporadic signal, you'll want to choose this action to ensure that violations are closed properly. The GraphQL node name for this is \"closeViolationsOnExpiration\" Open new violations: This will open a new violation when the signal is considered lost. These violations will indicate that they are due to a loss of signal. Based on your incident preferences, this should trigger a notification. The graphQL node name for this is \"openViolationOnExpiration\" When you enable both actions, we'll close all open violations first, and then open a new violation for loss of signal. To create a NRQL alert configured with loss of signal detection in the UI: For a policy, when you create a condition, under Select a product, click NRQL, then click Next, define thresholds. Write a NRQL query that returns the values you want to alert on. For Threshold type, select Static or Baseline. Click + Add lost signal threshold, then set the signal expiration duration time in minutes or seconds in the Signal is lost after field. Choose what you want to happen when the signal is lost. You can check one or both of Close all current open violations and Open new \"lost signal\" violation. These control how loss of signal violations will be handled for the condition. Make sure you name your condition before you save it. Violations open due to loss of signal close when the signal comes back. Newly opened lost signal violations will close immediately when new data is evaluated. the condition they belong to expires. By default, conditions expire after 3 days. you manually close the violation with the Close all current open violations option. Tip Loss of signal detection doesn't work on NRQL queries that use nested aggregation or sub-queries. Advanced signal settings When creating a NRQL alert condition, the advanced signal settings gives you better control over streaming alert data and helps you avoid false alarms. When creating a NRQL condition, there are several advanced signal settings: Aggregation window Evaluation offset Fill data gaps To read an explanation of what these settings are and how they relate to each other, see Streaming alerts concepts. Below are instructions and tips on how to configure them. Aggregation window You can set the aggregation window duration to choose how long data is accumulated in a streaming time window before it's aggregated. You can set it to anything between one second and 15 minutes. The default is one minute. Tip Baseline alert condition thresholds don't support editing the aggregation window. They use the 1 minute default. Evaluation offset You can adjust the evaluation offset to coordinate our streaming alerting algorithm with your data's latency. If it takes a while for your data to arrive, then you may need to increase the evaluation offset. The total supported latency is the product of the aggregation window duration multiplied by the evaluation offset. In the example screenshot above, the supported latency is 3 minutes (a 1-minute aggregation window multiplied by three windows). If the data type comes from an APM language agent and is aggregated from many app instances (for example, Transactions, TransactionErrors, etc.), we recommend using an evaluation offset of 3 with 1 minute aggregation windows. Important When creating NRQL conditions for data collected from Infrastructure Cloud Integrations such as AWS Cloudwatch or Azure, we recommend that you start with an evaluation offset of 15 minutes, then adjust up or down depending on how long it takes to collect your data. Fill data gaps Gap filling lets you customize the values to use when your signals don't have any data. You can fill gaps in your data streams with one of these settings: None: (Default) Choose this if you don't want to take any action on empty aggregation windows. On evaluation, an empty aggregation window will reset the threshold duration timer. For example, if a condition says that all aggregation windows must have data points above the threshold for 5 minutes, and 1 of the 5 aggregation windows is empty, then the condition won't be in violation. Custom static value: Choose this if you'd like to insert a custom static value into the empty aggregation windows before they're evaluated. This option has an additional, required parameter of fillValue (as named in the API) that specifies what static value should be used. This defaults to 0. Last known value: This option inserts the last seen value before evaluation occurs. We maintain the state of the last seen value for 2 hours. Tip The alerts system fills gaps in actively reported signals. This signal history is dropped after 2 hours of inactivity. For gap filling, data points received after this period of inactivity are treated as new signals. To learn more about signal loss, gap filling, and how to request access to these features, see this Explorers Hub post. Options for editing data gap settings: In the NRQL conditions UI, go to Condition settings > Advanced signal settings > fill data gaps with and choose an option. If using our Nerdgraph API (preferred), this node is located at: actor : account : alerts : nrqlCondition : signal : fillOption | fillValue NerdGraph is our recommended API for this but if you're using our REST API, you can find this setting in the REST API explorer under the \"signal\" section of the Alert NRQL conditions API.",

      "body": "You can use NRQL queries to create alert conditions. Once you've defined your signal, you can further define your warning and critical threshold levels. This determines when an alerts violation is created. Read on to learn more about how to do this. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Click NRQL, and then Next, define thresholds. Tip For more information on key concepts relating to NRQL alert conditions and streaming alerts, see Streaming alerts: key terms and concepts. Create a NRQL alert condition To create a NRQL alert condition for a policy: On one.newrelic.com, in the header click Alerts & AI, then in the left sidebar click Policies. Select an existing policy or click New alert policy to create a new policy. Click Add a condition. Under Select a product click NRQL, and then click Next, define thresholds. Create a condition from a chart You can use a chart to create a NRQL alert condition. To create a NRQL alerts condition from a chart, click the chart menu , then click Create alert condition. Once you've named and customized your condition, you can add it to an existing policy or create a new one. Caution A small number of our older charts don't include the option to create an alert condition. NRQL alert syntax Here's the basic syntax for creating all NRQL alert conditions. The FACET clause is required for outlier threshold types. It's optional for static and baseline. SELECT function(attribute) FROM Event WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Copy Clause Notes SELECT function(attribute) Required Supported functions that return numbers include: apdex average count latest max min percentage percentile sum uniqueCount Tip If you use the percentile aggregator in a faceted alert condition with many facets, this may cause the following error to appear: An error occurred while fetching chart data. If you see this error, use average instead. FROM data type Required Only one data type can be targeted. Supported data types: Event Metric (RAW data points will be returned) WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Use the WHERE clause to specify a series of one or more conditions. All the operators are supported. FACET attribute Required for outlier conditions Include an optional FACET clause in your NRQL syntax depending on the threshold type: static or baseline. Use the FACET clause to separate your results by attribute and alert on each attribute independently. No LIMIT clause is allowed, but all queries will receive the maximum number of facets possible. Faceted queries can return a maximum of 5000 values for static and baseline conditions and a maximum of 500 values for outlier conditions. Important If the query returns more than the maximum number of values, the alert condition can't be created. If you create the condition and the query returns more than this number later, the alert will fail. Modify your query so that it returns a fewer number of values. Reformatting incompatible NRQL Some elements of NRQL used in charts don’t make sense in the streaming context of alerts. Here’s a list of the most common incompatible elements and suggestions for reformatting a NRQL alert query to achieve the same effect. Element Notes SINCE and UNTIL Example: SELECT percentile(largestContentfulPaint, 75) FROM PageViewTiming WHERE (appId = 837807) SINCE yesterday Copy NRQL Alerting produces a never-ending stream of windowed query results, so the SINCE and UNTIL keywords to scope the query to a point in time are not compatible. As a convenience, we automatically strip SINCE and UNTIL from a query when creating a NRQL Alert Condition from the context of a chart. TIMESERIES In NRQL queries, the TIMESERIES clause is used to return data as a time series broken out by a specified period of time. For NRQL alerts, the equivalent property of a signal is the aggregation window. histogram() The histogram() aggregation function is used to generate histograms. histogram() is not compatible with NRQL alerting: histogram aggregations can not be formatted as a time series. To create an alert from a portion of a histogram (e.g. 95th percentile), use the percentile() aggregation function. Multiple Aggregation Functions Each alert condition can only target a single aggregated stream of data. To alert on multiple streams simultaneously, you’ll need to decompose them into individual conditions within the same policy. Original Query: SELECT count(foo), average(bar), max(baz) from Transaction Copy Decomposed: SELECT count(foo) from Transaction SELECT average(bar) from Transaction SELECT max(baz) from Transaction Copy COMPARE WITH The COMPARE WITH clause is used to compare the values for two different time ranges. This type of query is incompatible with NRQL alerting. We recommend using a Baseline Alert Condition to dynamically detect deviations for a particular signal. SLIDE BY The SLIDE BY clause supports a feature known as sliding windows. With sliding windows, SLIDE BY data is gathered into \"windows\" of time that overlap with each other. These windows can help to smooth out line graphs with a lot of variation in cases where the rolling aggregate (such as a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. Sliding windows are not currently supported in NRQL alerts. LIMIT In NRQL queries, the LIMIT clause is used to control the amount of data a query returns, either the maximum number of facet values returned by FACET queries or the maximum number of items returned by SELECT * queries. LIMIT is not compatible with NRQL alerting: evaluation is always performed on the full result set. NRQL alert threshold examples Here are some common use cases for NRQL alert conditions. These queries will work for static and baseline threshold types. The outlier threshold type will require additional FACET clauses. Alert on specific segments of your data Create constrained alerts that target a specific segment of your data, such as a few key customers or a range of data. Use the WHERE clause to define those conditions. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction WHERE account_id in (91290, 102021, 20230) Copy SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction WHERE name LIKE 'Controller/checkout/%' Copy Alert on Nth percentile of your data Create alerts when an Nth percentile of your data hits a specified threshold; for example, maintaining SLA service levels. Since we evaluate the NRQL query in one-minute time windows, percentiles will be calculated for each minute separately. SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentile(databaseDuration, 75) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on max, min, avg of your data Create alerts when your data hits a certain maximum, minimum, or average; for example, ensuring that a duration or response time does not pass a certain threshold. SELECT max(duration) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on a percentage of your data Create alerts when a proportion of your data goes above or below a certain threshold. SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE duration > 2) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE httpResponseCode = '500') FROM Transaction Copy Alert on Apdex with any T-value Create alerts on Apdex, applying your own T-value for certain transactions. For example, get an alert notification when your Apdex for a T-value of 500ms on transactions for production apps goes below 0.8. SELECT apdex(duration, t:0.5) FROM Transaction WHERE appName like '%prod%' Copy Alert conditions and query order of operations By default, the aggregation window is 1 minute, but you can change the window to suit your needs. Whatever the aggregation window, New Relic will collect data for that window using the function in the NRQL alert condition’s query. The query is parsed and executed by our systems in the following order: FROM clause – which event type needs to be grabbed? WHERE clause – what can be filtered out? SELECT clause – what information needs to be returned from the now-filtered data set? Example: null value returned Let's say this is your alert condition query: SELECT count(*) FROM SyntheticCheck WHERE monitorName = 'My Cool Monitor' AND result = 'FAILURE' Copy If there are no failures for the aggregation window: The system will execute the FROM clause by grabbing all SyntheticCheck events on your account. Then it will execute the WHERE clause to filter through those events by looking only for the ones that match the monitor name and result specified. If there are still events left to scan through after completing the FROM and WHERE operations, the SELECT clause will be executed. If there are no remaining events, the SELECT clause will not be executed. This means that aggregators like count() and uniqueCount() will never return a zero value. When there is a count of 0, the SELECT clause is ignored and no data is returned, resulting in a value of NULL. Example: zero value returned If you have a data source delivering legitimate numeric zeroes, the query will return zero values and not null values. Let's say this is your alert condition query, and that MyCoolEvent is an attribute that can sometimes return a zero value. SELECT average(MyCoolAttribute) FROM MyCoolEvent Copy If, in the aggregation window being evaluated, there's at least one instance of MyCoolEvent and if the average value of all MyCoolAttribute attributes from that window is equal to zero, then a 0 value will be returned. If there are no MyCoolEvent events during that minute, then a NULL will be returned due to the order of operations. Tip For more information about this topic, you can check out our blog post on troubleshooting for zero versus null values. Tip You can determine how null values will be handled by adjusting loss of signal and gap filling settings in the Alert Conditions UI. Tip You can avoid NULL values entirely with a query order of operations shortcut. Do this by using a filter sub-clause, then including all filter elements within that sub-clause. The main body of the query will run and return data, at which point the SELECT clause will then run and apply the filter elements. The query will return a value of 0 if the filter elements result in no matching data. Here's an example: SELECT filter(count(*), WHERE result = 'SUCCESS' AND monitorName = 'My Favorite Monitor') FROM SyntheticCheck Copy Nested aggregation NRQL alerts Nested aggregation queries are a powerful way to query your data. However, they have a few restrictions that are important to note. Nested queries with a non-faceted innermost query are not currently supported Without a FACET, the inner query produces a single result, giving the outer query nothing to aggregate. If you're using a nested query, make sure your inner query is faceted. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu) ​​​​​ Copy Queries at all levels must have the same aggregation window size With an alert aggregation window of 1 minute, the inner query would produce two smaller windows of 30 seconds. In theory, these two windows could be aggregated by the outer query. However, this is not currently supported. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu TIMESERIES 30 seconds)​​ Copy Signal loss is not yet supported for nested queries For more information on signal loss, see NerdGraph API: Loss of signal and gap filling. Nested queries containing 'WITH METRIC_FORMAT' in the inner query are not currently supported You can't use a nested query containing the WITH METRIC_FORMAT in the inner query to create NRQL alert conditions. NRQL condition creation tips Here are some tips for creating and using a NRQL condition: Topic Tips Condition threshold types NRQL condition threshold types include static, baseline, and outlier. Create a description For NRQL conditions, you can create a custom description to add to each violation. Descriptions can be enhanced with variable substitution based on metadata in the specific violation. For details, see Description Query results Queries must return a number. The condition evaluates the returned number against the thresholds you've set. Time period As with all alert conditions, NRQL conditions evaluate one single minute at a time. The implicit SINCE ... UNTIL clause specifying which minute to evaluate is controlled by your Evaluation offset setting. Since very recent data may be incomplete, you may want to query data from 3 minutes ago or longer, especially for: Applications that run on multiple hosts. SyntheticCheck data: Timeouts can take 3 minutes, so 5 minutes or more is recommended. Also, if a query will generate intermittent data, consider using the sum of query results option. Lost signal threshold (loss of signal detection) You can use loss of signal detection to alert on when your data (a telemetry signal) should be considered lost. A signal loss can indicate that a service or entity is no longer online or that a periodic job failed to run. You can also use this to make sure that violations for sporadic data, such as error counts, are closed when no signal is coming in. Advanced signal settings These settings give you options for better handling continuous, streaming data signals that may sometimes be missing. These settings include the aggregation window, the evaluation offset, and an option for filling data gaps. For more on using these, see Advanced signal settings. Condition settings Use the Condition settings to: Create a concise, descriptive condition name. Provide a custom violation description for the condition that will be included in violations and notifications. Add the runbook URL to include your organization's procedures for handling incidents. You may also add this information to the custom violation description. Limits on conditions See the maximum values. Health status NRQL alert conditions don't affect an entity's health status display. Examples For more information, see: Expected NRQL syntax Examples of NRQL condition queries Alert threshold types When you create a NRQL alert, you can choose from different types of thresholds: NRQL alert threshold types Description Static This is the simplest type of NRQL threshold. It allows you to create a condition based on a NRQL query that returns a numeric value. Optional: Include a FACET clause. Baseline (Dynamic) Uses a self-adjusting condition based on the past behavior of the monitored values. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type. Outlier Looks for group behavior and values that are outliers from those groups. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type, but requires a FACET clause. Sum of query results (limited or intermittent data) Important Available only for static (basic) threshold types. If a query returns intermittent or limited data, it may be difficult to set a meaningful threshold. Missing or limited data will sometimes generate false positives or false negatives. You can use loss of signal, aggregation duration, and gap filling settings to minimize these false notifications. To avoid this problem when using the static threshold type, you can set the selector to sum of query results. This lets you set the alert on an aggregated sum instead of a value from a single harvest cycle. Up to two hours of one-minute data checks can be aggregated. The duration you select determines the width of the rolling sum and the preview chart will update accordingly. Set the loss of signal threshold Loss of signal occurs when no data matches the NRQL condition over a specific period of time. You can set your loss of signal threshold duration and and also what happens when the threshold is crossed. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Loss of signal is only available for NRQL conditions. You may also manage these settings using the GraphQL API (recommended), or the REST API. Go here for specific GraphQL API examples. Loss of signal settings: Loss of signal settings include a time duration and two possible actions. Signal loss expiration time UI label: Signal is lost after: GraphQL Node: expiration.expirationDuration Expiration duration is a timer that starts and resets when we receive a data point in the streaming alerts pipeline. If we don't receive another data point before your 'expiration time' expires, we consider that signal to be lost. This can be because no data is being sent to New Relic or the WHERE clause of your NRQL query is filtering that data out before it is streamed to the alerts pipeline. The loss of signal expiration time is independent of the threshold duration and triggers as soon as the timer expires. The maximum expiration duration is 48 hours. This is helpful when monitoring for the execution of infrequent jobs. The minimum is 30 seconds, but we recommend using at least 3-5 minutes. Loss of signal actions Once a signal is considered lost, you can close open violations, open new violations, or both. Close all current open violations: This closes all open violations that are related to a specific signal. It won't necessarily close all violations for a condition. If you're alerting on an ephemeral service, or on a sporadic signal, you'll want to choose this action to ensure that violations are closed properly. The GraphQL node name for this is \"closeViolationsOnExpiration\" Open new violations: This will open a new violation when the signal is considered lost. These violations will indicate that they are due to a loss of signal. Based on your incident preferences, this should trigger a notification. The graphQL node name for this is \"openViolationOnExpiration\" When you enable both actions, we'll close all open violations first, and then open a new violation for loss of signal. To create a NRQL alert configured with loss of signal detection in the UI: For a policy, when you create a condition, under Select a product, click NRQL, then click Next, define thresholds. Write a NRQL query that returns the values you want to alert on. For Threshold type, select Static or Baseline. Click + Add lost signal threshold, then set the signal expiration duration time in minutes or seconds in the Signal is lost after field. Choose what you want to happen when the signal is lost. You can check one or both of Close all current open violations and Open new \"lost signal\" violation. These control how loss of signal violations will be handled for the condition. Make sure you name your condition before you save it. Violations open due to loss of signal close when the signal comes back. Newly opened lost signal violations will close immediately when new data is evaluated. the condition they belong to expires. By default, conditions expire after 3 days. you manually close the violation with the Close all current open violations option. Tip Loss of signal detection doesn't work on NRQL queries that use nested aggregation or sub-queries. Advanced signal settings When creating a NRQL alert condition, the advanced signal settings gives you better control over streaming alert data and helps you avoid false alarms. When creating a NRQL condition, there are several advanced signal settings: Aggregation window Evaluation offset Fill data gaps To read an explanation of what these settings are and how they relate to each other, see Streaming alerts concepts. Below are instructions and tips on how to configure them. Aggregation window You can set the aggregation window duration to choose how long data is accumulated in a streaming time window before it's aggregated. You can set it to anything between one second and 15 minutes. The default is one minute. Tip Baseline alert condition thresholds don't support editing the aggregation window. They use the 1 minute default. Evaluation offset You can adjust the evaluation offset to coordinate our streaming alerting algorithm with your data's latency. If it takes a while for your data to arrive, then you may need to increase the evaluation offset. The total supported latency is the product of the aggregation window duration multiplied by the evaluation offset. In the example screenshot above, the supported latency is 3 minutes (a 1-minute aggregation window multiplied by three windows). If the data type comes from an APM language agent and is aggregated from many app instances (for example, Transactions, TransactionErrors, etc.), we recommend using an evaluation offset of 3 with 1 minute aggregation windows. Important When creating NRQL conditions for data collected from Infrastructure Cloud Integrations such as AWS Cloudwatch or Azure, we recommend that you start with an evaluation offset of 15 minutes, then adjust up or down depending on how long it takes to collect your data. Fill data gaps Gap filling lets you customize the values to use when your signals don't have any data. You can fill gaps in your data streams with one of these settings: None: (Default) Choose this if you don't want to take any action on empty aggregation windows. On evaluation, an empty aggregation window will reset the threshold duration timer. For example, if a condition says that all aggregation windows must have data points above the threshold for 5 minutes, and 1 of the 5 aggregation windows is empty, then the condition won't be in violation. Custom static value: Choose this if you'd like to insert a custom static value into the empty aggregation windows before they're evaluated. This option has an additional, required parameter of fillValue (as named in the API) that specifies what static value should be used. This defaults to 0. Last known value: This option inserts the last seen value before evaluation occurs. We maintain the state of the last seen value for 2 hours. Tip The alerts system fills gaps in actively reported signals. This signal history is dropped after 2 hours of inactivity. For gap filling, data points received after this period of inactivity are treated as new signals. To learn more about signal loss, gap filling, and how to request access to these features, see this Explorers Hub post. Options for editing data gap settings: In the NRQL conditions UI, go to Condition settings > Advanced signal settings > fill data gaps with and choose an option. If using our Nerdgraph API (preferred), this node is located at: actor : account : alerts : nrqlCondition : signal : fillOption | fillValue NerdGraph is our recommended API for this but if you're using our REST API, you can find this setting in the REST API explorer under the \"signal\" section of the Alert NRQL conditions API.",

      "body": "You can use NRQL queries to create alert conditions. Once you've defined your signal, you can further define your warning and critical threshold levels. This determines when an alerts violation is created. Read on to learn more about how to do this. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Click NRQL, and then Next, define thresholds. Tip For more information on key concepts relating to NRQL alert conditions and streaming alerts, see Streaming alerts: key terms and concepts. Create a NRQL alert condition To create a NRQL alert condition for a policy: On one.newrelic.com, in the header click Alerts & AI, then in the left sidebar click Policies. Select an existing policy or click New alert policy to create a new policy. Click Add a condition. Under Select a product click NRQL, and then click Next, define thresholds. Create a condition from a chart You can use a chart to create a NRQL alert condition. To create a NRQL alerts condition from a chart, click the chart menu , then click Create alert condition. Once you've named and customized your condition, you can add it to an existing policy or create a new one. Caution A small number of our older charts don't include the option to create an alert condition. NRQL alert syntax Here's the basic syntax for creating all NRQL alert conditions. The FACET clause is required for outlier threshold types. It's optional for static and baseline. SELECT function(attribute) FROM Event WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Copy Clause Notes SELECT function(attribute) Required Supported functions that return numbers include: apdex average count latest max min percentage percentile sum uniqueCount Tip If you use the percentile aggregator in a faceted alert condition with many facets, this may cause the following error to appear: An error occurred while fetching chart data. If you see this error, use average instead. FROM data type Required Only one data type can be targeted. Supported data types: Event Metric (RAW data points will be returned) WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Use the WHERE clause to specify a series of one or more conditions. All the operators are supported. FACET attribute Required for outlier conditions Include an optional FACET clause in your NRQL syntax depending on the threshold type: static or baseline. Use the FACET clause to separate your results by attribute and alert on each attribute independently. No LIMIT clause is allowed, but all queries will receive the maximum number of facets possible. Faceted queries can return a maximum of 5000 values for static and baseline conditions and a maximum of 500 values for outlier conditions. Important If the query returns more than the maximum number of values, the alert condition can't be created. If you create the condition and the query returns more than this number later, the alert will fail. Modify your query so that it returns a fewer number of values. Reformatting incompatible NRQL Some elements of NRQL used in charts don’t make sense in the streaming context of alerts. Here’s a list of the most common incompatible elements and suggestions for reformatting a NRQL alert query to achieve the same effect. Element Notes SINCE and UNTIL Example: SELECT percentile(largestContentfulPaint, 75) FROM PageViewTiming WHERE (appId = 837807) SINCE yesterday Copy NRQL Alerting produces a never-ending stream of windowed query results, so the SINCE and UNTIL keywords to scope the query to a point in time are not compatible. As a convenience, we automatically strip SINCE and UNTIL from a query when creating a NRQL Alert Condition from the context of a chart. TIMESERIES In NRQL queries, the TIMESERIES clause is used to return data as a time series broken out by a specified period of time. For NRQL alerts, the equivalent property of a signal is the aggregation window. histogram() The histogram() aggregation function is used to generate histograms. histogram() is not compatible with NRQL alerting: histogram aggregations can not be formatted as a time series. To create an alert from a portion of a histogram (e.g. 95th percentile), use the percentile() aggregation function. Multiple Aggregation Functions Each alert condition can only target a single aggregated stream of data. To alert on multiple streams simultaneously, you’ll need to decompose them into individual conditions within the same policy. Original Query: SELECT count(foo), average(bar), max(baz) from Transaction Copy Decomposed: SELECT count(foo) from Transaction SELECT average(bar) from Transaction SELECT max(baz) from Transaction Copy COMPARE WITH The COMPARE WITH clause is used to compare the values for two different time ranges. This type of query is incompatible with NRQL alerting. We recommend using a Baseline Alert Condition to dynamically detect deviations for a particular signal. SLIDE BY The SLIDE BY clause supports a feature known as sliding windows. With sliding windows, SLIDE BY data is gathered into \"windows\" of time that overlap with each other. These windows can help to smooth out line graphs with a lot of variation in cases where the rolling aggregate (such as a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. Sliding windows are not currently supported in NRQL alerts. LIMIT In NRQL queries, the LIMIT clause is used to control the amount of data a query returns, either the maximum number of facet values returned by FACET queries or the maximum number of items returned by SELECT * queries. LIMIT is not compatible with NRQL alerting: evaluation is always performed on the full result set. NRQL alert threshold examples Here are some common use cases for NRQL alert conditions. These queries will work for static and baseline threshold types. The outlier threshold type will require additional FACET clauses. Alert on specific segments of your data Create constrained alerts that target a specific segment of your data, such as a few key customers or a range of data. Use the WHERE clause to define those conditions. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction WHERE account_id in (91290, 102021, 20230) Copy SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction WHERE name LIKE 'Controller/checkout/%' Copy Alert on Nth percentile of your data Create alerts when an Nth percentile of your data hits a specified threshold; for example, maintaining SLA service levels. Since we evaluate the NRQL query in one-minute time windows, percentiles will be calculated for each minute separately. SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentile(databaseDuration, 75) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on max, min, avg of your data Create alerts when your data hits a certain maximum, minimum, or average; for example, ensuring that a duration or response time does not pass a certain threshold. SELECT max(duration) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on a percentage of your data Create alerts when a proportion of your data goes above or below a certain threshold. SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE duration > 2) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE httpResponseCode = '500') FROM Transaction Copy Alert on Apdex with any T-value Create alerts on Apdex, applying your own T-value for certain transactions. For example, get an alert notification when your Apdex for a T-value of 500ms on transactions for production apps goes below 0.8. SELECT apdex(duration, t:0.5) FROM Transaction WHERE appName like '%prod%' Copy Alert conditions and query order of operations By default, the aggregation window is 1 minute, but you can change the window to suit your needs. Whatever the aggregation window, New Relic will collect data for that window using the function in the NRQL alert condition’s query. The query is parsed and executed by our systems in the following order: FROM clause – which event type needs to be grabbed? WHERE clause – what can be filtered out? SELECT clause – what information needs to be returned from the now-filtered data set? Example: null value returned Let's say this is your alert condition query: SELECT count(*) FROM SyntheticCheck WHERE monitorName = 'My Cool Monitor' AND result = 'FAILURE' Copy If there are no failures for the aggregation window: The system will execute the FROM clause by grabbing all SyntheticCheck events on your account. Then it will execute the WHERE clause to filter through those events by looking only for the ones that match the monitor name and result specified. If there are still events left to scan through after completing the FROM and WHERE operations, the SELECT clause will be executed. If there are no remaining events, the SELECT clause will not be executed. This means that aggregators like count() and uniqueCount() will never return a zero value. When there is a count of 0, the SELECT clause is ignored and no data is returned, resulting in a value of NULL. Example: zero value returned If you have a data source delivering legitimate numeric zeroes, the query will return zero values and not null values. Let's say this is your alert condition query, and that MyCoolEvent is an attribute that can sometimes return a zero value. SELECT average(MyCoolAttribute) FROM MyCoolEvent Copy If, in the aggregation window being evaluated, there's at least one instance of MyCoolEvent and if the average value of all MyCoolAttribute attributes from that window is equal to zero, then a 0 value will be returned. If there are no MyCoolEvent events during that minute, then a NULL will be returned due to the order of operations. Tip For more information about this topic, you can check out our blog post on troubleshooting for zero versus null values. Tip You can determine how null values will be handled by adjusting loss of signal and gap filling settings in the Alert Conditions UI. Tip You can avoid NULL values entirely with a query order of operations shortcut. Do this by using a filter sub-clause, then including all filter elements within that sub-clause. The main body of the query will run and return data, at which point the SELECT clause will then run and apply the filter elements. The query will return a value of 0 if the filter elements result in no matching data. Here's an example: SELECT filter(count(*), WHERE result = 'SUCCESS' AND monitorName = 'My Favorite Monitor') FROM SyntheticCheck Copy Nested aggregation NRQL alerts Nested aggregation queries are a powerful way to query your data. However, they have a few restrictions that are important to note. Nested queries with a non-faceted innermost query are not currently supported Without a FACET, the inner query produces a single result, giving the outer query nothing to aggregate. If you're using a nested query, make sure your inner query is faceted. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu) ​​​​​ Copy Queries at all levels must have the same aggregation window size With an alert aggregation window of 1 minute, the inner query would produce two smaller windows of 30 seconds. In theory, these two windows could be aggregated by the outer query. However, this is not currently supported. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu TIMESERIES 30 seconds)​​ Copy Signal loss is not yet supported for nested queries For more information on signal loss, see NerdGraph API: Loss of signal and gap filling. Nested queries containing 'WITH METRIC_FORMAT' in the inner query are not currently supported You can't use a nested query containing the WITH METRIC_FORMAT in the inner query to create NRQL alert conditions. NRQL condition creation tips Here are some tips for creating and using a NRQL condition: Topic Tips Condition threshold types NRQL condition threshold types include static, baseline, and outlier. Create a description For NRQL conditions, you can create a custom description to add to each violation. Descriptions can be enhanced with variable substitution based on metadata in the specific violation. For details, see Description Query results Queries must return a number. The condition evaluates the returned number against the thresholds you've set. Time period As with all alert conditions, NRQL conditions evaluate one single minute at a time. The implicit SINCE ... UNTIL clause specifying which minute to evaluate is controlled by your Evaluation offset setting. Since very recent data may be incomplete, you may want to query data from 3 minutes ago or longer, especially for: Applications that run on multiple hosts. SyntheticCheck data: Timeouts can take 3 minutes, so 5 minutes or more is recommended. Also, if a query will generate intermittent data, consider using the sum of query results option. Lost signal threshold (loss of signal detection) You can use loss of signal detection to alert on when your data (a telemetry signal) should be considered lost. A signal loss can indicate that a service or entity is no longer online or that a periodic job failed to run. You can also use this to make sure that violations for sporadic data, such as error counts, are closed when no signal is coming in. Advanced signal settings These settings give you options for better handling continuous, streaming data signals that may sometimes be missing. These settings include the aggregation window, the evaluation offset, and an option for filling data gaps. For more on using these, see Advanced signal settings. Condition settings Use the Condition settings to: Create a concise, descriptive condition name. Provide a custom violation description for the condition that will be included in violations and notifications. Add the runbook URL to include your organization's procedures for handling incidents. You may also add this information to the custom violation description. Limits on conditions See the maximum values. Health status NRQL alert conditions don't affect an entity's health status display. Examples For more information, see: Expected NRQL syntax Examples of NRQL condition queries Alert threshold types When you create a NRQL alert, you can choose from different types of thresholds: NRQL alert threshold types Description Static This is the simplest type of NRQL threshold. It allows you to create a condition based on a NRQL query that returns a numeric value. Optional: Include a FACET clause. Baseline (Dynamic) Uses a self-adjusting condition based on the past behavior of the monitored values. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type. Outlier Looks for group behavior and values that are outliers from those groups. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type, but requires a FACET clause. Sum of query results (limited or intermittent data) Important Available only for static (basic) threshold types. If a query returns intermittent or limited data, it may be difficult to set a meaningful threshold. Missing or limited data will sometimes generate false positives or false negatives. You can use loss of signal, aggregation duration, and gap filling settings to minimize these false notifications. To avoid this problem when using the static threshold type, you can set the selector to sum of query results. This lets you set the alert on an aggregated sum instead of a value from a single harvest cycle. Up to two hours of one-minute data checks can be aggregated. The duration you select determines the width of the rolling sum and the preview chart will update accordingly. Set the loss of signal threshold Loss of signal occurs when no data matches the NRQL condition over a specific period of time. You can set your loss of signal threshold duration and and also what happens when the threshold is crossed. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Loss of signal is only available for NRQL conditions. You may also manage these settings using the GraphQL API (recommended), or the REST API. Go here for specific GraphQL API examples. Loss of signal settings: Loss of signal settings include a time duration and two possible actions. Signal loss expiration time UI label: Signal is lost after: GraphQL Node: expiration.expirationDuration Expiration duration is a timer that starts and resets when we receive a data point in the streaming alerts pipeline. If we don't receive another data point before your 'expiration time' expires, we consider that signal to be lost. This can be because no data is being sent to New Relic or the WHERE clause of your NRQL query is filtering that data out before it is streamed to the alerts pipeline. The loss of signal expiration time is independent of the threshold duration and triggers as soon as the timer expires. The maximum expiration duration is 48 hours. This is helpful when monitoring for the execution of infrequent jobs. The minimum is 30 seconds, but we recommend using at least 3-5 minutes. Loss of signal actions Once a signal is considered lost, you can close open violations, open new violations, or both. Close all current open violations: This closes all open violations that are related to a specific signal. It won't necessarily close all violations for a condition. If you're alerting on an ephemeral service, or on a sporadic signal, you'll want to choose this action to ensure that violations are closed properly. The GraphQL node name for this is \"closeViolationsOnExpiration\" Open new violations: This will open a new violation when the signal is considered lost. These violations will indicate that they are due to a loss of signal. Based on your incident preferences, this should trigger a notification. The graphQL node name for this is \"openViolationOnExpiration\" When you enable both actions, we'll close all open violations first, and then open a new violation for loss of signal. To create a NRQL alert configured with loss of signal detection in the UI: For a policy, when you create a condition, under Select a product, click NRQL, then click Next, define thresholds. Write a NRQL query that returns the values you want to alert on. For Threshold type, select Static or Baseline. Click + Add lost signal threshold, then set the signal expiration duration time in minutes or seconds in the Signal is lost after field. Choose what you want to happen when the signal is lost. You can check one or both of Close all current open violations and Open new \"lost signal\" violation. These control how loss of signal violations will be handled for the condition. Make sure you name your condition before you save it. Violations open due to loss of signal close when the signal comes back. Newly opened lost signal violations will close immediately when new data is evaluated. the condition they belong to expires. By default, conditions expire after 3 days. you manually close the violation with the Close all current open violations option. Tip Loss of signal detection doesn't work on NRQL queries that use nested aggregation or sub-queries. Advanced signal settings When creating a NRQL alert condition, the advanced signal settings gives you better control over streaming alert data and helps you avoid false alarms. When creating a NRQL condition, there are several advanced signal settings: Aggregation window Evaluation offset Fill data gaps To read an explanation of what these settings are and how they relate to each other, see Streaming alerts concepts. Below are instructions and tips on how to configure them. Aggregation window You can set the aggregation window duration to choose how long data is accumulated in a streaming time window before it's aggregated. You can set it to anything between one second and 15 minutes. The default is one minute. Tip Baseline alert condition thresholds don't support editing the aggregation window. They use the 1 minute default. Evaluation offset You can adjust the evaluation offset to coordinate our streaming alerting algorithm with your data's latency. If it takes a while for your data to arrive, then you may need to increase the evaluation offset. The total supported latency is the product of the aggregation window duration multiplied by the evaluation offset. In the example screenshot above, the supported latency is 3 minutes (a 1-minute aggregation window multiplied by three windows). If the data type comes from an APM language agent and is aggregated from many app instances (for example, Transactions, TransactionErrors, etc.), we recommend using an evaluation offset of 3 with 1 minute aggregation windows. Important When creating NRQL conditions for data collected from Infrastructure Cloud Integrations such as AWS Cloudwatch or Azure, we recommend that you start with an evaluation offset of 15 minutes, then adjust up or down depending on how long it takes to collect your data. Fill data gaps Gap filling lets you customize the values to use when your signals don't have any data. You can fill gaps in your data streams with one of these settings: None: (Default) Choose this if you don't want to take any action on empty aggregation windows. On evaluation, an empty aggregation window will reset the threshold duration timer. For example, if a condition says that all aggregation windows must have data points above the threshold for 5 minutes, and 1 of the 5 aggregation windows is empty, then the condition won't be in violation. Custom static value: Choose this if you'd like to insert a custom static value into the empty aggregation windows before they're evaluated. This option has an additional, required parameter of fillValue (as named in the API) that specifies what static value should be used. This defaults to 0. Last known value: This option inserts the last seen value before evaluation occurs. We maintain the state of the last seen value for 2 hours. Tip The alerts system fills gaps in actively reported signals. This signal history is dropped after 2 hours of inactivity. For gap filling, data points received after this period of inactivity are treated as new signals. To learn more about signal loss, gap filling, and how to request access to these features, see this Explorers Hub post. Options for editing data gap settings: In the NRQL conditions UI, go to Condition settings > Advanced signal settings > fill data gaps with and choose an option. If using our Nerdgraph API (preferred), this node is located at: actor : account : alerts : nrqlCondition : signal : fillOption | fillValue NerdGraph is our recommended API for this but if you're using our REST API, you can find this setting in the REST API explorer under the \"signal\" section of the Alert NRQL conditions API.",

      "body": "Important This feature is a limited release. We’ve expanded anomaly detection coverage beyond your APM applications. Configure anomaly detection for your browser applications, mobile applications, infrastructure hosts, and nearly anything you want to monitor. Requirements Expanded anomaly detection is available as a limited beta. You can request access here. Why it matters When starting to configure alert conditions for a variety of applications and hosts, it can be difficult to know what you’ll want to be notified about ahead of time. Anomaly detection helps you distinguish between what’s typical performance in your system and where you’re starting to have trouble. Instead of creating your alert conditions manually, you can simply tell us what you want to monitor. Anomaly detection will help you identify baseline performance in your system and flags anomalous activity in your system. Get started with anomaly detection To get started with expanded anomaly detection: From one.newrelic.com, go to Alerts & AI > Proactive Detection > Settings. Click the Custom tab, and then click + Add a configuration. Select the account you want to use to record anomaly data, then select the workload or entities you’d like to monitor. Select the detection sensitivity. We recommend Low sensitivity so that you don’t see too many anomalies. Finally, name your configuration and save. Detect anomalies with a faceted NRQL query To detect anomalies with a faceted NRQL query: From one.newrelic.com, go to Alerts & AI > Proactive Detection > Settings. Click the Custom tab, and then click + Add a configuration. Click Use a query instead. You may need to select an account, if you have more than one. Add one or more queries with a FACET clause. Name the query and confirm the facets you want to monitor for anomalies. Select the detection sensitivity. We recommend Low sensitivity so that you don’t see too many anomalies. Finally, name the configuration and save. See your anomalies in one place When you set up anomaly detection, New Relic starts analyzing the golden signals of your entities and workloads. Anomalies appear in your activity feeds throughout New Relic One and the Anomalies tab as soon as they’re detected. Click any anomaly to get more detail about it, including analysis and context for the anomaly. Tip For this limited release, anomaly detection won’t generate notifications. However, you can configure a NRQL alert condition for the NrAiAnomaly event. To view anomalies, from one.newrelic.com, go to Alerts & AI > Issues & activity > Anomalies. Query anomaly data Detected anomalies are written to the NrAiAnomaly event in your NRDB account. You can learn more about this event and how to query it here. Reduce the number of detected anomalies If you’re seeing too many anomalies, the first step is to make sure your sensitivity level is set to Low.

      "body": "You can use NRQL queries to create alert conditions. Once you've defined your signal, you can further define your warning and critical threshold levels. This determines when an alerts violation is created. Read on to learn more about how to do this. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Click NRQL, and then Next, define thresholds. Tip For more information on key concepts relating to NRQL alert conditions and streaming alerts, see Streaming alerts: key terms and concepts. Create a NRQL alert condition To create a NRQL alert condition for a policy: On one.newrelic.com, in the header click Alerts & AI, then in the left sidebar click Policies. Select an existing policy or click New alert policy to create a new policy. Click Add a condition. Under Select a product click NRQL, and then click Next, define thresholds. Create a condition from a chart You can use a chart to create a NRQL alert condition. To create a NRQL alerts condition from a chart, click the chart menu , then click Create alert condition. Once you've named and customized your condition, you can add it to an existing policy or create a new one. Caution A small number of our older charts don't include the option to create an alert condition. NRQL alert syntax Here's the basic syntax for creating all NRQL alert conditions. The FACET clause is required for outlier threshold types. It's optional for static and baseline. SELECT function(attribute) FROM Event WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Copy Clause Notes SELECT function(attribute) Required Supported functions that return numbers include: apdex average count latest max min percentage percentile sum uniqueCount Tip If you use the percentile aggregator in a faceted alert condition with many facets, this may cause the following error to appear: An error occurred while fetching chart data. If you see this error, use average instead. FROM data type Required Only one data type can be targeted. Supported data types: Event Metric (RAW data points will be returned) WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Use the WHERE clause to specify a series of one or more conditions. All the operators are supported. FACET attribute Required for outlier conditions Include an optional FACET clause in your NRQL syntax depending on the threshold type: static or baseline. Use the FACET clause to separate your results by attribute and alert on each attribute independently. No LIMIT clause is allowed, but all queries will receive the maximum number of facets possible. Faceted queries can return a maximum of 5000 values for static and baseline conditions and a maximum of 500 values for outlier conditions. Important If the query returns more than the maximum number of values, the alert condition can't be created. If you create the condition and the query returns more than this number later, the alert will fail. Modify your query so that it returns a fewer number of values. Reformatting incompatible NRQL Some elements of NRQL used in charts don’t make sense in the streaming context of alerts. Here’s a list of the most common incompatible elements and suggestions for reformatting a NRQL alert query to achieve the same effect. Element Notes SINCE and UNTIL Example: SELECT percentile(largestContentfulPaint, 75) FROM PageViewTiming WHERE (appId = 837807) SINCE yesterday Copy NRQL Alerting produces a never-ending stream of windowed query results, so the SINCE and UNTIL keywords to scope the query to a point in time are not compatible. As a convenience, we automatically strip SINCE and UNTIL from a query when creating a NRQL Alert Condition from the context of a chart. TIMESERIES In NRQL queries, the TIMESERIES clause is used to return data as a time series broken out by a specified period of time. For NRQL alerts, the equivalent property of a signal is the aggregation window. histogram() The histogram() aggregation function is used to generate histograms. histogram() is not compatible with NRQL alerting: histogram aggregations can not be formatted as a time series. To create an alert from a portion of a histogram (e.g. 95th percentile), use the percentile() aggregation function. Multiple Aggregation Functions Each alert condition can only target a single aggregated stream of data. To alert on multiple streams simultaneously, you’ll need to decompose them into individual conditions within the same policy. Original Query: SELECT count(foo), average(bar), max(baz) from Transaction Copy Decomposed: SELECT count(foo) from Transaction SELECT average(bar) from Transaction SELECT max(baz) from Transaction Copy COMPARE WITH The COMPARE WITH clause is used to compare the values for two different time ranges. This type of query is incompatible with NRQL alerting. We recommend using a Baseline Alert Condition to dynamically detect deviations for a particular signal. SLIDE BY The SLIDE BY clause supports a feature known as sliding windows. With sliding windows, SLIDE BY data is gathered into \"windows\" of time that overlap with each other. These windows can help to smooth out line graphs with a lot of variation in cases where the rolling aggregate (such as a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. Sliding windows are not currently supported in NRQL alerts. LIMIT In NRQL queries, the LIMIT clause is used to control the amount of data a query returns, either the maximum number of facet values returned by FACET queries or the maximum number of items returned by SELECT * queries. LIMIT is not compatible with NRQL alerting: evaluation is always performed on the full result set. NRQL alert threshold examples Here are some common use cases for NRQL alert conditions. These queries will work for static and baseline threshold types. The outlier threshold type will require additional FACET clauses. Alert on specific segments of your data Create constrained alerts that target a specific segment of your data, such as a few key customers or a range of data. Use the WHERE clause to define those conditions. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction WHERE account_id in (91290, 102021, 20230) Copy SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction WHERE name LIKE 'Controller/checkout/%' Copy Alert on Nth percentile of your data Create alerts when an Nth percentile of your data hits a specified threshold; for example, maintaining SLA service levels. Since we evaluate the NRQL query in one-minute time windows, percentiles will be calculated for each minute separately. SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentile(databaseDuration, 75) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on max, min, avg of your data Create alerts when your data hits a certain maximum, minimum, or average; for example, ensuring that a duration or response time does not pass a certain threshold. SELECT max(duration) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on a percentage of your data Create alerts when a proportion of your data goes above or below a certain threshold. SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE duration > 2) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE httpResponseCode = '500') FROM Transaction Copy Alert on Apdex with any T-value Create alerts on Apdex, applying your own T-value for certain transactions. For example, get an alert notification when your Apdex for a T-value of 500ms on transactions for production apps goes below 0.8. SELECT apdex(duration, t:0.5) FROM Transaction WHERE appName like '%prod%' Copy Alert conditions and query order of operations By default, the aggregation window is 1 minute, but you can change the window to suit your needs. Whatever the aggregation window, New Relic will collect data for that window using the function in the NRQL alert condition’s query. The query is parsed and executed by our systems in the following order: FROM clause – which event type needs to be grabbed? WHERE clause – what can be filtered out? SELECT clause – what information needs to be returned from the now-filtered data set? Example: null value returned Let's say this is your alert condition query: SELECT count(*) FROM SyntheticCheck WHERE monitorName = 'My Cool Monitor' AND result = 'FAILURE' Copy If there are no failures for the aggregation window: The system will execute the FROM clause by grabbing all SyntheticCheck events on your account. Then it will execute the WHERE clause to filter through those events by looking only for the ones that match the monitor name and result specified. If there are still events left to scan through after completing the FROM and WHERE operations, the SELECT clause will be executed. If there are no remaining events, the SELECT clause will not be executed. This means that aggregators like count() and uniqueCount() will never return a zero value. When there is a count of 0, the SELECT clause is ignored and no data is returned, resulting in a value of NULL. Example: zero value returned If you have a data source delivering legitimate numeric zeroes, the query will return zero values and not null values. Let's say this is your alert condition query, and that MyCoolEvent is an attribute that can sometimes return a zero value. SELECT average(MyCoolAttribute) FROM MyCoolEvent Copy If, in the aggregation window being evaluated, there's at least one instance of MyCoolEvent and if the average value of all MyCoolAttribute attributes from that window is equal to zero, then a 0 value will be returned. If there are no MyCoolEvent events during that minute, then a NULL will be returned due to the order of operations. Tip For more information about this topic, you can check out our blog post on troubleshooting for zero versus null values. Tip You can determine how null values will be handled by adjusting loss of signal and gap filling settings in the Alert Conditions UI. Tip You can avoid NULL values entirely with a query order of operations shortcut. Do this by using a filter sub-clause, then including all filter elements within that sub-clause. The main body of the query will run and return data, at which point the SELECT clause will then run and apply the filter elements. The query will return a value of 0 if the filter elements result in no matching data. Here's an example: SELECT filter(count(*), WHERE result = 'SUCCESS' AND monitorName = 'My Favorite Monitor') FROM SyntheticCheck Copy Nested aggregation NRQL alerts Nested aggregation queries are a powerful way to query your data. However, they have a few restrictions that are important to note. Nested queries with a non-faceted innermost query are not currently supported Without a FACET, the inner query produces a single result, giving the outer query nothing to aggregate. If you're using a nested query, make sure your inner query is faceted. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu) ​​​​​ Copy Queries at all levels must have the same aggregation window size With an alert aggregation window of 1 minute, the inner query would produce two smaller windows of 30 seconds. In theory, these two windows could be aggregated by the outer query. However, this is not currently supported. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu TIMESERIES 30 seconds)​​ Copy Signal loss is not yet supported for nested queries For more information on signal loss, see NerdGraph API: Loss of signal and gap filling. Nested queries containing 'WITH METRIC_FORMAT' in the inner query are not currently supported You can't use a nested query containing the WITH METRIC_FORMAT in the inner query to create NRQL alert conditions. NRQL condition creation tips Here are some tips for creating and using a NRQL condition: Topic Tips Condition threshold types NRQL condition threshold types include static, baseline, and outlier. Create a description For NRQL conditions, you can create a custom description to add to each violation. Descriptions can be enhanced with variable substitution based on metadata in the specific violation. For details, see Description Query results Queries must return a number. The condition evaluates the returned number against the thresholds you've set. Time period As with all alert conditions, NRQL conditions evaluate one single minute at a time. The implicit SINCE ... UNTIL clause specifying which minute to evaluate is controlled by your Evaluation offset setting. Since very recent data may be incomplete, you may want to query data from 3 minutes ago or longer, especially for: Applications that run on multiple hosts. SyntheticCheck data: Timeouts can take 3 minutes, so 5 minutes or more is recommended. Also, if a query will generate intermittent data, consider using the sum of query results option. Lost signal threshold (loss of signal detection) You can use loss of signal detection to alert on when your data (a telemetry signal) should be considered lost. A signal loss can indicate that a service or entity is no longer online or that a periodic job failed to run. You can also use this to make sure that violations for sporadic data, such as error counts, are closed when no signal is coming in. Advanced signal settings These settings give you options for better handling continuous, streaming data signals that may sometimes be missing. These settings include the aggregation window, the evaluation offset, and an option for filling data gaps. For more on using these, see Advanced signal settings. Condition settings Use the Condition settings to: Create a concise, descriptive condition name. Provide a custom violation description for the condition that will be included in violations and notifications. Add the runbook URL to include your organization's procedures for handling incidents. You may also add this information to the custom violation description. Limits on conditions See the maximum values. Health status NRQL alert conditions don't affect an entity's health status display. Examples For more information, see: Expected NRQL syntax Examples of NRQL condition queries Alert threshold types When you create a NRQL alert, you can choose from different types of thresholds: NRQL alert threshold types Description Static This is the simplest type of NRQL threshold. It allows you to create a condition based on a NRQL query that returns a numeric value. Optional: Include a FACET clause. Baseline (Dynamic) Uses a self-adjusting condition based on the past behavior of the monitored values. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type. Outlier Looks for group behavior and values that are outliers from those groups. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type, but requires a FACET clause. Sum of query results (limited or intermittent data) Important Available only for static (basic) threshold types. If a query returns intermittent or limited data, it may be difficult to set a meaningful threshold. Missing or limited data will sometimes generate false positives or false negatives. You can use loss of signal, aggregation duration, and gap filling settings to minimize these false notifications. To avoid this problem when using the static threshold type, you can set the selector to sum of query results. This lets you set the alert on an aggregated sum instead of a value from a single harvest cycle. Up to two hours of one-minute data checks can be aggregated. The duration you select determines the width of the rolling sum and the preview chart will update accordingly. Set the loss of signal threshold Loss of signal occurs when no data matches the NRQL condition over a specific period of time. You can set your loss of signal threshold duration and and also what happens when the threshold is crossed. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Loss of signal is only available for NRQL conditions. You may also manage these settings using the GraphQL API (recommended), or the REST API. Go here for specific GraphQL API examples. Loss of signal settings: Loss of signal settings include a time duration and two possible actions. Signal loss expiration time UI label: Signal is lost after: GraphQL Node: expiration.expirationDuration Expiration duration is a timer that starts and resets when we receive a data point in the streaming alerts pipeline. If we don't receive another data point before your 'expiration time' expires, we consider that signal to be lost. This can be because no data is being sent to New Relic or the WHERE clause of your NRQL query is filtering that data out before it is streamed to the alerts pipeline. The loss of signal expiration time is independent of the threshold duration and triggers as soon as the timer expires. The maximum expiration duration is 48 hours. This is helpful when monitoring for the execution of infrequent jobs. The minimum is 30 seconds, but we recommend using at least 3-5 minutes. Loss of signal actions Once a signal is considered lost, you can close open violations, open new violations, or both. Close all current open violations: This closes all open violations that are related to a specific signal. It won't necessarily close all violations for a condition. If you're alerting on an ephemeral service, or on a sporadic signal, you'll want to choose this action to ensure that violations are closed properly. The GraphQL node name for this is \"closeViolationsOnExpiration\" Open new violations: This will open a new violation when the signal is considered lost. These violations will indicate that they are due to a loss of signal. Based on your incident preferences, this should trigger a notification. The graphQL node name for this is \"openViolationOnExpiration\" When you enable both actions, we'll close all open violations first, and then open a new violation for loss of signal. To create a NRQL alert configured with loss of signal detection in the UI: For a policy, when you create a condition, under Select a product, click NRQL, then click Next, define thresholds. Write a NRQL query that returns the values you want to alert on. For Threshold type, select Static or Baseline. Click + Add lost signal threshold, then set the signal expiration duration time in minutes or seconds in the Signal is lost after field. Choose what you want to happen when the signal is lost. You can check one or both of Close all current open violations and Open new \"lost signal\" violation. These control how loss of signal violations will be handled for the condition. Make sure you name your condition before you save it. Violations open due to loss of signal close when the signal comes back. Newly opened lost signal violations will close immediately when new data is evaluated. the condition they belong to expires. By default, conditions expire after 3 days. you manually close the violation with the Close all current open violations option. Tip Loss of signal detection doesn't work on NRQL queries that use nested aggregation or sub-queries. Advanced signal settings When creating a NRQL alert condition, the advanced signal settings gives you better control over streaming alert data and helps you avoid false alarms. When creating a NRQL condition, there are several advanced signal settings: Aggregation window Evaluation offset Fill data gaps To read an explanation of what these settings are and how they relate to each other, see Streaming alerts concepts. Below are instructions and tips on how to configure them. Aggregation window You can set the aggregation window duration to choose how long data is accumulated in a streaming time window before it's aggregated. You can set it to anything between one second and 15 minutes. The default is one minute. Tip Baseline alert condition thresholds don't support editing the aggregation window. They use the 1 minute default. Evaluation offset You can adjust the evaluation offset to coordinate our streaming alerting algorithm with your data's latency. If it takes a while for your data to arrive, then you may need to increase the evaluation offset. The total supported latency is the product of the aggregation window duration multiplied by the evaluation offset. In the example screenshot above, the supported latency is 3 minutes (a 1-minute aggregation window multiplied by three windows). If the data type comes from an APM language agent and is aggregated from many app instances (for example, Transactions, TransactionErrors, etc.), we recommend using an evaluation offset of 3 with 1 minute aggregation windows. Important When creating NRQL conditions for data collected from Infrastructure Cloud Integrations such as AWS Cloudwatch or Azure, we recommend that you start with an evaluation offset of 15 minutes, then adjust up or down depending on how long it takes to collect your data. Fill data gaps Gap filling lets you customize the values to use when your signals don't have any data. You can fill gaps in your data streams with one of these settings: None: (Default) Choose this if you don't want to take any action on empty aggregation windows. On evaluation, an empty aggregation window will reset the threshold duration timer. For example, if a condition says that all aggregation windows must have data points above the threshold for 5 minutes, and 1 of the 5 aggregation windows is empty, then the condition won't be in violation. Custom static value: Choose this if you'd like to insert a custom static value into the empty aggregation windows before they're evaluated. This option has an additional, required parameter of fillValue (as named in the API) that specifies what static value should be used. This defaults to 0. Last known value: This option inserts the last seen value before evaluation occurs. We maintain the state of the last seen value for 2 hours. Tip The alerts system fills gaps in actively reported signals. This signal history is dropped after 2 hours of inactivity. For gap filling, data points received after this period of inactivity are treated as new signals. To learn more about signal loss, gap filling, and how to request access to these features, see this Explorers Hub post. Options for editing data gap settings: In the NRQL conditions UI, go to Condition settings > Advanced signal settings > fill data gaps with and choose an option. If using our Nerdgraph API (preferred), this node is located at: actor : account : alerts : nrqlCondition : signal : fillOption | fillValue NerdGraph is our recommended API for this but if you're using our REST API, you can find this setting in the REST API explorer under the \"signal\" section of the Alert NRQL conditions API.",

      "body": "You can use NRQL queries to create alert conditions. Once you've defined your signal, you can further define your warning and critical threshold levels. This determines when an alerts violation is created. Read on to learn more about how to do this. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Click NRQL, and then Next, define thresholds. Tip For more information on key concepts relating to NRQL alert conditions and streaming alerts, see Streaming alerts: key terms and concepts. Create a NRQL alert condition To create a NRQL alert condition for a policy: On one.newrelic.com, in the header click Alerts & AI, then in the left sidebar click Policies. Select an existing policy or click New alert policy to create a new policy. Click Add a condition. Under Select a product click NRQL, and then click Next, define thresholds. Create a condition from a chart You can use a chart to create a NRQL alert condition. To create a NRQL alerts condition from a chart, click the chart menu , then click Create alert condition. Once you've named and customized your condition, you can add it to an existing policy or create a new one. Caution A small number of our older charts don't include the option to create an alert condition. NRQL alert syntax Here's the basic syntax for creating all NRQL alert conditions. The FACET clause is required for outlier threshold types. It's optional for static and baseline. SELECT function(attribute) FROM Event WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Copy Clause Notes SELECT function(attribute) Required Supported functions that return numbers include: apdex average count latest max min percentage percentile sum uniqueCount Tip If you use the percentile aggregator in a faceted alert condition with many facets, this may cause the following error to appear: An error occurred while fetching chart data. If you see this error, use average instead. FROM data type Required Only one data type can be targeted. Supported data types: Event Metric (RAW data points will be returned) WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Use the WHERE clause to specify a series of one or more conditions. All the operators are supported. FACET attribute Required for outlier conditions Include an optional FACET clause in your NRQL syntax depending on the threshold type: static or baseline. Use the FACET clause to separate your results by attribute and alert on each attribute independently. No LIMIT clause is allowed, but all queries will receive the maximum number of facets possible. Faceted queries can return a maximum of 5000 values for static and baseline conditions and a maximum of 500 values for outlier conditions. Important If the query returns more than the maximum number of values, the alert condition can't be created. If you create the condition and the query returns more than this number later, the alert will fail. Modify your query so that it returns a fewer number of values. Reformatting incompatible NRQL Some elements of NRQL used in charts don’t make sense in the streaming context of alerts. Here’s a list of the most common incompatible elements and suggestions for reformatting a NRQL alert query to achieve the same effect. Element Notes SINCE and UNTIL Example: SELECT percentile(largestContentfulPaint, 75) FROM PageViewTiming WHERE (appId = 837807) SINCE yesterday Copy NRQL Alerting produces a never-ending stream of windowed query results, so the SINCE and UNTIL keywords to scope the query to a point in time are not compatible. As a convenience, we automatically strip SINCE and UNTIL from a query when creating a NRQL Alert Condition from the context of a chart. TIMESERIES In NRQL queries, the TIMESERIES clause is used to return data as a time series broken out by a specified period of time. For NRQL alerts, the equivalent property of a signal is the aggregation window. histogram() The histogram() aggregation function is used to generate histograms. histogram() is not compatible with NRQL alerting: histogram aggregations can not be formatted as a time series. To create an alert from a portion of a histogram (e.g. 95th percentile), use the percentile() aggregation function. Multiple Aggregation Functions Each alert condition can only target a single aggregated stream of data. To alert on multiple streams simultaneously, you’ll need to decompose them into individual conditions within the same policy. Original Query: SELECT count(foo), average(bar), max(baz) from Transaction Copy Decomposed: SELECT count(foo) from Transaction SELECT average(bar) from Transaction SELECT max(baz) from Transaction Copy COMPARE WITH The COMPARE WITH clause is used to compare the values for two different time ranges. This type of query is incompatible with NRQL alerting. We recommend using a Baseline Alert Condition to dynamically detect deviations for a particular signal. SLIDE BY The SLIDE BY clause supports a feature known as sliding windows. With sliding windows, SLIDE BY data is gathered into \"windows\" of time that overlap with each other. These windows can help to smooth out line graphs with a lot of variation in cases where the rolling aggregate (such as a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. Sliding windows are not currently supported in NRQL alerts. LIMIT In NRQL queries, the LIMIT clause is used to control the amount of data a query returns, either the maximum number of facet values returned by FACET queries or the maximum number of items returned by SELECT * queries. LIMIT is not compatible with NRQL alerting: evaluation is always performed on the full result set. NRQL alert threshold examples Here are some common use cases for NRQL alert conditions. These queries will work for static and baseline threshold types. The outlier threshold type will require additional FACET clauses. Alert on specific segments of your data Create constrained alerts that target a specific segment of your data, such as a few key customers or a range of data. Use the WHERE clause to define those conditions. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction WHERE account_id in (91290, 102021, 20230) Copy SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction WHERE name LIKE 'Controller/checkout/%' Copy Alert on Nth percentile of your data Create alerts when an Nth percentile of your data hits a specified threshold; for example, maintaining SLA service levels. Since we evaluate the NRQL query in one-minute time windows, percentiles will be calculated for each minute separately. SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentile(databaseDuration, 75) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on max, min, avg of your data Create alerts when your data hits a certain maximum, minimum, or average; for example, ensuring that a duration or response time does not pass a certain threshold. SELECT max(duration) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on a percentage of your data Create alerts when a proportion of your data goes above or below a certain threshold. SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE duration > 2) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE httpResponseCode = '500') FROM Transaction Copy Alert on Apdex with any T-value Create alerts on Apdex, applying your own T-value for certain transactions. For example, get an alert notification when your Apdex for a T-value of 500ms on transactions for production apps goes below 0.8. SELECT apdex(duration, t:0.5) FROM Transaction WHERE appName like '%prod%' Copy Alert conditions and query order of operations By default, the aggregation window is 1 minute, but you can change the window to suit your needs. Whatever the aggregation window, New Relic will collect data for that window using the function in the NRQL alert condition’s query. The query is parsed and executed by our systems in the following order: FROM clause – which event type needs to be grabbed? WHERE clause – what can be filtered out? SELECT clause – what information needs to be returned from the now-filtered data set? Example: null value returned Let's say this is your alert condition query: SELECT count(*) FROM SyntheticCheck WHERE monitorName = 'My Cool Monitor' AND result = 'FAILURE' Copy If there are no failures for the aggregation window: The system will execute the FROM clause by grabbing all SyntheticCheck events on your account. Then it will execute the WHERE clause to filter through those events by looking only for the ones that match the monitor name and result specified. If there are still events left to scan through after completing the FROM and WHERE operations, the SELECT clause will be executed. If there are no remaining events, the SELECT clause will not be executed. This means that aggregators like count() and uniqueCount() will never return a zero value. When there is a count of 0, the SELECT clause is ignored and no data is returned, resulting in a value of NULL. Example: zero value returned If you have a data source delivering legitimate numeric zeroes, the query will return zero values and not null values. Let's say this is your alert condition query, and that MyCoolEvent is an attribute that can sometimes return a zero value. SELECT average(MyCoolAttribute) FROM MyCoolEvent Copy If, in the aggregation window being evaluated, there's at least one instance of MyCoolEvent and if the average value of all MyCoolAttribute attributes from that window is equal to zero, then a 0 value will be returned. If there are no MyCoolEvent events during that minute, then a NULL will be returned due to the order of operations. Tip For more information about this topic, you can check out our blog post on troubleshooting for zero versus null values. Tip You can determine how null values will be handled by adjusting loss of signal and gap filling settings in the Alert Conditions UI. Tip You can avoid NULL values entirely with a query order of operations shortcut. Do this by using a filter sub-clause, then including all filter elements within that sub-clause. The main body of the query will run and return data, at which point the SELECT clause will then run and apply the filter elements. The query will return a value of 0 if the filter elements result in no matching data. Here's an example: SELECT filter(count(*), WHERE result = 'SUCCESS' AND monitorName = 'My Favorite Monitor') FROM SyntheticCheck Copy Nested aggregation NRQL alerts Nested aggregation queries are a powerful way to query your data. However, they have a few restrictions that are important to note. Nested queries with a non-faceted innermost query are not currently supported Without a FACET, the inner query produces a single result, giving the outer query nothing to aggregate. If you're using a nested query, make sure your inner query is faceted. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu) ​​​​​ Copy Queries at all levels must have the same aggregation window size With an alert aggregation window of 1 minute, the inner query would produce two smaller windows of 30 seconds. In theory, these two windows could be aggregated by the outer query. However, this is not currently supported. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu TIMESERIES 30 seconds)​​ Copy Signal loss is not yet supported for nested queries For more information on signal loss, see NerdGraph API: Loss of signal and gap filling. Nested queries containing 'WITH METRIC_FORMAT' in the inner query are not currently supported You can't use a nested query containing the WITH METRIC_FORMAT in the inner query to create NRQL alert conditions. NRQL condition creation tips Here are some tips for creating and using a NRQL condition: Topic Tips Condition threshold types NRQL condition threshold types include static, baseline, and outlier. Create a description For NRQL conditions, you can create a custom description to add to each violation. Descriptions can be enhanced with variable substitution based on metadata in the specific violation. For details, see Description Query results Queries must return a number. The condition evaluates the returned number against the thresholds you've set. Time period As with all alert conditions, NRQL conditions evaluate one single minute at a time. The implicit SINCE ... UNTIL clause specifying which minute to evaluate is controlled by your Evaluation offset setting. Since very recent data may be incomplete, you may want to query data from 3 minutes ago or longer, especially for: Applications that run on multiple hosts. SyntheticCheck data: Timeouts can take 3 minutes, so 5 minutes or more is recommended. Also, if a query will generate intermittent data, consider using the sum of query results option. Lost signal threshold (loss of signal detection) You can use loss of signal detection to alert on when your data (a telemetry signal) should be considered lost. A signal loss can indicate that a service or entity is no longer online or that a periodic job failed to run. You can also use this to make sure that violations for sporadic data, such as error counts, are closed when no signal is coming in. Advanced signal settings These settings give you options for better handling continuous, streaming data signals that may sometimes be missing. These settings include the aggregation window, the evaluation offset, and an option for filling data gaps. For more on using these, see Advanced signal settings. Condition settings Use the Condition settings to: Create a concise, descriptive condition name. Provide a custom violation description for the condition that will be included in violations and notifications. Add the runbook URL to include your organization's procedures for handling incidents. You may also add this information to the custom violation description. Limits on conditions See the maximum values. Health status NRQL alert conditions don't affect an entity's health status display. Examples For more information, see: Expected NRQL syntax Examples of NRQL condition queries Alert threshold types When you create a NRQL alert, you can choose from different types of thresholds: NRQL alert threshold types Description Static This is the simplest type of NRQL threshold. It allows you to create a condition based on a NRQL query that returns a numeric value. Optional: Include a FACET clause. Baseline (Dynamic) Uses a self-adjusting condition based on the past behavior of the monitored values. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type. Outlier Looks for group behavior and values that are outliers from those groups. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type, but requires a FACET clause. Sum of query results (limited or intermittent data) Important Available only for static (basic) threshold types. If a query returns intermittent or limited data, it may be difficult to set a meaningful threshold. Missing or limited data will sometimes generate false positives or false negatives. You can use loss of signal, aggregation duration, and gap filling settings to minimize these false notifications. To avoid this problem when using the static threshold type, you can set the selector to sum of query results. This lets you set the alert on an aggregated sum instead of a value from a single harvest cycle. Up to two hours of one-minute data checks can be aggregated. The duration you select determines the width of the rolling sum and the preview chart will update accordingly. Set the loss of signal threshold Loss of signal occurs when no data matches the NRQL condition over a specific period of time. You can set your loss of signal threshold duration and and also what happens when the threshold is crossed. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Loss of signal is only available for NRQL conditions. You may also manage these settings using the GraphQL API (recommended), or the REST API. Go here for specific GraphQL API examples. Loss of signal settings: Loss of signal settings include a time duration and two possible actions. Signal loss expiration time UI label: Signal is lost after: GraphQL Node: expiration.expirationDuration Expiration duration is a timer that starts and resets when we receive a data point in the streaming alerts pipeline. If we don't receive another data point before your 'expiration time' expires, we consider that signal to be lost. This can be because no data is being sent to New Relic or the WHERE clause of your NRQL query is filtering that data out before it is streamed to the alerts pipeline. The loss of signal expiration time is independent of the threshold duration and triggers as soon as the timer expires. The maximum expiration duration is 48 hours. This is helpful when monitoring for the execution of infrequent jobs. The minimum is 30 seconds, but we recommend using at least 3-5 minutes. Loss of signal actions Once a signal is considered lost, you can close open violations, open new violations, or both. Close all current open violations: This closes all open violations that are related to a specific signal. It won't necessarily close all violations for a condition. If you're alerting on an ephemeral service, or on a sporadic signal, you'll want to choose this action to ensure that violations are closed properly. The GraphQL node name for this is \"closeViolationsOnExpiration\" Open new violations: This will open a new violation when the signal is considered lost. These violations will indicate that they are due to a loss of signal. Based on your incident preferences, this should trigger a notification. The graphQL node name for this is \"openViolationOnExpiration\" When you enable both actions, we'll close all open violations first, and then open a new violation for loss of signal. To create a NRQL alert configured with loss of signal detection in the UI: For a policy, when you create a condition, under Select a product, click NRQL, then click Next, define thresholds. Write a NRQL query that returns the values you want to alert on. For Threshold type, select Static or Baseline. Click + Add lost signal threshold, then set the signal expiration duration time in minutes or seconds in the Signal is lost after field. Choose what you want to happen when the signal is lost. You can check one or both of Close all current open violations and Open new \"lost signal\" violation. These control how loss of signal violations will be handled for the condition. Make sure you name your condition before you save it. Violations open due to loss of signal close when the signal comes back. Newly opened lost signal violations will close immediately when new data is evaluated. the condition they belong to expires. By default, conditions expire after 3 days. you manually close the violation with the Close all current open violations option. Tip Loss of signal detection doesn't work on NRQL queries that use nested aggregation or sub-queries. Advanced signal settings When creating a NRQL alert condition, the advanced signal settings gives you better control over streaming alert data and helps you avoid false alarms. When creating a NRQL condition, there are several advanced signal settings: Aggregation window Evaluation offset Fill data gaps To read an explanation of what these settings are and how they relate to each other, see Streaming alerts concepts. Below are instructions and tips on how to configure them. Aggregation window You can set the aggregation window duration to choose how long data is accumulated in a streaming time window before it's aggregated. You can set it to anything between one second and 15 minutes. The default is one minute. Tip Baseline alert condition thresholds don't support editing the aggregation window. They use the 1 minute default. Evaluation offset You can adjust the evaluation offset to coordinate our streaming alerting algorithm with your data's latency. If it takes a while for your data to arrive, then you may need to increase the evaluation offset. The total supported latency is the product of the aggregation window duration multiplied by the evaluation offset. In the example screenshot above, the supported latency is 3 minutes (a 1-minute aggregation window multiplied by three windows). If the data type comes from an APM language agent and is aggregated from many app instances (for example, Transactions, TransactionErrors, etc.), we recommend using an evaluation offset of 3 with 1 minute aggregation windows. Important When creating NRQL conditions for data collected from Infrastructure Cloud Integrations such as AWS Cloudwatch or Azure, we recommend that you start with an evaluation offset of 15 minutes, then adjust up or down depending on how long it takes to collect your data. Fill data gaps Gap filling lets you customize the values to use when your signals don't have any data. You can fill gaps in your data streams with one of these settings: None: (Default) Choose this if you don't want to take any action on empty aggregation windows. On evaluation, an empty aggregation window will reset the threshold duration timer. For example, if a condition says that all aggregation windows must have data points above the threshold for 5 minutes, and 1 of the 5 aggregation windows is empty, then the condition won't be in violation. Custom static value: Choose this if you'd like to insert a custom static value into the empty aggregation windows before they're evaluated. This option has an additional, required parameter of fillValue (as named in the API) that specifies what static value should be used. This defaults to 0. Last known value: This option inserts the last seen value before evaluation occurs. We maintain the state of the last seen value for 2 hours. Tip The alerts system fills gaps in actively reported signals. This signal history is dropped after 2 hours of inactivity. For gap filling, data points received after this period of inactivity are treated as new signals. To learn more about signal loss, gap filling, and how to request access to these features, see this Explorers Hub post. Options for editing data gap settings: In the NRQL conditions UI, go to Condition settings > Advanced signal settings > fill data gaps with and choose an option. If using our Nerdgraph API (preferred), this node is located at: actor : account : alerts : nrqlCondition : signal : fillOption | fillValue NerdGraph is our recommended API for this but if you're using our REST API, you can find this setting in the REST API explorer under the \"signal\" section of the Alert NRQL conditions API.",

      "body": "You can use NRQL queries to create alert conditions. Once you've defined your signal, you can further define your warning and critical threshold levels. This determines when an alerts violation is created. Read on to learn more about how to do this. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Click NRQL, and then Next, define thresholds. Tip For more information on key concepts relating to NRQL alert conditions and streaming alerts, see Streaming alerts: key terms and concepts. Create a NRQL alert condition To create a NRQL alert condition for a policy: On one.newrelic.com, in the header click Alerts & AI, then in the left sidebar click Policies. Select an existing policy or click New alert policy to create a new policy. Click Add a condition. Under Select a product click NRQL, and then click Next, define thresholds. Create a condition from a chart You can use a chart to create a NRQL alert condition. To create a NRQL alerts condition from a chart, click the chart menu , then click Create alert condition. Once you've named and customized your condition, you can add it to an existing policy or create a new one. Caution A small number of our older charts don't include the option to create an alert condition. NRQL alert syntax Here's the basic syntax for creating all NRQL alert conditions. The FACET clause is required for outlier threshold types. It's optional for static and baseline. SELECT function(attribute) FROM Event WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Copy Clause Notes SELECT function(attribute) Required Supported functions that return numbers include: apdex average count latest max min percentage percentile sum uniqueCount Tip If you use the percentile aggregator in a faceted alert condition with many facets, this may cause the following error to appear: An error occurred while fetching chart data. If you see this error, use average instead. FROM data type Required Only one data type can be targeted. Supported data types: Event Metric (RAW data points will be returned) WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Use the WHERE clause to specify a series of one or more conditions. All the operators are supported. FACET attribute Required for outlier conditions Include an optional FACET clause in your NRQL syntax depending on the threshold type: static or baseline. Use the FACET clause to separate your results by attribute and alert on each attribute independently. No LIMIT clause is allowed, but all queries will receive the maximum number of facets possible. Faceted queries can return a maximum of 5000 values for static and baseline conditions and a maximum of 500 values for outlier conditions. Important If the query returns more than the maximum number of values, the alert condition can't be created. If you create the condition and the query returns more than this number later, the alert will fail. Modify your query so that it returns a fewer number of values. Reformatting incompatible NRQL Some elements of NRQL used in charts don’t make sense in the streaming context of alerts. Here’s a list of the most common incompatible elements and suggestions for reformatting a NRQL alert query to achieve the same effect. Element Notes SINCE and UNTIL Example: SELECT percentile(largestContentfulPaint, 75) FROM PageViewTiming WHERE (appId = 837807) SINCE yesterday Copy NRQL Alerting produces a never-ending stream of windowed query results, so the SINCE and UNTIL keywords to scope the query to a point in time are not compatible. As a convenience, we automatically strip SINCE and UNTIL from a query when creating a NRQL Alert Condition from the context of a chart. TIMESERIES In NRQL queries, the TIMESERIES clause is used to return data as a time series broken out by a specified period of time. For NRQL alerts, the equivalent property of a signal is the aggregation window. histogram() The histogram() aggregation function is used to generate histograms. histogram() is not compatible with NRQL alerting: histogram aggregations can not be formatted as a time series. To create an alert from a portion of a histogram (e.g. 95th percentile), use the percentile() aggregation function. Multiple Aggregation Functions Each alert condition can only target a single aggregated stream of data. To alert on multiple streams simultaneously, you’ll need to decompose them into individual conditions within the same policy. Original Query: SELECT count(foo), average(bar), max(baz) from Transaction Copy Decomposed: SELECT count(foo) from Transaction SELECT average(bar) from Transaction SELECT max(baz) from Transaction Copy COMPARE WITH The COMPARE WITH clause is used to compare the values for two different time ranges. This type of query is incompatible with NRQL alerting. We recommend using a Baseline Alert Condition to dynamically detect deviations for a particular signal. SLIDE BY The SLIDE BY clause supports a feature known as sliding windows. With sliding windows, SLIDE BY data is gathered into \"windows\" of time that overlap with each other. These windows can help to smooth out line graphs with a lot of variation in cases where the rolling aggregate (such as a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. Sliding windows are not currently supported in NRQL alerts. LIMIT In NRQL queries, the LIMIT clause is used to control the amount of data a query returns, either the maximum number of facet values returned by FACET queries or the maximum number of items returned by SELECT * queries. LIMIT is not compatible with NRQL alerting: evaluation is always performed on the full result set. NRQL alert threshold examples Here are some common use cases for NRQL alert conditions. These queries will work for static and baseline threshold types. The outlier threshold type will require additional FACET clauses. Alert on specific segments of your data Create constrained alerts that target a specific segment of your data, such as a few key customers or a range of data. Use the WHERE clause to define those conditions. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction WHERE account_id in (91290, 102021, 20230) Copy SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction WHERE name LIKE 'Controller/checkout/%' Copy Alert on Nth percentile of your data Create alerts when an Nth percentile of your data hits a specified threshold; for example, maintaining SLA service levels. Since we evaluate the NRQL query in one-minute time windows, percentiles will be calculated for each minute separately. SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentile(databaseDuration, 75) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on max, min, avg of your data Create alerts when your data hits a certain maximum, minimum, or average; for example, ensuring that a duration or response time does not pass a certain threshold. SELECT max(duration) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on a percentage of your data Create alerts when a proportion of your data goes above or below a certain threshold. SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE duration > 2) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE httpResponseCode = '500') FROM Transaction Copy Alert on Apdex with any T-value Create alerts on Apdex, applying your own T-value for certain transactions. For example, get an alert notification when your Apdex for a T-value of 500ms on transactions for production apps goes below 0.8. SELECT apdex(duration, t:0.5) FROM Transaction WHERE appName like '%prod%' Copy Alert conditions and query order of operations By default, the aggregation window is 1 minute, but you can change the window to suit your needs. Whatever the aggregation window, New Relic will collect data for that window using the function in the NRQL alert condition’s query. The query is parsed and executed by our systems in the following order: FROM clause – which event type needs to be grabbed? WHERE clause – what can be filtered out? SELECT clause – what information needs to be returned from the now-filtered data set? Example: null value returned Let's say this is your alert condition query: SELECT count(*) FROM SyntheticCheck WHERE monitorName = 'My Cool Monitor' AND result = 'FAILURE' Copy If there are no failures for the aggregation window: The system will execute the FROM clause by grabbing all SyntheticCheck events on your account. Then it will execute the WHERE clause to filter through those events by looking only for the ones that match the monitor name and result specified. If there are still events left to scan through after completing the FROM and WHERE operations, the SELECT clause will be executed. If there are no remaining events, the SELECT clause will not be executed. This means that aggregators like count() and uniqueCount() will never return a zero value. When there is a count of 0, the SELECT clause is ignored and no data is returned, resulting in a value of NULL. Example: zero value returned If you have a data source delivering legitimate numeric zeroes, the query will return zero values and not null values. Let's say this is your alert condition query, and that MyCoolEvent is an attribute that can sometimes return a zero value. SELECT average(MyCoolAttribute) FROM MyCoolEvent Copy If, in the aggregation window being evaluated, there's at least one instance of MyCoolEvent and if the average value of all MyCoolAttribute attributes from that window is equal to zero, then a 0 value will be returned. If there are no MyCoolEvent events during that minute, then a NULL will be returned due to the order of operations. Tip For more information about this topic, you can check out our blog post on troubleshooting for zero versus null values. Tip You can determine how null values will be handled by adjusting loss of signal and gap filling settings in the Alert Conditions UI. Tip You can avoid NULL values entirely with a query order of operations shortcut. Do this by using a filter sub-clause, then including all filter elements within that sub-clause. The main body of the query will run and return data, at which point the SELECT clause will then run and apply the filter elements. The query will return a value of 0 if the filter elements result in no matching data. Here's an example: SELECT filter(count(*), WHERE result = 'SUCCESS' AND monitorName = 'My Favorite Monitor') FROM SyntheticCheck Copy Nested aggregation NRQL alerts Nested aggregation queries are a powerful way to query your data. However, they have a few restrictions that are important to note. Nested queries with a non-faceted innermost query are not currently supported Without a FACET, the inner query produces a single result, giving the outer query nothing to aggregate. If you're using a nested query, make sure your inner query is faceted. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu) ​​​​​ Copy Queries at all levels must have the same aggregation window size With an alert aggregation window of 1 minute, the inner query would produce two smaller windows of 30 seconds. In theory, these two windows could be aggregated by the outer query. However, this is not currently supported. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu TIMESERIES 30 seconds)​​ Copy Signal loss is not yet supported for nested queries For more information on signal loss, see NerdGraph API: Loss of signal and gap filling. Nested queries containing 'WITH METRIC_FORMAT' in the inner query are not currently supported You can't use a nested query containing the WITH METRIC_FORMAT in the inner query to create NRQL alert conditions. NRQL condition creation tips Here are some tips for creating and using a NRQL condition: Topic Tips Condition threshold types NRQL condition threshold types include static, baseline, and outlier. Create a description For NRQL conditions, you can create a custom description to add to each violation. Descriptions can be enhanced with variable substitution based on metadata in the specific violation. For details, see Description Query results Queries must return a number. The condition evaluates the returned number against the thresholds you've set. Time period As with all alert conditions, NRQL conditions evaluate one single minute at a time. The implicit SINCE ... UNTIL clause specifying which minute to evaluate is controlled by your Evaluation offset setting. Since very recent data may be incomplete, you may want to query data from 3 minutes ago or longer, especially for: Applications that run on multiple hosts. SyntheticCheck data: Timeouts can take 3 minutes, so 5 minutes or more is recommended. Also, if a query will generate intermittent data, consider using the sum of query results option. Lost signal threshold (loss of signal detection) You can use loss of signal detection to alert on when your data (a telemetry signal) should be considered lost. A signal loss can indicate that a service or entity is no longer online or that a periodic job failed to run. You can also use this to make sure that violations for sporadic data, such as error counts, are closed when no signal is coming in. Advanced signal settings These settings give you options for better handling continuous, streaming data signals that may sometimes be missing. These settings include the aggregation window, the evaluation offset, and an option for filling data gaps. For more on using these, see Advanced signal settings. Condition settings Use the Condition settings to: Create a concise, descriptive condition name. Provide a custom violation description for the condition that will be included in violations and notifications. Add the runbook URL to include your organization's procedures for handling incidents. You may also add this information to the custom violation description. Limits on conditions See the maximum values. Health status NRQL alert conditions don't affect an entity's health status display. Examples For more information, see: Expected NRQL syntax Examples of NRQL condition queries Alert threshold types When you create a NRQL alert, you can choose from different types of thresholds: NRQL alert threshold types Description Static This is the simplest type of NRQL threshold. It allows you to create a condition based on a NRQL query that returns a numeric value. Optional: Include a FACET clause. Baseline (Dynamic) Uses a self-adjusting condition based on the past behavior of the monitored values. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type. Outlier Looks for group behavior and values that are outliers from those groups. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type, but requires a FACET clause. Sum of query results (limited or intermittent data) Important Available only for static (basic) threshold types. If a query returns intermittent or limited data, it may be difficult to set a meaningful threshold. Missing or limited data will sometimes generate false positives or false negatives. You can use loss of signal, aggregation duration, and gap filling settings to minimize these false notifications. To avoid this problem when using the static threshold type, you can set the selector to sum of query results. This lets you set the alert on an aggregated sum instead of a value from a single harvest cycle. Up to two hours of one-minute data checks can be aggregated. The duration you select determines the width of the rolling sum and the preview chart will update accordingly. Set the loss of signal threshold Loss of signal occurs when no data matches the NRQL condition over a specific period of time. You can set your loss of signal threshold duration and and also what happens when the threshold is crossed. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Loss of signal is only available for NRQL conditions. You may also manage these settings using the GraphQL API (recommended), or the REST API. Go here for specific GraphQL API examples. Loss of signal settings: Loss of signal settings include a time duration and two possible actions. Signal loss expiration time UI label: Signal is lost after: GraphQL Node: expiration.expirationDuration Expiration duration is a timer that starts and resets when we receive a data point in the streaming alerts pipeline. If we don't receive another data point before your 'expiration time' expires, we consider that signal to be lost. This can be because no data is being sent to New Relic or the WHERE clause of your NRQL query is filtering that data out before it is streamed to the alerts pipeline. The loss of signal expiration time is independent of the threshold duration and triggers as soon as the timer expires. The maximum expiration duration is 48 hours. This is helpful when monitoring for the execution of infrequent jobs. The minimum is 30 seconds, but we recommend using at least 3-5 minutes. Loss of signal actions Once a signal is considered lost, you can close open violations, open new violations, or both. Close all current open violations: This closes all open violations that are related to a specific signal. It won't necessarily close all violations for a condition. If you're alerting on an ephemeral service, or on a sporadic signal, you'll want to choose this action to ensure that violations are closed properly. The GraphQL node name for this is \"closeViolationsOnExpiration\" Open new violations: This will open a new violation when the signal is considered lost. These violations will indicate that they are due to a loss of signal. Based on your incident preferences, this should trigger a notification. The graphQL node name for this is \"openViolationOnExpiration\" When you enable both actions, we'll close all open violations first, and then open a new violation for loss of signal. To create a NRQL alert configured with loss of signal detection in the UI: For a policy, when you create a condition, under Select a product, click NRQL, then click Next, define thresholds. Write a NRQL query that returns the values you want to alert on. For Threshold type, select Static or Baseline. Click + Add lost signal threshold, then set the signal expiration duration time in minutes or seconds in the Signal is lost after field. Choose what you want to happen when the signal is lost. You can check one or both of Close all current open violations and Open new \"lost signal\" violation. These control how loss of signal violations will be handled for the condition. Make sure you name your condition before you save it. Violations open due to loss of signal close when the signal comes back. Newly opened lost signal violations will close immediately when new data is evaluated. the condition they belong to expires. By default, conditions expire after 3 days. you manually close the violation with the Close all current open violations option. Tip Loss of signal detection doesn't work on NRQL queries that use nested aggregation or sub-queries. Advanced signal settings When creating a NRQL alert condition, the advanced signal settings gives you better control over streaming alert data and helps you avoid false alarms. When creating a NRQL condition, there are several advanced signal settings: Aggregation window Evaluation offset Fill data gaps To read an explanation of what these settings are and how they relate to each other, see Streaming alerts concepts. Below are instructions and tips on how to configure them. Aggregation window You can set the aggregation window duration to choose how long data is accumulated in a streaming time window before it's aggregated. You can set it to anything between one second and 15 minutes. The default is one minute. Tip Baseline alert condition thresholds don't support editing the aggregation window. They use the 1 minute default. Evaluation offset You can adjust the evaluation offset to coordinate our streaming alerting algorithm with your data's latency. If it takes a while for your data to arrive, then you may need to increase the evaluation offset. The total supported latency is the product of the aggregation window duration multiplied by the evaluation offset. In the example screenshot above, the supported latency is 3 minutes (a 1-minute aggregation window multiplied by three windows). If the data type comes from an APM language agent and is aggregated from many app instances (for example, Transactions, TransactionErrors, etc.), we recommend using an evaluation offset of 3 with 1 minute aggregation windows. Important When creating NRQL conditions for data collected from Infrastructure Cloud Integrations such as AWS Cloudwatch or Azure, we recommend that you start with an evaluation offset of 15 minutes, then adjust up or down depending on how long it takes to collect your data. Fill data gaps Gap filling lets you customize the values to use when your signals don't have any data. You can fill gaps in your data streams with one of these settings: None: (Default) Choose this if you don't want to take any action on empty aggregation windows. On evaluation, an empty aggregation window will reset the threshold duration timer. For example, if a condition says that all aggregation windows must have data points above the threshold for 5 minutes, and 1 of the 5 aggregation windows is empty, then the condition won't be in violation. Custom static value: Choose this if you'd like to insert a custom static value into the empty aggregation windows before they're evaluated. This option has an additional, required parameter of fillValue (as named in the API) that specifies what static value should be used. This defaults to 0. Last known value: This option inserts the last seen value before evaluation occurs. We maintain the state of the last seen value for 2 hours. Tip The alerts system fills gaps in actively reported signals. This signal history is dropped after 2 hours of inactivity. For gap filling, data points received after this period of inactivity are treated as new signals. To learn more about signal loss, gap filling, and how to request access to these features, see this Explorers Hub post. Options for editing data gap settings: In the NRQL conditions UI, go to Condition settings > Advanced signal settings > fill data gaps with and choose an option. If using our Nerdgraph API (preferred), this node is located at: actor : account : alerts : nrqlCondition : signal : fillOption | fillValue NerdGraph is our recommended API for this but if you're using our REST API, you can find this setting in the REST API explorer under the \"signal\" section of the Alert NRQL conditions API.",

      "body": "You can use NRQL queries to create alert conditions. Once you've defined your signal, you can further define your warning and critical threshold levels. This determines when an alerts violation is created. Read on to learn more about how to do this. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Click NRQL, and then Next, define thresholds. Tip For more information on key concepts relating to NRQL alert conditions and streaming alerts, see Streaming alerts: key terms and concepts. Create a NRQL alert condition To create a NRQL alert condition for a policy: On one.newrelic.com, in the header click Alerts & AI, then in the left sidebar click Policies. Select an existing policy or click New alert policy to create a new policy. Click Add a condition. Under Select a product click NRQL, and then click Next, define thresholds. Create a condition from a chart You can use a chart to create a NRQL alert condition. To create a NRQL alerts condition from a chart, click the chart menu , then click Create alert condition. Once you've named and customized your condition, you can add it to an existing policy or create a new one. Caution A small number of our older charts don't include the option to create an alert condition. NRQL alert syntax Here's the basic syntax for creating all NRQL alert conditions. The FACET clause is required for outlier threshold types. It's optional for static and baseline. SELECT function(attribute) FROM Event WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Copy Clause Notes SELECT function(attribute) Required Supported functions that return numbers include: apdex average count latest max min percentage percentile sum uniqueCount Tip If you use the percentile aggregator in a faceted alert condition with many facets, this may cause the following error to appear: An error occurred while fetching chart data. If you see this error, use average instead. FROM data type Required Only one data type can be targeted. Supported data types: Event Metric (RAW data points will be returned) WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Use the WHERE clause to specify a series of one or more conditions. All the operators are supported. FACET attribute Required for outlier conditions Include an optional FACET clause in your NRQL syntax depending on the threshold type: static or baseline. Use the FACET clause to separate your results by attribute and alert on each attribute independently. No LIMIT clause is allowed, but all queries will receive the maximum number of facets possible. Faceted queries can return a maximum of 5000 values for static and baseline conditions and a maximum of 500 values for outlier conditions. Important If the query returns more than the maximum number of values, the alert condition can't be created. If you create the condition and the query returns more than this number later, the alert will fail. Modify your query so that it returns a fewer number of values. Reformatting incompatible NRQL Some elements of NRQL used in charts don’t make sense in the streaming context of alerts. Here’s a list of the most common incompatible elements and suggestions for reformatting a NRQL alert query to achieve the same effect. Element Notes SINCE and UNTIL Example: SELECT percentile(largestContentfulPaint, 75) FROM PageViewTiming WHERE (appId = 837807) SINCE yesterday Copy NRQL Alerting produces a never-ending stream of windowed query results, so the SINCE and UNTIL keywords to scope the query to a point in time are not compatible. As a convenience, we automatically strip SINCE and UNTIL from a query when creating a NRQL Alert Condition from the context of a chart. TIMESERIES In NRQL queries, the TIMESERIES clause is used to return data as a time series broken out by a specified period of time. For NRQL alerts, the equivalent property of a signal is the aggregation window. histogram() The histogram() aggregation function is used to generate histograms. histogram() is not compatible with NRQL alerting: histogram aggregations can not be formatted as a time series. To create an alert from a portion of a histogram (e.g. 95th percentile), use the percentile() aggregation function. Multiple Aggregation Functions Each alert condition can only target a single aggregated stream of data. To alert on multiple streams simultaneously, you’ll need to decompose them into individual conditions within the same policy. Original Query: SELECT count(foo), average(bar), max(baz) from Transaction Copy Decomposed: SELECT count(foo) from Transaction SELECT average(bar) from Transaction SELECT max(baz) from Transaction Copy COMPARE WITH The COMPARE WITH clause is used to compare the values for two different time ranges. This type of query is incompatible with NRQL alerting. We recommend using a Baseline Alert Condition to dynamically detect deviations for a particular signal. SLIDE BY The SLIDE BY clause supports a feature known as sliding windows. With sliding windows, SLIDE BY data is gathered into \"windows\" of time that overlap with each other. These windows can help to smooth out line graphs with a lot of variation in cases where the rolling aggregate (such as a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. Sliding windows are not currently supported in NRQL alerts. LIMIT In NRQL queries, the LIMIT clause is used to control the amount of data a query returns, either the maximum number of facet values returned by FACET queries or the maximum number of items returned by SELECT * queries. LIMIT is not compatible with NRQL alerting: evaluation is always performed on the full result set. NRQL alert threshold examples Here are some common use cases for NRQL alert conditions. These queries will work for static and baseline threshold types. The outlier threshold type will require additional FACET clauses. Alert on specific segments of your data Create constrained alerts that target a specific segment of your data, such as a few key customers or a range of data. Use the WHERE clause to define those conditions. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction WHERE account_id in (91290, 102021, 20230) Copy SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction WHERE name LIKE 'Controller/checkout/%' Copy Alert on Nth percentile of your data Create alerts when an Nth percentile of your data hits a specified threshold; for example, maintaining SLA service levels. Since we evaluate the NRQL query in one-minute time windows, percentiles will be calculated for each minute separately. SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentile(databaseDuration, 75) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on max, min, avg of your data Create alerts when your data hits a certain maximum, minimum, or average; for example, ensuring that a duration or response time does not pass a certain threshold. SELECT max(duration) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on a percentage of your data Create alerts when a proportion of your data goes above or below a certain threshold. SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE duration > 2) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE httpResponseCode = '500') FROM Transaction Copy Alert on Apdex with any T-value Create alerts on Apdex, applying your own T-value for certain transactions. For example, get an alert notification when your Apdex for a T-value of 500ms on transactions for production apps goes below 0.8. SELECT apdex(duration, t:0.5) FROM Transaction WHERE appName like '%prod%' Copy Alert conditions and query order of operations By default, the aggregation window is 1 minute, but you can change the window to suit your needs. Whatever the aggregation window, New Relic will collect data for that window using the function in the NRQL alert condition’s query. The query is parsed and executed by our systems in the following order: FROM clause – which event type needs to be grabbed? WHERE clause – what can be filtered out? SELECT clause – what information needs to be returned from the now-filtered data set? Example: null value returned Let's say this is your alert condition query: SELECT count(*) FROM SyntheticCheck WHERE monitorName = 'My Cool Monitor' AND result = 'FAILURE' Copy If there are no failures for the aggregation window: The system will execute the FROM clause by grabbing all SyntheticCheck events on your account. Then it will execute the WHERE clause to filter through those events by looking only for the ones that match the monitor name and result specified. If there are still events left to scan through after completing the FROM and WHERE operations, the SELECT clause will be executed. If there are no remaining events, the SELECT clause will not be executed. This means that aggregators like count() and uniqueCount() will never return a zero value. When there is a count of 0, the SELECT clause is ignored and no data is returned, resulting in a value of NULL. Example: zero value returned If you have a data source delivering legitimate numeric zeroes, the query will return zero values and not null values. Let's say this is your alert condition query, and that MyCoolEvent is an attribute that can sometimes return a zero value. SELECT average(MyCoolAttribute) FROM MyCoolEvent Copy If, in the aggregation window being evaluated, there's at least one instance of MyCoolEvent and if the average value of all MyCoolAttribute attributes from that window is equal to zero, then a 0 value will be returned. If there are no MyCoolEvent events during that minute, then a NULL will be returned due to the order of operations. Tip For more information about this topic, you can check out our blog post on troubleshooting for zero versus null values. Tip You can determine how null values will be handled by adjusting loss of signal and gap filling settings in the Alert Conditions UI. Tip You can avoid NULL values entirely with a query order of operations shortcut. Do this by using a filter sub-clause, then including all filter elements within that sub-clause. The main body of the query will run and return data, at which point the SELECT clause will then run and apply the filter elements. The query will return a value of 0 if the filter elements result in no matching data. Here's an example: SELECT filter(count(*), WHERE result = 'SUCCESS' AND monitorName = 'My Favorite Monitor') FROM SyntheticCheck Copy Nested aggregation NRQL alerts Nested aggregation queries are a powerful way to query your data. However, they have a few restrictions that are important to note. Nested queries with a non-faceted innermost query are not currently supported Without a FACET, the inner query produces a single result, giving the outer query nothing to aggregate. If you're using a nested query, make sure your inner query is faceted. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu) ​​​​​ Copy Queries at all levels must have the same aggregation window size With an alert aggregation window of 1 minute, the inner query would produce two smaller windows of 30 seconds. In theory, these two windows could be aggregated by the outer query. However, this is not currently supported. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu TIMESERIES 30 seconds)​​ Copy Signal loss is not yet supported for nested queries For more information on signal loss, see NerdGraph API: Loss of signal and gap filling. Nested queries containing 'WITH METRIC_FORMAT' in the inner query are not currently supported You can't use a nested query containing the WITH METRIC_FORMAT in the inner query to create NRQL alert conditions. NRQL condition creation tips Here are some tips for creating and using a NRQL condition: Topic Tips Condition threshold types NRQL condition threshold types include static, baseline, and outlier. Create a description For NRQL conditions, you can create a custom description to add to each violation. Descriptions can be enhanced with variable substitution based on metadata in the specific violation. For details, see Description Query results Queries must return a number. The condition evaluates the returned number against the thresholds you've set. Time period As with all alert conditions, NRQL conditions evaluate one single minute at a time. The implicit SINCE ... UNTIL clause specifying which minute to evaluate is controlled by your Evaluation offset setting. Since very recent data may be incomplete, you may want to query data from 3 minutes ago or longer, especially for: Applications that run on multiple hosts. SyntheticCheck data: Timeouts can take 3 minutes, so 5 minutes or more is recommended. Also, if a query will generate intermittent data, consider using the sum of query results option. Lost signal threshold (loss of signal detection) You can use loss of signal detection to alert on when your data (a telemetry signal) should be considered lost. A signal loss can indicate that a service or entity is no longer online or that a periodic job failed to run. You can also use this to make sure that violations for sporadic data, such as error counts, are closed when no signal is coming in. Advanced signal settings These settings give you options for better handling continuous, streaming data signals that may sometimes be missing. These settings include the aggregation window, the evaluation offset, and an option for filling data gaps. For more on using these, see Advanced signal settings. Condition settings Use the Condition settings to: Create a concise, descriptive condition name. Provide a custom violation description for the condition that will be included in violations and notifications. Add the runbook URL to include your organization's procedures for handling incidents. You may also add this information to the custom violation description. Limits on conditions See the maximum values. Health status NRQL alert conditions don't affect an entity's health status display. Examples For more information, see: Expected NRQL syntax Examples of NRQL condition queries Alert threshold types When you create a NRQL alert, you can choose from different types of thresholds: NRQL alert threshold types Description Static This is the simplest type of NRQL threshold. It allows you to create a condition based on a NRQL query that returns a numeric value. Optional: Include a FACET clause. Baseline (Dynamic) Uses a self-adjusting condition based on the past behavior of the monitored values. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type. Outlier Looks for group behavior and values that are outliers from those groups. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type, but requires a FACET clause. Sum of query results (limited or intermittent data) Important Available only for static (basic) threshold types. If a query returns intermittent or limited data, it may be difficult to set a meaningful threshold. Missing or limited data will sometimes generate false positives or false negatives. You can use loss of signal, aggregation duration, and gap filling settings to minimize these false notifications. To avoid this problem when using the static threshold type, you can set the selector to sum of query results. This lets you set the alert on an aggregated sum instead of a value from a single harvest cycle. Up to two hours of one-minute data checks can be aggregated. The duration you select determines the width of the rolling sum and the preview chart will update accordingly. Set the loss of signal threshold Loss of signal occurs when no data matches the NRQL condition over a specific period of time. You can set your loss of signal threshold duration and and also what happens when the threshold is crossed. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Loss of signal is only available for NRQL conditions. You may also manage these settings using the GraphQL API (recommended), or the REST API. Go here for specific GraphQL API examples. Loss of signal settings: Loss of signal settings include a time duration and two possible actions. Signal loss expiration time UI label: Signal is lost after: GraphQL Node: expiration.expirationDuration Expiration duration is a timer that starts and resets when we receive a data point in the streaming alerts pipeline. If we don't receive another data point before your 'expiration time' expires, we consider that signal to be lost. This can be because no data is being sent to New Relic or the WHERE clause of your NRQL query is filtering that data out before it is streamed to the alerts pipeline. The loss of signal expiration time is independent of the threshold duration and triggers as soon as the timer expires. The maximum expiration duration is 48 hours. This is helpful when monitoring for the execution of infrequent jobs. The minimum is 30 seconds, but we recommend using at least 3-5 minutes. Loss of signal actions Once a signal is considered lost, you can close open violations, open new violations, or both. Close all current open violations: This closes all open violations that are related to a specific signal. It won't necessarily close all violations for a condition. If you're alerting on an ephemeral service, or on a sporadic signal, you'll want to choose this action to ensure that violations are closed properly. The GraphQL node name for this is \"closeViolationsOnExpiration\" Open new violations: This will open a new violation when the signal is considered lost. These violations will indicate that they are due to a loss of signal. Based on your incident preferences, this should trigger a notification. The graphQL node name for this is \"openViolationOnExpiration\" When you enable both actions, we'll close all open violations first, and then open a new violation for loss of signal. To create a NRQL alert configured with loss of signal detection in the UI: For a policy, when you create a condition, under Select a product, click NRQL, then click Next, define thresholds. Write a NRQL query that returns the values you want to alert on. For Threshold type, select Static or Baseline. Click + Add lost signal threshold, then set the signal expiration duration time in minutes or seconds in the Signal is lost after field. Choose what you want to happen when the signal is lost. You can check one or both of Close all current open violations and Open new \"lost signal\" violation. These control how loss of signal violations will be handled for the condition. Make sure you name your condition before you save it. Violations open due to loss of signal close when the signal comes back. Newly opened lost signal violations will close immediately when new data is evaluated. the condition they belong to expires. By default, conditions expire after 3 days. you manually close the violation with the Close all current open violations option. Tip Loss of signal detection doesn't work on NRQL queries that use nested aggregation or sub-queries. Advanced signal settings When creating a NRQL alert condition, the advanced signal settings gives you better control over streaming alert data and helps you avoid false alarms. When creating a NRQL condition, there are several advanced signal settings: Aggregation window Evaluation offset Fill data gaps To read an explanation of what these settings are and how they relate to each other, see Streaming alerts concepts. Below are instructions and tips on how to configure them. Aggregation window You can set the aggregation window duration to choose how long data is accumulated in a streaming time window before it's aggregated. You can set it to anything between one second and 15 minutes. The default is one minute. Tip Baseline alert condition thresholds don't support editing the aggregation window. They use the 1 minute default. Evaluation offset You can adjust the evaluation offset to coordinate our streaming alerting algorithm with your data's latency. If it takes a while for your data to arrive, then you may need to increase the evaluation offset. The total supported latency is the product of the aggregation window duration multiplied by the evaluation offset. In the example screenshot above, the supported latency is 3 minutes (a 1-minute aggregation window multiplied by three windows). If the data type comes from an APM language agent and is aggregated from many app instances (for example, Transactions, TransactionErrors, etc.), we recommend using an evaluation offset of 3 with 1 minute aggregation windows. Important When creating NRQL conditions for data collected from Infrastructure Cloud Integrations such as AWS Cloudwatch or Azure, we recommend that you start with an evaluation offset of 15 minutes, then adjust up or down depending on how long it takes to collect your data. Fill data gaps Gap filling lets you customize the values to use when your signals don't have any data. You can fill gaps in your data streams with one of these settings: None: (Default) Choose this if you don't want to take any action on empty aggregation windows. On evaluation, an empty aggregation window will reset the threshold duration timer. For example, if a condition says that all aggregation windows must have data points above the threshold for 5 minutes, and 1 of the 5 aggregation windows is empty, then the condition won't be in violation. Custom static value: Choose this if you'd like to insert a custom static value into the empty aggregation windows before they're evaluated. This option has an additional, required parameter of fillValue (as named in the API) that specifies what static value should be used. This defaults to 0. Last known value: This option inserts the last seen value before evaluation occurs. We maintain the state of the last seen value for 2 hours. Tip The alerts system fills gaps in actively reported signals. This signal history is dropped after 2 hours of inactivity. For gap filling, data points received after this period of inactivity are treated as new signals. To learn more about signal loss, gap filling, and how to request access to these features, see this Explorers Hub post. Options for editing data gap settings: In the NRQL conditions UI, go to Condition settings > Advanced signal settings > fill data gaps with and choose an option. If using our Nerdgraph API (preferred), this node is located at: actor : account : alerts : nrqlCondition : signal : fillOption | fillValue NerdGraph is our recommended API for this but if you're using our REST API, you can find this setting in the REST API explorer under the \"signal\" section of the Alert NRQL conditions API.",

      "body": "You can use NRQL queries to create alert conditions. Once you've defined your signal, you can further define your warning and critical threshold levels. This determines when an alerts violation is created. Read on to learn more about how to do this. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Click NRQL, and then Next, define thresholds. Tip For more information on key concepts relating to NRQL alert conditions and streaming alerts, see Streaming alerts: key terms and concepts. Create a NRQL alert condition To create a NRQL alert condition for a policy: On one.newrelic.com, in the header click Alerts & AI, then in the left sidebar click Policies. Select an existing policy or click New alert policy to create a new policy. Click Add a condition. Under Select a product click NRQL, and then click Next, define thresholds. Create a condition from a chart You can use a chart to create a NRQL alert condition. To create a NRQL alerts condition from a chart, click the chart menu , then click Create alert condition. Once you've named and customized your condition, you can add it to an existing policy or create a new one. Caution A small number of our older charts don't include the option to create an alert condition. NRQL alert syntax Here's the basic syntax for creating all NRQL alert conditions. The FACET clause is required for outlier threshold types. It's optional for static and baseline. SELECT function(attribute) FROM Event WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Copy Clause Notes SELECT function(attribute) Required Supported functions that return numbers include: apdex average count latest max min percentage percentile sum uniqueCount Tip If you use the percentile aggregator in a faceted alert condition with many facets, this may cause the following error to appear: An error occurred while fetching chart data. If you see this error, use average instead. FROM data type Required Only one data type can be targeted. Supported data types: Event Metric (RAW data points will be returned) WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Use the WHERE clause to specify a series of one or more conditions. All the operators are supported. FACET attribute Required for outlier conditions Include an optional FACET clause in your NRQL syntax depending on the threshold type: static or baseline. Use the FACET clause to separate your results by attribute and alert on each attribute independently. No LIMIT clause is allowed, but all queries will receive the maximum number of facets possible. Faceted queries can return a maximum of 5000 values for static and baseline conditions and a maximum of 500 values for outlier conditions. Important If the query returns more than the maximum number of values, the alert condition can't be created. If you create the condition and the query returns more than this number later, the alert will fail. Modify your query so that it returns a fewer number of values. Reformatting incompatible NRQL Some elements of NRQL used in charts don’t make sense in the streaming context of alerts. Here’s a list of the most common incompatible elements and suggestions for reformatting a NRQL alert query to achieve the same effect. Element Notes SINCE and UNTIL Example: SELECT percentile(largestContentfulPaint, 75) FROM PageViewTiming WHERE (appId = 837807) SINCE yesterday Copy NRQL Alerting produces a never-ending stream of windowed query results, so the SINCE and UNTIL keywords to scope the query to a point in time are not compatible. As a convenience, we automatically strip SINCE and UNTIL from a query when creating a NRQL Alert Condition from the context of a chart. TIMESERIES In NRQL queries, the TIMESERIES clause is used to return data as a time series broken out by a specified period of time. For NRQL alerts, the equivalent property of a signal is the aggregation window. histogram() The histogram() aggregation function is used to generate histograms. histogram() is not compatible with NRQL alerting: histogram aggregations can not be formatted as a time series. To create an alert from a portion of a histogram (e.g. 95th percentile), use the percentile() aggregation function. Multiple Aggregation Functions Each alert condition can only target a single aggregated stream of data. To alert on multiple streams simultaneously, you’ll need to decompose them into individual conditions within the same policy. Original Query: SELECT count(foo), average(bar), max(baz) from Transaction Copy Decomposed: SELECT count(foo) from Transaction SELECT average(bar) from Transaction SELECT max(baz) from Transaction Copy COMPARE WITH The COMPARE WITH clause is used to compare the values for two different time ranges. This type of query is incompatible with NRQL alerting. We recommend using a Baseline Alert Condition to dynamically detect deviations for a particular signal. SLIDE BY The SLIDE BY clause supports a feature known as sliding windows. With sliding windows, SLIDE BY data is gathered into \"windows\" of time that overlap with each other. These windows can help to smooth out line graphs with a lot of variation in cases where the rolling aggregate (such as a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. Sliding windows are not currently supported in NRQL alerts. LIMIT In NRQL queries, the LIMIT clause is used to control the amount of data a query returns, either the maximum number of facet values returned by FACET queries or the maximum number of items returned by SELECT * queries. LIMIT is not compatible with NRQL alerting: evaluation is always performed on the full result set. NRQL alert threshold examples Here are some common use cases for NRQL alert conditions. These queries will work for static and baseline threshold types. The outlier threshold type will require additional FACET clauses. Alert on specific segments of your data Create constrained alerts that target a specific segment of your data, such as a few key customers or a range of data. Use the WHERE clause to define those conditions. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction WHERE account_id in (91290, 102021, 20230) Copy SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction WHERE name LIKE 'Controller/checkout/%' Copy Alert on Nth percentile of your data Create alerts when an Nth percentile of your data hits a specified threshold; for example, maintaining SLA service levels. Since we evaluate the NRQL query in one-minute time windows, percentiles will be calculated for each minute separately. SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentile(databaseDuration, 75) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on max, min, avg of your data Create alerts when your data hits a certain maximum, minimum, or average; for example, ensuring that a duration or response time does not pass a certain threshold. SELECT max(duration) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on a percentage of your data Create alerts when a proportion of your data goes above or below a certain threshold. SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE duration > 2) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE httpResponseCode = '500') FROM Transaction Copy Alert on Apdex with any T-value Create alerts on Apdex, applying your own T-value for certain transactions. For example, get an alert notification when your Apdex for a T-value of 500ms on transactions for production apps goes below 0.8. SELECT apdex(duration, t:0.5) FROM Transaction WHERE appName like '%prod%' Copy Alert conditions and query order of operations By default, the aggregation window is 1 minute, but you can change the window to suit your needs. Whatever the aggregation window, New Relic will collect data for that window using the function in the NRQL alert condition’s query. The query is parsed and executed by our systems in the following order: FROM clause – which event type needs to be grabbed? WHERE clause – what can be filtered out? SELECT clause – what information needs to be returned from the now-filtered data set? Example: null value returned Let's say this is your alert condition query: SELECT count(*) FROM SyntheticCheck WHERE monitorName = 'My Cool Monitor' AND result = 'FAILURE' Copy If there are no failures for the aggregation window: The system will execute the FROM clause by grabbing all SyntheticCheck events on your account. Then it will execute the WHERE clause to filter through those events by looking only for the ones that match the monitor name and result specified. If there are still events left to scan through after completing the FROM and WHERE operations, the SELECT clause will be executed. If there are no remaining events, the SELECT clause will not be executed. This means that aggregators like count() and uniqueCount() will never return a zero value. When there is a count of 0, the SELECT clause is ignored and no data is returned, resulting in a value of NULL. Example: zero value returned If you have a data source delivering legitimate numeric zeroes, the query will return zero values and not null values. Let's say this is your alert condition query, and that MyCoolEvent is an attribute that can sometimes return a zero value. SELECT average(MyCoolAttribute) FROM MyCoolEvent Copy If, in the aggregation window being evaluated, there's at least one instance of MyCoolEvent and if the average value of all MyCoolAttribute attributes from that window is equal to zero, then a 0 value will be returned. If there are no MyCoolEvent events during that minute, then a NULL will be returned due to the order of operations. Tip For more information about this topic, you can check out our blog post on troubleshooting for zero versus null values. Tip You can determine how null values will be handled by adjusting loss of signal and gap filling settings in the Alert Conditions UI. Tip You can avoid NULL values entirely with a query order of operations shortcut. Do this by using a filter sub-clause, then including all filter elements within that sub-clause. The main body of the query will run and return data, at which point the SELECT clause will then run and apply the filter elements. The query will return a value of 0 if the filter elements result in no matching data. Here's an example: SELECT filter(count(*), WHERE result = 'SUCCESS' AND monitorName = 'My Favorite Monitor') FROM SyntheticCheck Copy Nested aggregation NRQL alerts Nested aggregation queries are a powerful way to query your data. However, they have a few restrictions that are important to note. Nested queries with a non-faceted innermost query are not currently supported Without a FACET, the inner query produces a single result, giving the outer query nothing to aggregate. If you're using a nested query, make sure your inner query is faceted. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu) ​​​​​ Copy Queries at all levels must have the same aggregation window size With an alert aggregation window of 1 minute, the inner query would produce two smaller windows of 30 seconds. In theory, these two windows could be aggregated by the outer query. However, this is not currently supported. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu TIMESERIES 30 seconds)​​ Copy Signal loss is not yet supported for nested queries For more information on signal loss, see NerdGraph API: Loss of signal and gap filling. Nested queries containing 'WITH METRIC_FORMAT' in the inner query are not currently supported You can't use a nested query containing the WITH METRIC_FORMAT in the inner query to create NRQL alert conditions. NRQL condition creation tips Here are some tips for creating and using a NRQL condition: Topic Tips Condition threshold types NRQL condition threshold types include static, baseline, and outlier. Create a description For NRQL conditions, you can create a custom description to add to each violation. Descriptions can be enhanced with variable substitution based on metadata in the specific violation. For details, see Description Query results Queries must return a number. The condition evaluates the returned number against the thresholds you've set. Time period As with all alert conditions, NRQL conditions evaluate one single minute at a time. The implicit SINCE ... UNTIL clause specifying which minute to evaluate is controlled by your Evaluation offset setting. Since very recent data may be incomplete, you may want to query data from 3 minutes ago or longer, especially for: Applications that run on multiple hosts. SyntheticCheck data: Timeouts can take 3 minutes, so 5 minutes or more is recommended. Also, if a query will generate intermittent data, consider using the sum of query results option. Lost signal threshold (loss of signal detection) You can use loss of signal detection to alert on when your data (a telemetry signal) should be considered lost. A signal loss can indicate that a service or entity is no longer online or that a periodic job failed to run. You can also use this to make sure that violations for sporadic data, such as error counts, are closed when no signal is coming in. Advanced signal settings These settings give you options for better handling continuous, streaming data signals that may sometimes be missing. These settings include the aggregation window, the evaluation offset, and an option for filling data gaps. For more on using these, see Advanced signal settings. Condition settings Use the Condition settings to: Create a concise, descriptive condition name. Provide a custom violation description for the condition that will be included in violations and notifications. Add the runbook URL to include your organization's procedures for handling incidents. You may also add this information to the custom violation description. Limits on conditions See the maximum values. Health status NRQL alert conditions don't affect an entity's health status display. Examples For more information, see: Expected NRQL syntax Examples of NRQL condition queries Alert threshold types When you create a NRQL alert, you can choose from different types of thresholds: NRQL alert threshold types Description Static This is the simplest type of NRQL threshold. It allows you to create a condition based on a NRQL query that returns a numeric value. Optional: Include a FACET clause. Baseline (Dynamic) Uses a self-adjusting condition based on the past behavior of the monitored values. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type. Outlier Looks for group behavior and values that are outliers from those groups. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type, but requires a FACET clause. Sum of query results (limited or intermittent data) Important Available only for static (basic) threshold types. If a query returns intermittent or limited data, it may be difficult to set a meaningful threshold. Missing or limited data will sometimes generate false positives or false negatives. You can use loss of signal, aggregation duration, and gap filling settings to minimize these false notifications. To avoid this problem when using the static threshold type, you can set the selector to sum of query results. This lets you set the alert on an aggregated sum instead of a value from a single harvest cycle. Up to two hours of one-minute data checks can be aggregated. The duration you select determines the width of the rolling sum and the preview chart will update accordingly. Set the loss of signal threshold Loss of signal occurs when no data matches the NRQL condition over a specific period of time. You can set your loss of signal threshold duration and and also what happens when the threshold is crossed. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Loss of signal is only available for NRQL conditions. You may also manage these settings using the GraphQL API (recommended), or the REST API. Go here for specific GraphQL API examples. Loss of signal settings: Loss of signal settings include a time duration and two possible actions. Signal loss expiration time UI label: Signal is lost after: GraphQL Node: expiration.expirationDuration Expiration duration is a timer that starts and resets when we receive a data point in the streaming alerts pipeline. If we don't receive another data point before your 'expiration time' expires, we consider that signal to be lost. This can be because no data is being sent to New Relic or the WHERE clause of your NRQL query is filtering that data out before it is streamed to the alerts pipeline. The loss of signal expiration time is independent of the threshold duration and triggers as soon as the timer expires. The maximum expiration duration is 48 hours. This is helpful when monitoring for the execution of infrequent jobs. The minimum is 30 seconds, but we recommend using at least 3-5 minutes. Loss of signal actions Once a signal is considered lost, you can close open violations, open new violations, or both. Close all current open violations: This closes all open violations that are related to a specific signal. It won't necessarily close all violations for a condition. If you're alerting on an ephemeral service, or on a sporadic signal, you'll want to choose this action to ensure that violations are closed properly. The GraphQL node name for this is \"closeViolationsOnExpiration\" Open new violations: This will open a new violation when the signal is considered lost. These violations will indicate that they are due to a loss of signal. Based on your incident preferences, this should trigger a notification. The graphQL node name for this is \"openViolationOnExpiration\" When you enable both actions, we'll close all open violations first, and then open a new violation for loss of signal. To create a NRQL alert configured with loss of signal detection in the UI: For a policy, when you create a condition, under Select a product, click NRQL, then click Next, define thresholds. Write a NRQL query that returns the values you want to alert on. For Threshold type, select Static or Baseline. Click + Add lost signal threshold, then set the signal expiration duration time in minutes or seconds in the Signal is lost after field. Choose what you want to happen when the signal is lost. You can check one or both of Close all current open violations and Open new \"lost signal\" violation. These control how loss of signal violations will be handled for the condition. Make sure you name your condition before you save it. Violations open due to loss of signal close when the signal comes back. Newly opened lost signal violations will close immediately when new data is evaluated. the condition they belong to expires. By default, conditions expire after 3 days. you manually close the violation with the Close all current open violations option. Tip Loss of signal detection doesn't work on NRQL queries that use nested aggregation or sub-queries. Advanced signal settings When creating a NRQL alert condition, the advanced signal settings gives you better control over streaming alert data and helps you avoid false alarms. When creating a NRQL condition, there are several advanced signal settings: Aggregation window Evaluation offset Fill data gaps To read an explanation of what these settings are and how they relate to each other, see Streaming alerts concepts. Below are instructions and tips on how to configure them. Aggregation window You can set the aggregation window duration to choose how long data is accumulated in a streaming time window before it's aggregated. You can set it to anything between one second and 15 minutes. The default is one minute. Tip Baseline alert condition thresholds don't support editing the aggregation window. They use the 1 minute default. Evaluation offset You can adjust the evaluation offset to coordinate our streaming alerting algorithm with your data's latency. If it takes a while for your data to arrive, then you may need to increase the evaluation offset. The total supported latency is the product of the aggregation window duration multiplied by the evaluation offset. In the example screenshot above, the supported latency is 3 minutes (a 1-minute aggregation window multiplied by three windows). If the data type comes from an APM language agent and is aggregated from many app instances (for example, Transactions, TransactionErrors, etc.), we recommend using an evaluation offset of 3 with 1 minute aggregation windows. Important When creating NRQL conditions for data collected from Infrastructure Cloud Integrations such as AWS Cloudwatch or Azure, we recommend that you start with an evaluation offset of 15 minutes, then adjust up or down depending on how long it takes to collect your data. Fill data gaps Gap filling lets you customize the values to use when your signals don't have any data. You can fill gaps in your data streams with one of these settings: None: (Default) Choose this if you don't want to take any action on empty aggregation windows. On evaluation, an empty aggregation window will reset the threshold duration timer. For example, if a condition says that all aggregation windows must have data points above the threshold for 5 minutes, and 1 of the 5 aggregation windows is empty, then the condition won't be in violation. Custom static value: Choose this if you'd like to insert a custom static value into the empty aggregation windows before they're evaluated. This option has an additional, required parameter of fillValue (as named in the API) that specifies what static value should be used. This defaults to 0. Last known value: This option inserts the last seen value before evaluation occurs. We maintain the state of the last seen value for 2 hours. Tip The alerts system fills gaps in actively reported signals. This signal history is dropped after 2 hours of inactivity. For gap filling, data points received after this period of inactivity are treated as new signals. To learn more about signal loss, gap filling, and how to request access to these features, see this Explorers Hub post. Options for editing data gap settings: In the NRQL conditions UI, go to Condition settings > Advanced signal settings > fill data gaps with and choose an option. If using our Nerdgraph API (preferred), this node is located at: actor : account : alerts : nrqlCondition : signal : fillOption | fillValue NerdGraph is our recommended API for this but if you're using our REST API, you can find this setting in the REST API explorer under the \"signal\" section of the Alert NRQL conditions API.",

Create a NRQL alert condition To create a NRQL alert condition for a policy: On one.newrelic.com, in the header click Alerts & AI, then in the left sidebar click Policies. Select an existing policy or click New alert policy to create a new policy. Click Add a condition. Under Select a product click NRQL, and then click Next, define thresholds. Create a condition from a chart You can use a chart to create a NRQL alert condition. To create a NRQL alerts condition from a chart, click the chart menu , then click Create alert condition. Once you've named and customized your condition, you can add it to an existing policy or create a new one. Caution A small number of our older charts don't include the option to create an alert condition. NRQL alert syntax Here's the basic syntax for creating all NRQL alert conditions. The FACET clause is required for outlier threshold types. It's optional for static and baseline. SELECT function(attribute) FROM Event WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Copy Clause Notes SELECT function(attribute) Required Supported functions that return numbers include: apdex average count latest max min percentage percentile sum uniqueCount Tip If you use the percentile aggregator in a faceted alert condition with many facets, this may cause the following error to appear: An error occurred while fetching chart data. If you see this error, use average instead. FROM data type Required Only one data type can be targeted. Supported data types: Event Metric (RAW data points will be returned) WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Use the WHERE clause to specify a series of one or more conditions. All the operators are supported. FACET attribute Required for outlier conditions Include an optional FACET clause in your NRQL syntax depending on the threshold type: static or baseline. Use the FACET clause to separate your results by attribute and alert on each attribute independently. No LIMIT clause is allowed, but all queries will receive the maximum number of facets possible. Faceted queries can return a maximum of 5000 values for static and baseline conditions and a maximum of 500 values for outlier conditions. Important If the query returns more than the maximum number of values, the alert condition can't be created. If you create the condition and the query returns more than this number later, the alert will fail. Modify your query so that it returns a fewer number of values. Reformatting incompatible NRQL Some elements of NRQL used in charts don’t make sense in the streaming context of alerts. Here’s a list of the most common incompatible elements and suggestions for reformatting a NRQL alert query to achieve the same effect. Element Notes SINCE and UNTIL Example: SELECT percentile(largestContentfulPaint, 75) FROM PageViewTiming WHERE (appId = 837807) SINCE yesterday Copy NRQL Alerting produces a never-ending stream of windowed query results, so the SINCE and UNTIL keywords to scope the query to a point in time are not compatible. As a convenience, we automatically strip SINCE and UNTIL from a query when creating a NRQL Alert Condition from the context of a chart. TIMESERIES In NRQL queries, the TIMESERIES clause is used to return data as a time series broken out by a specified period of time. For NRQL alerts, the equivalent property of a signal is the aggregation window. histogram() The histogram() aggregation function is used to generate histograms. histogram() is not compatible with NRQL alerting: histogram aggregations can not be formatted as a time series. To create an alert from a portion of a histogram (e.g. 95th percentile), use the percentile() aggregation function. Multiple Aggregation Functions Each alert condition can only target a single aggregated stream of data. To alert on multiple streams simultaneously, you’ll need to decompose them into individual conditions within the same policy. Original Query: SELECT count(foo), average(bar), max(baz) from Transaction Copy Decomposed: SELECT count(foo) from Transaction SELECT average(bar) from Transaction SELECT max(baz) from Transaction Copy COMPARE WITH The COMPARE WITH clause is used to compare the values for two different time ranges. This type of query is incompatible with NRQL alerting. We recommend using a Baseline Alert Condition to dynamically detect deviations for a particular signal. SLIDE BY The SLIDE BY clause supports a feature known as sliding windows. With sliding windows, SLIDE BY data is gathered into \"windows\" of time that overlap with each other. These windows can help to smooth out line graphs with a lot of variation in cases where the rolling aggregate (such as a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. Sliding windows are not currently supported in NRQL alerts. LIMIT In NRQL queries, the LIMIT clause is used to control the amount of data a query returns, either the maximum number of facet values returned by FACET queries or the maximum number of items returned by SELECT * queries. LIMIT is not compatible with NRQL alerting: evaluation is always performed on the full result set. NRQL alert threshold examples Here are some common use cases for NRQL alert conditions. These queries will work for static and baseline threshold types. The outlier threshold type will require additional FACET clauses. Alert on specific segments of your data Create constrained alerts that target a specific segment of your data, such as a few key customers or a range of data. Use the WHERE clause to define those conditions. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction WHERE account_id in (91290, 102021, 20230) Copy SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction WHERE name LIKE 'Controller/checkout/%' Copy Alert on Nth percentile of your data Create alerts when an Nth percentile of your data hits a specified threshold; for example, maintaining SLA service levels. Since we evaluate the NRQL query in one-minute time windows, percentiles will be calculated for each minute separately. SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentile(databaseDuration, 75) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on max, min, avg of your data Create alerts when your data hits a certain maximum, minimum, or average; for example, ensuring that a duration or response time does not pass a certain threshold. SELECT max(duration) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on a percentage of your data Create alerts when a proportion of your data goes above or below a certain threshold. SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE duration > 2) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE httpResponseCode = '500') FROM Transaction Copy Alert on Apdex with any T-value Create alerts on Apdex, applying your own T-value for certain transactions. For example, get an alert notification when your Apdex for a T-value of 500ms on transactions for production apps goes below 0.8. SELECT apdex(duration, t:0.5) FROM Transaction WHERE appName like '%prod%' Copy Alert conditions and query order of operations By default, the aggregation window is 1 minute, but you can change the window to suit your needs. Whatever the aggregation window, New Relic will collect data for that window using the function in the NRQL alert condition’s query. The query is parsed and executed by our systems in the following order: FROM clause – which event type needs to be grabbed? WHERE clause – what can be filtered out? SELECT clause – what information needs to be returned from the now-filtered data set? Example: null value returned Let's say this is your alert condition query: SELECT count(*) FROM SyntheticCheck WHERE monitorName = 'My Cool Monitor' AND result = 'FAILURE' Copy If there are no failures for the aggregation window: The system will execute the FROM clause by grabbing all SyntheticCheck events on your account. Then it will execute the WHERE clause to filter through those events by looking only for the ones that match the monitor name and result specified. If there are still events left to scan through after completing the FROM and WHERE operations, the SELECT clause will be executed. If there are no remaining events, the SELECT clause will not be executed. This means that aggregators like count() and uniqueCount() will never return a zero value. When there is a count of 0, the SELECT clause is ignored and no data is returned, resulting in a value of NULL. Example: zero value returned If you have a data source delivering legitimate numeric zeroes, the query will return zero values and not null values. Let's say this is your alert condition query, and that MyCoolEvent is an attribute that can sometimes return a zero value. SELECT average(MyCoolAttribute) FROM MyCoolEvent Copy If, in the aggregation window being evaluated, there's at least one instance of MyCoolEvent and if the average value of all MyCoolAttribute attributes from that window is equal to zero, then a 0 value will be returned. If there are no MyCoolEvent events during that minute, then a NULL will be returned due to the order of operations. Tip For more information about this topic, you can check out our blog post on troubleshooting for zero versus null values. Tip You can determine how null values will be handled by adjusting loss of signal and gap filling settings in the Alert Conditions UI. Tip You can avoid NULL values entirely with a query order of operations shortcut. Do this by using a filter sub-clause, then including all filter elements within that sub-clause. The main body of the query will run and return data, at which point the SELECT clause will then run and apply the filter elements. The query will return a value of 0 if the filter elements result in no matching data. Here's an example: SELECT filter(count(*), WHERE result = 'SUCCESS' AND monitorName = 'My Favorite Monitor') FROM SyntheticCheck Copy Nested aggregation NRQL alerts Nested aggregation queries are a powerful way to query your data. However, they have a few restrictions that are important to note. Nested queries with a non-faceted innermost query are not currently supported Without a FACET, the inner query produces a single result, giving the outer query nothing to aggregate. If you're using a nested query, make sure your inner query is faceted. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu) ​​​​​ Copy Queries at all levels must have the same aggregation window size With an alert aggregation window of 1 minute, the inner query would produce two smaller windows of 30 seconds. In theory, these two windows could be aggregated by the outer query. However, this is not currently supported. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu TIMESERIES 30 seconds)​​ Copy Signal loss is not yet supported for nested queries For more information on signal loss, see NerdGraph API: Loss of signal and gap filling. Nested queries containing 'WITH METRIC_FORMAT' in the inner query are not currently supported You can't use a nested query containing the WITH METRIC_FORMAT in the inner query to create NRQL alert conditions. NRQL condition creation tips Here are some tips for creating and using a NRQL condition: Topic Tips Condition threshold types NRQL condition threshold types include static, baseline, and outlier. Create a description For NRQL conditions, you can create a custom description to add to each violation. Descriptions can be enhanced with variable substitution based on metadata in the specific violation. For details, see Description Query results Queries must return a number. The condition evaluates the returned number against the thresholds you've set. Time period As with all alert conditions, NRQL conditions evaluate one single minute at a time. The implicit SINCE ... UNTIL clause specifying which minute to evaluate is controlled by your Evaluation offset setting. Since very recent data may be incomplete, you may want to query data from 3 minutes ago or longer, especially for: Applications that run on multiple hosts. SyntheticCheck data: Timeouts can take 3 minutes, so 5 minutes or more is recommended. Also, if a query will generate intermittent data, consider using the sum of query results option. Lost signal threshold (loss of signal detection) You can use loss of signal detection to alert on when your data (a telemetry signal) should be considered lost. A signal loss can indicate that a service or entity is no longer online or that a periodic job failed to run. You can also use this to make sure that violations for sporadic data, such as error counts, are closed when no signal is coming in. Advanced signal settings These settings give you options for better handling continuous, streaming data signals that may sometimes be missing. These settings include the aggregation window, the evaluation offset, and an option for filling data gaps. For more on using these, see Advanced signal settings. Condition settings Use the Condition settings to: Create a concise, descriptive condition name. Provide a custom violation description for the condition that will be included in violations and notifications. Add the runbook URL to include your organization's procedures for handling incidents. You may also add this information to the custom violation description. Limits on conditions See the maximum values. Health status NRQL alert conditions don't affect an entity's health status display. Examples For more information, see: Expected NRQL syntax Examples of NRQL condition queries Alert threshold types When you create a NRQL alert, you can choose from different types of thresholds: NRQL alert threshold types Description Static This is the simplest type of NRQL threshold. It allows you to create a condition based on a NRQL query that returns a numeric value. Optional: Include a FACET clause. Baseline (Dynamic) Uses a self-adjusting condition based on the past behavior of the monitored values. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type. Outlier Looks for group behavior and values that are outliers from those groups. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type, but requires a FACET clause. Sum of query results (limited or intermittent data) Important Available only for static (basic) threshold types. If a query returns intermittent or limited data, it may be difficult to set a meaningful threshold. Missing or limited data will sometimes generate false positives or false negatives. You can use loss of signal, aggregation duration, and gap filling settings to minimize these false notifications. To avoid this problem when using the static threshold type, you can set the selector to sum of query results. This lets you set the alert on an aggregated sum instead of a value from a single harvest cycle. Up to two hours of one-minute data checks can be aggregated. The duration you select determines the width of the rolling sum and the preview chart will update accordingly. Set the loss of signal threshold Loss of signal occurs when no data matches the NRQL condition over a specific period of time. You can set your loss of signal threshold duration and and also what happens when the threshold is crossed. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Loss of signal is only available for NRQL conditions. You may also manage these settings using the GraphQL API (recommended), or the REST API. Go here for specific GraphQL API examples. Loss of signal settings: Loss of signal settings include a time duration and two possible actions. Signal loss expiration time UI label: Signal is lost after: GraphQL Node: expiration.expirationDuration Expiration duration is a timer that starts and resets when we receive a data point in the streaming alerts pipeline. If we don't receive another data point before your 'expiration time' expires, we consider that signal to be lost. This can be because no data is being sent to New Relic or the WHERE clause of your NRQL query is filtering that data out before it is streamed to the alerts pipeline. The loss of signal expiration time is independent of the threshold duration and triggers as soon as the timer expires. The maximum expiration duration is 48 hours. This is helpful when monitoring for the execution of infrequent jobs. The minimum is 30 seconds, but we recommend using at least 3-5 minutes. Loss of signal actions Once a signal is considered lost, you can close open violations, open new violations, or both. Close all current open violations: This closes all open violations that are related to a specific signal. It won't necessarily close all violations for a condition. If you're alerting on an ephemeral service, or on a sporadic signal, you'll want to choose this action to ensure that violations are closed properly. The GraphQL node name for this is \"closeViolationsOnExpiration\" Open new violations: This will open a new violation when the signal is considered lost. These violations will indicate that they are due to a loss of signal. Based on your incident preferences, this should trigger a notification. The graphQL node name for this is \"openViolationOnExpiration\" When you enable both actions, we'll close all open violations first, and then open a new violation for loss of signal. To create a NRQL alert configured with loss of signal detection in the UI: For a policy, when you create a condition, under Select a product, click NRQL, then click Next, define thresholds. Write a NRQL query that returns the values you want to alert on. For Threshold type, select Static or Baseline. Click + Add lost signal threshold, then set the signal expiration duration time in minutes or seconds in the Signal is lost after field. Choose what you want to happen when the signal is lost. You can check one or both of Close all current open violations and Open new \"lost signal\" violation. These control how loss of signal violations will be handled for the condition. Make sure you name your condition before you save it. Violations open due to loss of signal close when the signal comes back. Newly opened lost signal violations will close immediately when new data is evaluated. the condition they belong to expires. By default, conditions expire after 3 days. you manually close the violation with the Close all current open violations option. Tip Loss of signal detection doesn't work on NRQL queries that use nested aggregation or sub-queries. Advanced signal settings When creating a NRQL alert condition, the advanced signal settings gives you better control over streaming alert data and helps you avoid false alarms. When creating a NRQL condition, there are several advanced signal settings: Aggregation window Evaluation offset Fill data gaps To read an explanation of what these settings are and how they relate to each other, see Streaming alerts concepts. Below are instructions and tips on how to configure them. Aggregation window You can set the aggregation window duration to choose how long data is accumulated in a streaming time window before it's aggregated. You can set it to anything between one second and 15 minutes. The default is one minute. Tip Baseline alert condition thresholds don't support editing the aggregation window. They use the 1 minute default. Evaluation offset You can adjust the evaluation offset to coordinate our streaming alerting algorithm with your data's latency. If it takes a while for your data to arrive, then you may need to increase the evaluation offset. The total supported latency is the product of the aggregation window duration multiplied by the evaluation offset. In the example screenshot above, the supported latency is 3 minutes (a 1-minute aggregation window multiplied by three windows). If the data type comes from an APM language agent and is aggregated from many app instances (for example, Transactions, TransactionErrors, etc.), we recommend using an evaluation offset of 3 with 1 minute aggregation windows. Important When creating NRQL conditions for data collected from Infrastructure Cloud Integrations such as AWS Cloudwatch or Azure, we recommend that you start with an evaluation offset of 15 minutes, then adjust up or down depending on how long it takes to collect your data. Fill data gaps Gap filling lets you customize the values to use when your signals don't have any data. You can fill gaps in your data streams with one of these settings: None: (Default) Choose this if you don't want to take any action on empty aggregation windows. On evaluation, an empty aggregation window will reset the threshold duration timer. For example, if a condition says that all aggregation windows must have data points above the threshold for 5 minutes, and 1 of the 5 aggregation windows is empty, then the condition won't be in violation. Custom static value: Choose this if you'd like to insert a custom static value into the empty aggregation windows before they're evaluated. This option has an additional, required parameter of fillValue (as named in the API) that specifies what static value should be used. This defaults to 0. Last known value: This option inserts the last seen value before evaluation occurs. We maintain the state of the last seen value for 2 hours. Tip The alerts system fills gaps in actively reported signals. This signal history is dropped after 2 hours of inactivity. For gap filling, data points received after this period of inactivity are treated as new signals. To learn more about signal loss, gap filling, and how to request access to these features, see this Explorers Hub post. Options for editing data gap settings: In the NRQL conditions UI, go to Condition settings > Advanced signal settings > fill data gaps with and choose an option. If using our Nerdgraph API (preferred), this node is located at: actor : account : alerts : nrqlCondition : signal : fillOption | fillValue NerdGraph is our recommended API for this but if you're using our REST API, you can find this setting in the REST API explorer under the \"signal\" section of the Alert NRQL conditions API.",

At its core, Applied Intelligence helps you find, troubleshoot, and resolve problems more quickly. Specifically, it’s a hybrid machine learning engine that reduces alert noise, correlates incidents, and automatically detects anomalies. By applying machine learning to your data and feedback, Applied Intelligence is designed to improve functionality and deliver smarter context over time. After connecting your data sources to Applied Intelligence, it looks for potential problems and improves based on your feedback. Why use Applied Intelligence? How you respond to an incident can mean thousands of dollars or clicks for your company. Applied Intelligence helps you solve problems faster. Feature Description Troubleshoot and respond to incidents Our solution helps you understand your incidents and gives you ideas for what to do next. Here are a few examples: Automatically classifies incidents based on the golden signals of site reliability engineering. Identifies entities in your stack that may relate to the underlying issue. Suggests responses for incidents based on historical context. Less noise, more focus As tools and systems become more complex, alert noise can overwhelm DevOps and SRE teams. Applied Intelligence correlates related incidents and suppresses noise, so you're only notified when human action is required. Incidents with a hybrid approach Applied Intelligence streamlines your incidents by combining its built-in inputs with your knowledge and feedback. Over time, the system delivers more accurate insights. For example: Our correlation and classification engine adjusts based on your feedback. The system automatically suggests new correlation rules based on your production data. You can create custom logic using the decision builder. Automatic anomaly detection Applied Intelligence provides automatic anomaly detection on all your APM-monitored applications. We detect anomalies in throughput, latency, and error rate, with no action required from you. Benefits include: No setup required. See anomalies surfaced automatically in the anomalies feed. See them in various New Relic activity streams (for example, on the New Relic One home page). Ability to run NRQL queries of anomalies and create custom dashboards with that data. Determine root causes with Incident Intelligence As part of Applied Intelligence, Incident Intelligence helps you correlate incident events and reduce noise in your environment. With it, you can get an overview of all your issues, see suggested responders, and configure your own correlation logic. To get started, see Incident Intelligence. Find unknowns with Proactive Detection Another feature of Applied Intelligence is Proactive Detection. Proactive Detection is, by default, always on and detecting anomalies. These anomalies are surfaced in the Applied Intelligence anomalies feed, New Relic One activity streams, and can be queried, alerted on, and added to dashboards. Anomalies can be sent to Slack or via webhooks, and/or added as a source for Incident Intelligence correlation and issue notification. Proactive Detection also provides automatic analysis of anomalies and alerts via the analysis page. To get started, see Proactive Detection.",

This determines when an alerts violation is created. Read on to learn more about how to do this. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Click NRQL, and then Next, define thresholds. Tip For more information on key concepts relating to NRQL alert conditions and streaming alerts, see Streaming alerts: key terms and concepts. Create a NRQL alert condition To create a NRQL alert condition for a policy: On one.newrelic.com, in the header click Alerts & AI, then in the left sidebar click Policies. Select an existing policy or click New alert policy to create a new policy. Click Add a condition. Under Select a product click NRQL, and then click Next, define thresholds. Create a condition from a chart You can use a chart to create a NRQL alert condition. To create a NRQL alerts condition from a chart, click the chart menu , then click Create alert condition. Once you've named and customized your condition, you can add it to an existing policy or create a new one. Caution A small number of our older charts don't include the option to create an alert condition. NRQL alert syntax Here's the basic syntax for creating all NRQL alert conditions. The FACET clause is required for outlier threshold types. It's optional for static and baseline. SELECT function(attribute) FROM Event WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Copy Clause Notes SELECT function(attribute) Required Supported functions that return numbers include: apdex average count latest max min percentage percentile sum uniqueCount Tip If you use the percentile aggregator in a faceted alert condition with many facets, this may cause the following error to appear: An error occurred while fetching chart data. If you see this error, use average instead. FROM data type Required Only one data type can be targeted. Supported data types: Event Metric (RAW data points will be returned) WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Use the WHERE clause to specify a series of one or more conditions. All the operators are supported. FACET attribute Required for outlier conditions Include an optional FACET clause in your NRQL syntax depending on the threshold type: static or baseline. Use the FACET clause to separate your results by attribute and alert on each attribute independently. No LIMIT clause is allowed, but all queries will receive the maximum number of facets possible. Faceted queries can return a maximum of 5000 values for static and baseline conditions and a maximum of 500 values for outlier conditions. Important If the query returns more than the maximum number of values, the alert condition can't be created. If you create the condition and the query returns more than this number later, the alert will fail. Modify your query so that it returns a fewer number of values. Reformatting incompatible NRQL Some elements of NRQL used in charts don’t make sense in the streaming context of alerts. Here’s a list of the most common incompatible elements and suggestions for reformatting a NRQL alert query to achieve the same effect. Element Notes SINCE and UNTIL Example: SELECT percentile(largestContentfulPaint, 75) FROM PageViewTiming WHERE (appId = 837807) SINCE yesterday Copy NRQL Alerting produces a never-ending stream of windowed query results, so the SINCE and UNTIL keywords to scope the query to a point in time are not compatible. As a convenience, we automatically strip SINCE and UNTIL from a query when creating a NRQL Alert Condition from the context of a chart. TIMESERIES In NRQL queries, the TIMESERIES clause is used to return data as a time series broken out by a specified period of time. For NRQL alerts, the equivalent property of a signal is the aggregation window. histogram() The histogram() aggregation function is used to generate histograms. histogram() is not compatible with NRQL alerting: histogram aggregations can not be formatted as a time series. To create an alert from a portion of a histogram (e.g. 95th percentile), use the percentile() aggregation function. Multiple Aggregation Functions Each alert condition can only target a single aggregated stream of data. To alert on multiple streams simultaneously, you’ll need to decompose them into individual conditions within the same policy. Original Query: SELECT count(foo), average(bar), max(baz) from Transaction Copy Decomposed: SELECT count(foo) from Transaction SELECT average(bar) from Transaction SELECT max(baz) from Transaction Copy COMPARE WITH The COMPARE WITH clause is used to compare the values for two different time ranges. This type of query is incompatible with NRQL alerting. We recommend using a Baseline Alert Condition to dynamically detect deviations for a particular signal. SLIDE BY The SLIDE BY clause supports a feature known as sliding windows. With sliding windows, SLIDE BY data is gathered into \"windows\" of time that overlap with each other. These windows can help to smooth out line graphs with a lot of variation in cases where the rolling aggregate (such as a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. Sliding windows are not currently supported in NRQL alerts. LIMIT In NRQL queries, the LIMIT clause is used to control the amount of data a query returns, either the maximum number of facet values returned by FACET queries or the maximum number of items returned by SELECT * queries. LIMIT is not compatible with NRQL alerting: evaluation is always performed on the full result set. NRQL alert threshold examples Here are some common use cases for NRQL alert conditions. These queries will work for static and baseline threshold types. The outlier threshold type will require additional FACET clauses. Alert on specific segments of your data Create constrained alerts that target a specific segment of your data, such as a few key customers or a range of data. Use the WHERE clause to define those conditions. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction WHERE account_id in (91290, 102021, 20230) Copy SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction WHERE name LIKE 'Controller/checkout/%' Copy Alert on Nth percentile of your data Create alerts when an Nth percentile of your data hits a specified threshold; for example, maintaining SLA service levels. Since we evaluate the NRQL query in one-minute time windows, percentiles will be calculated for each minute separately. SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentile(databaseDuration, 75) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on max, min, avg of your data Create alerts when your data hits a certain maximum, minimum, or average; for example, ensuring that a duration or response time does not pass a certain threshold. SELECT max(duration) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on a percentage of your data Create alerts when a proportion of your data goes above or below a certain threshold. SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE duration > 2) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE httpResponseCode = '500') FROM Transaction Copy Alert on Apdex with any T-value Create alerts on Apdex, applying your own T-value for certain transactions. For example, get an alert notification when your Apdex for a T-value of 500ms on transactions for production apps goes below 0.8. SELECT apdex(duration, t:0.5) FROM Transaction WHERE appName like '%prod%' Copy Alert conditions and query order of operations By default, the aggregation window is 1 minute, but you can change the window to suit your needs. Whatever the aggregation window, New Relic will collect data for that window using the function in the NRQL alert condition’s query. The query is parsed and executed by our systems in the following order: FROM clause – which event type needs to be grabbed? WHERE clause – what can be filtered out? SELECT clause – what information needs to be returned from the now-filtered data set? Example: null value returned Let's say this is your alert condition query: SELECT count(*) FROM SyntheticCheck WHERE monitorName = 'My Cool Monitor' AND result = 'FAILURE' Copy If there are no failures for the aggregation window: The system will execute the FROM clause by grabbing all SyntheticCheck events on your account. Then it will execute the WHERE clause to filter through those events by looking only for the ones that match the monitor name and result specified. If there are still events left to scan through after completing the FROM and WHERE operations, the SELECT clause will be executed. If there are no remaining events, the SELECT clause will not be executed. This means that aggregators like count() and uniqueCount() will never return a zero value. When there is a count of 0, the SELECT clause is ignored and no data is returned, resulting in a value of NULL. Example: zero value returned If you have a data source delivering legitimate numeric zeroes, the query will return zero values and not null values. Let's say this is your alert condition query, and that MyCoolEvent is an attribute that can sometimes return a zero value. SELECT average(MyCoolAttribute) FROM MyCoolEvent Copy If, in the aggregation window being evaluated, there's at least one instance of MyCoolEvent and if the average value of all MyCoolAttribute attributes from that window is equal to zero, then a 0 value will be returned. If there are no MyCoolEvent events during that minute, then a NULL will be returned due to the order of operations. Tip For more information about this topic, you can check out our blog post on troubleshooting for zero versus null values. Tip You can determine how null values will be handled by adjusting loss of signal and gap filling settings in the Alert Conditions UI. Tip You can avoid NULL values entirely with a query order of operations shortcut. Do this by using a filter sub-clause, then including all filter elements within that sub-clause. The main body of the query will run and return data, at which point the SELECT clause will then run and apply the filter elements. The query will return a value of 0 if the filter elements result in no matching data. Here's an example: SELECT filter(count(*), WHERE result = 'SUCCESS' AND monitorName = 'My Favorite Monitor') FROM SyntheticCheck Copy Nested aggregation NRQL alerts Nested aggregation queries are a powerful way to query your data. However, they have a few restrictions that are important to note. Nested queries with a non-faceted innermost query are not currently supported Without a FACET, the inner query produces a single result, giving the outer query nothing to aggregate. If you're using a nested query, make sure your inner query is faceted. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu) ​​​​​ Copy Queries at all levels must have the same aggregation window size With an alert aggregation window of 1 minute, the inner query would produce two smaller windows of 30 seconds. In theory, these two windows could be aggregated by the outer query. However, this is not currently supported. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu TIMESERIES 30 seconds)​​ Copy Signal loss is not yet supported for nested queries For more information on signal loss, see NerdGraph API: Loss of signal and gap filling. Nested queries containing 'WITH METRIC_FORMAT' in the inner query are not currently supported You can't use a nested query containing the WITH METRIC_FORMAT in the inner query to create NRQL alert conditions. NRQL condition creation tips Here are some tips for creating and using a NRQL condition: Topic Tips Condition threshold types NRQL condition threshold types include static, baseline, and outlier. Create a description For NRQL conditions, you can create a custom description to add to each violation. Descriptions can be enhanced with variable substitution based on metadata in the specific violation. For details, see Description Query results Queries must return a number. The condition evaluates the returned number against the thresholds you've set. Time period As with all alert conditions, NRQL conditions evaluate one single minute at a time. The implicit SINCE ... UNTIL clause specifying which minute to evaluate is controlled by your Evaluation offset setting. Since very recent data may be incomplete, you may want to query data from 3 minutes ago or longer, especially for: Applications that run on multiple hosts. SyntheticCheck data: Timeouts can take 3 minutes, so 5 minutes or more is recommended. Also, if a query will generate intermittent data, consider using the sum of query results option. Lost signal threshold (loss of signal detection) You can use loss of signal detection to alert on when your data (a telemetry signal) should be considered lost. A signal loss can indicate that a service or entity is no longer online or that a periodic job failed to run. You can also use this to make sure that violations for sporadic data, such as error counts, are closed when no signal is coming in. Advanced signal settings These settings give you options for better handling continuous, streaming data signals that may sometimes be missing. These settings include the aggregation window, the evaluation offset, and an option for filling data gaps. For more on using these, see Advanced signal settings. Condition settings Use the Condition settings to: Create a concise, descriptive condition name. Provide a custom violation description for the condition that will be included in violations and notifications. Add the runbook URL to include your organization's procedures for handling incidents. You may also add this information to the custom violation description. Limits on conditions See the maximum values. Health status NRQL alert conditions don't affect an entity's health status display. Examples For more information, see: Expected NRQL syntax Examples of NRQL condition queries Alert threshold types When you create a NRQL alert, you can choose from different types of thresholds: NRQL alert threshold types Description Static This is the simplest type of NRQL threshold. It allows you to create a condition based on a NRQL query that returns a numeric value. Optional: Include a FACET clause. Baseline (Dynamic) Uses a self-adjusting condition based on the past behavior of the monitored values. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type. Outlier Looks for group behavior and values that are outliers from those groups. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type, but requires a FACET clause. Sum of query results (limited or intermittent data) Important Available only for static (basic) threshold types. If a query returns intermittent or limited data, it may be difficult to set a meaningful threshold. Missing or limited data will sometimes generate false positives or false negatives. You can use loss of signal, aggregation duration, and gap filling settings to minimize these false notifications. To avoid this problem when using the static threshold type, you can set the selector to sum of query results. This lets you set the alert on an aggregated sum instead of a value from a single harvest cycle. Up to two hours of one-minute data checks can be aggregated. The duration you select determines the width of the rolling sum and the preview chart will update accordingly. Set the loss of signal threshold Loss of signal occurs when no data matches the NRQL condition over a specific period of time. You can set your loss of signal threshold duration and and also what happens when the threshold is crossed. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Loss of signal is only available for NRQL conditions. You may also manage these settings using the GraphQL API (recommended), or the REST API. Go here for specific GraphQL API examples. Loss of signal settings: Loss of signal settings include a time duration and two possible actions. Signal loss expiration time UI label: Signal is lost after: GraphQL Node: expiration.expirationDuration Expiration duration is a timer that starts and resets when we receive a data point in the streaming alerts pipeline. If we don't receive another data point before your 'expiration time' expires, we consider that signal to be lost. This can be because no data is being sent to New Relic or the WHERE clause of your NRQL query is filtering that data out before it is streamed to the alerts pipeline. The loss of signal expiration time is independent of the threshold duration and triggers as soon as the timer expires. The maximum expiration duration is 48 hours. This is helpful when monitoring for the execution of infrequent jobs. The minimum is 30 seconds, but we recommend using at least 3-5 minutes. Loss of signal actions Once a signal is considered lost, you can close open violations, open new violations, or both. Close all current open violations: This closes all open violations that are related to a specific signal. It won't necessarily close all violations for a condition. If you're alerting on an ephemeral service, or on a sporadic signal, you'll want to choose this action to ensure that violations are closed properly. The GraphQL node name for this is \"closeViolationsOnExpiration\" Open new violations: This will open a new violation when the signal is considered lost. These violations will indicate that they are due to a loss of signal. Based on your incident preferences, this should trigger a notification. The graphQL node name for this is \"openViolationOnExpiration\" When you enable both actions, we'll close all open violations first, and then open a new violation for loss of signal. To create a NRQL alert configured with loss of signal detection in the UI: For a policy, when you create a condition, under Select a product, click NRQL, then click Next, define thresholds. Write a NRQL query that returns the values you want to alert on. For Threshold type, select Static or Baseline. Click + Add lost signal threshold, then set the signal expiration duration time in minutes or seconds in the Signal is lost after field. Choose what you want to happen when the signal is lost. You can check one or both of Close all current open violations and Open new \"lost signal\" violation. These control how loss of signal violations will be handled for the condition. Make sure you name your condition before you save it. Violations open due to loss of signal close when the signal comes back. Newly opened lost signal violations will close immediately when new data is evaluated. the condition they belong to expires. By default, conditions expire after 3 days. you manually close the violation with the Close all current open violations option. Tip Loss of signal detection doesn't work on NRQL queries that use nested aggregation or sub-queries. Advanced signal settings When creating a NRQL alert condition, the advanced signal settings gives you better control over streaming alert data and helps you avoid false alarms. When creating a NRQL condition, there are several advanced signal settings: Aggregation window Evaluation offset Fill data gaps To read an explanation of what these settings are and how they relate to each other, see Streaming alerts concepts. Below are instructions and tips on how to configure them. Aggregation window You can set the aggregation window duration to choose how long data is accumulated in a streaming time window before it's aggregated. You can set it to anything between one second and 15 minutes. The default is one minute. Tip Baseline alert condition thresholds don't support editing the aggregation window. They use the 1 minute default. Evaluation offset You can adjust the evaluation offset to coordinate our streaming alerting algorithm with your data's latency. If it takes a while for your data to arrive, then you may need to increase the evaluation offset. The total supported latency is the product of the aggregation window duration multiplied by the evaluation offset. In the example screenshot above, the supported latency is 3 minutes (a 1-minute aggregation window multiplied by three windows). If the data type comes from an APM language agent and is aggregated from many app instances (for example, Transactions, TransactionErrors, etc.), we recommend using an evaluation offset of 3 with 1 minute aggregation windows. Important When creating NRQL conditions for data collected from Infrastructure Cloud Integrations such as AWS Cloudwatch or Azure, we recommend that you start with an evaluation offset of 15 minutes, then adjust up or down depending on how long it takes to collect your data. Fill data gaps Gap filling lets you customize the values to use when your signals don't have any data. You can fill gaps in your data streams with one of these settings: None: (Default) Choose this if you don't want to take any action on empty aggregation windows. On evaluation, an empty aggregation window will reset the threshold duration timer. For example, if a condition says that all aggregation windows must have data points above the threshold for 5 minutes, and 1 of the 5 aggregation windows is empty, then the condition won't be in violation. Custom static value: Choose this if you'd like to insert a custom static value into the empty aggregation windows before they're evaluated. This option has an additional, required parameter of fillValue (as named in the API) that specifies what static value should be used. This defaults to 0. Last known value: This option inserts the last seen value before evaluation occurs. We maintain the state of the last seen value for 2 hours. Tip The alerts system fills gaps in actively reported signals. This signal history is dropped after 2 hours of inactivity. For gap filling, data points received after this period of inactivity are treated as new signals. To learn more about signal loss, gap filling, and how to request access to these features, see this Explorers Hub post. Options for editing data gap settings: In the NRQL conditions UI, go to Condition settings > Advanced signal settings > fill data gaps with and choose an option. If using our Nerdgraph API (preferred), this node is located at: actor : account : alerts : nrqlCondition : signal : fillOption | fillValue NerdGraph is our recommended API for this but if you're using our REST API, you can find this setting in the REST API explorer under the \"signal\" section of the Alert NRQL conditions API.",

These include: The exact custom metric name for the selected product category and targets. Note: wildcard characters are not allowed. Selected threshold value function. The options are average, minimum, maximum, count, and rate. Selected threshold level. The options are above, below, and equal to. Critical (required) and Warning (optional) threshold value and duration that will open a violation. For example, 5 units for at least 5 minutes. Condition name (required) for the custom metric. Create a custom metric condition To define the custom metric values for your condition: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, then (select a policy) or add a new alert policy. From the policy's Alert conditions page, click Add a condition. From the Categorize section, select the product and type of condition for the custom metric. From the Select entities section, add one or more targets (entities) that use your custom metric. From the Define thresholds > When target application section, select Custom > Search metric name, and begin typing the custom metric name, select from the list, or type the exact metric name. Tip Exception: The custom metric search is not enabled for: Labels for APM apps New Relic Plugins To find the metric name in these situations, use the Data explorer. Then type the exact metric name in the Alerts Define thresholds page. Provide the required threshold values for your custom metric. From the Define thresholds > Condition name section, provide a meaningful name for your custom metric condition, maximum 100 characters. Optional: Include the URL with runbook instructions for handling the situation. Click Create condition. Repeat these steps as necessary to create additional conditions for custom metrics. View or update custom metric conditions After you save the condition, you can view the selected policy's Alert conditions page with a list of each condition. From here you can follow standard procedures to select and update the custom metric condition. The Condition name does not appear in the Thresholds section for a saved condition. If you want to change the condition name for a custom metric, edit it from the selected policy's Alert conditions page: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, then (select a policy). Click a condition name to edit it, and then type a meaningful name for the condition.

      "body": "You can use NRQL queries to create alert conditions. Once you've defined your signal, you can further define your warning and critical threshold levels. This determines when an alerts violation is created. Read on to learn more about how to do this. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Click NRQL, and then Next, define thresholds. Tip For more information on key concepts relating to NRQL alert conditions and streaming alerts, see Streaming alerts: key terms and concepts. Create a NRQL alert condition To create a NRQL alert condition for a policy: On one.newrelic.com, in the header click Alerts & AI, then in the left sidebar click Policies. Select an existing policy or click New alert policy to create a new policy. Click Add a condition. Under Select a product click NRQL, and then click Next, define thresholds. Create a condition from a chart You can use a chart to create a NRQL alert condition. To create a NRQL alerts condition from a chart, click the chart menu , then click Create alert condition. Once you've named and customized your condition, you can add it to an existing policy or create a new one. Caution A small number of our older charts don't include the option to create an alert condition. NRQL alert syntax Here's the basic syntax for creating all NRQL alert conditions. The FACET clause is required for outlier threshold types. It's optional for static and baseline. SELECT function(attribute) FROM Event WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Copy Clause Notes SELECT function(attribute) Required Supported functions that return numbers include: apdex average count latest max min percentage percentile sum uniqueCount Tip If you use the percentile aggregator in a faceted alert condition with many facets, this may cause the following error to appear: An error occurred while fetching chart data. If you see this error, use average instead. FROM data type Required Only one data type can be targeted. Supported data types: Event Metric (RAW data points will be returned) WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Use the WHERE clause to specify a series of one or more conditions. All the operators are supported. FACET attribute Required for outlier conditions Include an optional FACET clause in your NRQL syntax depending on the threshold type: static or baseline. Use the FACET clause to separate your results by attribute and alert on each attribute independently. No LIMIT clause is allowed, but all queries will receive the maximum number of facets possible. Faceted queries can return a maximum of 5000 values for static and baseline conditions and a maximum of 500 values for outlier conditions. Important If the query returns more than the maximum number of values, the alert condition can't be created. If you create the condition and the query returns more than this number later, the alert will fail. Modify your query so that it returns a fewer number of values. Reformatting incompatible NRQL Some elements of NRQL used in charts don’t make sense in the streaming context of alerts. Here’s a list of the most common incompatible elements and suggestions for reformatting a NRQL alert query to achieve the same effect. Element Notes SINCE and UNTIL Example: SELECT percentile(largestContentfulPaint, 75) FROM PageViewTiming WHERE (appId = 837807) SINCE yesterday Copy NRQL Alerting produces a never-ending stream of windowed query results, so the SINCE and UNTIL keywords to scope the query to a point in time are not compatible. As a convenience, we automatically strip SINCE and UNTIL from a query when creating a NRQL Alert Condition from the context of a chart. TIMESERIES In NRQL queries, the TIMESERIES clause is used to return data as a time series broken out by a specified period of time. For NRQL alerts, the equivalent property of a signal is the aggregation window. histogram() The histogram() aggregation function is used to generate histograms. histogram() is not compatible with NRQL alerting: histogram aggregations can not be formatted as a time series. To create an alert from a portion of a histogram (e.g. 95th percentile), use the percentile() aggregation function. Multiple Aggregation Functions Each alert condition can only target a single aggregated stream of data. To alert on multiple streams simultaneously, you’ll need to decompose them into individual conditions within the same policy. Original Query: SELECT count(foo), average(bar), max(baz) from Transaction Copy Decomposed: SELECT count(foo) from Transaction SELECT average(bar) from Transaction SELECT max(baz) from Transaction Copy COMPARE WITH The COMPARE WITH clause is used to compare the values for two different time ranges. This type of query is incompatible with NRQL alerting. We recommend using a Baseline Alert Condition to dynamically detect deviations for a particular signal. SLIDE BY The SLIDE BY clause supports a feature known as sliding windows. With sliding windows, SLIDE BY data is gathered into \"windows\" of time that overlap with each other. These windows can help to smooth out line graphs with a lot of variation in cases where the rolling aggregate (such as a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. Sliding windows are not currently supported in NRQL alerts. LIMIT In NRQL queries, the LIMIT clause is used to control the amount of data a query returns, either the maximum number of facet values returned by FACET queries or the maximum number of items returned by SELECT * queries. LIMIT is not compatible with NRQL alerting: evaluation is always performed on the full result set. NRQL alert threshold examples Here are some common use cases for NRQL alert conditions. These queries will work for static and baseline threshold types. The outlier threshold type will require additional FACET clauses. Alert on specific segments of your data Create constrained alerts that target a specific segment of your data, such as a few key customers or a range of data. Use the WHERE clause to define those conditions. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction WHERE account_id in (91290, 102021, 20230) Copy SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction WHERE name LIKE 'Controller/checkout/%' Copy Alert on Nth percentile of your data Create alerts when an Nth percentile of your data hits a specified threshold; for example, maintaining SLA service levels. Since we evaluate the NRQL query in one-minute time windows, percentiles will be calculated for each minute separately. SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentile(databaseDuration, 75) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on max, min, avg of your data Create alerts when your data hits a certain maximum, minimum, or average; for example, ensuring that a duration or response time does not pass a certain threshold. SELECT max(duration) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on a percentage of your data Create alerts when a proportion of your data goes above or below a certain threshold. SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE duration > 2) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE httpResponseCode = '500') FROM Transaction Copy Alert on Apdex with any T-value Create alerts on Apdex, applying your own T-value for certain transactions. For example, get an alert notification when your Apdex for a T-value of 500ms on transactions for production apps goes below 0.8. SELECT apdex(duration, t:0.5) FROM Transaction WHERE appName like '%prod%' Copy Alert conditions and query order of operations By default, the aggregation window is 1 minute, but you can change the window to suit your needs. Whatever the aggregation window, New Relic will collect data for that window using the function in the NRQL alert condition’s query. The query is parsed and executed by our systems in the following order: FROM clause – which event type needs to be grabbed? WHERE clause – what can be filtered out? SELECT clause – what information needs to be returned from the now-filtered data set? Example: null value returned Let's say this is your alert condition query: SELECT count(*) FROM SyntheticCheck WHERE monitorName = 'My Cool Monitor' AND result = 'FAILURE' Copy If there are no failures for the aggregation window: The system will execute the FROM clause by grabbing all SyntheticCheck events on your account. Then it will execute the WHERE clause to filter through those events by looking only for the ones that match the monitor name and result specified. If there are still events left to scan through after completing the FROM and WHERE operations, the SELECT clause will be executed. If there are no remaining events, the SELECT clause will not be executed. This means that aggregators like count() and uniqueCount() will never return a zero value. When there is a count of 0, the SELECT clause is ignored and no data is returned, resulting in a value of NULL. Example: zero value returned If you have a data source delivering legitimate numeric zeroes, the query will return zero values and not null values. Let's say this is your alert condition query, and that MyCoolEvent is an attribute that can sometimes return a zero value. SELECT average(MyCoolAttribute) FROM MyCoolEvent Copy If, in the aggregation window being evaluated, there's at least one instance of MyCoolEvent and if the average value of all MyCoolAttribute attributes from that window is equal to zero, then a 0 value will be returned. If there are no MyCoolEvent events during that minute, then a NULL will be returned due to the order of operations. Tip For more information about this topic, you can check out our blog post on troubleshooting for zero versus null values. Tip You can determine how null values will be handled by adjusting loss of signal and gap filling settings in the Alert Conditions UI. Tip You can avoid NULL values entirely with a query order of operations shortcut. Do this by using a filter sub-clause, then including all filter elements within that sub-clause. The main body of the query will run and return data, at which point the SELECT clause will then run and apply the filter elements. The query will return a value of 0 if the filter elements result in no matching data. Here's an example: SELECT filter(count(*), WHERE result = 'SUCCESS' AND monitorName = 'My Favorite Monitor') FROM SyntheticCheck Copy Nested aggregation NRQL alerts Nested aggregation queries are a powerful way to query your data. However, they have a few restrictions that are important to note. Nested queries with a non-faceted innermost query are not currently supported Without a FACET, the inner query produces a single result, giving the outer query nothing to aggregate. If you're using a nested query, make sure your inner query is faceted. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu) ​​​​​ Copy Queries at all levels must have the same aggregation window size With an alert aggregation window of 1 minute, the inner query would produce two smaller windows of 30 seconds. In theory, these two windows could be aggregated by the outer query. However, this is not currently supported. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu TIMESERIES 30 seconds)​​ Copy Signal loss is not yet supported for nested queries For more information on signal loss, see NerdGraph API: Loss of signal and gap filling. Nested queries containing 'WITH METRIC_FORMAT' in the inner query are not currently supported You can't use a nested query containing the WITH METRIC_FORMAT in the inner query to create NRQL alert conditions. NRQL condition creation tips Here are some tips for creating and using a NRQL condition: Topic Tips Condition threshold types NRQL condition threshold types include static, baseline, and outlier. Create a description For NRQL conditions, you can create a custom description to add to each violation. Descriptions can be enhanced with variable substitution based on metadata in the specific violation. For details, see Description Query results Queries must return a number. The condition evaluates the returned number against the thresholds you've set. Time period As with all alert conditions, NRQL conditions evaluate one single minute at a time. The implicit SINCE ... UNTIL clause specifying which minute to evaluate is controlled by your Evaluation offset setting. Since very recent data may be incomplete, you may want to query data from 3 minutes ago or longer, especially for: Applications that run on multiple hosts. SyntheticCheck data: Timeouts can take 3 minutes, so 5 minutes or more is recommended. Also, if a query will generate intermittent data, consider using the sum of query results option. Lost signal threshold (loss of signal detection) You can use loss of signal detection to alert on when your data (a telemetry signal) should be considered lost. A signal loss can indicate that a service or entity is no longer online or that a periodic job failed to run. You can also use this to make sure that violations for sporadic data, such as error counts, are closed when no signal is coming in. Advanced signal settings These settings give you options for better handling continuous, streaming data signals that may sometimes be missing. These settings include the aggregation window, the evaluation offset, and an option for filling data gaps. For more on using these, see Advanced signal settings. Condition settings Use the Condition settings to: Create a concise, descriptive condition name. Provide a custom violation description for the condition that will be included in violations and notifications. Add the runbook URL to include your organization's procedures for handling incidents. You may also add this information to the custom violation description. Limits on conditions See the maximum values. Health status NRQL alert conditions don't affect an entity's health status display. Examples For more information, see: Expected NRQL syntax Examples of NRQL condition queries Alert threshold types When you create a NRQL alert, you can choose from different types of thresholds: NRQL alert threshold types Description Static This is the simplest type of NRQL threshold. It allows you to create a condition based on a NRQL query that returns a numeric value. Optional: Include a FACET clause. Baseline (Dynamic) Uses a self-adjusting condition based on the past behavior of the monitored values. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type. Outlier Looks for group behavior and values that are outliers from those groups. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type, but requires a FACET clause. Sum of query results (limited or intermittent data) Important Available only for static (basic) threshold types. If a query returns intermittent or limited data, it may be difficult to set a meaningful threshold. Missing or limited data will sometimes generate false positives or false negatives. You can use loss of signal, aggregation duration, and gap filling settings to minimize these false notifications. To avoid this problem when using the static threshold type, you can set the selector to sum of query results. This lets you set the alert on an aggregated sum instead of a value from a single harvest cycle. Up to two hours of one-minute data checks can be aggregated. The duration you select determines the width of the rolling sum and the preview chart will update accordingly. Set the loss of signal threshold Loss of signal occurs when no data matches the NRQL condition over a specific period of time. You can set your loss of signal threshold duration and and also what happens when the threshold is crossed. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Loss of signal is only available for NRQL conditions. You may also manage these settings using the GraphQL API (recommended), or the REST API. Go here for specific GraphQL API examples. Loss of signal settings: Loss of signal settings include a time duration and two possible actions. Signal loss expiration time UI label: Signal is lost after: GraphQL Node: expiration.expirationDuration Expiration duration is a timer that starts and resets when we receive a data point in the streaming alerts pipeline. If we don't receive another data point before your 'expiration time' expires, we consider that signal to be lost. This can be because no data is being sent to New Relic or the WHERE clause of your NRQL query is filtering that data out before it is streamed to the alerts pipeline. The loss of signal expiration time is independent of the threshold duration and triggers as soon as the timer expires. The maximum expiration duration is 48 hours. This is helpful when monitoring for the execution of infrequent jobs. The minimum is 30 seconds, but we recommend using at least 3-5 minutes. Loss of signal actions Once a signal is considered lost, you can close open violations, open new violations, or both. Close all current open violations: This closes all open violations that are related to a specific signal. It won't necessarily close all violations for a condition. If you're alerting on an ephemeral service, or on a sporadic signal, you'll want to choose this action to ensure that violations are closed properly. The GraphQL node name for this is \"closeViolationsOnExpiration\" Open new violations: This will open a new violation when the signal is considered lost. These violations will indicate that they are due to a loss of signal. Based on your incident preferences, this should trigger a notification. The graphQL node name for this is \"openViolationOnExpiration\" When you enable both actions, we'll close all open violations first, and then open a new violation for loss of signal. To create a NRQL alert configured with loss of signal detection in the UI: For a policy, when you create a condition, under Select a product, click NRQL, then click Next, define thresholds. Write a NRQL query that returns the values you want to alert on. For Threshold type, select Static or Baseline. Click + Add lost signal threshold, then set the signal expiration duration time in minutes or seconds in the Signal is lost after field. Choose what you want to happen when the signal is lost. You can check one or both of Close all current open violations and Open new \"lost signal\" violation. These control how loss of signal violations will be handled for the condition. Make sure you name your condition before you save it. Violations open due to loss of signal close when the signal comes back. Newly opened lost signal violations will close immediately when new data is evaluated. the condition they belong to expires. By default, conditions expire after 3 days. you manually close the violation with the Close all current open violations option. Tip Loss of signal detection doesn't work on NRQL queries that use nested aggregation or sub-queries. Advanced signal settings When creating a NRQL alert condition, the advanced signal settings gives you better control over streaming alert data and helps you avoid false alarms. When creating a NRQL condition, there are several advanced signal settings: Aggregation window Evaluation offset Fill data gaps To read an explanation of what these settings are and how they relate to each other, see Streaming alerts concepts. Below are instructions and tips on how to configure them. Aggregation window You can set the aggregation window duration to choose how long data is accumulated in a streaming time window before it's aggregated. You can set it to anything between one second and 15 minutes. The default is one minute. Tip Baseline alert condition thresholds don't support editing the aggregation window. They use the 1 minute default. Evaluation offset You can adjust the evaluation offset to coordinate our streaming alerting algorithm with your data's latency. If it takes a while for your data to arrive, then you may need to increase the evaluation offset. The total supported latency is the product of the aggregation window duration multiplied by the evaluation offset. In the example screenshot above, the supported latency is 3 minutes (a 1-minute aggregation window multiplied by three windows). If the data type comes from an APM language agent and is aggregated from many app instances (for example, Transactions, TransactionErrors, etc.), we recommend using an evaluation offset of 3 with 1 minute aggregation windows. Important When creating NRQL conditions for data collected from Infrastructure Cloud Integrations such as AWS Cloudwatch or Azure, we recommend that you start with an evaluation offset of 15 minutes, then adjust up or down depending on how long it takes to collect your data. Fill data gaps Gap filling lets you customize the values to use when your signals don't have any data. You can fill gaps in your data streams with one of these settings: None: (Default) Choose this if you don't want to take any action on empty aggregation windows. On evaluation, an empty aggregation window will reset the threshold duration timer. For example, if a condition says that all aggregation windows must have data points above the threshold for 5 minutes, and 1 of the 5 aggregation windows is empty, then the condition won't be in violation. Custom static value: Choose this if you'd like to insert a custom static value into the empty aggregation windows before they're evaluated. This option has an additional, required parameter of fillValue (as named in the API) that specifies what static value should be used. This defaults to 0. Last known value: This option inserts the last seen value before evaluation occurs. We maintain the state of the last seen value for 2 hours. Tip The alerts system fills gaps in actively reported signals. This signal history is dropped after 2 hours of inactivity. For gap filling, data points received after this period of inactivity are treated as new signals. To learn more about signal loss, gap filling, and how to request access to these features, see this Explorers Hub post. Options for editing data gap settings: In the NRQL conditions UI, go to Condition settings > Advanced signal settings > fill data gaps with and choose an option. If using our Nerdgraph API (preferred), this node is located at: actor : account : alerts : nrqlCondition : signal : fillOption | fillValue NerdGraph is our recommended API for this but if you're using our REST API, you can find this setting in the REST API explorer under the \"signal\" section of the Alert NRQL conditions API.",

      "body": "Applied Intelligence (AI) is our AIOps solution for DevOps, site reliability engineers, and on-call teams. At its core, Applied Intelligence helps you find, troubleshoot, and resolve problems more quickly. Specifically, it’s a hybrid machine learning engine that reduces alert noise, correlates incidents, and automatically detects anomalies. By applying machine learning to your data and feedback, Applied Intelligence is designed to improve functionality and deliver smarter context over time. After connecting your data sources to Applied Intelligence, it looks for potential problems and improves based on your feedback. Why use Applied Intelligence? How you respond to an incident can mean thousands of dollars or clicks for your company. Applied Intelligence helps you solve problems faster. Feature Description Troubleshoot and respond to incidents Our solution helps you understand your incidents and gives you ideas for what to do next. Here are a few examples: Automatically classifies incidents based on the golden signals of site reliability engineering. Identifies entities in your stack that may relate to the underlying issue. Suggests responses for incidents based on historical context. Less noise, more focus As tools and systems become more complex, alert noise can overwhelm DevOps and SRE teams. Applied Intelligence correlates related incidents and suppresses noise, so you're only notified when human action is required. Incidents with a hybrid approach Applied Intelligence streamlines your incidents by combining its built-in inputs with your knowledge and feedback. Over time, the system delivers more accurate insights. For example: Our correlation and classification engine adjusts based on your feedback. The system automatically suggests new correlation rules based on your production data. You can create custom logic using the decision builder. Automatic anomaly detection Applied Intelligence provides automatic anomaly detection on all your APM-monitored applications. We detect anomalies in throughput, latency, and error rate, with no action required from you. Benefits include: No setup required. See anomalies surfaced automatically in the anomalies feed. See them in various New Relic activity streams (for example, on the New Relic One home page). Ability to run NRQL queries of anomalies and create custom dashboards with that data. Determine root causes with Incident Intelligence As part of Applied Intelligence, Incident Intelligence helps you correlate incident events and reduce noise in your environment. With it, you can get an overview of all your issues, see suggested responders, and configure your own correlation logic. To get started, see Incident Intelligence. Find unknowns with Proactive Detection Another feature of Applied Intelligence is Proactive Detection. Proactive Detection is, by default, always on and detecting anomalies. These anomalies are surfaced in the Applied Intelligence anomalies feed, New Relic One activity streams, and can be queried, alerted on, and added to dashboards. Anomalies can be sent to Slack or via webhooks, and/or added as a source for Incident Intelligence correlation and issue notification. Proactive Detection also provides automatic analysis of anomalies and alerts via the analysis page. To get started, see Proactive Detection.",

      "body": "You can use NRQL queries to create alert conditions. Once you've defined your signal, you can further define your warning and critical threshold levels. This determines when an alerts violation is created. Read on to learn more about how to do this. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Click NRQL, and then Next, define thresholds. Tip For more information on key concepts relating to NRQL alert conditions and streaming alerts, see Streaming alerts: key terms and concepts. Create a NRQL alert condition To create a NRQL alert condition for a policy: On one.newrelic.com, in the header click Alerts & AI, then in the left sidebar click Policies. Select an existing policy or click New alert policy to create a new policy. Click Add a condition. Under Select a product click NRQL, and then click Next, define thresholds. Create a condition from a chart You can use a chart to create a NRQL alert condition. To create a NRQL alerts condition from a chart, click the chart menu , then click Create alert condition. Once you've named and customized your condition, you can add it to an existing policy or create a new one. Caution A small number of our older charts don't include the option to create an alert condition. NRQL alert syntax Here's the basic syntax for creating all NRQL alert conditions. The FACET clause is required for outlier threshold types. It's optional for static and baseline. SELECT function(attribute) FROM Event WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Copy Clause Notes SELECT function(attribute) Required Supported functions that return numbers include: apdex average count latest max min percentage percentile sum uniqueCount Tip If you use the percentile aggregator in a faceted alert condition with many facets, this may cause the following error to appear: An error occurred while fetching chart data. If you see this error, use average instead. FROM data type Required Only one data type can be targeted. Supported data types: Event Metric (RAW data points will be returned) WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Use the WHERE clause to specify a series of one or more conditions. All the operators are supported. FACET attribute Required for outlier conditions Include an optional FACET clause in your NRQL syntax depending on the threshold type: static or baseline. Use the FACET clause to separate your results by attribute and alert on each attribute independently. No LIMIT clause is allowed, but all queries will receive the maximum number of facets possible. Faceted queries can return a maximum of 5000 values for static and baseline conditions and a maximum of 500 values for outlier conditions. Important If the query returns more than the maximum number of values, the alert condition can't be created. If you create the condition and the query returns more than this number later, the alert will fail. Modify your query so that it returns a fewer number of values. Reformatting incompatible NRQL Some elements of NRQL used in charts don’t make sense in the streaming context of alerts. Here’s a list of the most common incompatible elements and suggestions for reformatting a NRQL alert query to achieve the same effect. Element Notes SINCE and UNTIL Example: SELECT percentile(largestContentfulPaint, 75) FROM PageViewTiming WHERE (appId = 837807) SINCE yesterday Copy NRQL Alerting produces a never-ending stream of windowed query results, so the SINCE and UNTIL keywords to scope the query to a point in time are not compatible. As a convenience, we automatically strip SINCE and UNTIL from a query when creating a NRQL Alert Condition from the context of a chart. TIMESERIES In NRQL queries, the TIMESERIES clause is used to return data as a time series broken out by a specified period of time. For NRQL alerts, the equivalent property of a signal is the aggregation window. histogram() The histogram() aggregation function is used to generate histograms. histogram() is not compatible with NRQL alerting: histogram aggregations can not be formatted as a time series. To create an alert from a portion of a histogram (e.g. 95th percentile), use the percentile() aggregation function. Multiple Aggregation Functions Each alert condition can only target a single aggregated stream of data. To alert on multiple streams simultaneously, you’ll need to decompose them into individual conditions within the same policy. Original Query: SELECT count(foo), average(bar), max(baz) from Transaction Copy Decomposed: SELECT count(foo) from Transaction SELECT average(bar) from Transaction SELECT max(baz) from Transaction Copy COMPARE WITH The COMPARE WITH clause is used to compare the values for two different time ranges. This type of query is incompatible with NRQL alerting. We recommend using a Baseline Alert Condition to dynamically detect deviations for a particular signal. SLIDE BY The SLIDE BY clause supports a feature known as sliding windows. With sliding windows, SLIDE BY data is gathered into \"windows\" of time that overlap with each other. These windows can help to smooth out line graphs with a lot of variation in cases where the rolling aggregate (such as a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. Sliding windows are not currently supported in NRQL alerts. LIMIT In NRQL queries, the LIMIT clause is used to control the amount of data a query returns, either the maximum number of facet values returned by FACET queries or the maximum number of items returned by SELECT * queries. LIMIT is not compatible with NRQL alerting: evaluation is always performed on the full result set. NRQL alert threshold examples Here are some common use cases for NRQL alert conditions. These queries will work for static and baseline threshold types. The outlier threshold type will require additional FACET clauses. Alert on specific segments of your data Create constrained alerts that target a specific segment of your data, such as a few key customers or a range of data. Use the WHERE clause to define those conditions. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction WHERE account_id in (91290, 102021, 20230) Copy SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction WHERE name LIKE 'Controller/checkout/%' Copy Alert on Nth percentile of your data Create alerts when an Nth percentile of your data hits a specified threshold; for example, maintaining SLA service levels. Since we evaluate the NRQL query in one-minute time windows, percentiles will be calculated for each minute separately. SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentile(databaseDuration, 75) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on max, min, avg of your data Create alerts when your data hits a certain maximum, minimum, or average; for example, ensuring that a duration or response time does not pass a certain threshold. SELECT max(duration) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on a percentage of your data Create alerts when a proportion of your data goes above or below a certain threshold. SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE duration > 2) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE httpResponseCode = '500') FROM Transaction Copy Alert on Apdex with any T-value Create alerts on Apdex, applying your own T-value for certain transactions. For example, get an alert notification when your Apdex for a T-value of 500ms on transactions for production apps goes below 0.8. SELECT apdex(duration, t:0.5) FROM Transaction WHERE appName like '%prod%' Copy Alert conditions and query order of operations By default, the aggregation window is 1 minute, but you can change the window to suit your needs. Whatever the aggregation window, New Relic will collect data for that window using the function in the NRQL alert condition’s query. The query is parsed and executed by our systems in the following order: FROM clause – which event type needs to be grabbed? WHERE clause – what can be filtered out? SELECT clause – what information needs to be returned from the now-filtered data set? Example: null value returned Let's say this is your alert condition query: SELECT count(*) FROM SyntheticCheck WHERE monitorName = 'My Cool Monitor' AND result = 'FAILURE' Copy If there are no failures for the aggregation window: The system will execute the FROM clause by grabbing all SyntheticCheck events on your account. Then it will execute the WHERE clause to filter through those events by looking only for the ones that match the monitor name and result specified. If there are still events left to scan through after completing the FROM and WHERE operations, the SELECT clause will be executed. If there are no remaining events, the SELECT clause will not be executed. This means that aggregators like count() and uniqueCount() will never return a zero value. When there is a count of 0, the SELECT clause is ignored and no data is returned, resulting in a value of NULL. Example: zero value returned If you have a data source delivering legitimate numeric zeroes, the query will return zero values and not null values. Let's say this is your alert condition query, and that MyCoolEvent is an attribute that can sometimes return a zero value. SELECT average(MyCoolAttribute) FROM MyCoolEvent Copy If, in the aggregation window being evaluated, there's at least one instance of MyCoolEvent and if the average value of all MyCoolAttribute attributes from that window is equal to zero, then a 0 value will be returned. If there are no MyCoolEvent events during that minute, then a NULL will be returned due to the order of operations. Tip For more information about this topic, you can check out our blog post on troubleshooting for zero versus null values. Tip You can determine how null values will be handled by adjusting loss of signal and gap filling settings in the Alert Conditions UI. Tip You can avoid NULL values entirely with a query order of operations shortcut. Do this by using a filter sub-clause, then including all filter elements within that sub-clause. The main body of the query will run and return data, at which point the SELECT clause will then run and apply the filter elements. The query will return a value of 0 if the filter elements result in no matching data. Here's an example: SELECT filter(count(*), WHERE result = 'SUCCESS' AND monitorName = 'My Favorite Monitor') FROM SyntheticCheck Copy Nested aggregation NRQL alerts Nested aggregation queries are a powerful way to query your data. However, they have a few restrictions that are important to note. Nested queries with a non-faceted innermost query are not currently supported Without a FACET, the inner query produces a single result, giving the outer query nothing to aggregate. If you're using a nested query, make sure your inner query is faceted. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu) ​​​​​ Copy Queries at all levels must have the same aggregation window size With an alert aggregation window of 1 minute, the inner query would produce two smaller windows of 30 seconds. In theory, these two windows could be aggregated by the outer query. However, this is not currently supported. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu TIMESERIES 30 seconds)​​ Copy Signal loss is not yet supported for nested queries For more information on signal loss, see NerdGraph API: Loss of signal and gap filling. Nested queries containing 'WITH METRIC_FORMAT' in the inner query are not currently supported You can't use a nested query containing the WITH METRIC_FORMAT in the inner query to create NRQL alert conditions. NRQL condition creation tips Here are some tips for creating and using a NRQL condition: Topic Tips Condition threshold types NRQL condition threshold types include static, baseline, and outlier. Create a description For NRQL conditions, you can create a custom description to add to each violation. Descriptions can be enhanced with variable substitution based on metadata in the specific violation. For details, see Description Query results Queries must return a number. The condition evaluates the returned number against the thresholds you've set. Time period As with all alert conditions, NRQL conditions evaluate one single minute at a time. The implicit SINCE ... UNTIL clause specifying which minute to evaluate is controlled by your Evaluation offset setting. Since very recent data may be incomplete, you may want to query data from 3 minutes ago or longer, especially for: Applications that run on multiple hosts. SyntheticCheck data: Timeouts can take 3 minutes, so 5 minutes or more is recommended. Also, if a query will generate intermittent data, consider using the sum of query results option. Lost signal threshold (loss of signal detection) You can use loss of signal detection to alert on when your data (a telemetry signal) should be considered lost. A signal loss can indicate that a service or entity is no longer online or that a periodic job failed to run. You can also use this to make sure that violations for sporadic data, such as error counts, are closed when no signal is coming in. Advanced signal settings These settings give you options for better handling continuous, streaming data signals that may sometimes be missing. These settings include the aggregation window, the evaluation offset, and an option for filling data gaps. For more on using these, see Advanced signal settings. Condition settings Use the Condition settings to: Create a concise, descriptive condition name. Provide a custom violation description for the condition that will be included in violations and notifications. Add the runbook URL to include your organization's procedures for handling incidents. You may also add this information to the custom violation description. Limits on conditions See the maximum values. Health status NRQL alert conditions don't affect an entity's health status display. Examples For more information, see: Expected NRQL syntax Examples of NRQL condition queries Alert threshold types When you create a NRQL alert, you can choose from different types of thresholds: NRQL alert threshold types Description Static This is the simplest type of NRQL threshold. It allows you to create a condition based on a NRQL query that returns a numeric value. Optional: Include a FACET clause. Baseline (Dynamic) Uses a self-adjusting condition based on the past behavior of the monitored values. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type. Outlier Looks for group behavior and values that are outliers from those groups. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type, but requires a FACET clause. Sum of query results (limited or intermittent data) Important Available only for static (basic) threshold types. If a query returns intermittent or limited data, it may be difficult to set a meaningful threshold. Missing or limited data will sometimes generate false positives or false negatives. You can use loss of signal, aggregation duration, and gap filling settings to minimize these false notifications. To avoid this problem when using the static threshold type, you can set the selector to sum of query results. This lets you set the alert on an aggregated sum instead of a value from a single harvest cycle. Up to two hours of one-minute data checks can be aggregated. The duration you select determines the width of the rolling sum and the preview chart will update accordingly. Set the loss of signal threshold Loss of signal occurs when no data matches the NRQL condition over a specific period of time. You can set your loss of signal threshold duration and and also what happens when the threshold is crossed. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Loss of signal is only available for NRQL conditions. You may also manage these settings using the GraphQL API (recommended), or the REST API. Go here for specific GraphQL API examples. Loss of signal settings: Loss of signal settings include a time duration and two possible actions. Signal loss expiration time UI label: Signal is lost after: GraphQL Node: expiration.expirationDuration Expiration duration is a timer that starts and resets when we receive a data point in the streaming alerts pipeline. If we don't receive another data point before your 'expiration time' expires, we consider that signal to be lost. This can be because no data is being sent to New Relic or the WHERE clause of your NRQL query is filtering that data out before it is streamed to the alerts pipeline. The loss of signal expiration time is independent of the threshold duration and triggers as soon as the timer expires. The maximum expiration duration is 48 hours. This is helpful when monitoring for the execution of infrequent jobs. The minimum is 30 seconds, but we recommend using at least 3-5 minutes. Loss of signal actions Once a signal is considered lost, you can close open violations, open new violations, or both. Close all current open violations: This closes all open violations that are related to a specific signal. It won't necessarily close all violations for a condition. If you're alerting on an ephemeral service, or on a sporadic signal, you'll want to choose this action to ensure that violations are closed properly. The GraphQL node name for this is \"closeViolationsOnExpiration\" Open new violations: This will open a new violation when the signal is considered lost. These violations will indicate that they are due to a loss of signal. Based on your incident preferences, this should trigger a notification. The graphQL node name for this is \"openViolationOnExpiration\" When you enable both actions, we'll close all open violations first, and then open a new violation for loss of signal. To create a NRQL alert configured with loss of signal detection in the UI: For a policy, when you create a condition, under Select a product, click NRQL, then click Next, define thresholds. Write a NRQL query that returns the values you want to alert on. For Threshold type, select Static or Baseline. Click + Add lost signal threshold, then set the signal expiration duration time in minutes or seconds in the Signal is lost after field. Choose what you want to happen when the signal is lost. You can check one or both of Close all current open violations and Open new \"lost signal\" violation. These control how loss of signal violations will be handled for the condition. Make sure you name your condition before you save it. Violations open due to loss of signal close when the signal comes back. Newly opened lost signal violations will close immediately when new data is evaluated. the condition they belong to expires. By default, conditions expire after 3 days. you manually close the violation with the Close all current open violations option. Tip Loss of signal detection doesn't work on NRQL queries that use nested aggregation or sub-queries. Advanced signal settings When creating a NRQL alert condition, the advanced signal settings gives you better control over streaming alert data and helps you avoid false alarms. When creating a NRQL condition, there are several advanced signal settings: Aggregation window Evaluation offset Fill data gaps To read an explanation of what these settings are and how they relate to each other, see Streaming alerts concepts. Below are instructions and tips on how to configure them. Aggregation window You can set the aggregation window duration to choose how long data is accumulated in a streaming time window before it's aggregated. You can set it to anything between one second and 15 minutes. The default is one minute. Tip Baseline alert condition thresholds don't support editing the aggregation window. They use the 1 minute default. Evaluation offset You can adjust the evaluation offset to coordinate our streaming alerting algorithm with your data's latency. If it takes a while for your data to arrive, then you may need to increase the evaluation offset. The total supported latency is the product of the aggregation window duration multiplied by the evaluation offset. In the example screenshot above, the supported latency is 3 minutes (a 1-minute aggregation window multiplied by three windows). If the data type comes from an APM language agent and is aggregated from many app instances (for example, Transactions, TransactionErrors, etc.), we recommend using an evaluation offset of 3 with 1 minute aggregation windows. Important When creating NRQL conditions for data collected from Infrastructure Cloud Integrations such as AWS Cloudwatch or Azure, we recommend that you start with an evaluation offset of 15 minutes, then adjust up or down depending on how long it takes to collect your data. Fill data gaps Gap filling lets you customize the values to use when your signals don't have any data. You can fill gaps in your data streams with one of these settings: None: (Default) Choose this if you don't want to take any action on empty aggregation windows. On evaluation, an empty aggregation window will reset the threshold duration timer. For example, if a condition says that all aggregation windows must have data points above the threshold for 5 minutes, and 1 of the 5 aggregation windows is empty, then the condition won't be in violation. Custom static value: Choose this if you'd like to insert a custom static value into the empty aggregation windows before they're evaluated. This option has an additional, required parameter of fillValue (as named in the API) that specifies what static value should be used. This defaults to 0. Last known value: This option inserts the last seen value before evaluation occurs. We maintain the state of the last seen value for 2 hours. Tip The alerts system fills gaps in actively reported signals. This signal history is dropped after 2 hours of inactivity. For gap filling, data points received after this period of inactivity are treated as new signals. To learn more about signal loss, gap filling, and how to request access to these features, see this Explorers Hub post. Options for editing data gap settings: In the NRQL conditions UI, go to Condition settings > Advanced signal settings > fill data gaps with and choose an option. If using our Nerdgraph API (preferred), this node is located at: actor : account : alerts : nrqlCondition : signal : fillOption | fillValue NerdGraph is our recommended API for this but if you're using our REST API, you can find this setting in the REST API explorer under the \"signal\" section of the Alert NRQL conditions API.",

      "body": "Applied Intelligence (AI) is our AIOps solution for DevOps, site reliability engineers, and on-call teams. At its core, Applied Intelligence helps you find, troubleshoot, and resolve problems more quickly. Specifically, it’s a hybrid machine learning engine that reduces alert noise, correlates incidents, and automatically detects anomalies. By applying machine learning to your data and feedback, Applied Intelligence is designed to improve functionality and deliver smarter context over time. After connecting your data sources to Applied Intelligence, it looks for potential problems and improves based on your feedback. Why use Applied Intelligence? How you respond to an incident can mean thousands of dollars or clicks for your company. Applied Intelligence helps you solve problems faster. Feature Description Troubleshoot and respond to incidents Our solution helps you understand your incidents and gives you ideas for what to do next. Here are a few examples: Automatically classifies incidents based on the golden signals of site reliability engineering. Identifies entities in your stack that may relate to the underlying issue. Suggests responses for incidents based on historical context. Less noise, more focus As tools and systems become more complex, alert noise can overwhelm DevOps and SRE teams. Applied Intelligence correlates related incidents and suppresses noise, so you're only notified when human action is required. Incidents with a hybrid approach Applied Intelligence streamlines your incidents by combining its built-in inputs with your knowledge and feedback. Over time, the system delivers more accurate insights. For example: Our correlation and classification engine adjusts based on your feedback. The system automatically suggests new correlation rules based on your production data. You can create custom logic using the decision builder. Automatic anomaly detection Applied Intelligence provides automatic anomaly detection on all your APM-monitored applications. We detect anomalies in throughput, latency, and error rate, with no action required from you. Benefits include: No setup required. See anomalies surfaced automatically in the anomalies feed. See them in various New Relic activity streams (for example, on the New Relic One home page). Ability to run NRQL queries of anomalies and create custom dashboards with that data. Determine root causes with Incident Intelligence As part of Applied Intelligence, Incident Intelligence helps you correlate incident events and reduce noise in your environment. With it, you can get an overview of all your issues, see suggested responders, and configure your own correlation logic. To get started, see Incident Intelligence. Find unknowns with Proactive Detection Another feature of Applied Intelligence is Proactive Detection. Proactive Detection is, by default, always on and detecting anomalies. These anomalies are surfaced in the Applied Intelligence anomalies feed, New Relic One activity streams, and can be queried, alerted on, and added to dashboards. Anomalies can be sent to Slack or via webhooks, and/or added as a source for Incident Intelligence correlation and issue notification. Proactive Detection also provides automatic analysis of anomalies and alerts via the analysis page. To get started, see Proactive Detection.",

      "body": "You can use NRQL queries to create alert conditions. Once you've defined your signal, you can further define your warning and critical threshold levels. This determines when an alerts violation is created. Read on to learn more about how to do this. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Click NRQL, and then Next, define thresholds. Tip For more information on key concepts relating to NRQL alert conditions and streaming alerts, see Streaming alerts: key terms and concepts. Create a NRQL alert condition To create a NRQL alert condition for a policy: On one.newrelic.com, in the header click Alerts & AI, then in the left sidebar click Policies. Select an existing policy or click New alert policy to create a new policy. Click Add a condition. Under Select a product click NRQL, and then click Next, define thresholds. Create a condition from a chart You can use a chart to create a NRQL alert condition. To create a NRQL alerts condition from a chart, click the chart menu , then click Create alert condition. Once you've named and customized your condition, you can add it to an existing policy or create a new one. Caution A small number of our older charts don't include the option to create an alert condition. NRQL alert syntax Here's the basic syntax for creating all NRQL alert conditions. The FACET clause is required for outlier threshold types. It's optional for static and baseline. SELECT function(attribute) FROM Event WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Copy Clause Notes SELECT function(attribute) Required Supported functions that return numbers include: apdex average count latest max min percentage percentile sum uniqueCount Tip If you use the percentile aggregator in a faceted alert condition with many facets, this may cause the following error to appear: An error occurred while fetching chart data. If you see this error, use average instead. FROM data type Required Only one data type can be targeted. Supported data types: Event Metric (RAW data points will be returned) WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Use the WHERE clause to specify a series of one or more conditions. All the operators are supported. FACET attribute Required for outlier conditions Include an optional FACET clause in your NRQL syntax depending on the threshold type: static or baseline. Use the FACET clause to separate your results by attribute and alert on each attribute independently. No LIMIT clause is allowed, but all queries will receive the maximum number of facets possible. Faceted queries can return a maximum of 5000 values for static and baseline conditions and a maximum of 500 values for outlier conditions. Important If the query returns more than the maximum number of values, the alert condition can't be created. If you create the condition and the query returns more than this number later, the alert will fail. Modify your query so that it returns a fewer number of values. Reformatting incompatible NRQL Some elements of NRQL used in charts don’t make sense in the streaming context of alerts. Here’s a list of the most common incompatible elements and suggestions for reformatting a NRQL alert query to achieve the same effect. Element Notes SINCE and UNTIL Example: SELECT percentile(largestContentfulPaint, 75) FROM PageViewTiming WHERE (appId = 837807) SINCE yesterday Copy NRQL Alerting produces a never-ending stream of windowed query results, so the SINCE and UNTIL keywords to scope the query to a point in time are not compatible. As a convenience, we automatically strip SINCE and UNTIL from a query when creating a NRQL Alert Condition from the context of a chart. TIMESERIES In NRQL queries, the TIMESERIES clause is used to return data as a time series broken out by a specified period of time. For NRQL alerts, the equivalent property of a signal is the aggregation window. histogram() The histogram() aggregation function is used to generate histograms. histogram() is not compatible with NRQL alerting: histogram aggregations can not be formatted as a time series. To create an alert from a portion of a histogram (e.g. 95th percentile), use the percentile() aggregation function. Multiple Aggregation Functions Each alert condition can only target a single aggregated stream of data. To alert on multiple streams simultaneously, you’ll need to decompose them into individual conditions within the same policy. Original Query: SELECT count(foo), average(bar), max(baz) from Transaction Copy Decomposed: SELECT count(foo) from Transaction SELECT average(bar) from Transaction SELECT max(baz) from Transaction Copy COMPARE WITH The COMPARE WITH clause is used to compare the values for two different time ranges. This type of query is incompatible with NRQL alerting. We recommend using a Baseline Alert Condition to dynamically detect deviations for a particular signal. SLIDE BY The SLIDE BY clause supports a feature known as sliding windows. With sliding windows, SLIDE BY data is gathered into \"windows\" of time that overlap with each other. These windows can help to smooth out line graphs with a lot of variation in cases where the rolling aggregate (such as a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. Sliding windows are not currently supported in NRQL alerts. LIMIT In NRQL queries, the LIMIT clause is used to control the amount of data a query returns, either the maximum number of facet values returned by FACET queries or the maximum number of items returned by SELECT * queries. LIMIT is not compatible with NRQL alerting: evaluation is always performed on the full result set. NRQL alert threshold examples Here are some common use cases for NRQL alert conditions. These queries will work for static and baseline threshold types. The outlier threshold type will require additional FACET clauses. Alert on specific segments of your data Create constrained alerts that target a specific segment of your data, such as a few key customers or a range of data. Use the WHERE clause to define those conditions. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction WHERE account_id in (91290, 102021, 20230) Copy SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction WHERE name LIKE 'Controller/checkout/%' Copy Alert on Nth percentile of your data Create alerts when an Nth percentile of your data hits a specified threshold; for example, maintaining SLA service levels. Since we evaluate the NRQL query in one-minute time windows, percentiles will be calculated for each minute separately. SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentile(databaseDuration, 75) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on max, min, avg of your data Create alerts when your data hits a certain maximum, minimum, or average; for example, ensuring that a duration or response time does not pass a certain threshold. SELECT max(duration) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on a percentage of your data Create alerts when a proportion of your data goes above or below a certain threshold. SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE duration > 2) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE httpResponseCode = '500') FROM Transaction Copy Alert on Apdex with any T-value Create alerts on Apdex, applying your own T-value for certain transactions. For example, get an alert notification when your Apdex for a T-value of 500ms on transactions for production apps goes below 0.8. SELECT apdex(duration, t:0.5) FROM Transaction WHERE appName like '%prod%' Copy Alert conditions and query order of operations By default, the aggregation window is 1 minute, but you can change the window to suit your needs. Whatever the aggregation window, New Relic will collect data for that window using the function in the NRQL alert condition’s query. The query is parsed and executed by our systems in the following order: FROM clause – which event type needs to be grabbed? WHERE clause – what can be filtered out? SELECT clause – what information needs to be returned from the now-filtered data set? Example: null value returned Let's say this is your alert condition query: SELECT count(*) FROM SyntheticCheck WHERE monitorName = 'My Cool Monitor' AND result = 'FAILURE' Copy If there are no failures for the aggregation window: The system will execute the FROM clause by grabbing all SyntheticCheck events on your account. Then it will execute the WHERE clause to filter through those events by looking only for the ones that match the monitor name and result specified. If there are still events left to scan through after completing the FROM and WHERE operations, the SELECT clause will be executed. If there are no remaining events, the SELECT clause will not be executed. This means that aggregators like count() and uniqueCount() will never return a zero value. When there is a count of 0, the SELECT clause is ignored and no data is returned, resulting in a value of NULL. Example: zero value returned If you have a data source delivering legitimate numeric zeroes, the query will return zero values and not null values. Let's say this is your alert condition query, and that MyCoolEvent is an attribute that can sometimes return a zero value. SELECT average(MyCoolAttribute) FROM MyCoolEvent Copy If, in the aggregation window being evaluated, there's at least one instance of MyCoolEvent and if the average value of all MyCoolAttribute attributes from that window is equal to zero, then a 0 value will be returned. If there are no MyCoolEvent events during that minute, then a NULL will be returned due to the order of operations. Tip For more information about this topic, you can check out our blog post on troubleshooting for zero versus null values. Tip You can determine how null values will be handled by adjusting loss of signal and gap filling settings in the Alert Conditions UI. Tip You can avoid NULL values entirely with a query order of operations shortcut. Do this by using a filter sub-clause, then including all filter elements within that sub-clause. The main body of the query will run and return data, at which point the SELECT clause will then run and apply the filter elements. The query will return a value of 0 if the filter elements result in no matching data. Here's an example: SELECT filter(count(*), WHERE result = 'SUCCESS' AND monitorName = 'My Favorite Monitor') FROM SyntheticCheck Copy Nested aggregation NRQL alerts Nested aggregation queries are a powerful way to query your data. However, they have a few restrictions that are important to note. Nested queries with a non-faceted innermost query are not currently supported Without a FACET, the inner query produces a single result, giving the outer query nothing to aggregate. If you're using a nested query, make sure your inner query is faceted. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu) ​​​​​ Copy Queries at all levels must have the same aggregation window size With an alert aggregation window of 1 minute, the inner query would produce two smaller windows of 30 seconds. In theory, these two windows could be aggregated by the outer query. However, this is not currently supported. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu TIMESERIES 30 seconds)​​ Copy Signal loss is not yet supported for nested queries For more information on signal loss, see NerdGraph API: Loss of signal and gap filling. Nested queries containing 'WITH METRIC_FORMAT' in the inner query are not currently supported You can't use a nested query containing the WITH METRIC_FORMAT in the inner query to create NRQL alert conditions. NRQL condition creation tips Here are some tips for creating and using a NRQL condition: Topic Tips Condition threshold types NRQL condition threshold types include static, baseline, and outlier. Create a description For NRQL conditions, you can create a custom description to add to each violation. Descriptions can be enhanced with variable substitution based on metadata in the specific violation. For details, see Description Query results Queries must return a number. The condition evaluates the returned number against the thresholds you've set. Time period As with all alert conditions, NRQL conditions evaluate one single minute at a time. The implicit SINCE ... UNTIL clause specifying which minute to evaluate is controlled by your Evaluation offset setting. Since very recent data may be incomplete, you may want to query data from 3 minutes ago or longer, especially for: Applications that run on multiple hosts. SyntheticCheck data: Timeouts can take 3 minutes, so 5 minutes or more is recommended. Also, if a query will generate intermittent data, consider using the sum of query results option. Lost signal threshold (loss of signal detection) You can use loss of signal detection to alert on when your data (a telemetry signal) should be considered lost. A signal loss can indicate that a service or entity is no longer online or that a periodic job failed to run. You can also use this to make sure that violations for sporadic data, such as error counts, are closed when no signal is coming in. Advanced signal settings These settings give you options for better handling continuous, streaming data signals that may sometimes be missing. These settings include the aggregation window, the evaluation offset, and an option for filling data gaps. For more on using these, see Advanced signal settings. Condition settings Use the Condition settings to: Create a concise, descriptive condition name. Provide a custom violation description for the condition that will be included in violations and notifications. Add the runbook URL to include your organization's procedures for handling incidents. You may also add this information to the custom violation description. Limits on conditions See the maximum values. Health status NRQL alert conditions don't affect an entity's health status display. Examples For more information, see: Expected NRQL syntax Examples of NRQL condition queries Alert threshold types When you create a NRQL alert, you can choose from different types of thresholds: NRQL alert threshold types Description Static This is the simplest type of NRQL threshold. It allows you to create a condition based on a NRQL query that returns a numeric value. Optional: Include a FACET clause. Baseline (Dynamic) Uses a self-adjusting condition based on the past behavior of the monitored values. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type. Outlier Looks for group behavior and values that are outliers from those groups. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type, but requires a FACET clause. Sum of query results (limited or intermittent data) Important Available only for static (basic) threshold types. If a query returns intermittent or limited data, it may be difficult to set a meaningful threshold. Missing or limited data will sometimes generate false positives or false negatives. You can use loss of signal, aggregation duration, and gap filling settings to minimize these false notifications. To avoid this problem when using the static threshold type, you can set the selector to sum of query results. This lets you set the alert on an aggregated sum instead of a value from a single harvest cycle. Up to two hours of one-minute data checks can be aggregated. The duration you select determines the width of the rolling sum and the preview chart will update accordingly. Set the loss of signal threshold Loss of signal occurs when no data matches the NRQL condition over a specific period of time. You can set your loss of signal threshold duration and and also what happens when the threshold is crossed. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Loss of signal is only available for NRQL conditions. You may also manage these settings using the GraphQL API (recommended), or the REST API. Go here for specific GraphQL API examples. Loss of signal settings: Loss of signal settings include a time duration and two possible actions. Signal loss expiration time UI label: Signal is lost after: GraphQL Node: expiration.expirationDuration Expiration duration is a timer that starts and resets when we receive a data point in the streaming alerts pipeline. If we don't receive another data point before your 'expiration time' expires, we consider that signal to be lost. This can be because no data is being sent to New Relic or the WHERE clause of your NRQL query is filtering that data out before it is streamed to the alerts pipeline. The loss of signal expiration time is independent of the threshold duration and triggers as soon as the timer expires. The maximum expiration duration is 48 hours. This is helpful when monitoring for the execution of infrequent jobs. The minimum is 30 seconds, but we recommend using at least 3-5 minutes. Loss of signal actions Once a signal is considered lost, you can close open violations, open new violations, or both. Close all current open violations: This closes all open violations that are related to a specific signal. It won't necessarily close all violations for a condition. If you're alerting on an ephemeral service, or on a sporadic signal, you'll want to choose this action to ensure that violations are closed properly. The GraphQL node name for this is \"closeViolationsOnExpiration\" Open new violations: This will open a new violation when the signal is considered lost. These violations will indicate that they are due to a loss of signal. Based on your incident preferences, this should trigger a notification. The graphQL node name for this is \"openViolationOnExpiration\" When you enable both actions, we'll close all open violations first, and then open a new violation for loss of signal. To create a NRQL alert configured with loss of signal detection in the UI: For a policy, when you create a condition, under Select a product, click NRQL, then click Next, define thresholds. Write a NRQL query that returns the values you want to alert on. For Threshold type, select Static or Baseline. Click + Add lost signal threshold, then set the signal expiration duration time in minutes or seconds in the Signal is lost after field. Choose what you want to happen when the signal is lost. You can check one or both of Close all current open violations and Open new \"lost signal\" violation. These control how loss of signal violations will be handled for the condition. Make sure you name your condition before you save it. Violations open due to loss of signal close when the signal comes back. Newly opened lost signal violations will close immediately when new data is evaluated. the condition they belong to expires. By default, conditions expire after 3 days. you manually close the violation with the Close all current open violations option. Tip Loss of signal detection doesn't work on NRQL queries that use nested aggregation or sub-queries. Advanced signal settings When creating a NRQL alert condition, the advanced signal settings gives you better control over streaming alert data and helps you avoid false alarms. When creating a NRQL condition, there are several advanced signal settings: Aggregation window Evaluation offset Fill data gaps To read an explanation of what these settings are and how they relate to each other, see Streaming alerts concepts. Below are instructions and tips on how to configure them. Aggregation window You can set the aggregation window duration to choose how long data is accumulated in a streaming time window before it's aggregated. You can set it to anything between one second and 15 minutes. The default is one minute. Tip Baseline alert condition thresholds don't support editing the aggregation window. They use the 1 minute default. Evaluation offset You can adjust the evaluation offset to coordinate our streaming alerting algorithm with your data's latency. If it takes a while for your data to arrive, then you may need to increase the evaluation offset. The total supported latency is the product of the aggregation window duration multiplied by the evaluation offset. In the example screenshot above, the supported latency is 3 minutes (a 1-minute aggregation window multiplied by three windows). If the data type comes from an APM language agent and is aggregated from many app instances (for example, Transactions, TransactionErrors, etc.), we recommend using an evaluation offset of 3 with 1 minute aggregation windows. Important When creating NRQL conditions for data collected from Infrastructure Cloud Integrations such as AWS Cloudwatch or Azure, we recommend that you start with an evaluation offset of 15 minutes, then adjust up or down depending on how long it takes to collect your data. Fill data gaps Gap filling lets you customize the values to use when your signals don't have any data. You can fill gaps in your data streams with one of these settings: None: (Default) Choose this if you don't want to take any action on empty aggregation windows. On evaluation, an empty aggregation window will reset the threshold duration timer. For example, if a condition says that all aggregation windows must have data points above the threshold for 5 minutes, and 1 of the 5 aggregation windows is empty, then the condition won't be in violation. Custom static value: Choose this if you'd like to insert a custom static value into the empty aggregation windows before they're evaluated. This option has an additional, required parameter of fillValue (as named in the API) that specifies what static value should be used. This defaults to 0. Last known value: This option inserts the last seen value before evaluation occurs. We maintain the state of the last seen value for 2 hours. Tip The alerts system fills gaps in actively reported signals. This signal history is dropped after 2 hours of inactivity. For gap filling, data points received after this period of inactivity are treated as new signals. To learn more about signal loss, gap filling, and how to request access to these features, see this Explorers Hub post. Options for editing data gap settings: In the NRQL conditions UI, go to Condition settings > Advanced signal settings > fill data gaps with and choose an option. If using our Nerdgraph API (preferred), this node is located at: actor : account : alerts : nrqlCondition : signal : fillOption | fillValue NerdGraph is our recommended API for this but if you're using our REST API, you can find this setting in the REST API explorer under the \"signal\" section of the Alert NRQL conditions API.",

      "body": "Applied Intelligence (AI) is our AIOps solution for DevOps, site reliability engineers, and on-call teams. At its core, Applied Intelligence helps you find, troubleshoot, and resolve problems more quickly. Specifically, it’s a hybrid machine learning engine that reduces alert noise, correlates incidents, and automatically detects anomalies. By applying machine learning to your data and feedback, Applied Intelligence is designed to improve functionality and deliver smarter context over time. After connecting your data sources to Applied Intelligence, it looks for potential problems and improves based on your feedback. Why use Applied Intelligence? How you respond to an incident can mean thousands of dollars or clicks for your company. Applied Intelligence helps you solve problems faster. Feature Description Troubleshoot and respond to incidents Our solution helps you understand your incidents and gives you ideas for what to do next. Here are a few examples: Automatically classifies incidents based on the golden signals of site reliability engineering. Identifies entities in your stack that may relate to the underlying issue. Suggests responses for incidents based on historical context. Less noise, more focus As tools and systems become more complex, alert noise can overwhelm DevOps and SRE teams. Applied Intelligence correlates related incidents and suppresses noise, so you're only notified when human action is required. Incidents with a hybrid approach Applied Intelligence streamlines your incidents by combining its built-in inputs with your knowledge and feedback. Over time, the system delivers more accurate insights. For example: Our correlation and classification engine adjusts based on your feedback. The system automatically suggests new correlation rules based on your production data. You can create custom logic using the decision builder. Automatic anomaly detection Applied Intelligence provides automatic anomaly detection on all your APM-monitored applications. We detect anomalies in throughput, latency, and error rate, with no action required from you. Benefits include: No setup required. See anomalies surfaced automatically in the anomalies feed. See them in various New Relic activity streams (for example, on the New Relic One home page). Ability to run NRQL queries of anomalies and create custom dashboards with that data. Determine root causes with Incident Intelligence As part of Applied Intelligence, Incident Intelligence helps you correlate incident events and reduce noise in your environment. With it, you can get an overview of all your issues, see suggested responders, and configure your own correlation logic. To get started, see Incident Intelligence. Find unknowns with Proactive Detection Another feature of Applied Intelligence is Proactive Detection. Proactive Detection is, by default, always on and detecting anomalies. These anomalies are surfaced in the Applied Intelligence anomalies feed, New Relic One activity streams, and can be queried, alerted on, and added to dashboards. Anomalies can be sent to Slack or via webhooks, and/or added as a source for Incident Intelligence correlation and issue notification. Proactive Detection also provides automatic analysis of anomalies and alerts via the analysis page. To get started, see Proactive Detection.",

      "body": "You can use NRQL queries to create alert conditions. Once you've defined your signal, you can further define your warning and critical threshold levels. This determines when an alerts violation is created. Read on to learn more about how to do this. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Click NRQL, and then Next, define thresholds. Tip For more information on key concepts relating to NRQL alert conditions and streaming alerts, see Streaming alerts: key terms and concepts. Create a NRQL alert condition To create a NRQL alert condition for a policy: On one.newrelic.com, in the header click Alerts & AI, then in the left sidebar click Policies. Select an existing policy or click New alert policy to create a new policy. Click Add a condition. Under Select a product click NRQL, and then click Next, define thresholds. Create a condition from a chart You can use a chart to create a NRQL alert condition. To create a NRQL alerts condition from a chart, click the chart menu , then click Create alert condition. Once you've named and customized your condition, you can add it to an existing policy or create a new one. Caution A small number of our older charts don't include the option to create an alert condition. NRQL alert syntax Here's the basic syntax for creating all NRQL alert conditions. The FACET clause is required for outlier threshold types. It's optional for static and baseline. SELECT function(attribute) FROM Event WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Copy Clause Notes SELECT function(attribute) Required Supported functions that return numbers include: apdex average count latest max min percentage percentile sum uniqueCount Tip If you use the percentile aggregator in a faceted alert condition with many facets, this may cause the following error to appear: An error occurred while fetching chart data. If you see this error, use average instead. FROM data type Required Only one data type can be targeted. Supported data types: Event Metric (RAW data points will be returned) WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Use the WHERE clause to specify a series of one or more conditions. All the operators are supported. FACET attribute Required for outlier conditions Include an optional FACET clause in your NRQL syntax depending on the threshold type: static or baseline. Use the FACET clause to separate your results by attribute and alert on each attribute independently. No LIMIT clause is allowed, but all queries will receive the maximum number of facets possible. Faceted queries can return a maximum of 5000 values for static and baseline conditions and a maximum of 500 values for outlier conditions. Important If the query returns more than the maximum number of values, the alert condition can't be created. If you create the condition and the query returns more than this number later, the alert will fail. Modify your query so that it returns a fewer number of values. Reformatting incompatible NRQL Some elements of NRQL used in charts don’t make sense in the streaming context of alerts. Here’s a list of the most common incompatible elements and suggestions for reformatting a NRQL alert query to achieve the same effect. Element Notes SINCE and UNTIL Example: SELECT percentile(largestContentfulPaint, 75) FROM PageViewTiming WHERE (appId = 837807) SINCE yesterday Copy NRQL Alerting produces a never-ending stream of windowed query results, so the SINCE and UNTIL keywords to scope the query to a point in time are not compatible. As a convenience, we automatically strip SINCE and UNTIL from a query when creating a NRQL Alert Condition from the context of a chart. TIMESERIES In NRQL queries, the TIMESERIES clause is used to return data as a time series broken out by a specified period of time. For NRQL alerts, the equivalent property of a signal is the aggregation window. histogram() The histogram() aggregation function is used to generate histograms. histogram() is not compatible with NRQL alerting: histogram aggregations can not be formatted as a time series. To create an alert from a portion of a histogram (e.g. 95th percentile), use the percentile() aggregation function. Multiple Aggregation Functions Each alert condition can only target a single aggregated stream of data. To alert on multiple streams simultaneously, you’ll need to decompose them into individual conditions within the same policy. Original Query: SELECT count(foo), average(bar), max(baz) from Transaction Copy Decomposed: SELECT count(foo) from Transaction SELECT average(bar) from Transaction SELECT max(baz) from Transaction Copy COMPARE WITH The COMPARE WITH clause is used to compare the values for two different time ranges. This type of query is incompatible with NRQL alerting. We recommend using a Baseline Alert Condition to dynamically detect deviations for a particular signal. SLIDE BY The SLIDE BY clause supports a feature known as sliding windows. With sliding windows, SLIDE BY data is gathered into \"windows\" of time that overlap with each other. These windows can help to smooth out line graphs with a lot of variation in cases where the rolling aggregate (such as a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. Sliding windows are not currently supported in NRQL alerts. LIMIT In NRQL queries, the LIMIT clause is used to control the amount of data a query returns, either the maximum number of facet values returned by FACET queries or the maximum number of items returned by SELECT * queries. LIMIT is not compatible with NRQL alerting: evaluation is always performed on the full result set. NRQL alert threshold examples Here are some common use cases for NRQL alert conditions. These queries will work for static and baseline threshold types. The outlier threshold type will require additional FACET clauses. Alert on specific segments of your data Create constrained alerts that target a specific segment of your data, such as a few key customers or a range of data. Use the WHERE clause to define those conditions. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction WHERE account_id in (91290, 102021, 20230) Copy SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction WHERE name LIKE 'Controller/checkout/%' Copy Alert on Nth percentile of your data Create alerts when an Nth percentile of your data hits a specified threshold; for example, maintaining SLA service levels. Since we evaluate the NRQL query in one-minute time windows, percentiles will be calculated for each minute separately. SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentile(databaseDuration, 75) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on max, min, avg of your data Create alerts when your data hits a certain maximum, minimum, or average; for example, ensuring that a duration or response time does not pass a certain threshold. SELECT max(duration) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on a percentage of your data Create alerts when a proportion of your data goes above or below a certain threshold. SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE duration > 2) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE httpResponseCode = '500') FROM Transaction Copy Alert on Apdex with any T-value Create alerts on Apdex, applying your own T-value for certain transactions. For example, get an alert notification when your Apdex for a T-value of 500ms on transactions for production apps goes below 0.8. SELECT apdex(duration, t:0.5) FROM Transaction WHERE appName like '%prod%' Copy Alert conditions and query order of operations By default, the aggregation window is 1 minute, but you can change the window to suit your needs. Whatever the aggregation window, New Relic will collect data for that window using the function in the NRQL alert condition’s query. The query is parsed and executed by our systems in the following order: FROM clause – which event type needs to be grabbed? WHERE clause – what can be filtered out? SELECT clause – what information needs to be returned from the now-filtered data set? Example: null value returned Let's say this is your alert condition query: SELECT count(*) FROM SyntheticCheck WHERE monitorName = 'My Cool Monitor' AND result = 'FAILURE' Copy If there are no failures for the aggregation window: The system will execute the FROM clause by grabbing all SyntheticCheck events on your account. Then it will execute the WHERE clause to filter through those events by looking only for the ones that match the monitor name and result specified. If there are still events left to scan through after completing the FROM and WHERE operations, the SELECT clause will be executed. If there are no remaining events, the SELECT clause will not be executed. This means that aggregators like count() and uniqueCount() will never return a zero value. When there is a count of 0, the SELECT clause is ignored and no data is returned, resulting in a value of NULL. Example: zero value returned If you have a data source delivering legitimate numeric zeroes, the query will return zero values and not null values. Let's say this is your alert condition query, and that MyCoolEvent is an attribute that can sometimes return a zero value. SELECT average(MyCoolAttribute) FROM MyCoolEvent Copy If, in the aggregation window being evaluated, there's at least one instance of MyCoolEvent and if the average value of all MyCoolAttribute attributes from that window is equal to zero, then a 0 value will be returned. If there are no MyCoolEvent events during that minute, then a NULL will be returned due to the order of operations. Tip For more information about this topic, you can check out our blog post on troubleshooting for zero versus null values. Tip You can determine how null values will be handled by adjusting loss of signal and gap filling settings in the Alert Conditions UI. Tip You can avoid NULL values entirely with a query order of operations shortcut. Do this by using a filter sub-clause, then including all filter elements within that sub-clause. The main body of the query will run and return data, at which point the SELECT clause will then run and apply the filter elements. The query will return a value of 0 if the filter elements result in no matching data. Here's an example: SELECT filter(count(*), WHERE result = 'SUCCESS' AND monitorName = 'My Favorite Monitor') FROM SyntheticCheck Copy Nested aggregation NRQL alerts Nested aggregation queries are a powerful way to query your data. However, they have a few restrictions that are important to note. Nested queries with a non-faceted innermost query are not currently supported Without a FACET, the inner query produces a single result, giving the outer query nothing to aggregate. If you're using a nested query, make sure your inner query is faceted. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu) ​​​​​ Copy Queries at all levels must have the same aggregation window size With an alert aggregation window of 1 minute, the inner query would produce two smaller windows of 30 seconds. In theory, these two windows could be aggregated by the outer query. However, this is not currently supported. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu TIMESERIES 30 seconds)​​ Copy Signal loss is not yet supported for nested queries For more information on signal loss, see NerdGraph API: Loss of signal and gap filling. Nested queries containing 'WITH METRIC_FORMAT' in the inner query are not currently supported You can't use a nested query containing the WITH METRIC_FORMAT in the inner query to create NRQL alert conditions. NRQL condition creation tips Here are some tips for creating and using a NRQL condition: Topic Tips Condition threshold types NRQL condition threshold types include static, baseline, and outlier. Create a description For NRQL conditions, you can create a custom description to add to each violation. Descriptions can be enhanced with variable substitution based on metadata in the specific violation. For details, see Description Query results Queries must return a number. The condition evaluates the returned number against the thresholds you've set. Time period As with all alert conditions, NRQL conditions evaluate one single minute at a time. The implicit SINCE ... UNTIL clause specifying which minute to evaluate is controlled by your Evaluation offset setting. Since very recent data may be incomplete, you may want to query data from 3 minutes ago or longer, especially for: Applications that run on multiple hosts. SyntheticCheck data: Timeouts can take 3 minutes, so 5 minutes or more is recommended. Also, if a query will generate intermittent data, consider using the sum of query results option. Lost signal threshold (loss of signal detection) You can use loss of signal detection to alert on when your data (a telemetry signal) should be considered lost. A signal loss can indicate that a service or entity is no longer online or that a periodic job failed to run. You can also use this to make sure that violations for sporadic data, such as error counts, are closed when no signal is coming in. Advanced signal settings These settings give you options for better handling continuous, streaming data signals that may sometimes be missing. These settings include the aggregation window, the evaluation offset, and an option for filling data gaps. For more on using these, see Advanced signal settings. Condition settings Use the Condition settings to: Create a concise, descriptive condition name. Provide a custom violation description for the condition that will be included in violations and notifications. Add the runbook URL to include your organization's procedures for handling incidents. You may also add this information to the custom violation description. Limits on conditions See the maximum values. Health status NRQL alert conditions don't affect an entity's health status display. Examples For more information, see: Expected NRQL syntax Examples of NRQL condition queries Alert threshold types When you create a NRQL alert, you can choose from different types of thresholds: NRQL alert threshold types Description Static This is the simplest type of NRQL threshold. It allows you to create a condition based on a NRQL query that returns a numeric value. Optional: Include a FACET clause. Baseline (Dynamic) Uses a self-adjusting condition based on the past behavior of the monitored values. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type. Outlier Looks for group behavior and values that are outliers from those groups. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type, but requires a FACET clause. Sum of query results (limited or intermittent data) Important Available only for static (basic) threshold types. If a query returns intermittent or limited data, it may be difficult to set a meaningful threshold. Missing or limited data will sometimes generate false positives or false negatives. You can use loss of signal, aggregation duration, and gap filling settings to minimize these false notifications. To avoid this problem when using the static threshold type, you can set the selector to sum of query results. This lets you set the alert on an aggregated sum instead of a value from a single harvest cycle. Up to two hours of one-minute data checks can be aggregated. The duration you select determines the width of the rolling sum and the preview chart will update accordingly. Set the loss of signal threshold Loss of signal occurs when no data matches the NRQL condition over a specific period of time. You can set your loss of signal threshold duration and and also what happens when the threshold is crossed. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Loss of signal is only available for NRQL conditions. You may also manage these settings using the GraphQL API (recommended), or the REST API. Go here for specific GraphQL API examples. Loss of signal settings: Loss of signal settings include a time duration and two possible actions. Signal loss expiration time UI label: Signal is lost after: GraphQL Node: expiration.expirationDuration Expiration duration is a timer that starts and resets when we receive a data point in the streaming alerts pipeline. If we don't receive another data point before your 'expiration time' expires, we consider that signal to be lost. This can be because no data is being sent to New Relic or the WHERE clause of your NRQL query is filtering that data out before it is streamed to the alerts pipeline. The loss of signal expiration time is independent of the threshold duration and triggers as soon as the timer expires. The maximum expiration duration is 48 hours. This is helpful when monitoring for the execution of infrequent jobs. The minimum is 30 seconds, but we recommend using at least 3-5 minutes. Loss of signal actions Once a signal is considered lost, you can close open violations, open new violations, or both. Close all current open violations: This closes all open violations that are related to a specific signal. It won't necessarily close all violations for a condition. If you're alerting on an ephemeral service, or on a sporadic signal, you'll want to choose this action to ensure that violations are closed properly. The GraphQL node name for this is \"closeViolationsOnExpiration\" Open new violations: This will open a new violation when the signal is considered lost. These violations will indicate that they are due to a loss of signal. Based on your incident preferences, this should trigger a notification. The graphQL node name for this is \"openViolationOnExpiration\" When you enable both actions, we'll close all open violations first, and then open a new violation for loss of signal. To create a NRQL alert configured with loss of signal detection in the UI: For a policy, when you create a condition, under Select a product, click NRQL, then click Next, define thresholds. Write a NRQL query that returns the values you want to alert on. For Threshold type, select Static or Baseline. Click + Add lost signal threshold, then set the signal expiration duration time in minutes or seconds in the Signal is lost after field. Choose what you want to happen when the signal is lost. You can check one or both of Close all current open violations and Open new \"lost signal\" violation. These control how loss of signal violations will be handled for the condition. Make sure you name your condition before you save it. Violations open due to loss of signal close when the signal comes back. Newly opened lost signal violations will close immediately when new data is evaluated. the condition they belong to expires. By default, conditions expire after 3 days. you manually close the violation with the Close all current open violations option. Tip Loss of signal detection doesn't work on NRQL queries that use nested aggregation or sub-queries. Advanced signal settings When creating a NRQL alert condition, the advanced signal settings gives you better control over streaming alert data and helps you avoid false alarms. When creating a NRQL condition, there are several advanced signal settings: Aggregation window Evaluation offset Fill data gaps To read an explanation of what these settings are and how they relate to each other, see Streaming alerts concepts. Below are instructions and tips on how to configure them. Aggregation window You can set the aggregation window duration to choose how long data is accumulated in a streaming time window before it's aggregated. You can set it to anything between one second and 15 minutes. The default is one minute. Tip Baseline alert condition thresholds don't support editing the aggregation window. They use the 1 minute default. Evaluation offset You can adjust the evaluation offset to coordinate our streaming alerting algorithm with your data's latency. If it takes a while for your data to arrive, then you may need to increase the evaluation offset. The total supported latency is the product of the aggregation window duration multiplied by the evaluation offset. In the example screenshot above, the supported latency is 3 minutes (a 1-minute aggregation window multiplied by three windows). If the data type comes from an APM language agent and is aggregated from many app instances (for example, Transactions, TransactionErrors, etc.), we recommend using an evaluation offset of 3 with 1 minute aggregation windows. Important When creating NRQL conditions for data collected from Infrastructure Cloud Integrations such as AWS Cloudwatch or Azure, we recommend that you start with an evaluation offset of 15 minutes, then adjust up or down depending on how long it takes to collect your data. Fill data gaps Gap filling lets you customize the values to use when your signals don't have any data. You can fill gaps in your data streams with one of these settings: None: (Default) Choose this if you don't want to take any action on empty aggregation windows. On evaluation, an empty aggregation window will reset the threshold duration timer. For example, if a condition says that all aggregation windows must have data points above the threshold for 5 minutes, and 1 of the 5 aggregation windows is empty, then the condition won't be in violation. Custom static value: Choose this if you'd like to insert a custom static value into the empty aggregation windows before they're evaluated. This option has an additional, required parameter of fillValue (as named in the API) that specifies what static value should be used. This defaults to 0. Last known value: This option inserts the last seen value before evaluation occurs. We maintain the state of the last seen value for 2 hours. Tip The alerts system fills gaps in actively reported signals. This signal history is dropped after 2 hours of inactivity. For gap filling, data points received after this period of inactivity are treated as new signals. To learn more about signal loss, gap filling, and how to request access to these features, see this Explorers Hub post. Options for editing data gap settings: In the NRQL conditions UI, go to Condition settings > Advanced signal settings > fill data gaps with and choose an option. If using our Nerdgraph API (preferred), this node is located at: actor : account : alerts : nrqlCondition : signal : fillOption | fillValue NerdGraph is our recommended API for this but if you're using our REST API, you can find this setting in the REST API explorer under the \"signal\" section of the Alert NRQL conditions API.",

      "body": "Applied Intelligence (AI) is our AIOps solution for DevOps, site reliability engineers, and on-call teams. At its core, Applied Intelligence helps you find, troubleshoot, and resolve problems more quickly. Specifically, it’s a hybrid machine learning engine that reduces alert noise, correlates incidents, and automatically detects anomalies. By applying machine learning to your data and feedback, Applied Intelligence is designed to improve functionality and deliver smarter context over time. After connecting your data sources to Applied Intelligence, it looks for potential problems and improves based on your feedback. Why use Applied Intelligence? How you respond to an incident can mean thousands of dollars or clicks for your company. Applied Intelligence helps you solve problems faster. Feature Description Troubleshoot and respond to incidents Our solution helps you understand your incidents and gives you ideas for what to do next. Here are a few examples: Automatically classifies incidents based on the golden signals of site reliability engineering. Identifies entities in your stack that may relate to the underlying issue. Suggests responses for incidents based on historical context. Less noise, more focus As tools and systems become more complex, alert noise can overwhelm DevOps and SRE teams. Applied Intelligence correlates related incidents and suppresses noise, so you're only notified when human action is required. Incidents with a hybrid approach Applied Intelligence streamlines your incidents by combining its built-in inputs with your knowledge and feedback. Over time, the system delivers more accurate insights. For example: Our correlation and classification engine adjusts based on your feedback. The system automatically suggests new correlation rules based on your production data. You can create custom logic using the decision builder. Automatic anomaly detection Applied Intelligence provides automatic anomaly detection on all your APM-monitored applications. We detect anomalies in throughput, latency, and error rate, with no action required from you. Benefits include: No setup required. See anomalies surfaced automatically in the anomalies feed. See them in various New Relic activity streams (for example, on the New Relic One home page). Ability to run NRQL queries of anomalies and create custom dashboards with that data. Determine root causes with Incident Intelligence As part of Applied Intelligence, Incident Intelligence helps you correlate incident events and reduce noise in your environment. With it, you can get an overview of all your issues, see suggested responders, and configure your own correlation logic. To get started, see Incident Intelligence. Find unknowns with Proactive Detection Another feature of Applied Intelligence is Proactive Detection. Proactive Detection is, by default, always on and detecting anomalies. These anomalies are surfaced in the Applied Intelligence anomalies feed, New Relic One activity streams, and can be queried, alerted on, and added to dashboards. Anomalies can be sent to Slack or via webhooks, and/or added as a source for Incident Intelligence correlation and issue notification. Proactive Detection also provides automatic analysis of anomalies and alerts via the analysis page. To get started, see Proactive Detection.",

      "body": "You can use NRQL queries to create alert conditions. Once you've defined your signal, you can further define your warning and critical threshold levels. This determines when an alerts violation is created. Read on to learn more about how to do this. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Click NRQL, and then Next, define thresholds. Tip For more information on key concepts relating to NRQL alert conditions and streaming alerts, see Streaming alerts: key terms and concepts. Create a NRQL alert condition To create a NRQL alert condition for a policy: On one.newrelic.com, in the header click Alerts & AI, then in the left sidebar click Policies. Select an existing policy or click New alert policy to create a new policy. Click Add a condition. Under Select a product click NRQL, and then click Next, define thresholds. Create a condition from a chart You can use a chart to create a NRQL alert condition. To create a NRQL alerts condition from a chart, click the chart menu , then click Create alert condition. Once you've named and customized your condition, you can add it to an existing policy or create a new one. Caution A small number of our older charts don't include the option to create an alert condition. NRQL alert syntax Here's the basic syntax for creating all NRQL alert conditions. The FACET clause is required for outlier threshold types. It's optional for static and baseline. SELECT function(attribute) FROM Event WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Copy Clause Notes SELECT function(attribute) Required Supported functions that return numbers include: apdex average count latest max min percentage percentile sum uniqueCount Tip If you use the percentile aggregator in a faceted alert condition with many facets, this may cause the following error to appear: An error occurred while fetching chart data. If you see this error, use average instead. FROM data type Required Only one data type can be targeted. Supported data types: Event Metric (RAW data points will be returned) WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Use the WHERE clause to specify a series of one or more conditions. All the operators are supported. FACET attribute Required for outlier conditions Include an optional FACET clause in your NRQL syntax depending on the threshold type: static or baseline. Use the FACET clause to separate your results by attribute and alert on each attribute independently. No LIMIT clause is allowed, but all queries will receive the maximum number of facets possible. Faceted queries can return a maximum of 5000 values for static and baseline conditions and a maximum of 500 values for outlier conditions. Important If the query returns more than the maximum number of values, the alert condition can't be created. If you create the condition and the query returns more than this number later, the alert will fail. Modify your query so that it returns a fewer number of values. Reformatting incompatible NRQL Some elements of NRQL used in charts don’t make sense in the streaming context of alerts. Here’s a list of the most common incompatible elements and suggestions for reformatting a NRQL alert query to achieve the same effect. Element Notes SINCE and UNTIL Example: SELECT percentile(largestContentfulPaint, 75) FROM PageViewTiming WHERE (appId = 837807) SINCE yesterday Copy NRQL Alerting produces a never-ending stream of windowed query results, so the SINCE and UNTIL keywords to scope the query to a point in time are not compatible. As a convenience, we automatically strip SINCE and UNTIL from a query when creating a NRQL Alert Condition from the context of a chart. TIMESERIES In NRQL queries, the TIMESERIES clause is used to return data as a time series broken out by a specified period of time. For NRQL alerts, the equivalent property of a signal is the aggregation window. histogram() The histogram() aggregation function is used to generate histograms. histogram() is not compatible with NRQL alerting: histogram aggregations can not be formatted as a time series. To create an alert from a portion of a histogram (e.g. 95th percentile), use the percentile() aggregation function. Multiple Aggregation Functions Each alert condition can only target a single aggregated stream of data. To alert on multiple streams simultaneously, you’ll need to decompose them into individual conditions within the same policy. Original Query: SELECT count(foo), average(bar), max(baz) from Transaction Copy Decomposed: SELECT count(foo) from Transaction SELECT average(bar) from Transaction SELECT max(baz) from Transaction Copy COMPARE WITH The COMPARE WITH clause is used to compare the values for two different time ranges. This type of query is incompatible with NRQL alerting. We recommend using a Baseline Alert Condition to dynamically detect deviations for a particular signal. SLIDE BY The SLIDE BY clause supports a feature known as sliding windows. With sliding windows, SLIDE BY data is gathered into \"windows\" of time that overlap with each other. These windows can help to smooth out line graphs with a lot of variation in cases where the rolling aggregate (such as a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. Sliding windows are not currently supported in NRQL alerts. LIMIT In NRQL queries, the LIMIT clause is used to control the amount of data a query returns, either the maximum number of facet values returned by FACET queries or the maximum number of items returned by SELECT * queries. LIMIT is not compatible with NRQL alerting: evaluation is always performed on the full result set. NRQL alert threshold examples Here are some common use cases for NRQL alert conditions. These queries will work for static and baseline threshold types. The outlier threshold type will require additional FACET clauses. Alert on specific segments of your data Create constrained alerts that target a specific segment of your data, such as a few key customers or a range of data. Use the WHERE clause to define those conditions. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction WHERE account_id in (91290, 102021, 20230) Copy SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction WHERE name LIKE 'Controller/checkout/%' Copy Alert on Nth percentile of your data Create alerts when an Nth percentile of your data hits a specified threshold; for example, maintaining SLA service levels. Since we evaluate the NRQL query in one-minute time windows, percentiles will be calculated for each minute separately. SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentile(databaseDuration, 75) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on max, min, avg of your data Create alerts when your data hits a certain maximum, minimum, or average; for example, ensuring that a duration or response time does not pass a certain threshold. SELECT max(duration) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on a percentage of your data Create alerts when a proportion of your data goes above or below a certain threshold. SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE duration > 2) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE httpResponseCode = '500') FROM Transaction Copy Alert on Apdex with any T-value Create alerts on Apdex, applying your own T-value for certain transactions. For example, get an alert notification when your Apdex for a T-value of 500ms on transactions for production apps goes below 0.8. SELECT apdex(duration, t:0.5) FROM Transaction WHERE appName like '%prod%' Copy Alert conditions and query order of operations By default, the aggregation window is 1 minute, but you can change the window to suit your needs. Whatever the aggregation window, New Relic will collect data for that window using the function in the NRQL alert condition’s query. The query is parsed and executed by our systems in the following order: FROM clause – which event type needs to be grabbed? WHERE clause – what can be filtered out? SELECT clause – what information needs to be returned from the now-filtered data set? Example: null value returned Let's say this is your alert condition query: SELECT count(*) FROM SyntheticCheck WHERE monitorName = 'My Cool Monitor' AND result = 'FAILURE' Copy If there are no failures for the aggregation window: The system will execute the FROM clause by grabbing all SyntheticCheck events on your account. Then it will execute the WHERE clause to filter through those events by looking only for the ones that match the monitor name and result specified. If there are still events left to scan through after completing the FROM and WHERE operations, the SELECT clause will be executed. If there are no remaining events, the SELECT clause will not be executed. This means that aggregators like count() and uniqueCount() will never return a zero value. When there is a count of 0, the SELECT clause is ignored and no data is returned, resulting in a value of NULL. Example: zero value returned If you have a data source delivering legitimate numeric zeroes, the query will return zero values and not null values. Let's say this is your alert condition query, and that MyCoolEvent is an attribute that can sometimes return a zero value. SELECT average(MyCoolAttribute) FROM MyCoolEvent Copy If, in the aggregation window being evaluated, there's at least one instance of MyCoolEvent and if the average value of all MyCoolAttribute attributes from that window is equal to zero, then a 0 value will be returned. If there are no MyCoolEvent events during that minute, then a NULL will be returned due to the order of operations. Tip For more information about this topic, you can check out our blog post on troubleshooting for zero versus null values. Tip You can determine how null values will be handled by adjusting loss of signal and gap filling settings in the Alert Conditions UI. Tip You can avoid NULL values entirely with a query order of operations shortcut. Do this by using a filter sub-clause, then including all filter elements within that sub-clause. The main body of the query will run and return data, at which point the SELECT clause will then run and apply the filter elements. The query will return a value of 0 if the filter elements result in no matching data. Here's an example: SELECT filter(count(*), WHERE result = 'SUCCESS' AND monitorName = 'My Favorite Monitor') FROM SyntheticCheck Copy Nested aggregation NRQL alerts Nested aggregation queries are a powerful way to query your data. However, they have a few restrictions that are important to note. Nested queries with a non-faceted innermost query are not currently supported Without a FACET, the inner query produces a single result, giving the outer query nothing to aggregate. If you're using a nested query, make sure your inner query is faceted. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu) ​​​​​ Copy Queries at all levels must have the same aggregation window size With an alert aggregation window of 1 minute, the inner query would produce two smaller windows of 30 seconds. In theory, these two windows could be aggregated by the outer query. However, this is not currently supported. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu TIMESERIES 30 seconds)​​ Copy Signal loss is not yet supported for nested queries For more information on signal loss, see NerdGraph API: Loss of signal and gap filling. Nested queries containing 'WITH METRIC_FORMAT' in the inner query are not currently supported You can't use a nested query containing the WITH METRIC_FORMAT in the inner query to create NRQL alert conditions. NRQL condition creation tips Here are some tips for creating and using a NRQL condition: Topic Tips Condition threshold types NRQL condition threshold types include static, baseline, and outlier. Create a description For NRQL conditions, you can create a custom description to add to each violation. Descriptions can be enhanced with variable substitution based on metadata in the specific violation. For details, see Description Query results Queries must return a number. The condition evaluates the returned number against the thresholds you've set. Time period As with all alert conditions, NRQL conditions evaluate one single minute at a time. The implicit SINCE ... UNTIL clause specifying which minute to evaluate is controlled by your Evaluation offset setting. Since very recent data may be incomplete, you may want to query data from 3 minutes ago or longer, especially for: Applications that run on multiple hosts. SyntheticCheck data: Timeouts can take 3 minutes, so 5 minutes or more is recommended. Also, if a query will generate intermittent data, consider using the sum of query results option. Lost signal threshold (loss of signal detection) You can use loss of signal detection to alert on when your data (a telemetry signal) should be considered lost. A signal loss can indicate that a service or entity is no longer online or that a periodic job failed to run. You can also use this to make sure that violations for sporadic data, such as error counts, are closed when no signal is coming in. Advanced signal settings These settings give you options for better handling continuous, streaming data signals that may sometimes be missing. These settings include the aggregation window, the evaluation offset, and an option for filling data gaps. For more on using these, see Advanced signal settings. Condition settings Use the Condition settings to: Create a concise, descriptive condition name. Provide a custom violation description for the condition that will be included in violations and notifications. Add the runbook URL to include your organization's procedures for handling incidents. You may also add this information to the custom violation description. Limits on conditions See the maximum values. Health status NRQL alert conditions don't affect an entity's health status display. Examples For more information, see: Expected NRQL syntax Examples of NRQL condition queries Alert threshold types When you create a NRQL alert, you can choose from different types of thresholds: NRQL alert threshold types Description Static This is the simplest type of NRQL threshold. It allows you to create a condition based on a NRQL query that returns a numeric value. Optional: Include a FACET clause. Baseline (Dynamic) Uses a self-adjusting condition based on the past behavior of the monitored values. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type. Outlier Looks for group behavior and values that are outliers from those groups. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type, but requires a FACET clause. Sum of query results (limited or intermittent data) Important Available only for static (basic) threshold types. If a query returns intermittent or limited data, it may be difficult to set a meaningful threshold. Missing or limited data will sometimes generate false positives or false negatives. You can use loss of signal, aggregation duration, and gap filling settings to minimize these false notifications. To avoid this problem when using the static threshold type, you can set the selector to sum of query results. This lets you set the alert on an aggregated sum instead of a value from a single harvest cycle. Up to two hours of one-minute data checks can be aggregated. The duration you select determines the width of the rolling sum and the preview chart will update accordingly. Set the loss of signal threshold Loss of signal occurs when no data matches the NRQL condition over a specific period of time. You can set your loss of signal threshold duration and and also what happens when the threshold is crossed. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Loss of signal is only available for NRQL conditions. You may also manage these settings using the GraphQL API (recommended), or the REST API. Go here for specific GraphQL API examples. Loss of signal settings: Loss of signal settings include a time duration and two possible actions. Signal loss expiration time UI label: Signal is lost after: GraphQL Node: expiration.expirationDuration Expiration duration is a timer that starts and resets when we receive a data point in the streaming alerts pipeline. If we don't receive another data point before your 'expiration time' expires, we consider that signal to be lost. This can be because no data is being sent to New Relic or the WHERE clause of your NRQL query is filtering that data out before it is streamed to the alerts pipeline. The loss of signal expiration time is independent of the threshold duration and triggers as soon as the timer expires. The maximum expiration duration is 48 hours. This is helpful when monitoring for the execution of infrequent jobs. The minimum is 30 seconds, but we recommend using at least 3-5 minutes. Loss of signal actions Once a signal is considered lost, you can close open violations, open new violations, or both. Close all current open violations: This closes all open violations that are related to a specific signal. It won't necessarily close all violations for a condition. If you're alerting on an ephemeral service, or on a sporadic signal, you'll want to choose this action to ensure that violations are closed properly. The GraphQL node name for this is \"closeViolationsOnExpiration\" Open new violations: This will open a new violation when the signal is considered lost. These violations will indicate that they are due to a loss of signal. Based on your incident preferences, this should trigger a notification. The graphQL node name for this is \"openViolationOnExpiration\" When you enable both actions, we'll close all open violations first, and then open a new violation for loss of signal. To create a NRQL alert configured with loss of signal detection in the UI: For a policy, when you create a condition, under Select a product, click NRQL, then click Next, define thresholds. Write a NRQL query that returns the values you want to alert on. For Threshold type, select Static or Baseline. Click + Add lost signal threshold, then set the signal expiration duration time in minutes or seconds in the Signal is lost after field. Choose what you want to happen when the signal is lost. You can check one or both of Close all current open violations and Open new \"lost signal\" violation. These control how loss of signal violations will be handled for the condition. Make sure you name your condition before you save it. Violations open due to loss of signal close when the signal comes back. Newly opened lost signal violations will close immediately when new data is evaluated. the condition they belong to expires. By default, conditions expire after 3 days. you manually close the violation with the Close all current open violations option. Tip Loss of signal detection doesn't work on NRQL queries that use nested aggregation or sub-queries. Advanced signal settings When creating a NRQL alert condition, the advanced signal settings gives you better control over streaming alert data and helps you avoid false alarms. When creating a NRQL condition, there are several advanced signal settings: Aggregation window Evaluation offset Fill data gaps To read an explanation of what these settings are and how they relate to each other, see Streaming alerts concepts. Below are instructions and tips on how to configure them. Aggregation window You can set the aggregation window duration to choose how long data is accumulated in a streaming time window before it's aggregated. You can set it to anything between one second and 15 minutes. The default is one minute. Tip Baseline alert condition thresholds don't support editing the aggregation window. They use the 1 minute default. Evaluation offset You can adjust the evaluation offset to coordinate our streaming alerting algorithm with your data's latency. If it takes a while for your data to arrive, then you may need to increase the evaluation offset. The total supported latency is the product of the aggregation window duration multiplied by the evaluation offset. In the example screenshot above, the supported latency is 3 minutes (a 1-minute aggregation window multiplied by three windows). If the data type comes from an APM language agent and is aggregated from many app instances (for example, Transactions, TransactionErrors, etc.), we recommend using an evaluation offset of 3 with 1 minute aggregation windows. Important When creating NRQL conditions for data collected from Infrastructure Cloud Integrations such as AWS Cloudwatch or Azure, we recommend that you start with an evaluation offset of 15 minutes, then adjust up or down depending on how long it takes to collect your data. Fill data gaps Gap filling lets you customize the values to use when your signals don't have any data. You can fill gaps in your data streams with one of these settings: None: (Default) Choose this if you don't want to take any action on empty aggregation windows. On evaluation, an empty aggregation window will reset the threshold duration timer. For example, if a condition says that all aggregation windows must have data points above the threshold for 5 minutes, and 1 of the 5 aggregation windows is empty, then the condition won't be in violation. Custom static value: Choose this if you'd like to insert a custom static value into the empty aggregation windows before they're evaluated. This option has an additional, required parameter of fillValue (as named in the API) that specifies what static value should be used. This defaults to 0. Last known value: This option inserts the last seen value before evaluation occurs. We maintain the state of the last seen value for 2 hours. Tip The alerts system fills gaps in actively reported signals. This signal history is dropped after 2 hours of inactivity. For gap filling, data points received after this period of inactivity are treated as new signals. To learn more about signal loss, gap filling, and how to request access to these features, see this Explorers Hub post. Options for editing data gap settings: In the NRQL conditions UI, go to Condition settings > Advanced signal settings > fill data gaps with and choose an option. If using our Nerdgraph API (preferred), this node is located at: actor : account : alerts : nrqlCondition : signal : fillOption | fillValue NerdGraph is our recommended API for this but if you're using our REST API, you can find this setting in the REST API explorer under the \"signal\" section of the Alert NRQL conditions API.",

      "body": "Applied Intelligence (AI) is our AIOps solution for DevOps, site reliability engineers, and on-call teams. At its core, Applied Intelligence helps you find, troubleshoot, and resolve problems more quickly. Specifically, it’s a hybrid machine learning engine that reduces alert noise, correlates incidents, and automatically detects anomalies. By applying machine learning to your data and feedback, Applied Intelligence is designed to improve functionality and deliver smarter context over time. After connecting your data sources to Applied Intelligence, it looks for potential problems and improves based on your feedback. Why use Applied Intelligence? How you respond to an incident can mean thousands of dollars or clicks for your company. Applied Intelligence helps you solve problems faster. Feature Description Troubleshoot and respond to incidents Our solution helps you understand your incidents and gives you ideas for what to do next. Here are a few examples: Automatically classifies incidents based on the golden signals of site reliability engineering. Identifies entities in your stack that may relate to the underlying issue. Suggests responses for incidents based on historical context. Less noise, more focus As tools and systems become more complex, alert noise can overwhelm DevOps and SRE teams. Applied Intelligence correlates related incidents and suppresses noise, so you're only notified when human action is required. Incidents with a hybrid approach Applied Intelligence streamlines your incidents by combining its built-in inputs with your knowledge and feedback. Over time, the system delivers more accurate insights. For example: Our correlation and classification engine adjusts based on your feedback. The system automatically suggests new correlation rules based on your production data. You can create custom logic using the decision builder. Automatic anomaly detection Applied Intelligence provides automatic anomaly detection on all your APM-monitored applications. We detect anomalies in throughput, latency, and error rate, with no action required from you. Benefits include: No setup required. See anomalies surfaced automatically in the anomalies feed. See them in various New Relic activity streams (for example, on the New Relic One home page). Ability to run NRQL queries of anomalies and create custom dashboards with that data. Determine root causes with Incident Intelligence As part of Applied Intelligence, Incident Intelligence helps you correlate incident events and reduce noise in your environment. With it, you can get an overview of all your issues, see suggested responders, and configure your own correlation logic. To get started, see Incident Intelligence. Find unknowns with Proactive Detection Another feature of Applied Intelligence is Proactive Detection. Proactive Detection is, by default, always on and detecting anomalies. These anomalies are surfaced in the Applied Intelligence anomalies feed, New Relic One activity streams, and can be queried, alerted on, and added to dashboards. Anomalies can be sent to Slack or via webhooks, and/or added as a source for Incident Intelligence correlation and issue notification. Proactive Detection also provides automatic analysis of anomalies and alerts via the analysis page. To get started, see Proactive Detection.",

      "body": "You can use NRQL queries to create alert conditions. Once you've defined your signal, you can further define your warning and critical threshold levels. This determines when an alerts violation is created. Read on to learn more about how to do this. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Click NRQL, and then Next, define thresholds. Tip For more information on key concepts relating to NRQL alert conditions and streaming alerts, see Streaming alerts: key terms and concepts. Create a NRQL alert condition To create a NRQL alert condition for a policy: On one.newrelic.com, in the header click Alerts & AI, then in the left sidebar click Policies. Select an existing policy or click New alert policy to create a new policy. Click Add a condition. Under Select a product click NRQL, and then click Next, define thresholds. Create a condition from a chart You can use a chart to create a NRQL alert condition. To create a NRQL alerts condition from a chart, click the chart menu , then click Create alert condition. Once you've named and customized your condition, you can add it to an existing policy or create a new one. Caution A small number of our older charts don't include the option to create an alert condition. NRQL alert syntax Here's the basic syntax for creating all NRQL alert conditions. The FACET clause is required for outlier threshold types. It's optional for static and baseline. SELECT function(attribute) FROM Event WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Copy Clause Notes SELECT function(attribute) Required Supported functions that return numbers include: apdex average count latest max min percentage percentile sum uniqueCount Tip If you use the percentile aggregator in a faceted alert condition with many facets, this may cause the following error to appear: An error occurred while fetching chart data. If you see this error, use average instead. FROM data type Required Only one data type can be targeted. Supported data types: Event Metric (RAW data points will be returned) WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Use the WHERE clause to specify a series of one or more conditions. All the operators are supported. FACET attribute Required for outlier conditions Include an optional FACET clause in your NRQL syntax depending on the threshold type: static or baseline. Use the FACET clause to separate your results by attribute and alert on each attribute independently. No LIMIT clause is allowed, but all queries will receive the maximum number of facets possible. Faceted queries can return a maximum of 5000 values for static and baseline conditions and a maximum of 500 values for outlier conditions. Important If the query returns more than the maximum number of values, the alert condition can't be created. If you create the condition and the query returns more than this number later, the alert will fail. Modify your query so that it returns a fewer number of values. Reformatting incompatible NRQL Some elements of NRQL used in charts don’t make sense in the streaming context of alerts. Here’s a list of the most common incompatible elements and suggestions for reformatting a NRQL alert query to achieve the same effect. Element Notes SINCE and UNTIL Example: SELECT percentile(largestContentfulPaint, 75) FROM PageViewTiming WHERE (appId = 837807) SINCE yesterday Copy NRQL Alerting produces a never-ending stream of windowed query results, so the SINCE and UNTIL keywords to scope the query to a point in time are not compatible. As a convenience, we automatically strip SINCE and UNTIL from a query when creating a NRQL Alert Condition from the context of a chart. TIMESERIES In NRQL queries, the TIMESERIES clause is used to return data as a time series broken out by a specified period of time. For NRQL alerts, the equivalent property of a signal is the aggregation window. histogram() The histogram() aggregation function is used to generate histograms. histogram() is not compatible with NRQL alerting: histogram aggregations can not be formatted as a time series. To create an alert from a portion of a histogram (e.g. 95th percentile), use the percentile() aggregation function. Multiple Aggregation Functions Each alert condition can only target a single aggregated stream of data. To alert on multiple streams simultaneously, you’ll need to decompose them into individual conditions within the same policy. Original Query: SELECT count(foo), average(bar), max(baz) from Transaction Copy Decomposed: SELECT count(foo) from Transaction SELECT average(bar) from Transaction SELECT max(baz) from Transaction Copy COMPARE WITH The COMPARE WITH clause is used to compare the values for two different time ranges. This type of query is incompatible with NRQL alerting. We recommend using a Baseline Alert Condition to dynamically detect deviations for a particular signal. SLIDE BY The SLIDE BY clause supports a feature known as sliding windows. With sliding windows, SLIDE BY data is gathered into \"windows\" of time that overlap with each other. These windows can help to smooth out line graphs with a lot of variation in cases where the rolling aggregate (such as a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. Sliding windows are not currently supported in NRQL alerts. LIMIT In NRQL queries, the LIMIT clause is used to control the amount of data a query returns, either the maximum number of facet values returned by FACET queries or the maximum number of items returned by SELECT * queries. LIMIT is not compatible with NRQL alerting: evaluation is always performed on the full result set. NRQL alert threshold examples Here are some common use cases for NRQL alert conditions. These queries will work for static and baseline threshold types. The outlier threshold type will require additional FACET clauses. Alert on specific segments of your data Create constrained alerts that target a specific segment of your data, such as a few key customers or a range of data. Use the WHERE clause to define those conditions. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction WHERE account_id in (91290, 102021, 20230) Copy SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction WHERE name LIKE 'Controller/checkout/%' Copy Alert on Nth percentile of your data Create alerts when an Nth percentile of your data hits a specified threshold; for example, maintaining SLA service levels. Since we evaluate the NRQL query in one-minute time windows, percentiles will be calculated for each minute separately. SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentile(databaseDuration, 75) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on max, min, avg of your data Create alerts when your data hits a certain maximum, minimum, or average; for example, ensuring that a duration or response time does not pass a certain threshold. SELECT max(duration) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on a percentage of your data Create alerts when a proportion of your data goes above or below a certain threshold. SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE duration > 2) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE httpResponseCode = '500') FROM Transaction Copy Alert on Apdex with any T-value Create alerts on Apdex, applying your own T-value for certain transactions. For example, get an alert notification when your Apdex for a T-value of 500ms on transactions for production apps goes below 0.8. SELECT apdex(duration, t:0.5) FROM Transaction WHERE appName like '%prod%' Copy Alert conditions and query order of operations By default, the aggregation window is 1 minute, but you can change the window to suit your needs. Whatever the aggregation window, New Relic will collect data for that window using the function in the NRQL alert condition’s query. The query is parsed and executed by our systems in the following order: FROM clause – which event type needs to be grabbed? WHERE clause – what can be filtered out? SELECT clause – what information needs to be returned from the now-filtered data set? Example: null value returned Let's say this is your alert condition query: SELECT count(*) FROM SyntheticCheck WHERE monitorName = 'My Cool Monitor' AND result = 'FAILURE' Copy If there are no failures for the aggregation window: The system will execute the FROM clause by grabbing all SyntheticCheck events on your account. Then it will execute the WHERE clause to filter through those events by looking only for the ones that match the monitor name and result specified. If there are still events left to scan through after completing the FROM and WHERE operations, the SELECT clause will be executed. If there are no remaining events, the SELECT clause will not be executed. This means that aggregators like count() and uniqueCount() will never return a zero value. When there is a count of 0, the SELECT clause is ignored and no data is returned, resulting in a value of NULL. Example: zero value returned If you have a data source delivering legitimate numeric zeroes, the query will return zero values and not null values. Let's say this is your alert condition query, and that MyCoolEvent is an attribute that can sometimes return a zero value. SELECT average(MyCoolAttribute) FROM MyCoolEvent Copy If, in the aggregation window being evaluated, there's at least one instance of MyCoolEvent and if the average value of all MyCoolAttribute attributes from that window is equal to zero, then a 0 value will be returned. If there are no MyCoolEvent events during that minute, then a NULL will be returned due to the order of operations. Tip For more information about this topic, you can check out our blog post on troubleshooting for zero versus null values. Tip You can determine how null values will be handled by adjusting loss of signal and gap filling settings in the Alert Conditions UI. Tip You can avoid NULL values entirely with a query order of operations shortcut. Do this by using a filter sub-clause, then including all filter elements within that sub-clause. The main body of the query will run and return data, at which point the SELECT clause will then run and apply the filter elements. The query will return a value of 0 if the filter elements result in no matching data. Here's an example: SELECT filter(count(*), WHERE result = 'SUCCESS' AND monitorName = 'My Favorite Monitor') FROM SyntheticCheck Copy Nested aggregation NRQL alerts Nested aggregation queries are a powerful way to query your data. However, they have a few restrictions that are important to note. Nested queries with a non-faceted innermost query are not currently supported Without a FACET, the inner query produces a single result, giving the outer query nothing to aggregate. If you're using a nested query, make sure your inner query is faceted. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu) ​​​​​ Copy Queries at all levels must have the same aggregation window size With an alert aggregation window of 1 minute, the inner query would produce two smaller windows of 30 seconds. In theory, these two windows could be aggregated by the outer query. However, this is not currently supported. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu TIMESERIES 30 seconds)​​ Copy Signal loss is not yet supported for nested queries For more information on signal loss, see NerdGraph API: Loss of signal and gap filling. Nested queries containing 'WITH METRIC_FORMAT' in the inner query are not currently supported You can't use a nested query containing the WITH METRIC_FORMAT in the inner query to create NRQL alert conditions. NRQL condition creation tips Here are some tips for creating and using a NRQL condition: Topic Tips Condition threshold types NRQL condition threshold types include static, baseline, and outlier. Create a description For NRQL conditions, you can create a custom description to add to each violation. Descriptions can be enhanced with variable substitution based on metadata in the specific violation. For details, see Description Query results Queries must return a number. The condition evaluates the returned number against the thresholds you've set. Time period As with all alert conditions, NRQL conditions evaluate one single minute at a time. The implicit SINCE ... UNTIL clause specifying which minute to evaluate is controlled by your Evaluation offset setting. Since very recent data may be incomplete, you may want to query data from 3 minutes ago or longer, especially for: Applications that run on multiple hosts. SyntheticCheck data: Timeouts can take 3 minutes, so 5 minutes or more is recommended. Also, if a query will generate intermittent data, consider using the sum of query results option. Lost signal threshold (loss of signal detection) You can use loss of signal detection to alert on when your data (a telemetry signal) should be considered lost. A signal loss can indicate that a service or entity is no longer online or that a periodic job failed to run. You can also use this to make sure that violations for sporadic data, such as error counts, are closed when no signal is coming in. Advanced signal settings These settings give you options for better handling continuous, streaming data signals that may sometimes be missing. These settings include the aggregation window, the evaluation offset, and an option for filling data gaps. For more on using these, see Advanced signal settings. Condition settings Use the Condition settings to: Create a concise, descriptive condition name. Provide a custom violation description for the condition that will be included in violations and notifications. Add the runbook URL to include your organization's procedures for handling incidents. You may also add this information to the custom violation description. Limits on conditions See the maximum values. Health status NRQL alert conditions don't affect an entity's health status display. Examples For more information, see: Expected NRQL syntax Examples of NRQL condition queries Alert threshold types When you create a NRQL alert, you can choose from different types of thresholds: NRQL alert threshold types Description Static This is the simplest type of NRQL threshold. It allows you to create a condition based on a NRQL query that returns a numeric value. Optional: Include a FACET clause. Baseline (Dynamic) Uses a self-adjusting condition based on the past behavior of the monitored values. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type. Outlier Looks for group behavior and values that are outliers from those groups. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type, but requires a FACET clause. Sum of query results (limited or intermittent data) Important Available only for static (basic) threshold types. If a query returns intermittent or limited data, it may be difficult to set a meaningful threshold. Missing or limited data will sometimes generate false positives or false negatives. You can use loss of signal, aggregation duration, and gap filling settings to minimize these false notifications. To avoid this problem when using the static threshold type, you can set the selector to sum of query results. This lets you set the alert on an aggregated sum instead of a value from a single harvest cycle. Up to two hours of one-minute data checks can be aggregated. The duration you select determines the width of the rolling sum and the preview chart will update accordingly. Set the loss of signal threshold Loss of signal occurs when no data matches the NRQL condition over a specific period of time. You can set your loss of signal threshold duration and and also what happens when the threshold is crossed. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Loss of signal is only available for NRQL conditions. You may also manage these settings using the GraphQL API (recommended), or the REST API. Go here for specific GraphQL API examples. Loss of signal settings: Loss of signal settings include a time duration and two possible actions. Signal loss expiration time UI label: Signal is lost after: GraphQL Node: expiration.expirationDuration Expiration duration is a timer that starts and resets when we receive a data point in the streaming alerts pipeline. If we don't receive another data point before your 'expiration time' expires, we consider that signal to be lost. This can be because no data is being sent to New Relic or the WHERE clause of your NRQL query is filtering that data out before it is streamed to the alerts pipeline. The loss of signal expiration time is independent of the threshold duration and triggers as soon as the timer expires. The maximum expiration duration is 48 hours. This is helpful when monitoring for the execution of infrequent jobs. The minimum is 30 seconds, but we recommend using at least 3-5 minutes. Loss of signal actions Once a signal is considered lost, you can close open violations, open new violations, or both. Close all current open violations: This closes all open violations that are related to a specific signal. It won't necessarily close all violations for a condition. If you're alerting on an ephemeral service, or on a sporadic signal, you'll want to choose this action to ensure that violations are closed properly. The GraphQL node name for this is \"closeViolationsOnExpiration\" Open new violations: This will open a new violation when the signal is considered lost. These violations will indicate that they are due to a loss of signal. Based on your incident preferences, this should trigger a notification. The graphQL node name for this is \"openViolationOnExpiration\" When you enable both actions, we'll close all open violations first, and then open a new violation for loss of signal. To create a NRQL alert configured with loss of signal detection in the UI: For a policy, when you create a condition, under Select a product, click NRQL, then click Next, define thresholds. Write a NRQL query that returns the values you want to alert on. For Threshold type, select Static or Baseline. Click + Add lost signal threshold, then set the signal expiration duration time in minutes or seconds in the Signal is lost after field. Choose what you want to happen when the signal is lost. You can check one or both of Close all current open violations and Open new \"lost signal\" violation. These control how loss of signal violations will be handled for the condition. Make sure you name your condition before you save it. Violations open due to loss of signal close when the signal comes back. Newly opened lost signal violations will close immediately when new data is evaluated. the condition they belong to expires. By default, conditions expire after 3 days. you manually close the violation with the Close all current open violations option. Tip Loss of signal detection doesn't work on NRQL queries that use nested aggregation or sub-queries. Advanced signal settings When creating a NRQL alert condition, the advanced signal settings gives you better control over streaming alert data and helps you avoid false alarms. When creating a NRQL condition, there are several advanced signal settings: Aggregation window Evaluation offset Fill data gaps To read an explanation of what these settings are and how they relate to each other, see Streaming alerts concepts. Below are instructions and tips on how to configure them. Aggregation window You can set the aggregation window duration to choose how long data is accumulated in a streaming time window before it's aggregated. You can set it to anything between one second and 15 minutes. The default is one minute. Tip Baseline alert condition thresholds don't support editing the aggregation window. They use the 1 minute default. Evaluation offset You can adjust the evaluation offset to coordinate our streaming alerting algorithm with your data's latency. If it takes a while for your data to arrive, then you may need to increase the evaluation offset. The total supported latency is the product of the aggregation window duration multiplied by the evaluation offset. In the example screenshot above, the supported latency is 3 minutes (a 1-minute aggregation window multiplied by three windows). If the data type comes from an APM language agent and is aggregated from many app instances (for example, Transactions, TransactionErrors, etc.), we recommend using an evaluation offset of 3 with 1 minute aggregation windows. Important When creating NRQL conditions for data collected from Infrastructure Cloud Integrations such as AWS Cloudwatch or Azure, we recommend that you start with an evaluation offset of 15 minutes, then adjust up or down depending on how long it takes to collect your data. Fill data gaps Gap filling lets you customize the values to use when your signals don't have any data. You can fill gaps in your data streams with one of these settings: None: (Default) Choose this if you don't want to take any action on empty aggregation windows. On evaluation, an empty aggregation window will reset the threshold duration timer. For example, if a condition says that all aggregation windows must have data points above the threshold for 5 minutes, and 1 of the 5 aggregation windows is empty, then the condition won't be in violation. Custom static value: Choose this if you'd like to insert a custom static value into the empty aggregation windows before they're evaluated. This option has an additional, required parameter of fillValue (as named in the API) that specifies what static value should be used. This defaults to 0. Last known value: This option inserts the last seen value before evaluation occurs. We maintain the state of the last seen value for 2 hours. Tip The alerts system fills gaps in actively reported signals. This signal history is dropped after 2 hours of inactivity. For gap filling, data points received after this period of inactivity are treated as new signals. To learn more about signal loss, gap filling, and how to request access to these features, see this Explorers Hub post. Options for editing data gap settings: In the NRQL conditions UI, go to Condition settings > Advanced signal settings > fill data gaps with and choose an option. If using our Nerdgraph API (preferred), this node is located at: actor : account : alerts : nrqlCondition : signal : fillOption | fillValue NerdGraph is our recommended API for this but if you're using our REST API, you can find this setting in the REST API explorer under the \"signal\" section of the Alert NRQL conditions API.",

Caution A small number of our older charts don't include the option to create an alert condition. NRQL alert syntax Here's the basic syntax for creating all NRQL alert conditions. The FACET clause is required for outlier threshold types. It's optional for static and baseline. SELECT function(attribute) FROM Event WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Copy Clause Notes SELECT function(attribute) Required Supported functions that return numbers include: apdex average count latest max min percentage percentile sum uniqueCount Tip If you use the percentile aggregator in a faceted alert condition with many facets, this may cause the following error to appear: An error occurred while fetching chart data. If you see this error, use average instead. FROM data type Required Only one data type can be targeted. Supported data types: Event Metric (RAW data points will be returned) WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Use the WHERE clause to specify a series of one or more conditions. All the operators are supported. FACET attribute Required for outlier conditions Include an optional FACET clause in your NRQL syntax depending on the threshold type: static or baseline. Use the FACET clause to separate your results by attribute and alert on each attribute independently. No LIMIT clause is allowed, but all queries will receive the maximum number of facets possible. Faceted queries can return a maximum of 5000 values for static and baseline conditions and a maximum of 500 values for outlier conditions. Important If the query returns more than the maximum number of values, the alert condition can't be created. If you create the condition and the query returns more than this number later, the alert will fail. Modify your query so that it returns a fewer number of values. Reformatting incompatible NRQL Some elements of NRQL used in charts don’t make sense in the streaming context of alerts. Here’s a list of the most common incompatible elements and suggestions for reformatting a NRQL alert query to achieve the same effect. Element Notes SINCE and UNTIL Example: SELECT percentile(largestContentfulPaint, 75) FROM PageViewTiming WHERE (appId = 837807) SINCE yesterday Copy NRQL Alerting produces a never-ending stream of windowed query results, so the SINCE and UNTIL keywords to scope the query to a point in time are not compatible. As a convenience, we automatically strip SINCE and UNTIL from a query when creating a NRQL Alert Condition from the context of a chart. TIMESERIES In NRQL queries, the TIMESERIES clause is used to return data as a time series broken out by a specified period of time. For NRQL alerts, the equivalent property of a signal is the aggregation window. histogram() The histogram() aggregation function is used to generate histograms. histogram() is not compatible with NRQL alerting: histogram aggregations can not be formatted as a time series. To create an alert from a portion of a histogram (e.g. 95th percentile), use the percentile() aggregation function. Multiple Aggregation Functions Each alert condition can only target a single aggregated stream of data. To alert on multiple streams simultaneously, you’ll need to decompose them into individual conditions within the same policy. Original Query: SELECT count(foo), average(bar), max(baz) from Transaction Copy Decomposed: SELECT count(foo) from Transaction SELECT average(bar) from Transaction SELECT max(baz) from Transaction Copy COMPARE WITH The COMPARE WITH clause is used to compare the values for two different time ranges. This type of query is incompatible with NRQL alerting. We recommend using a Baseline Alert Condition to dynamically detect deviations for a particular signal. SLIDE BY The SLIDE BY clause supports a feature known as sliding windows. With sliding windows, SLIDE BY data is gathered into \"windows\" of time that overlap with each other. These windows can help to smooth out line graphs with a lot of variation in cases where the rolling aggregate (such as a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. Sliding windows are not currently supported in NRQL alerts. LIMIT In NRQL queries, the LIMIT clause is used to control the amount of data a query returns, either the maximum number of facet values returned by FACET queries or the maximum number of items returned by SELECT * queries. LIMIT is not compatible with NRQL alerting: evaluation is always performed on the full result set. NRQL alert threshold examples Here are some common use cases for NRQL alert conditions. These queries will work for static and baseline threshold types. The outlier threshold type will require additional FACET clauses. Alert on specific segments of your data Create constrained alerts that target a specific segment of your data, such as a few key customers or a range of data. Use the WHERE clause to define those conditions. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction WHERE account_id in (91290, 102021, 20230) Copy SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction WHERE name LIKE 'Controller/checkout/%' Copy Alert on Nth percentile of your data Create alerts when an Nth percentile of your data hits a specified threshold; for example, maintaining SLA service levels. Since we evaluate the NRQL query in one-minute time windows, percentiles will be calculated for each minute separately. SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentile(databaseDuration, 75) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on max, min, avg of your data Create alerts when your data hits a certain maximum, minimum, or average; for example, ensuring that a duration or response time does not pass a certain threshold. SELECT max(duration) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on a percentage of your data Create alerts when a proportion of your data goes above or below a certain threshold. SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE duration > 2) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE httpResponseCode = '500') FROM Transaction Copy Alert on Apdex with any T-value Create alerts on Apdex, applying your own T-value for certain transactions. For example, get an alert notification when your Apdex for a T-value of 500ms on transactions for production apps goes below 0.8. SELECT apdex(duration, t:0.5) FROM Transaction WHERE appName like '%prod%' Copy Alert conditions and query order of operations By default, the aggregation window is 1 minute, but you can change the window to suit your needs. Whatever the aggregation window, New Relic will collect data for that window using the function in the NRQL alert condition’s query. The query is parsed and executed by our systems in the following order: FROM clause – which event type needs to be grabbed? WHERE clause – what can be filtered out? SELECT clause – what information needs to be returned from the now-filtered data set? Example: null value returned Let's say this is your alert condition query: SELECT count(*) FROM SyntheticCheck WHERE monitorName = 'My Cool Monitor' AND result = 'FAILURE' Copy If there are no failures for the aggregation window: The system will execute the FROM clause by grabbing all SyntheticCheck events on your account. Then it will execute the WHERE clause to filter through those events by looking only for the ones that match the monitor name and result specified. If there are still events left to scan through after completing the FROM and WHERE operations, the SELECT clause will be executed. If there are no remaining events, the SELECT clause will not be executed. This means that aggregators like count() and uniqueCount() will never return a zero value. When there is a count of 0, the SELECT clause is ignored and no data is returned, resulting in a value of NULL. Example: zero value returned If you have a data source delivering legitimate numeric zeroes, the query will return zero values and not null values. Let's say this is your alert condition query, and that MyCoolEvent is an attribute that can sometimes return a zero value. SELECT average(MyCoolAttribute) FROM MyCoolEvent Copy If, in the aggregation window being evaluated, there's at least one instance of MyCoolEvent and if the average value of all MyCoolAttribute attributes from that window is equal to zero, then a 0 value will be returned. If there are no MyCoolEvent events during that minute, then a NULL will be returned due to the order of operations. Tip For more information about this topic, you can check out our blog post on troubleshooting for zero versus null values. Tip You can determine how null values will be handled by adjusting loss of signal and gap filling settings in the Alert Conditions UI. Tip You can avoid NULL values entirely with a query order of operations shortcut. Do this by using a filter sub-clause, then including all filter elements within that sub-clause. The main body of the query will run and return data, at which point the SELECT clause will then run and apply the filter elements. The query will return a value of 0 if the filter elements result in no matching data. Here's an example: SELECT filter(count(*), WHERE result = 'SUCCESS' AND monitorName = 'My Favorite Monitor') FROM SyntheticCheck Copy Nested aggregation NRQL alerts Nested aggregation queries are a powerful way to query your data. However, they have a few restrictions that are important to note. Nested queries with a non-faceted innermost query are not currently supported Without a FACET, the inner query produces a single result, giving the outer query nothing to aggregate. If you're using a nested query, make sure your inner query is faceted. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu) ​​​​​ Copy Queries at all levels must have the same aggregation window size With an alert aggregation window of 1 minute, the inner query would produce two smaller windows of 30 seconds. In theory, these two windows could be aggregated by the outer query. However, this is not currently supported. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu TIMESERIES 30 seconds)​​ Copy Signal loss is not yet supported for nested queries For more information on signal loss, see NerdGraph API: Loss of signal and gap filling. Nested queries containing 'WITH METRIC_FORMAT' in the inner query are not currently supported You can't use a nested query containing the WITH METRIC_FORMAT in the inner query to create NRQL alert conditions. NRQL condition creation tips Here are some tips for creating and using a NRQL condition: Topic Tips Condition threshold types NRQL condition threshold types include static, baseline, and outlier. Create a description For NRQL conditions, you can create a custom description to add to each violation. Descriptions can be enhanced with variable substitution based on metadata in the specific violation. For details, see Description Query results Queries must return a number. The condition evaluates the returned number against the thresholds you've set. Time period As with all alert conditions, NRQL conditions evaluate one single minute at a time. The implicit SINCE ... UNTIL clause specifying which minute to evaluate is controlled by your Evaluation offset setting. Since very recent data may be incomplete, you may want to query data from 3 minutes ago or longer, especially for: Applications that run on multiple hosts. SyntheticCheck data: Timeouts can take 3 minutes, so 5 minutes or more is recommended. Also, if a query will generate intermittent data, consider using the sum of query results option. Lost signal threshold (loss of signal detection) You can use loss of signal detection to alert on when your data (a telemetry signal) should be considered lost. A signal loss can indicate that a service or entity is no longer online or that a periodic job failed to run. You can also use this to make sure that violations for sporadic data, such as error counts, are closed when no signal is coming in. Advanced signal settings These settings give you options for better handling continuous, streaming data signals that may sometimes be missing. These settings include the aggregation window, the evaluation offset, and an option for filling data gaps. For more on using these, see Advanced signal settings. Condition settings Use the Condition settings to: Create a concise, descriptive condition name. Provide a custom violation description for the condition that will be included in violations and notifications. Add the runbook URL to include your organization's procedures for handling incidents. You may also add this information to the custom violation description. Limits on conditions See the maximum values. Health status NRQL alert conditions don't affect an entity's health status display. Examples For more information, see: Expected NRQL syntax Examples of NRQL condition queries Alert threshold types When you create a NRQL alert, you can choose from different types of thresholds: NRQL alert threshold types Description Static This is the simplest type of NRQL threshold. It allows you to create a condition based on a NRQL query that returns a numeric value. Optional: Include a FACET clause. Baseline (Dynamic) Uses a self-adjusting condition based on the past behavior of the monitored values. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type. Outlier Looks for group behavior and values that are outliers from those groups. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type, but requires a FACET clause. Sum of query results (limited or intermittent data) Important Available only for static (basic) threshold types. If a query returns intermittent or limited data, it may be difficult to set a meaningful threshold. Missing or limited data will sometimes generate false positives or false negatives. You can use loss of signal, aggregation duration, and gap filling settings to minimize these false notifications. To avoid this problem when using the static threshold type, you can set the selector to sum of query results. This lets you set the alert on an aggregated sum instead of a value from a single harvest cycle. Up to two hours of one-minute data checks can be aggregated. The duration you select determines the width of the rolling sum and the preview chart will update accordingly. Set the loss of signal threshold Loss of signal occurs when no data matches the NRQL condition over a specific period of time. You can set your loss of signal threshold duration and and also what happens when the threshold is crossed. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Loss of signal is only available for NRQL conditions. You may also manage these settings using the GraphQL API (recommended), or the REST API. Go here for specific GraphQL API examples. Loss of signal settings: Loss of signal settings include a time duration and two possible actions. Signal loss expiration time UI label: Signal is lost after: GraphQL Node: expiration.expirationDuration Expiration duration is a timer that starts and resets when we receive a data point in the streaming alerts pipeline. If we don't receive another data point before your 'expiration time' expires, we consider that signal to be lost. This can be because no data is being sent to New Relic or the WHERE clause of your NRQL query is filtering that data out before it is streamed to the alerts pipeline. The loss of signal expiration time is independent of the threshold duration and triggers as soon as the timer expires. The maximum expiration duration is 48 hours. This is helpful when monitoring for the execution of infrequent jobs. The minimum is 30 seconds, but we recommend using at least 3-5 minutes. Loss of signal actions Once a signal is considered lost, you can close open violations, open new violations, or both. Close all current open violations: This closes all open violations that are related to a specific signal. It won't necessarily close all violations for a condition. If you're alerting on an ephemeral service, or on a sporadic signal, you'll want to choose this action to ensure that violations are closed properly. The GraphQL node name for this is \"closeViolationsOnExpiration\" Open new violations: This will open a new violation when the signal is considered lost. These violations will indicate that they are due to a loss of signal. Based on your incident preferences, this should trigger a notification. The graphQL node name for this is \"openViolationOnExpiration\" When you enable both actions, we'll close all open violations first, and then open a new violation for loss of signal. To create a NRQL alert configured with loss of signal detection in the UI: For a policy, when you create a condition, under Select a product, click NRQL, then click Next, define thresholds. Write a NRQL query that returns the values you want to alert on. For Threshold type, select Static or Baseline. Click + Add lost signal threshold, then set the signal expiration duration time in minutes or seconds in the Signal is lost after field. Choose what you want to happen when the signal is lost. You can check one or both of Close all current open violations and Open new \"lost signal\" violation. These control how loss of signal violations will be handled for the condition. Make sure you name your condition before you save it. Violations open due to loss of signal close when the signal comes back. Newly opened lost signal violations will close immediately when new data is evaluated. the condition they belong to expires. By default, conditions expire after 3 days. you manually close the violation with the Close all current open violations option. Tip Loss of signal detection doesn't work on NRQL queries that use nested aggregation or sub-queries. Advanced signal settings When creating a NRQL alert condition, the advanced signal settings gives you better control over streaming alert data and helps you avoid false alarms. When creating a NRQL condition, there are several advanced signal settings: Aggregation window Evaluation offset Fill data gaps To read an explanation of what these settings are and how they relate to each other, see Streaming alerts concepts. Below are instructions and tips on how to configure them. Aggregation window You can set the aggregation window duration to choose how long data is accumulated in a streaming time window before it's aggregated. You can set it to anything between one second and 15 minutes. The default is one minute. Tip Baseline alert condition thresholds don't support editing the aggregation window. They use the 1 minute default. Evaluation offset You can adjust the evaluation offset to coordinate our streaming alerting algorithm with your data's latency. If it takes a while for your data to arrive, then you may need to increase the evaluation offset. The total supported latency is the product of the aggregation window duration multiplied by the evaluation offset. In the example screenshot above, the supported latency is 3 minutes (a 1-minute aggregation window multiplied by three windows). If the data type comes from an APM language agent and is aggregated from many app instances (for example, Transactions, TransactionErrors, etc.), we recommend using an evaluation offset of 3 with 1 minute aggregation windows. Important When creating NRQL conditions for data collected from Infrastructure Cloud Integrations such as AWS Cloudwatch or Azure, we recommend that you start with an evaluation offset of 15 minutes, then adjust up or down depending on how long it takes to collect your data. Fill data gaps Gap filling lets you customize the values to use when your signals don't have any data. You can fill gaps in your data streams with one of these settings: None: (Default) Choose this if you don't want to take any action on empty aggregation windows. On evaluation, an empty aggregation window will reset the threshold duration timer. For example, if a condition says that all aggregation windows must have data points above the threshold for 5 minutes, and 1 of the 5 aggregation windows is empty, then the condition won't be in violation. Custom static value: Choose this if you'd like to insert a custom static value into the empty aggregation windows before they're evaluated. This option has an additional, required parameter of fillValue (as named in the API) that specifies what static value should be used. This defaults to 0. Last known value: This option inserts the last seen value before evaluation occurs. We maintain the state of the last seen value for 2 hours. Tip The alerts system fills gaps in actively reported signals. This signal history is dropped after 2 hours of inactivity. For gap filling, data points received after this period of inactivity are treated as new signals. To learn more about signal loss, gap filling, and how to request access to these features, see this Explorers Hub post. Options for editing data gap settings: In the NRQL conditions UI, go to Condition settings > Advanced signal settings > fill data gaps with and choose an option. If using our Nerdgraph API (preferred), this node is located at: actor : account : alerts : nrqlCondition : signal : fillOption | fillValue NerdGraph is our recommended API for this but if you're using our REST API, you can find this setting in the REST API explorer under the \"signal\" section of the Alert NRQL conditions API.",

      "body": "In a policy, a condition identifies what triggers an alert. You can use the REST API to disable and enable conditions. You can also disable and enable conditions in New Relic One. Policies can't be enabled or disabled, whether via the API or the UI. Policies can only be created, deleted, or have their conditions changed. Requirements Modifying any attribute in a condition using the API requires: An API key and permissions to manage Alerts The condition's id (available from API Explorer: Alerts Conditions > GET > List) If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you are using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. Enable and disable a condition The process for disabling or enabling a condition is the same general process for changing any attribute in a condition. A more detailed example comes after this general procedure: Find the ID for the policy that contains the condition you want to change. If the policy's ID is unknown, use the policy's name or type to make an API call and find the policy's ID. For more on this process, see List a single policy. With the policy ID, make an API call that returns the conditions associated with that policy. There are four different condition categories. If you don't know the category, this may require making up to four API calls in order to find the condition. Details on searching for condition ID If you don't know the category of the condition you want to change, you must search for it by making API calls using the four condition categories. Here are the different API call formats for the various condition categories. APM, browser, and mobile monitoring Conditions available: apm_app_metric, apm_kt_metric, browser_metric, and mobile_metric API Explorer link Get>List External services Conditions available: apm_external_service, mobile_external_service API Explorer link Get>List Synthetic monitoring API Explorer link Get>List Plugins API Explorer link Get>List For the returned JSON, find the JSON object of the condition you want to change. Copy and paste the condition's JSON in a text editor of your choice and edit the JSON. To enable the condition, set \"enabled\" to true. To disable the condition, set \"enabled\" to false. Update the condition by submitting your edited JSON via an Update API request. Our different products require different API requests. Details on Update API requests Use the Update API request that corresponds to the product in question: Conditions for APM, browser, and mobile Conditions available: apm_app_metric, apm_kt_metric, browser_metric, and mobile_metric API Explorer PUT>Update link Conditions for external services Conditions available: apm_external_service, mobile_external_service API Explorer PUT>Update Conditions for Synthetic monitoring) API Explorer PUT>Update Conditions for Plugins API Explorer PUT>Update Tip An Update API request can only change one condition at a time, it cannot update a vector of objects. For example, to change three conditions, you will have to make three separate requests. Example: Disable an APM condition The following example shows how to disable a condition for an apm_app_metric condition. With the exception of the types of API calls required, the process is similar to the process for changing other condition types. Obtain the policy_id of the policy you want to update. For an imaginary policy named Logjam Alert, the command would be: curl -X GET 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_policies.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -G --data-urlencode 'filter[name]= Logjam Alert' <---<<< {policy_name} Copy The output for this request might look like: { \"policies\": [ { \"id\": 85, <---<<< $POLICY_ID \"incident_preference\": \"PER_POLICY\", \"name\": \"Logjam Alert\", \"created_at\": 1461176510393, \"updated_at\": 1461176510393 } ] } Copy List all of this policy's conditions and locate the {condition_id}: curl -X GET 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_conditions.json' \\ -H 'X-Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -G -d 'policy_id=85' Copy The output for this request might look like: { \"conditions\": [ { \"id\": 12345, <---<<< $CONDITION_ID \"type\": \"apm_app_metric\", \"name\": \"Apdex (Low)\", \"enabled\": true, <---<<< Note the condition is enabled \"entities\": [ \"8288171\" ], \"metric\": \"apdex\", \"terms\": [ { \"duration\": \"5\", \"operator\": \"below\", \"priority\": \"critical\", \"threshold\": \"1\", \"time_function\": \"any\" } ] }, { \"id\": 2468, <---<<< another condition_id \"type\": \"apm_app_metric\", \"name\": \"Throughput (Low)\", ... } ] } Copy Copy the JSON for only the condition in question and paste it in a text editor. Change \"enabled\": true to \"enabled\": false. The edited JSON would look like: curl -X PUT 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_conditions/12345.json' \\ -H 'X-Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"condition\": { \"type\": \"apm_app_metric\", \"name\": \"Apdex (Low)\", \"enabled\": false, <---<<< Changed to false \"entities\": [ \"8288171\" ], \"metric\": \"apdex\", \"terms\": [ { \"duration\": \"5\", \"operator\": \"below\", \"priority\": \"critical\", \"threshold\": \"1\", \"time_function\": \"any\" } ] } }' Copy Update the condition by submitting the edited condition JSON via an Update API request. For this specific condition, you would follow the steps in Update conditions for APM policies. Other product conditions would have other API requests, as detailed in Update API requests.

Exception: NRQL baseline conditions are not available from this endpoint. Important If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you are using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. Create NRQL conditions for policies Recommendation: Due to the way NRQL data is aggregated, set the nrql[since_value] to 3 or higher to prevent false positives. This equates to the Evaluation Offset value in the Alerts Condition UI. API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > POST > Create To create NRQL conditions for policies: curl -X POST 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_nrql_conditions/policies/$POLICY_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"nrql_condition\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"name\": \"string\", \"runbook_url\": \"string\", \"enabled\": boolean, \"terms\": [ { \"duration\": \"string\", \"operator\": \"string\", \"priority\": \"string\", \"threshold\": \"string\", \"time_function\": \"string\" } ], \"value_function\": \"string\", \"nrql\": { \"query\": \"string\", \"since_value\": \"string\" }, \"signal\": { \"aggregation_window\": \"string\", \"evaluation_offset\": \"string\", \"fill_option\": \"string\", \"fill_value\": \"string\" }, \"expiration\": { \"expiration_duration\": \"string\", \"open_violation_on_expiration\": boolean, \"close_violations_on_expiration\": boolean } } }' Copy If you set nrql[since_value] to 3 and nrql[query] to SELECT count FROM myEvent, New Relic evaluates the following query against the terms[threshold] value once per minute: SELECT count FROM myEvent SINCE 3 minutes ago UNTIL 2 minutes ago Copy If you set type as outlier, you can omit the value_function. However, two additional fields are required: expected_groups and ignore_overlap. For more information, see Alerts Conditions API field names. If you omit type or set it as static, it will default to standard NRQL alerting. Update NRQL conditions for policies Recommendation: Due to the way NRQL data is aggregated, set the nrql[since_value] to 3 or higher to prevent false positives.

This glossary contains the names and descriptions of each of the fields that you can use to define or update a condition. Required and optional fields The API includes four types of New Relic Alerts conditions: APM External services Synthetic monitoring Plugins All of the fields used with a specific condition type are required except for these optional fields: enabled (defaults to false) runbook_url user_defined Field definitions Not every field listed in this glossary is required for every condition type. The condition type for which a field must be used is listed in each description. aggregation_window Streaming alerts gathers data together into specific amounts of time before running the function in the NRQL query. These windows of time are customizable. The default is 1 minute. The maximum is 15 minutes. Data points are collected together based their timestamps and reported as a batch. The customizable aggregation window provides greater flexibility and fewer false violations when alerting on irregular or less frequent data points. In the UI, under Advanced signal settings, this is the Aggregation window field. close_violations_on_expiration When true, this closes all currently open violations when no signal is heard within the expiration_duration time. The default is False. condition_scope This field allows you to scope a condition to either a JVM instance or to a whole application. This may be one of the strings: instance application Used for: Conditions Entity conditions For instance-based and JVM health metrics, see also violation_close_timer. enabled This is the status of your alert condition and is optional. The default is false. This field may be used to enable or disable a condition for maintenance or testing periods. Used for: Conditions External service conditions Synthetic monitoring conditions Plugin conditions entities This is an array of entity IDs identifying the objects which will be monitored with your condition. These may be application IDs, browser IDs, plugin IDs, key transaction IDs, external service IDs, etc. These are entered as a series of comma separated integers if there is more than one. Used for: Conditions External service conditions Plugin conditions evaluation_offset The offset is how long we wait for late data before evaluating each aggregation window. Waiting longer gives a more accurate signal but increases latency. The default is 3 minutes. In the UI, under Advanced signal settings, this is the Offset evaluation by field. expected_groups This is the number of groups you expect to see at any given time. It is used in combination with the ignore_overlap option. Used for: NRQL outlier conditions expiration_duration How long to wait, in seconds, after the last data point is received by our platform before considering the signal as lost. This is based on the time when data arrives and not on data timestamps. The default is null. Add a value to enable loss of signal detection. external_service_url This is the URL of the external service to be monitored. This string must not include the protocol. For example, use example.com, not https://example.com. Used for: External service conditions fill_option For sporadic data, you can avoid false alerts by filling the gaps (empty windows) with synthetic data. none: (Default) Use this if you don’t want to take any action on empty aggregation windows. On evaluation, an empty aggregation window will reset the threshold duration timer. For example, if a condition says that all aggregation windows must have data points above the threshold for 5 minutes, and 1 of the 5 aggregation windows is empty, then the condition won’t be in violation. static: Use this if you’d like to insert a custom static value into the empty aggregation windows before they’re evaluated. This option has an additional, required parameter of fillValue that specifies what static value should be used. This defaults to 0. last_value: Use this to insert the last seen value before evaluation occurs. We maintain the state of the last seen value for 2 hours. In the UI, under Advanced signal settings, this is the Fill data gaps with field. fill_value This is the value used by the fill_option custom value. The default is 0. ignore_overlap If disabled, this looks for a convergence (or overlapping) of groups. If the condition is looking for two or more groups, and the returned values can't be separated into that number of distinct groups, then that will also produce a violation. This type of overlap event is represented on a chart by group bands touching. Used for: NRQL outlier conditions metric The metric field is used for three alert categories. The exact parameters available for use depend on the setting in the type field. These are listed below according to their alert type field. Alerts plugin conditions For Plugin conditions this is the metric, which has been defined in a plugin, that will be used to trigger a notification. Alerts conditions The value specified in the type field controls which of the parameters may be specified. The type field and corresponding available parameter names are listed in the following table. Only one may be specified. type Parameter apm_app_metric apdex error_percentage response_time_web response_time_background throughput_web throughput_background user_defined apm_kt_metric apdex error_percentage error_count response_time throughput browser_metric end_user_apdex total_page_load page_rendering web_application network dom_processing request_queuing ajax_response_time page_views_with_js_errors page_view_throughput ajax_throughput user_defined browser_metric_baseline page_view_throughput average_response_time ajax_response_time ajax_application_time mobile_metric database images json, network view_loading network_error_percentage status_error_percentage user_defined Alerts external service conditions The value specified in the type field controls which of the parameters may be specified. The type field and corresponding available parameter names are listed in the following table. Only one may be specified. type Parameter apm_external_service apdex error_percentage response_time_web response_time_background throughput_web throughput_background user_defined apm_app_metric_baseline external_service_transaction_time error_count database_transaction_time throughput_web response_time_web non_web_transaction_time web_transaction_database_time non_web_transaction_database_time mobile_external_service response_time_average response_time_minimum response_time_maximum throughput network_failure_percentage http_status_error_percentage metric_description This is a title for the metric which is displayed in notifications. Make this descriptive and unique so the reader will understand the nature of plugin metric being used to trigger an alert. Used for: Plugin conditions monitor_id This is the GUID of the Synthetic monitoring to alert on. Used for: Synthetic monitoring conditions name This condition title will allow to you identify it in the UI. Follow the guidelines for making this descriptive but short. Used for: Conditions External service conditions Synthetic monitoring conditions Plugin conditions nrql[query] This is the NRQL query that alerts monitors as part of a NRQL condition. Used for: NRQL conditions nrql[since_value] This is the timeframe (in minutes) in which to evaluate the specified NRQL query. since_value must be between 1 and 20. Used for: NRQL conditions open_violation_on_expiration When true, this opens a loss of signal violation when no signal within the expiration_duration time. The default is False. plugin[guid] This is the GUID of the plugin for which the trigger is being defined. Used for: Plugin conditions plugin[id] This is the ID of the plugin for which the trigger is being defined. Used for: Plugin conditions runbook_url The runbook URL to display in notifications. This field is optional. Used for: Conditions External service conditions Synthetic monitoring conditions Plugin conditions terms[duration] This is the time (in minutes) for the condition to persist before triggering an event. It corresponds to the duration set when adding a threshold in the UI. Used for: Conditions terms[operator] This determines what comparison will be used between the value_function and the terms [ threshold] value to trigger an event. It corresponds to the operation selected when adding a threshold in the UI. It must be one of the following strings: above below equal Used for: Conditions External service conditions Plugin conditions terms[priority] This corresponds to the severity level selected when setting the threshold values for the condition in the UI. This must be one of the following strings: critical warning Used for: Conditions External service conditions Plugin conditions terms[threshold] This is the threshold that the value_function must be compared to using the terms [ operator] for an event to be triggered. It corresponds to the numeric value specified in the UI when adding the threshold values. This is a numeric value and must be 0 (zero) or greater. Used for: Conditions External service conditions Plugin conditions terms[time_function] This corresponds to the settings made in the UI when adding the threshold values. The choices are: all (corresponding to for at least in the UI) any (corresponding to at least once in in the UI) Used for: Conditions External service conditions Plugin conditions type This defines the type of metric that will be used for the alert. Allowable content for the metric field depends on the type value chosen. There are two product categories : Alerts conditions For this category, type is set to one of the following strings indicating the type of alerts condition. type Use apm_app_metric APM application metric will trigger an alert. apm_app_metric_baseline APM application metric will trigger an alert (using a baseline threshold). apm_kt_metric APM key transaction metric will trigger an alert. browser_metric Browser metric will trigger an alert. browser_metric_baseline Browser metric will trigger an alert (using a baseline threshold). mobile_metric Mobile metric will trigger an alert. Used for: Conditions Alerts external service conditions For this category, type is set to one of the following strings indicating the type of external service condition. type Use apm_external_service APM external metric will trigger an alert. mobile_external_service Mobile external metric will trigger an alert. Used for: External service conditions user_defined[metric] (optional) This is the name of a user defined custom metric to be used to determine if an event should be triggered. The user_defined [ value_function] associated with the metric is compared with the terms [ threshold] value when evaluating if an incident should be triggered. The comparison is performed using the operator defined by terms [ operator]. Used for: Conditions External service conditions Synthetic monitoring conditions Plugin conditions user_defined[value_function] (optional) This is the numeric value obtained from the custom metric specified by user_defined [ metric]. It is compared with the terms [ threshold] value when evaluating if an incident should be triggered. The comparison is performed using the operator defined by terms [ operator]. One of these value functions must be specified: average min max total sample_size Used for: Conditions value_function This is the value function used from the plugin metric. This may be one of the strings: min max average sample_size total percent Used for: Plugin conditions When used for a NRQL condition, the options are: single_value (condition is evaluated based on each query's returned value) sum (condition is evaluated based on the sum of each query's returned values over the specified duration) violation_time_limit_seconds Use to automatically close instance-based violations after the number of seconds specified. Must be one of these values: 3600 7200 14400 28800 43200 86400 Used for: Location conditions NRQL conditions violation_close_timer Use to automatically close instance-based violations, including JVM health metric violations, after the number of hours specified. Must be one of these values: 1 2 4 8 12 24 Used for: apm_app_metric (with condition_scope set to instance) apm_jvm_metric",

      "body": "In alerts, an entity is defined as any target for monitoring, such as an application, a browser, or a plugin. The alerts UI shows available entities that you can select. You can also use the REST API and API Explorer to add or remove entities for a condition. Requirements Modifying the list of entities in a condition requires you to know: Your API key The { entity_ID} of the entity you want to monitor The { condition_ID} of the condition you want to modify General procedure To update the entity list for a condition: Locate the appropriate entity ID; for example, Application ID and browser ID. Identify the policy ID by name or type. Get the list of conditions associated with the policy and choose the one you want to modify for the appropriate category: APM, browser, and mobile External services Synthetic monitoring Plugins Modify the condition using the add or remove API requests. Important Follow the requirements for the minimum and maximum number of entities you can add to conditions. Example: Add/remove an entity The following example shows how to add a Ruby application named TimberTime in a condition and how to remove an entity from that same condition. Only the first step in this example is unique to choosing the Ruby app as the entity. The remaining steps will be the same for whichever entity you choose. Get the entity_id; for example, {application_id}: curl -X GET 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i Copy OR If you know the application name, use this command and specify the app_name: curl -X GET 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -d 'filter[name]=TimberTime' Copy Review the output to find the {application_id}, and use it as the {entity_id}: { \"applications\": [ { \"id\": 12345, <---<<< {application_id} == {entity_id} \"name\": \"TimberTime\", \"language\": \"ruby\", \"health_status\": \"gray\", ... }, Copy Get the policy_id you want to update; for example, the TimberTime app's Logjam Alert policy.

Exception: NRQL baseline conditions are not available from this endpoint. Important If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you are using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. Create NRQL conditions for policies Recommendation: Due to the way NRQL data is aggregated, set the nrql[since_value] to 3 or higher to prevent false positives. This equates to the Evaluation Offset value in the Alerts Condition UI. API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > POST > Create To create NRQL conditions for policies: curl -X POST 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_nrql_conditions/policies/$POLICY_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"nrql_condition\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"name\": \"string\", \"runbook_url\": \"string\", \"enabled\": boolean, \"terms\": [ { \"duration\": \"string\", \"operator\": \"string\", \"priority\": \"string\", \"threshold\": \"string\", \"time_function\": \"string\" } ], \"value_function\": \"string\", \"nrql\": { \"query\": \"string\", \"since_value\": \"string\" }, \"signal\": { \"aggregation_window\": \"string\", \"evaluation_offset\": \"string\", \"fill_option\": \"string\", \"fill_value\": \"string\" }, \"expiration\": { \"expiration_duration\": \"string\", \"open_violation_on_expiration\": boolean, \"close_violations_on_expiration\": boolean } } }' Copy If you set nrql[since_value] to 3 and nrql[query] to SELECT count FROM myEvent, New Relic evaluates the following query against the terms[threshold] value once per minute: SELECT count FROM myEvent SINCE 3 minutes ago UNTIL 2 minutes ago Copy If you set type as outlier, you can omit the value_function. However, two additional fields are required: expected_groups and ignore_overlap. For more information, see Alerts Conditions API field names. If you omit type or set it as static, it will default to standard NRQL alerting. Update NRQL conditions for policies Recommendation: Due to the way NRQL data is aggregated, set the nrql[since_value] to 3 or higher to prevent false positives.

This glossary contains the names and descriptions of each of the fields that you can use to define or update a condition. Required and optional fields The API includes four types of New Relic Alerts conditions: APM External services Synthetic monitoring Plugins All of the fields used with a specific condition type are required except for these optional fields: enabled (defaults to false) runbook_url user_defined Field definitions Not every field listed in this glossary is required for every condition type. The condition type for which a field must be used is listed in each description. aggregation_window Streaming alerts gathers data together into specific amounts of time before running the function in the NRQL query. These windows of time are customizable. The default is 1 minute. The maximum is 15 minutes. Data points are collected together based their timestamps and reported as a batch. The customizable aggregation window provides greater flexibility and fewer false violations when alerting on irregular or less frequent data points. In the UI, under Advanced signal settings, this is the Aggregation window field. close_violations_on_expiration When true, this closes all currently open violations when no signal is heard within the expiration_duration time. The default is False. condition_scope This field allows you to scope a condition to either a JVM instance or to a whole application. This may be one of the strings: instance application Used for: Conditions Entity conditions For instance-based and JVM health metrics, see also violation_close_timer. enabled This is the status of your alert condition and is optional. The default is false. This field may be used to enable or disable a condition for maintenance or testing periods. Used for: Conditions External service conditions Synthetic monitoring conditions Plugin conditions entities This is an array of entity IDs identifying the objects which will be monitored with your condition. These may be application IDs, browser IDs, plugin IDs, key transaction IDs, external service IDs, etc. These are entered as a series of comma separated integers if there is more than one. Used for: Conditions External service conditions Plugin conditions evaluation_offset The offset is how long we wait for late data before evaluating each aggregation window. Waiting longer gives a more accurate signal but increases latency. The default is 3 minutes. In the UI, under Advanced signal settings, this is the Offset evaluation by field. expected_groups This is the number of groups you expect to see at any given time. It is used in combination with the ignore_overlap option. Used for: NRQL outlier conditions expiration_duration How long to wait, in seconds, after the last data point is received by our platform before considering the signal as lost. This is based on the time when data arrives and not on data timestamps. The default is null. Add a value to enable loss of signal detection. external_service_url This is the URL of the external service to be monitored. This string must not include the protocol. For example, use example.com, not https://example.com. Used for: External service conditions fill_option For sporadic data, you can avoid false alerts by filling the gaps (empty windows) with synthetic data. none: (Default) Use this if you don’t want to take any action on empty aggregation windows. On evaluation, an empty aggregation window will reset the threshold duration timer. For example, if a condition says that all aggregation windows must have data points above the threshold for 5 minutes, and 1 of the 5 aggregation windows is empty, then the condition won’t be in violation. static: Use this if you’d like to insert a custom static value into the empty aggregation windows before they’re evaluated. This option has an additional, required parameter of fillValue that specifies what static value should be used. This defaults to 0. last_value: Use this to insert the last seen value before evaluation occurs. We maintain the state of the last seen value for 2 hours. In the UI, under Advanced signal settings, this is the Fill data gaps with field. fill_value This is the value used by the fill_option custom value. The default is 0. ignore_overlap If disabled, this looks for a convergence (or overlapping) of groups. If the condition is looking for two or more groups, and the returned values can't be separated into that number of distinct groups, then that will also produce a violation. This type of overlap event is represented on a chart by group bands touching. Used for: NRQL outlier conditions metric The metric field is used for three alert categories. The exact parameters available for use depend on the setting in the type field. These are listed below according to their alert type field. Alerts plugin conditions For Plugin conditions this is the metric, which has been defined in a plugin, that will be used to trigger a notification.

      "body": "In a policy, a condition identifies what triggers an alert. You can use the REST API to disable and enable conditions. You can also disable and enable conditions in New Relic One. Policies can't be enabled or disabled, whether via the API or the UI. Policies can only be created, deleted, or have their conditions changed. Requirements Modifying any attribute in a condition using the API requires: An API key and permissions to manage Alerts The condition's id (available from API Explorer: Alerts Conditions > GET > List) If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you are using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. Enable and disable a condition The process for disabling or enabling a condition is the same general process for changing any attribute in a condition. A more detailed example comes after this general procedure: Find the ID for the policy that contains the condition you want to change. If the policy's ID is unknown, use the policy's name or type to make an API call and find the policy's ID. For more on this process, see List a single policy. With the policy ID, make an API call that returns the conditions associated with that policy. There are four different condition categories. If you don't know the category, this may require making up to four API calls in order to find the condition. Details on searching for condition ID If you don't know the category of the condition you want to change, you must search for it by making API calls using the four condition categories. Here are the different API call formats for the various condition categories. APM, browser, and mobile monitoring Conditions available: apm_app_metric, apm_kt_metric, browser_metric, and mobile_metric API Explorer link Get>List External services Conditions available: apm_external_service, mobile_external_service API Explorer link Get>List Synthetic monitoring API Explorer link Get>List Plugins API Explorer link Get>List For the returned JSON, find the JSON object of the condition you want to change. Copy and paste the condition's JSON in a text editor of your choice and edit the JSON. To enable the condition, set \"enabled\" to true. To disable the condition, set \"enabled\" to false. Update the condition by submitting your edited JSON via an Update API request. Our different products require different API requests. Details on Update API requests Use the Update API request that corresponds to the product in question: Conditions for APM, browser, and mobile Conditions available: apm_app_metric, apm_kt_metric, browser_metric, and mobile_metric API Explorer PUT>Update link Conditions for external services Conditions available: apm_external_service, mobile_external_service API Explorer PUT>Update Conditions for Synthetic monitoring) API Explorer PUT>Update Conditions for Plugins API Explorer PUT>Update Tip An Update API request can only change one condition at a time, it cannot update a vector of objects. For example, to change three conditions, you will have to make three separate requests. Example: Disable an APM condition The following example shows how to disable a condition for an apm_app_metric condition. With the exception of the types of API calls required, the process is similar to the process for changing other condition types. Obtain the policy_id of the policy you want to update. For an imaginary policy named Logjam Alert, the command would be: curl -X GET 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_policies.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -G --data-urlencode 'filter[name]= Logjam Alert' <---<<< {policy_name} Copy The output for this request might look like: { \"policies\": [ { \"id\": 85, <---<<< $POLICY_ID \"incident_preference\": \"PER_POLICY\", \"name\": \"Logjam Alert\", \"created_at\": 1461176510393, \"updated_at\": 1461176510393 } ] } Copy List all of this policy's conditions and locate the {condition_id}: curl -X GET 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_conditions.json' \\ -H 'X-Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -G -d 'policy_id=85' Copy The output for this request might look like: { \"conditions\": [ { \"id\": 12345, <---<<< $CONDITION_ID \"type\": \"apm_app_metric\", \"name\": \"Apdex (Low)\", \"enabled\": true, <---<<< Note the condition is enabled \"entities\": [ \"8288171\" ], \"metric\": \"apdex\", \"terms\": [ { \"duration\": \"5\", \"operator\": \"below\", \"priority\": \"critical\", \"threshold\": \"1\", \"time_function\": \"any\" } ] }, { \"id\": 2468, <---<<< another condition_id \"type\": \"apm_app_metric\", \"name\": \"Throughput (Low)\", ... } ] } Copy Copy the JSON for only the condition in question and paste it in a text editor. Change \"enabled\": true to \"enabled\": false. The edited JSON would look like: curl -X PUT 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_conditions/12345.json' \\ -H 'X-Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"condition\": { \"type\": \"apm_app_metric\", \"name\": \"Apdex (Low)\", \"enabled\": false, <---<<< Changed to false \"entities\": [ \"8288171\" ], \"metric\": \"apdex\", \"terms\": [ { \"duration\": \"5\", \"operator\": \"below\", \"priority\": \"critical\", \"threshold\": \"1\", \"time_function\": \"any\" } ] } }' Copy Update the condition by submitting the edited condition JSON via an Update API request. For this specific condition, you would follow the steps in Update conditions for APM policies. Other product conditions would have other API requests, as detailed in Update API requests.

Used for: External service conditions user_defined[metric] (optional) This is the name of a user defined custom metric to be used to determine if an event should be triggered. The user_defined [ value_function] associated with the metric is compared with the terms [ threshold] value when evaluating if an incident should be triggered. The comparison is performed using the operator defined by terms [ operator]. Used for: Conditions External service conditions Synthetic monitoring conditions Plugin conditions user_defined[value_function] (optional) This is the numeric value obtained from the custom metric specified by user_defined [ metric]. It is compared with the terms [ threshold] value when evaluating if an incident should be triggered. The comparison is performed using the operator defined by terms [ operator]. One of these value functions must be specified: average min max total sample_size Used for: Conditions value_function This is the value function used from the plugin metric. This may be one of the strings: min max average sample_size total percent Used for: Plugin conditions When used for a NRQL condition, the options are: single_value (condition is evaluated based on each query's returned value) sum (condition is evaluated based on the sum of each query's returned values over the specified duration) violation_time_limit_seconds Use to automatically close instance-based violations after the number of seconds specified. Must be one of these values: 3600 7200 14400 28800 43200 86400 Used for: Location conditions NRQL conditions violation_close_timer Use to automatically close instance-based violations, including JVM health metric violations, after the number of hours specified.

      "body": "In a policy, a condition identifies what triggers an alert. You can use the REST API to disable and enable conditions. You can also disable and enable conditions in New Relic One. Policies can't be enabled or disabled, whether via the API or the UI. Policies can only be created, deleted, or have their conditions changed. Requirements Modifying any attribute in a condition using the API requires: An API key and permissions to manage Alerts The condition's id (available from API Explorer: Alerts Conditions > GET > List) If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you are using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. Enable and disable a condition The process for disabling or enabling a condition is the same general process for changing any attribute in a condition. A more detailed example comes after this general procedure: Find the ID for the policy that contains the condition you want to change. If the policy's ID is unknown, use the policy's name or type to make an API call and find the policy's ID. For more on this process, see List a single policy. With the policy ID, make an API call that returns the conditions associated with that policy. There are four different condition categories. If you don't know the category, this may require making up to four API calls in order to find the condition. Details on searching for condition ID If you don't know the category of the condition you want to change, you must search for it by making API calls using the four condition categories. Here are the different API call formats for the various condition categories. APM, browser, and mobile monitoring Conditions available: apm_app_metric, apm_kt_metric, browser_metric, and mobile_metric API Explorer link Get>List External services Conditions available: apm_external_service, mobile_external_service API Explorer link Get>List Synthetic monitoring API Explorer link Get>List Plugins API Explorer link Get>List For the returned JSON, find the JSON object of the condition you want to change. Copy and paste the condition's JSON in a text editor of your choice and edit the JSON. To enable the condition, set \"enabled\" to true. To disable the condition, set \"enabled\" to false. Update the condition by submitting your edited JSON via an Update API request. Our different products require different API requests. Details on Update API requests Use the Update API request that corresponds to the product in question: Conditions for APM, browser, and mobile Conditions available: apm_app_metric, apm_kt_metric, browser_metric, and mobile_metric API Explorer PUT>Update link Conditions for external services Conditions available: apm_external_service, mobile_external_service API Explorer PUT>Update Conditions for Synthetic monitoring) API Explorer PUT>Update Conditions for Plugins API Explorer PUT>Update Tip An Update API request can only change one condition at a time, it cannot update a vector of objects. For example, to change three conditions, you will have to make three separate requests. Example: Disable an APM condition The following example shows how to disable a condition for an apm_app_metric condition. With the exception of the types of API calls required, the process is similar to the process for changing other condition types. Obtain the policy_id of the policy you want to update. For an imaginary policy named Logjam Alert, the command would be: curl -X GET 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_policies.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -G --data-urlencode 'filter[name]= Logjam Alert' <---<<< {policy_name} Copy The output for this request might look like: { \"policies\": [ { \"id\": 85, <---<<< $POLICY_ID \"incident_preference\": \"PER_POLICY\", \"name\": \"Logjam Alert\", \"created_at\": 1461176510393, \"updated_at\": 1461176510393 } ] } Copy List all of this policy's conditions and locate the {condition_id}: curl -X GET 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_conditions.json' \\ -H 'X-Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -G -d 'policy_id=85' Copy The output for this request might look like: { \"conditions\": [ { \"id\": 12345, <---<<< $CONDITION_ID \"type\": \"apm_app_metric\", \"name\": \"Apdex (Low)\", \"enabled\": true, <---<<< Note the condition is enabled \"entities\": [ \"8288171\" ], \"metric\": \"apdex\", \"terms\": [ { \"duration\": \"5\", \"operator\": \"below\", \"priority\": \"critical\", \"threshold\": \"1\", \"time_function\": \"any\" } ] }, { \"id\": 2468, <---<<< another condition_id \"type\": \"apm_app_metric\", \"name\": \"Throughput (Low)\", ... } ] } Copy Copy the JSON for only the condition in question and paste it in a text editor. Change \"enabled\": true to \"enabled\": false.

      "body": "You can use NRQL queries to create alert conditions. Once you've defined your signal, you can further define your warning and critical threshold levels. This determines when an alerts violation is created. Read on to learn more about how to do this. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Click NRQL, and then Next, define thresholds. Tip For more information on key concepts relating to NRQL alert conditions and streaming alerts, see Streaming alerts: key terms and concepts. Create a NRQL alert condition To create a NRQL alert condition for a policy: On one.newrelic.com, in the header click Alerts & AI, then in the left sidebar click Policies. Select an existing policy or click New alert policy to create a new policy. Click Add a condition. Under Select a product click NRQL, and then click Next, define thresholds. Create a condition from a chart You can use a chart to create a NRQL alert condition. To create a NRQL alerts condition from a chart, click the chart menu , then click Create alert condition. Once you've named and customized your condition, you can add it to an existing policy or create a new one. Caution A small number of our older charts don't include the option to create an alert condition. NRQL alert syntax Here's the basic syntax for creating all NRQL alert conditions. The FACET clause is required for outlier threshold types. It's optional for static and baseline. SELECT function(attribute) FROM Event WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Copy Clause Notes SELECT function(attribute) Required Supported functions that return numbers include: apdex average count latest max min percentage percentile sum uniqueCount Tip If you use the percentile aggregator in a faceted alert condition with many facets, this may cause the following error to appear: An error occurred while fetching chart data. If you see this error, use average instead. FROM data type Required Only one data type can be targeted. Supported data types: Event Metric (RAW data points will be returned) WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Use the WHERE clause to specify a series of one or more conditions. All the operators are supported. FACET attribute Required for outlier conditions Include an optional FACET clause in your NRQL syntax depending on the threshold type: static or baseline. Use the FACET clause to separate your results by attribute and alert on each attribute independently. No LIMIT clause is allowed, but all queries will receive the maximum number of facets possible. Faceted queries can return a maximum of 5000 values for static and baseline conditions and a maximum of 500 values for outlier conditions. Important If the query returns more than the maximum number of values, the alert condition can't be created. If you create the condition and the query returns more than this number later, the alert will fail. Modify your query so that it returns a fewer number of values. Reformatting incompatible NRQL Some elements of NRQL used in charts don’t make sense in the streaming context of alerts. Here’s a list of the most common incompatible elements and suggestions for reformatting a NRQL alert query to achieve the same effect. Element Notes SINCE and UNTIL Example: SELECT percentile(largestContentfulPaint, 75) FROM PageViewTiming WHERE (appId = 837807) SINCE yesterday Copy NRQL Alerting produces a never-ending stream of windowed query results, so the SINCE and UNTIL keywords to scope the query to a point in time are not compatible. As a convenience, we automatically strip SINCE and UNTIL from a query when creating a NRQL Alert Condition from the context of a chart. TIMESERIES In NRQL queries, the TIMESERIES clause is used to return data as a time series broken out by a specified period of time. For NRQL alerts, the equivalent property of a signal is the aggregation window. histogram() The histogram() aggregation function is used to generate histograms. histogram() is not compatible with NRQL alerting: histogram aggregations can not be formatted as a time series. To create an alert from a portion of a histogram (e.g. 95th percentile), use the percentile() aggregation function. Multiple Aggregation Functions Each alert condition can only target a single aggregated stream of data. To alert on multiple streams simultaneously, you’ll need to decompose them into individual conditions within the same policy. Original Query: SELECT count(foo), average(bar), max(baz) from Transaction Copy Decomposed: SELECT count(foo) from Transaction SELECT average(bar) from Transaction SELECT max(baz) from Transaction Copy COMPARE WITH The COMPARE WITH clause is used to compare the values for two different time ranges. This type of query is incompatible with NRQL alerting. We recommend using a Baseline Alert Condition to dynamically detect deviations for a particular signal. SLIDE BY The SLIDE BY clause supports a feature known as sliding windows. With sliding windows, SLIDE BY data is gathered into \"windows\" of time that overlap with each other. These windows can help to smooth out line graphs with a lot of variation in cases where the rolling aggregate (such as a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. Sliding windows are not currently supported in NRQL alerts. LIMIT In NRQL queries, the LIMIT clause is used to control the amount of data a query returns, either the maximum number of facet values returned by FACET queries or the maximum number of items returned by SELECT * queries. LIMIT is not compatible with NRQL alerting: evaluation is always performed on the full result set. NRQL alert threshold examples Here are some common use cases for NRQL alert conditions. These queries will work for static and baseline threshold types. The outlier threshold type will require additional FACET clauses. Alert on specific segments of your data Create constrained alerts that target a specific segment of your data, such as a few key customers or a range of data. Use the WHERE clause to define those conditions. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction WHERE account_id in (91290, 102021, 20230) Copy SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction WHERE name LIKE 'Controller/checkout/%' Copy Alert on Nth percentile of your data Create alerts when an Nth percentile of your data hits a specified threshold; for example, maintaining SLA service levels. Since we evaluate the NRQL query in one-minute time windows, percentiles will be calculated for each minute separately. SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentile(databaseDuration, 75) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on max, min, avg of your data Create alerts when your data hits a certain maximum, minimum, or average; for example, ensuring that a duration or response time does not pass a certain threshold. SELECT max(duration) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on a percentage of your data Create alerts when a proportion of your data goes above or below a certain threshold. SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE duration > 2) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE httpResponseCode = '500') FROM Transaction Copy Alert on Apdex with any T-value Create alerts on Apdex, applying your own T-value for certain transactions. For example, get an alert notification when your Apdex for a T-value of 500ms on transactions for production apps goes below 0.8. SELECT apdex(duration, t:0.5) FROM Transaction WHERE appName like '%prod%' Copy Alert conditions and query order of operations By default, the aggregation window is 1 minute, but you can change the window to suit your needs. Whatever the aggregation window, New Relic will collect data for that window using the function in the NRQL alert condition’s query. The query is parsed and executed by our systems in the following order: FROM clause – which event type needs to be grabbed? WHERE clause – what can be filtered out? SELECT clause – what information needs to be returned from the now-filtered data set? Example: null value returned Let's say this is your alert condition query: SELECT count(*) FROM SyntheticCheck WHERE monitorName = 'My Cool Monitor' AND result = 'FAILURE' Copy If there are no failures for the aggregation window: The system will execute the FROM clause by grabbing all SyntheticCheck events on your account. Then it will execute the WHERE clause to filter through those events by looking only for the ones that match the monitor name and result specified. If there are still events left to scan through after completing the FROM and WHERE operations, the SELECT clause will be executed. If there are no remaining events, the SELECT clause will not be executed. This means that aggregators like count() and uniqueCount() will never return a zero value. When there is a count of 0, the SELECT clause is ignored and no data is returned, resulting in a value of NULL. Example: zero value returned If you have a data source delivering legitimate numeric zeroes, the query will return zero values and not null values. Let's say this is your alert condition query, and that MyCoolEvent is an attribute that can sometimes return a zero value. SELECT average(MyCoolAttribute) FROM MyCoolEvent Copy If, in the aggregation window being evaluated, there's at least one instance of MyCoolEvent and if the average value of all MyCoolAttribute attributes from that window is equal to zero, then a 0 value will be returned. If there are no MyCoolEvent events during that minute, then a NULL will be returned due to the order of operations. Tip For more information about this topic, you can check out our blog post on troubleshooting for zero versus null values. Tip You can determine how null values will be handled by adjusting loss of signal and gap filling settings in the Alert Conditions UI. Tip You can avoid NULL values entirely with a query order of operations shortcut. Do this by using a filter sub-clause, then including all filter elements within that sub-clause. The main body of the query will run and return data, at which point the SELECT clause will then run and apply the filter elements. The query will return a value of 0 if the filter elements result in no matching data. Here's an example: SELECT filter(count(*), WHERE result = 'SUCCESS' AND monitorName = 'My Favorite Monitor') FROM SyntheticCheck Copy Nested aggregation NRQL alerts Nested aggregation queries are a powerful way to query your data. However, they have a few restrictions that are important to note. Nested queries with a non-faceted innermost query are not currently supported Without a FACET, the inner query produces a single result, giving the outer query nothing to aggregate. If you're using a nested query, make sure your inner query is faceted. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu) ​​​​​ Copy Queries at all levels must have the same aggregation window size With an alert aggregation window of 1 minute, the inner query would produce two smaller windows of 30 seconds. In theory, these two windows could be aggregated by the outer query. However, this is not currently supported. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu TIMESERIES 30 seconds)​​ Copy Signal loss is not yet supported for nested queries For more information on signal loss, see NerdGraph API: Loss of signal and gap filling. Nested queries containing 'WITH METRIC_FORMAT' in the inner query are not currently supported You can't use a nested query containing the WITH METRIC_FORMAT in the inner query to create NRQL alert conditions. NRQL condition creation tips Here are some tips for creating and using a NRQL condition: Topic Tips Condition threshold types NRQL condition threshold types include static, baseline, and outlier. Create a description For NRQL conditions, you can create a custom description to add to each violation. Descriptions can be enhanced with variable substitution based on metadata in the specific violation. For details, see Description Query results Queries must return a number. The condition evaluates the returned number against the thresholds you've set. Time period As with all alert conditions, NRQL conditions evaluate one single minute at a time. The implicit SINCE ... UNTIL clause specifying which minute to evaluate is controlled by your Evaluation offset setting. Since very recent data may be incomplete, you may want to query data from 3 minutes ago or longer, especially for: Applications that run on multiple hosts. SyntheticCheck data: Timeouts can take 3 minutes, so 5 minutes or more is recommended. Also, if a query will generate intermittent data, consider using the sum of query results option. Lost signal threshold (loss of signal detection) You can use loss of signal detection to alert on when your data (a telemetry signal) should be considered lost. A signal loss can indicate that a service or entity is no longer online or that a periodic job failed to run. You can also use this to make sure that violations for sporadic data, such as error counts, are closed when no signal is coming in. Advanced signal settings These settings give you options for better handling continuous, streaming data signals that may sometimes be missing. These settings include the aggregation window, the evaluation offset, and an option for filling data gaps. For more on using these, see Advanced signal settings. Condition settings Use the Condition settings to: Create a concise, descriptive condition name. Provide a custom violation description for the condition that will be included in violations and notifications. Add the runbook URL to include your organization's procedures for handling incidents. You may also add this information to the custom violation description. Limits on conditions See the maximum values. Health status NRQL alert conditions don't affect an entity's health status display. Examples For more information, see: Expected NRQL syntax Examples of NRQL condition queries Alert threshold types When you create a NRQL alert, you can choose from different types of thresholds: NRQL alert threshold types Description Static This is the simplest type of NRQL threshold. It allows you to create a condition based on a NRQL query that returns a numeric value. Optional: Include a FACET clause. Baseline (Dynamic) Uses a self-adjusting condition based on the past behavior of the monitored values. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type. Outlier Looks for group behavior and values that are outliers from those groups. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type, but requires a FACET clause. Sum of query results (limited or intermittent data) Important Available only for static (basic) threshold types. If a query returns intermittent or limited data, it may be difficult to set a meaningful threshold. Missing or limited data will sometimes generate false positives or false negatives. You can use loss of signal, aggregation duration, and gap filling settings to minimize these false notifications. To avoid this problem when using the static threshold type, you can set the selector to sum of query results. This lets you set the alert on an aggregated sum instead of a value from a single harvest cycle. Up to two hours of one-minute data checks can be aggregated. The duration you select determines the width of the rolling sum and the preview chart will update accordingly. Set the loss of signal threshold Loss of signal occurs when no data matches the NRQL condition over a specific period of time. You can set your loss of signal threshold duration and and also what happens when the threshold is crossed. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Loss of signal is only available for NRQL conditions. You may also manage these settings using the GraphQL API (recommended), or the REST API. Go here for specific GraphQL API examples. Loss of signal settings: Loss of signal settings include a time duration and two possible actions. Signal loss expiration time UI label: Signal is lost after: GraphQL Node: expiration.expirationDuration Expiration duration is a timer that starts and resets when we receive a data point in the streaming alerts pipeline. If we don't receive another data point before your 'expiration time' expires, we consider that signal to be lost. This can be because no data is being sent to New Relic or the WHERE clause of your NRQL query is filtering that data out before it is streamed to the alerts pipeline. The loss of signal expiration time is independent of the threshold duration and triggers as soon as the timer expires. The maximum expiration duration is 48 hours. This is helpful when monitoring for the execution of infrequent jobs. The minimum is 30 seconds, but we recommend using at least 3-5 minutes. Loss of signal actions Once a signal is considered lost, you can close open violations, open new violations, or both. Close all current open violations: This closes all open violations that are related to a specific signal. It won't necessarily close all violations for a condition. If you're alerting on an ephemeral service, or on a sporadic signal, you'll want to choose this action to ensure that violations are closed properly. The GraphQL node name for this is \"closeViolationsOnExpiration\" Open new violations: This will open a new violation when the signal is considered lost. These violations will indicate that they are due to a loss of signal. Based on your incident preferences, this should trigger a notification. The graphQL node name for this is \"openViolationOnExpiration\" When you enable both actions, we'll close all open violations first, and then open a new violation for loss of signal. To create a NRQL alert configured with loss of signal detection in the UI: For a policy, when you create a condition, under Select a product, click NRQL, then click Next, define thresholds. Write a NRQL query that returns the values you want to alert on. For Threshold type, select Static or Baseline. Click + Add lost signal threshold, then set the signal expiration duration time in minutes or seconds in the Signal is lost after field. Choose what you want to happen when the signal is lost. You can check one or both of Close all current open violations and Open new \"lost signal\" violation. These control how loss of signal violations will be handled for the condition. Make sure you name your condition before you save it. Violations open due to loss of signal close when the signal comes back. Newly opened lost signal violations will close immediately when new data is evaluated. the condition they belong to expires. By default, conditions expire after 3 days. you manually close the violation with the Close all current open violations option. Tip Loss of signal detection doesn't work on NRQL queries that use nested aggregation or sub-queries. Advanced signal settings When creating a NRQL alert condition, the advanced signal settings gives you better control over streaming alert data and helps you avoid false alarms. When creating a NRQL condition, there are several advanced signal settings: Aggregation window Evaluation offset Fill data gaps To read an explanation of what these settings are and how they relate to each other, see Streaming alerts concepts. Below are instructions and tips on how to configure them. Aggregation window You can set the aggregation window duration to choose how long data is accumulated in a streaming time window before it's aggregated. You can set it to anything between one second and 15 minutes. The default is one minute. Tip Baseline alert condition thresholds don't support editing the aggregation window. They use the 1 minute default. Evaluation offset You can adjust the evaluation offset to coordinate our streaming alerting algorithm with your data's latency. If it takes a while for your data to arrive, then you may need to increase the evaluation offset. The total supported latency is the product of the aggregation window duration multiplied by the evaluation offset. In the example screenshot above, the supported latency is 3 minutes (a 1-minute aggregation window multiplied by three windows). If the data type comes from an APM language agent and is aggregated from many app instances (for example, Transactions, TransactionErrors, etc.), we recommend using an evaluation offset of 3 with 1 minute aggregation windows. Important When creating NRQL conditions for data collected from Infrastructure Cloud Integrations such as AWS Cloudwatch or Azure, we recommend that you start with an evaluation offset of 15 minutes, then adjust up or down depending on how long it takes to collect your data. Fill data gaps Gap filling lets you customize the values to use when your signals don't have any data. You can fill gaps in your data streams with one of these settings: None: (Default) Choose this if you don't want to take any action on empty aggregation windows. On evaluation, an empty aggregation window will reset the threshold duration timer. For example, if a condition says that all aggregation windows must have data points above the threshold for 5 minutes, and 1 of the 5 aggregation windows is empty, then the condition won't be in violation. Custom static value: Choose this if you'd like to insert a custom static value into the empty aggregation windows before they're evaluated. This option has an additional, required parameter of fillValue (as named in the API) that specifies what static value should be used. This defaults to 0. Last known value: This option inserts the last seen value before evaluation occurs. We maintain the state of the last seen value for 2 hours. Tip The alerts system fills gaps in actively reported signals. This signal history is dropped after 2 hours of inactivity. For gap filling, data points received after this period of inactivity are treated as new signals. To learn more about signal loss, gap filling, and how to request access to these features, see this Explorers Hub post. Options for editing data gap settings: In the NRQL conditions UI, go to Condition settings > Advanced signal settings > fill data gaps with and choose an option. If using our Nerdgraph API (preferred), this node is located at: actor : account : alerts : nrqlCondition : signal : fillOption | fillValue NerdGraph is our recommended API for this but if you're using our REST API, you can find this setting in the REST API explorer under the \"signal\" section of the Alert NRQL conditions API.",

At its core, Applied Intelligence helps you find, troubleshoot, and resolve problems more quickly. Specifically, it’s a hybrid machine learning engine that reduces alert noise, correlates incidents, and automatically detects anomalies. By applying machine learning to your data and feedback, Applied Intelligence is designed to improve functionality and deliver smarter context over time. After connecting your data sources to Applied Intelligence, it looks for potential problems and improves based on your feedback. Why use Applied Intelligence? How you respond to an incident can mean thousands of dollars or clicks for your company. Applied Intelligence helps you solve problems faster. Feature Description Troubleshoot and respond to incidents Our solution helps you understand your incidents and gives you ideas for what to do next. Here are a few examples: Automatically classifies incidents based on the golden signals of site reliability engineering. Identifies entities in your stack that may relate to the underlying issue. Suggests responses for incidents based on historical context. Less noise, more focus As tools and systems become more complex, alert noise can overwhelm DevOps and SRE teams. Applied Intelligence correlates related incidents and suppresses noise, so you're only notified when human action is required. Incidents with a hybrid approach Applied Intelligence streamlines your incidents by combining its built-in inputs with your knowledge and feedback. Over time, the system delivers more accurate insights. For example: Our correlation and classification engine adjusts based on your feedback. The system automatically suggests new correlation rules based on your production data. You can create custom logic using the decision builder. Automatic anomaly detection Applied Intelligence provides automatic anomaly detection on all your APM-monitored applications. We detect anomalies in throughput, latency, and error rate, with no action required from you. Benefits include: No setup required. See anomalies surfaced automatically in the anomalies feed. See them in various New Relic activity streams (for example, on the New Relic One home page). Ability to run NRQL queries of anomalies and create custom dashboards with that data. Determine root causes with Incident Intelligence As part of Applied Intelligence, Incident Intelligence helps you correlate incident events and reduce noise in your environment. With it, you can get an overview of all your issues, see suggested responders, and configure your own correlation logic. To get started, see Incident Intelligence. Find unknowns with Proactive Detection Another feature of Applied Intelligence is Proactive Detection. Proactive Detection is, by default, always on and detecting anomalies. These anomalies are surfaced in the Applied Intelligence anomalies feed, New Relic One activity streams, and can be queried, alerted on, and added to dashboards. Anomalies can be sent to Slack or via webhooks, and/or added as a source for Incident Intelligence correlation and issue notification. Proactive Detection also provides automatic analysis of anomalies and alerts via the analysis page. To get started, see Proactive Detection.",

      "body": "You can use NRQL queries to create alert conditions. Once you've defined your signal, you can further define your warning and critical threshold levels. This determines when an alerts violation is created. Read on to learn more about how to do this. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Click NRQL, and then Next, define thresholds. Tip For more information on key concepts relating to NRQL alert conditions and streaming alerts, see Streaming alerts: key terms and concepts. Create a NRQL alert condition To create a NRQL alert condition for a policy: On one.newrelic.com, in the header click Alerts & AI, then in the left sidebar click Policies. Select an existing policy or click New alert policy to create a new policy. Click Add a condition. Under Select a product click NRQL, and then click Next, define thresholds. Create a condition from a chart You can use a chart to create a NRQL alert condition. To create a NRQL alerts condition from a chart, click the chart menu , then click Create alert condition. Once you've named and customized your condition, you can add it to an existing policy or create a new one. Caution A small number of our older charts don't include the option to create an alert condition. NRQL alert syntax Here's the basic syntax for creating all NRQL alert conditions. The FACET clause is required for outlier threshold types. It's optional for static and baseline. SELECT function(attribute) FROM Event WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Copy Clause Notes SELECT function(attribute) Required Supported functions that return numbers include: apdex average count latest max min percentage percentile sum uniqueCount Tip If you use the percentile aggregator in a faceted alert condition with many facets, this may cause the following error to appear: An error occurred while fetching chart data. If you see this error, use average instead. FROM data type Required Only one data type can be targeted. Supported data types: Event Metric (RAW data points will be returned) WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Use the WHERE clause to specify a series of one or more conditions. All the operators are supported. FACET attribute Required for outlier conditions Include an optional FACET clause in your NRQL syntax depending on the threshold type: static or baseline. Use the FACET clause to separate your results by attribute and alert on each attribute independently. No LIMIT clause is allowed, but all queries will receive the maximum number of facets possible. Faceted queries can return a maximum of 5000 values for static and baseline conditions and a maximum of 500 values for outlier conditions. Important If the query returns more than the maximum number of values, the alert condition can't be created. If you create the condition and the query returns more than this number later, the alert will fail. Modify your query so that it returns a fewer number of values. Reformatting incompatible NRQL Some elements of NRQL used in charts don’t make sense in the streaming context of alerts. Here’s a list of the most common incompatible elements and suggestions for reformatting a NRQL alert query to achieve the same effect. Element Notes SINCE and UNTIL Example: SELECT percentile(largestContentfulPaint, 75) FROM PageViewTiming WHERE (appId = 837807) SINCE yesterday Copy NRQL Alerting produces a never-ending stream of windowed query results, so the SINCE and UNTIL keywords to scope the query to a point in time are not compatible. As a convenience, we automatically strip SINCE and UNTIL from a query when creating a NRQL Alert Condition from the context of a chart. TIMESERIES In NRQL queries, the TIMESERIES clause is used to return data as a time series broken out by a specified period of time. For NRQL alerts, the equivalent property of a signal is the aggregation window. histogram() The histogram() aggregation function is used to generate histograms. histogram() is not compatible with NRQL alerting: histogram aggregations can not be formatted as a time series. To create an alert from a portion of a histogram (e.g. 95th percentile), use the percentile() aggregation function. Multiple Aggregation Functions Each alert condition can only target a single aggregated stream of data. To alert on multiple streams simultaneously, you’ll need to decompose them into individual conditions within the same policy. Original Query: SELECT count(foo), average(bar), max(baz) from Transaction Copy Decomposed: SELECT count(foo) from Transaction SELECT average(bar) from Transaction SELECT max(baz) from Transaction Copy COMPARE WITH The COMPARE WITH clause is used to compare the values for two different time ranges. This type of query is incompatible with NRQL alerting. We recommend using a Baseline Alert Condition to dynamically detect deviations for a particular signal. SLIDE BY The SLIDE BY clause supports a feature known as sliding windows. With sliding windows, SLIDE BY data is gathered into \"windows\" of time that overlap with each other. These windows can help to smooth out line graphs with a lot of variation in cases where the rolling aggregate (such as a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. Sliding windows are not currently supported in NRQL alerts. LIMIT In NRQL queries, the LIMIT clause is used to control the amount of data a query returns, either the maximum number of facet values returned by FACET queries or the maximum number of items returned by SELECT * queries. LIMIT is not compatible with NRQL alerting: evaluation is always performed on the full result set. NRQL alert threshold examples Here are some common use cases for NRQL alert conditions. These queries will work for static and baseline threshold types. The outlier threshold type will require additional FACET clauses. Alert on specific segments of your data Create constrained alerts that target a specific segment of your data, such as a few key customers or a range of data. Use the WHERE clause to define those conditions. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction WHERE account_id in (91290, 102021, 20230) Copy SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction WHERE name LIKE 'Controller/checkout/%' Copy Alert on Nth percentile of your data Create alerts when an Nth percentile of your data hits a specified threshold; for example, maintaining SLA service levels. Since we evaluate the NRQL query in one-minute time windows, percentiles will be calculated for each minute separately. SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentile(databaseDuration, 75) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on max, min, avg of your data Create alerts when your data hits a certain maximum, minimum, or average; for example, ensuring that a duration or response time does not pass a certain threshold. SELECT max(duration) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on a percentage of your data Create alerts when a proportion of your data goes above or below a certain threshold. SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE duration > 2) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE httpResponseCode = '500') FROM Transaction Copy Alert on Apdex with any T-value Create alerts on Apdex, applying your own T-value for certain transactions. For example, get an alert notification when your Apdex for a T-value of 500ms on transactions for production apps goes below 0.8. SELECT apdex(duration, t:0.5) FROM Transaction WHERE appName like '%prod%' Copy Alert conditions and query order of operations By default, the aggregation window is 1 minute, but you can change the window to suit your needs. Whatever the aggregation window, New Relic will collect data for that window using the function in the NRQL alert condition’s query. The query is parsed and executed by our systems in the following order: FROM clause – which event type needs to be grabbed? WHERE clause – what can be filtered out? SELECT clause – what information needs to be returned from the now-filtered data set? Example: null value returned Let's say this is your alert condition query: SELECT count(*) FROM SyntheticCheck WHERE monitorName = 'My Cool Monitor' AND result = 'FAILURE' Copy If there are no failures for the aggregation window: The system will execute the FROM clause by grabbing all SyntheticCheck events on your account. Then it will execute the WHERE clause to filter through those events by looking only for the ones that match the monitor name and result specified. If there are still events left to scan through after completing the FROM and WHERE operations, the SELECT clause will be executed. If there are no remaining events, the SELECT clause will not be executed. This means that aggregators like count() and uniqueCount() will never return a zero value. When there is a count of 0, the SELECT clause is ignored and no data is returned, resulting in a value of NULL. Example: zero value returned If you have a data source delivering legitimate numeric zeroes, the query will return zero values and not null values. Let's say this is your alert condition query, and that MyCoolEvent is an attribute that can sometimes return a zero value. SELECT average(MyCoolAttribute) FROM MyCoolEvent Copy If, in the aggregation window being evaluated, there's at least one instance of MyCoolEvent and if the average value of all MyCoolAttribute attributes from that window is equal to zero, then a 0 value will be returned. If there are no MyCoolEvent events during that minute, then a NULL will be returned due to the order of operations. Tip For more information about this topic, you can check out our blog post on troubleshooting for zero versus null values. Tip You can determine how null values will be handled by adjusting loss of signal and gap filling settings in the Alert Conditions UI. Tip You can avoid NULL values entirely with a query order of operations shortcut. Do this by using a filter sub-clause, then including all filter elements within that sub-clause. The main body of the query will run and return data, at which point the SELECT clause will then run and apply the filter elements. The query will return a value of 0 if the filter elements result in no matching data. Here's an example: SELECT filter(count(*), WHERE result = 'SUCCESS' AND monitorName = 'My Favorite Monitor') FROM SyntheticCheck Copy Nested aggregation NRQL alerts Nested aggregation queries are a powerful way to query your data. However, they have a few restrictions that are important to note. Nested queries with a non-faceted innermost query are not currently supported Without a FACET, the inner query produces a single result, giving the outer query nothing to aggregate. If you're using a nested query, make sure your inner query is faceted. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu) ​​​​​ Copy Queries at all levels must have the same aggregation window size With an alert aggregation window of 1 minute, the inner query would produce two smaller windows of 30 seconds. In theory, these two windows could be aggregated by the outer query. However, this is not currently supported. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu TIMESERIES 30 seconds)​​ Copy Signal loss is not yet supported for nested queries For more information on signal loss, see NerdGraph API: Loss of signal and gap filling. Nested queries containing 'WITH METRIC_FORMAT' in the inner query are not currently supported You can't use a nested query containing the WITH METRIC_FORMAT in the inner query to create NRQL alert conditions. NRQL condition creation tips Here are some tips for creating and using a NRQL condition: Topic Tips Condition threshold types NRQL condition threshold types include static, baseline, and outlier. Create a description For NRQL conditions, you can create a custom description to add to each violation. Descriptions can be enhanced with variable substitution based on metadata in the specific violation. For details, see Description Query results Queries must return a number. The condition evaluates the returned number against the thresholds you've set. Time period As with all alert conditions, NRQL conditions evaluate one single minute at a time. The implicit SINCE ... UNTIL clause specifying which minute to evaluate is controlled by your Evaluation offset setting. Since very recent data may be incomplete, you may want to query data from 3 minutes ago or longer, especially for: Applications that run on multiple hosts. SyntheticCheck data: Timeouts can take 3 minutes, so 5 minutes or more is recommended. Also, if a query will generate intermittent data, consider using the sum of query results option. Lost signal threshold (loss of signal detection) You can use loss of signal detection to alert on when your data (a telemetry signal) should be considered lost. A signal loss can indicate that a service or entity is no longer online or that a periodic job failed to run. You can also use this to make sure that violations for sporadic data, such as error counts, are closed when no signal is coming in. Advanced signal settings These settings give you options for better handling continuous, streaming data signals that may sometimes be missing. These settings include the aggregation window, the evaluation offset, and an option for filling data gaps. For more on using these, see Advanced signal settings. Condition settings Use the Condition settings to: Create a concise, descriptive condition name. Provide a custom violation description for the condition that will be included in violations and notifications. Add the runbook URL to include your organization's procedures for handling incidents. You may also add this information to the custom violation description. Limits on conditions See the maximum values. Health status NRQL alert conditions don't affect an entity's health status display. Examples For more information, see: Expected NRQL syntax Examples of NRQL condition queries Alert threshold types When you create a NRQL alert, you can choose from different types of thresholds: NRQL alert threshold types Description Static This is the simplest type of NRQL threshold. It allows you to create a condition based on a NRQL query that returns a numeric value. Optional: Include a FACET clause. Baseline (Dynamic) Uses a self-adjusting condition based on the past behavior of the monitored values. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type. Outlier Looks for group behavior and values that are outliers from those groups. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type, but requires a FACET clause. Sum of query results (limited or intermittent data) Important Available only for static (basic) threshold types. If a query returns intermittent or limited data, it may be difficult to set a meaningful threshold. Missing or limited data will sometimes generate false positives or false negatives. You can use loss of signal, aggregation duration, and gap filling settings to minimize these false notifications. To avoid this problem when using the static threshold type, you can set the selector to sum of query results. This lets you set the alert on an aggregated sum instead of a value from a single harvest cycle. Up to two hours of one-minute data checks can be aggregated. The duration you select determines the width of the rolling sum and the preview chart will update accordingly. Set the loss of signal threshold Loss of signal occurs when no data matches the NRQL condition over a specific period of time. You can set your loss of signal threshold duration and and also what happens when the threshold is crossed. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Loss of signal is only available for NRQL conditions. You may also manage these settings using the GraphQL API (recommended), or the REST API. Go here for specific GraphQL API examples. Loss of signal settings: Loss of signal settings include a time duration and two possible actions. Signal loss expiration time UI label: Signal is lost after: GraphQL Node: expiration.expirationDuration Expiration duration is a timer that starts and resets when we receive a data point in the streaming alerts pipeline. If we don't receive another data point before your 'expiration time' expires, we consider that signal to be lost. This can be because no data is being sent to New Relic or the WHERE clause of your NRQL query is filtering that data out before it is streamed to the alerts pipeline. The loss of signal expiration time is independent of the threshold duration and triggers as soon as the timer expires. The maximum expiration duration is 48 hours. This is helpful when monitoring for the execution of infrequent jobs. The minimum is 30 seconds, but we recommend using at least 3-5 minutes. Loss of signal actions Once a signal is considered lost, you can close open violations, open new violations, or both. Close all current open violations: This closes all open violations that are related to a specific signal. It won't necessarily close all violations for a condition. If you're alerting on an ephemeral service, or on a sporadic signal, you'll want to choose this action to ensure that violations are closed properly. The GraphQL node name for this is \"closeViolationsOnExpiration\" Open new violations: This will open a new violation when the signal is considered lost. These violations will indicate that they are due to a loss of signal. Based on your incident preferences, this should trigger a notification. The graphQL node name for this is \"openViolationOnExpiration\" When you enable both actions, we'll close all open violations first, and then open a new violation for loss of signal. To create a NRQL alert configured with loss of signal detection in the UI: For a policy, when you create a condition, under Select a product, click NRQL, then click Next, define thresholds. Write a NRQL query that returns the values you want to alert on. For Threshold type, select Static or Baseline. Click + Add lost signal threshold, then set the signal expiration duration time in minutes or seconds in the Signal is lost after field. Choose what you want to happen when the signal is lost. You can check one or both of Close all current open violations and Open new \"lost signal\" violation. These control how loss of signal violations will be handled for the condition. Make sure you name your condition before you save it. Violations open due to loss of signal close when the signal comes back. Newly opened lost signal violations will close immediately when new data is evaluated. the condition they belong to expires. By default, conditions expire after 3 days. you manually close the violation with the Close all current open violations option. Tip Loss of signal detection doesn't work on NRQL queries that use nested aggregation or sub-queries. Advanced signal settings When creating a NRQL alert condition, the advanced signal settings gives you better control over streaming alert data and helps you avoid false alarms. When creating a NRQL condition, there are several advanced signal settings: Aggregation window Evaluation offset Fill data gaps To read an explanation of what these settings are and how they relate to each other, see Streaming alerts concepts. Below are instructions and tips on how to configure them. Aggregation window You can set the aggregation window duration to choose how long data is accumulated in a streaming time window before it's aggregated. You can set it to anything between one second and 15 minutes. The default is one minute. Tip Baseline alert condition thresholds don't support editing the aggregation window. They use the 1 minute default. Evaluation offset You can adjust the evaluation offset to coordinate our streaming alerting algorithm with your data's latency. If it takes a while for your data to arrive, then you may need to increase the evaluation offset. The total supported latency is the product of the aggregation window duration multiplied by the evaluation offset. In the example screenshot above, the supported latency is 3 minutes (a 1-minute aggregation window multiplied by three windows). If the data type comes from an APM language agent and is aggregated from many app instances (for example, Transactions, TransactionErrors, etc.), we recommend using an evaluation offset of 3 with 1 minute aggregation windows. Important When creating NRQL conditions for data collected from Infrastructure Cloud Integrations such as AWS Cloudwatch or Azure, we recommend that you start with an evaluation offset of 15 minutes, then adjust up or down depending on how long it takes to collect your data. Fill data gaps Gap filling lets you customize the values to use when your signals don't have any data. You can fill gaps in your data streams with one of these settings: None: (Default) Choose this if you don't want to take any action on empty aggregation windows. On evaluation, an empty aggregation window will reset the threshold duration timer. For example, if a condition says that all aggregation windows must have data points above the threshold for 5 minutes, and 1 of the 5 aggregation windows is empty, then the condition won't be in violation. Custom static value: Choose this if you'd like to insert a custom static value into the empty aggregation windows before they're evaluated. This option has an additional, required parameter of fillValue (as named in the API) that specifies what static value should be used. This defaults to 0. Last known value: This option inserts the last seen value before evaluation occurs. We maintain the state of the last seen value for 2 hours. Tip The alerts system fills gaps in actively reported signals. This signal history is dropped after 2 hours of inactivity. For gap filling, data points received after this period of inactivity are treated as new signals. To learn more about signal loss, gap filling, and how to request access to these features, see this Explorers Hub post. Options for editing data gap settings: In the NRQL conditions UI, go to Condition settings > Advanced signal settings > fill data gaps with and choose an option. If using our Nerdgraph API (preferred), this node is located at: actor : account : alerts : nrqlCondition : signal : fillOption | fillValue NerdGraph is our recommended API for this but if you're using our REST API, you can find this setting in the REST API explorer under the \"signal\" section of the Alert NRQL conditions API.",

At its core, Applied Intelligence helps you find, troubleshoot, and resolve problems more quickly. Specifically, it’s a hybrid machine learning engine that reduces alert noise, correlates incidents, and automatically detects anomalies. By applying machine learning to your data and feedback, Applied Intelligence is designed to improve functionality and deliver smarter context over time. After connecting your data sources to Applied Intelligence, it looks for potential problems and improves based on your feedback. Why use Applied Intelligence? How you respond to an incident can mean thousands of dollars or clicks for your company. Applied Intelligence helps you solve problems faster. Feature Description Troubleshoot and respond to incidents Our solution helps you understand your incidents and gives you ideas for what to do next. Here are a few examples: Automatically classifies incidents based on the golden signals of site reliability engineering. Identifies entities in your stack that may relate to the underlying issue. Suggests responses for incidents based on historical context. Less noise, more focus As tools and systems become more complex, alert noise can overwhelm DevOps and SRE teams. Applied Intelligence correlates related incidents and suppresses noise, so you're only notified when human action is required. Incidents with a hybrid approach Applied Intelligence streamlines your incidents by combining its built-in inputs with your knowledge and feedback. Over time, the system delivers more accurate insights. For example: Our correlation and classification engine adjusts based on your feedback. The system automatically suggests new correlation rules based on your production data. You can create custom logic using the decision builder. Automatic anomaly detection Applied Intelligence provides automatic anomaly detection on all your APM-monitored applications. We detect anomalies in throughput, latency, and error rate, with no action required from you. Benefits include: No setup required. See anomalies surfaced automatically in the anomalies feed. See them in various New Relic activity streams (for example, on the New Relic One home page). Ability to run NRQL queries of anomalies and create custom dashboards with that data. Determine root causes with Incident Intelligence As part of Applied Intelligence, Incident Intelligence helps you correlate incident events and reduce noise in your environment. With it, you can get an overview of all your issues, see suggested responders, and configure your own correlation logic. To get started, see Incident Intelligence. Find unknowns with Proactive Detection Another feature of Applied Intelligence is Proactive Detection. Proactive Detection is, by default, always on and detecting anomalies. These anomalies are surfaced in the Applied Intelligence anomalies feed, New Relic One activity streams, and can be queried, alerted on, and added to dashboards. Anomalies can be sent to Slack or via webhooks, and/or added as a source for Incident Intelligence correlation and issue notification. Proactive Detection also provides automatic analysis of anomalies and alerts via the analysis page. To get started, see Proactive Detection.",

      "body": "You can use NRQL queries to create alert conditions. Once you've defined your signal, you can further define your warning and critical threshold levels. This determines when an alerts violation is created. Read on to learn more about how to do this. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Click NRQL, and then Next, define thresholds. Tip For more information on key concepts relating to NRQL alert conditions and streaming alerts, see Streaming alerts: key terms and concepts. Create a NRQL alert condition To create a NRQL alert condition for a policy: On one.newrelic.com, in the header click Alerts & AI, then in the left sidebar click Policies. Select an existing policy or click New alert policy to create a new policy. Click Add a condition. Under Select a product click NRQL, and then click Next, define thresholds. Create a condition from a chart You can use a chart to create a NRQL alert condition. To create a NRQL alerts condition from a chart, click the chart menu , then click Create alert condition. Once you've named and customized your condition, you can add it to an existing policy or create a new one. Caution A small number of our older charts don't include the option to create an alert condition. NRQL alert syntax Here's the basic syntax for creating all NRQL alert conditions. The FACET clause is required for outlier threshold types. It's optional for static and baseline. SELECT function(attribute) FROM Event WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Copy Clause Notes SELECT function(attribute) Required Supported functions that return numbers include: apdex average count latest max min percentage percentile sum uniqueCount Tip If you use the percentile aggregator in a faceted alert condition with many facets, this may cause the following error to appear: An error occurred while fetching chart data. If you see this error, use average instead. FROM data type Required Only one data type can be targeted. Supported data types: Event Metric (RAW data points will be returned) WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Use the WHERE clause to specify a series of one or more conditions. All the operators are supported. FACET attribute Required for outlier conditions Include an optional FACET clause in your NRQL syntax depending on the threshold type: static or baseline. Use the FACET clause to separate your results by attribute and alert on each attribute independently. No LIMIT clause is allowed, but all queries will receive the maximum number of facets possible. Faceted queries can return a maximum of 5000 values for static and baseline conditions and a maximum of 500 values for outlier conditions. Important If the query returns more than the maximum number of values, the alert condition can't be created. If you create the condition and the query returns more than this number later, the alert will fail. Modify your query so that it returns a fewer number of values. Reformatting incompatible NRQL Some elements of NRQL used in charts don’t make sense in the streaming context of alerts. Here’s a list of the most common incompatible elements and suggestions for reformatting a NRQL alert query to achieve the same effect. Element Notes SINCE and UNTIL Example: SELECT percentile(largestContentfulPaint, 75) FROM PageViewTiming WHERE (appId = 837807) SINCE yesterday Copy NRQL Alerting produces a never-ending stream of windowed query results, so the SINCE and UNTIL keywords to scope the query to a point in time are not compatible. As a convenience, we automatically strip SINCE and UNTIL from a query when creating a NRQL Alert Condition from the context of a chart. TIMESERIES In NRQL queries, the TIMESERIES clause is used to return data as a time series broken out by a specified period of time. For NRQL alerts, the equivalent property of a signal is the aggregation window. histogram() The histogram() aggregation function is used to generate histograms. histogram() is not compatible with NRQL alerting: histogram aggregations can not be formatted as a time series. To create an alert from a portion of a histogram (e.g. 95th percentile), use the percentile() aggregation function. Multiple Aggregation Functions Each alert condition can only target a single aggregated stream of data. To alert on multiple streams simultaneously, you’ll need to decompose them into individual conditions within the same policy. Original Query: SELECT count(foo), average(bar), max(baz) from Transaction Copy Decomposed: SELECT count(foo) from Transaction SELECT average(bar) from Transaction SELECT max(baz) from Transaction Copy COMPARE WITH The COMPARE WITH clause is used to compare the values for two different time ranges. This type of query is incompatible with NRQL alerting. We recommend using a Baseline Alert Condition to dynamically detect deviations for a particular signal. SLIDE BY The SLIDE BY clause supports a feature known as sliding windows. With sliding windows, SLIDE BY data is gathered into \"windows\" of time that overlap with each other. These windows can help to smooth out line graphs with a lot of variation in cases where the rolling aggregate (such as a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. Sliding windows are not currently supported in NRQL alerts. LIMIT In NRQL queries, the LIMIT clause is used to control the amount of data a query returns, either the maximum number of facet values returned by FACET queries or the maximum number of items returned by SELECT * queries. LIMIT is not compatible with NRQL alerting: evaluation is always performed on the full result set. NRQL alert threshold examples Here are some common use cases for NRQL alert conditions. These queries will work for static and baseline threshold types. The outlier threshold type will require additional FACET clauses. Alert on specific segments of your data Create constrained alerts that target a specific segment of your data, such as a few key customers or a range of data. Use the WHERE clause to define those conditions. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction WHERE account_id in (91290, 102021, 20230) Copy SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction WHERE name LIKE 'Controller/checkout/%' Copy Alert on Nth percentile of your data Create alerts when an Nth percentile of your data hits a specified threshold; for example, maintaining SLA service levels. Since we evaluate the NRQL query in one-minute time windows, percentiles will be calculated for each minute separately. SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentile(databaseDuration, 75) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on max, min, avg of your data Create alerts when your data hits a certain maximum, minimum, or average; for example, ensuring that a duration or response time does not pass a certain threshold. SELECT max(duration) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on a percentage of your data Create alerts when a proportion of your data goes above or below a certain threshold. SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE duration > 2) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE httpResponseCode = '500') FROM Transaction Copy Alert on Apdex with any T-value Create alerts on Apdex, applying your own T-value for certain transactions. For example, get an alert notification when your Apdex for a T-value of 500ms on transactions for production apps goes below 0.8. SELECT apdex(duration, t:0.5) FROM Transaction WHERE appName like '%prod%' Copy Alert conditions and query order of operations By default, the aggregation window is 1 minute, but you can change the window to suit your needs. Whatever the aggregation window, New Relic will collect data for that window using the function in the NRQL alert condition’s query. The query is parsed and executed by our systems in the following order: FROM clause – which event type needs to be grabbed? WHERE clause – what can be filtered out? SELECT clause – what information needs to be returned from the now-filtered data set? Example: null value returned Let's say this is your alert condition query: SELECT count(*) FROM SyntheticCheck WHERE monitorName = 'My Cool Monitor' AND result = 'FAILURE' Copy If there are no failures for the aggregation window: The system will execute the FROM clause by grabbing all SyntheticCheck events on your account. Then it will execute the WHERE clause to filter through those events by looking only for the ones that match the monitor name and result specified. If there are still events left to scan through after completing the FROM and WHERE operations, the SELECT clause will be executed. If there are no remaining events, the SELECT clause will not be executed. This means that aggregators like count() and uniqueCount() will never return a zero value. When there is a count of 0, the SELECT clause is ignored and no data is returned, resulting in a value of NULL. Example: zero value returned If you have a data source delivering legitimate numeric zeroes, the query will return zero values and not null values. Let's say this is your alert condition query, and that MyCoolEvent is an attribute that can sometimes return a zero value. SELECT average(MyCoolAttribute) FROM MyCoolEvent Copy If, in the aggregation window being evaluated, there's at least one instance of MyCoolEvent and if the average value of all MyCoolAttribute attributes from that window is equal to zero, then a 0 value will be returned. If there are no MyCoolEvent events during that minute, then a NULL will be returned due to the order of operations. Tip For more information about this topic, you can check out our blog post on troubleshooting for zero versus null values. Tip You can determine how null values will be handled by adjusting loss of signal and gap filling settings in the Alert Conditions UI. Tip You can avoid NULL values entirely with a query order of operations shortcut. Do this by using a filter sub-clause, then including all filter elements within that sub-clause. The main body of the query will run and return data, at which point the SELECT clause will then run and apply the filter elements. The query will return a value of 0 if the filter elements result in no matching data. Here's an example: SELECT filter(count(*), WHERE result = 'SUCCESS' AND monitorName = 'My Favorite Monitor') FROM SyntheticCheck Copy Nested aggregation NRQL alerts Nested aggregation queries are a powerful way to query your data. However, they have a few restrictions that are important to note. Nested queries with a non-faceted innermost query are not currently supported Without a FACET, the inner query produces a single result, giving the outer query nothing to aggregate. If you're using a nested query, make sure your inner query is faceted. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu) ​​​​​ Copy Queries at all levels must have the same aggregation window size With an alert aggregation window of 1 minute, the inner query would produce two smaller windows of 30 seconds. In theory, these two windows could be aggregated by the outer query. However, this is not currently supported. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu TIMESERIES 30 seconds)​​ Copy Signal loss is not yet supported for nested queries For more information on signal loss, see NerdGraph API: Loss of signal and gap filling. Nested queries containing 'WITH METRIC_FORMAT' in the inner query are not currently supported You can't use a nested query containing the WITH METRIC_FORMAT in the inner query to create NRQL alert conditions. NRQL condition creation tips Here are some tips for creating and using a NRQL condition: Topic Tips Condition threshold types NRQL condition threshold types include static, baseline, and outlier. Create a description For NRQL conditions, you can create a custom description to add to each violation. Descriptions can be enhanced with variable substitution based on metadata in the specific violation. For details, see Description Query results Queries must return a number. The condition evaluates the returned number against the thresholds you've set. Time period As with all alert conditions, NRQL conditions evaluate one single minute at a time. The implicit SINCE ... UNTIL clause specifying which minute to evaluate is controlled by your Evaluation offset setting. Since very recent data may be incomplete, you may want to query data from 3 minutes ago or longer, especially for: Applications that run on multiple hosts. SyntheticCheck data: Timeouts can take 3 minutes, so 5 minutes or more is recommended. Also, if a query will generate intermittent data, consider using the sum of query results option. Lost signal threshold (loss of signal detection) You can use loss of signal detection to alert on when your data (a telemetry signal) should be considered lost. A signal loss can indicate that a service or entity is no longer online or that a periodic job failed to run. You can also use this to make sure that violations for sporadic data, such as error counts, are closed when no signal is coming in. Advanced signal settings These settings give you options for better handling continuous, streaming data signals that may sometimes be missing. These settings include the aggregation window, the evaluation offset, and an option for filling data gaps. For more on using these, see Advanced signal settings. Condition settings Use the Condition settings to: Create a concise, descriptive condition name. Provide a custom violation description for the condition that will be included in violations and notifications. Add the runbook URL to include your organization's procedures for handling incidents. You may also add this information to the custom violation description. Limits on conditions See the maximum values. Health status NRQL alert conditions don't affect an entity's health status display. Examples For more information, see: Expected NRQL syntax Examples of NRQL condition queries Alert threshold types When you create a NRQL alert, you can choose from different types of thresholds: NRQL alert threshold types Description Static This is the simplest type of NRQL threshold. It allows you to create a condition based on a NRQL query that returns a numeric value. Optional: Include a FACET clause. Baseline (Dynamic) Uses a self-adjusting condition based on the past behavior of the monitored values. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type. Outlier Looks for group behavior and values that are outliers from those groups. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type, but requires a FACET clause. Sum of query results (limited or intermittent data) Important Available only for static (basic) threshold types. If a query returns intermittent or limited data, it may be difficult to set a meaningful threshold. Missing or limited data will sometimes generate false positives or false negatives. You can use loss of signal, aggregation duration, and gap filling settings to minimize these false notifications. To avoid this problem when using the static threshold type, you can set the selector to sum of query results. This lets you set the alert on an aggregated sum instead of a value from a single harvest cycle. Up to two hours of one-minute data checks can be aggregated. The duration you select determines the width of the rolling sum and the preview chart will update accordingly. Set the loss of signal threshold Loss of signal occurs when no data matches the NRQL condition over a specific period of time. You can set your loss of signal threshold duration and and also what happens when the threshold is crossed. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Loss of signal is only available for NRQL conditions. You may also manage these settings using the GraphQL API (recommended), or the REST API. Go here for specific GraphQL API examples. Loss of signal settings: Loss of signal settings include a time duration and two possible actions. Signal loss expiration time UI label: Signal is lost after: GraphQL Node: expiration.expirationDuration Expiration duration is a timer that starts and resets when we receive a data point in the streaming alerts pipeline. If we don't receive another data point before your 'expiration time' expires, we consider that signal to be lost. This can be because no data is being sent to New Relic or the WHERE clause of your NRQL query is filtering that data out before it is streamed to the alerts pipeline. The loss of signal expiration time is independent of the threshold duration and triggers as soon as the timer expires. The maximum expiration duration is 48 hours. This is helpful when monitoring for the execution of infrequent jobs. The minimum is 30 seconds, but we recommend using at least 3-5 minutes. Loss of signal actions Once a signal is considered lost, you can close open violations, open new violations, or both. Close all current open violations: This closes all open violations that are related to a specific signal. It won't necessarily close all violations for a condition. If you're alerting on an ephemeral service, or on a sporadic signal, you'll want to choose this action to ensure that violations are closed properly. The GraphQL node name for this is \"closeViolationsOnExpiration\" Open new violations: This will open a new violation when the signal is considered lost. These violations will indicate that they are due to a loss of signal. Based on your incident preferences, this should trigger a notification. The graphQL node name for this is \"openViolationOnExpiration\" When you enable both actions, we'll close all open violations first, and then open a new violation for loss of signal. To create a NRQL alert configured with loss of signal detection in the UI: For a policy, when you create a condition, under Select a product, click NRQL, then click Next, define thresholds. Write a NRQL query that returns the values you want to alert on. For Threshold type, select Static or Baseline. Click + Add lost signal threshold, then set the signal expiration duration time in minutes or seconds in the Signal is lost after field. Choose what you want to happen when the signal is lost. You can check one or both of Close all current open violations and Open new \"lost signal\" violation. These control how loss of signal violations will be handled for the condition. Make sure you name your condition before you save it. Violations open due to loss of signal close when the signal comes back. Newly opened lost signal violations will close immediately when new data is evaluated. the condition they belong to expires. By default, conditions expire after 3 days. you manually close the violation with the Close all current open violations option. Tip Loss of signal detection doesn't work on NRQL queries that use nested aggregation or sub-queries. Advanced signal settings When creating a NRQL alert condition, the advanced signal settings gives you better control over streaming alert data and helps you avoid false alarms. When creating a NRQL condition, there are several advanced signal settings: Aggregation window Evaluation offset Fill data gaps To read an explanation of what these settings are and how they relate to each other, see Streaming alerts concepts. Below are instructions and tips on how to configure them. Aggregation window You can set the aggregation window duration to choose how long data is accumulated in a streaming time window before it's aggregated. You can set it to anything between one second and 15 minutes. The default is one minute. Tip Baseline alert condition thresholds don't support editing the aggregation window. They use the 1 minute default. Evaluation offset You can adjust the evaluation offset to coordinate our streaming alerting algorithm with your data's latency. If it takes a while for your data to arrive, then you may need to increase the evaluation offset. The total supported latency is the product of the aggregation window duration multiplied by the evaluation offset. In the example screenshot above, the supported latency is 3 minutes (a 1-minute aggregation window multiplied by three windows). If the data type comes from an APM language agent and is aggregated from many app instances (for example, Transactions, TransactionErrors, etc.), we recommend using an evaluation offset of 3 with 1 minute aggregation windows. Important When creating NRQL conditions for data collected from Infrastructure Cloud Integrations such as AWS Cloudwatch or Azure, we recommend that you start with an evaluation offset of 15 minutes, then adjust up or down depending on how long it takes to collect your data. Fill data gaps Gap filling lets you customize the values to use when your signals don't have any data. You can fill gaps in your data streams with one of these settings: None: (Default) Choose this if you don't want to take any action on empty aggregation windows. On evaluation, an empty aggregation window will reset the threshold duration timer. For example, if a condition says that all aggregation windows must have data points above the threshold for 5 minutes, and 1 of the 5 aggregation windows is empty, then the condition won't be in violation. Custom static value: Choose this if you'd like to insert a custom static value into the empty aggregation windows before they're evaluated. This option has an additional, required parameter of fillValue (as named in the API) that specifies what static value should be used. This defaults to 0. Last known value: This option inserts the last seen value before evaluation occurs. We maintain the state of the last seen value for 2 hours. Tip The alerts system fills gaps in actively reported signals. This signal history is dropped after 2 hours of inactivity. For gap filling, data points received after this period of inactivity are treated as new signals. To learn more about signal loss, gap filling, and how to request access to these features, see this Explorers Hub post. Options for editing data gap settings: In the NRQL conditions UI, go to Condition settings > Advanced signal settings > fill data gaps with and choose an option. If using our Nerdgraph API (preferred), this node is located at: actor : account : alerts : nrqlCondition : signal : fillOption | fillValue NerdGraph is our recommended API for this but if you're using our REST API, you can find this setting in the REST API explorer under the \"signal\" section of the Alert NRQL conditions API.",

      "body": "Applied Intelligence (AI) is our AIOps solution for DevOps, site reliability engineers, and on-call teams. At its core, Applied Intelligence helps you find, troubleshoot, and resolve problems more quickly. Specifically, it’s a hybrid machine learning engine that reduces alert noise, correlates incidents, and automatically detects anomalies. By applying machine learning to your data and feedback, Applied Intelligence is designed to improve functionality and deliver smarter context over time. After connecting your data sources to Applied Intelligence, it looks for potential problems and improves based on your feedback. Why use Applied Intelligence? How you respond to an incident can mean thousands of dollars or clicks for your company. Applied Intelligence helps you solve problems faster. Feature Description Troubleshoot and respond to incidents Our solution helps you understand your incidents and gives you ideas for what to do next. Here are a few examples: Automatically classifies incidents based on the golden signals of site reliability engineering. Identifies entities in your stack that may relate to the underlying issue. Suggests responses for incidents based on historical context. Less noise, more focus As tools and systems become more complex, alert noise can overwhelm DevOps and SRE teams. Applied Intelligence correlates related incidents and suppresses noise, so you're only notified when human action is required. Incidents with a hybrid approach Applied Intelligence streamlines your incidents by combining its built-in inputs with your knowledge and feedback. Over time, the system delivers more accurate insights. For example: Our correlation and classification engine adjusts based on your feedback. The system automatically suggests new correlation rules based on your production data. You can create custom logic using the decision builder. Automatic anomaly detection Applied Intelligence provides automatic anomaly detection on all your APM-monitored applications. We detect anomalies in throughput, latency, and error rate, with no action required from you. Benefits include: No setup required. See anomalies surfaced automatically in the anomalies feed. See them in various New Relic activity streams (for example, on the New Relic One home page). Ability to run NRQL queries of anomalies and create custom dashboards with that data. Determine root causes with Incident Intelligence As part of Applied Intelligence, Incident Intelligence helps you correlate incident events and reduce noise in your environment. With it, you can get an overview of all your issues, see suggested responders, and configure your own correlation logic. To get started, see Incident Intelligence. Find unknowns with Proactive Detection Another feature of Applied Intelligence is Proactive Detection. Proactive Detection is, by default, always on and detecting anomalies. These anomalies are surfaced in the Applied Intelligence anomalies feed, New Relic One activity streams, and can be queried, alerted on, and added to dashboards. Anomalies can be sent to Slack or via webhooks, and/or added as a source for Incident Intelligence correlation and issue notification. Proactive Detection also provides automatic analysis of anomalies and alerts via the analysis page. To get started, see Proactive Detection.",

      "body": "You can use NRQL queries to create alert conditions. Once you've defined your signal, you can further define your warning and critical threshold levels. This determines when an alerts violation is created. Read on to learn more about how to do this. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Click NRQL, and then Next, define thresholds. Tip For more information on key concepts relating to NRQL alert conditions and streaming alerts, see Streaming alerts: key terms and concepts. Create a NRQL alert condition To create a NRQL alert condition for a policy: On one.newrelic.com, in the header click Alerts & AI, then in the left sidebar click Policies. Select an existing policy or click New alert policy to create a new policy. Click Add a condition. Under Select a product click NRQL, and then click Next, define thresholds. Create a condition from a chart You can use a chart to create a NRQL alert condition. To create a NRQL alerts condition from a chart, click the chart menu , then click Create alert condition. Once you've named and customized your condition, you can add it to an existing policy or create a new one. Caution A small number of our older charts don't include the option to create an alert condition. NRQL alert syntax Here's the basic syntax for creating all NRQL alert conditions. The FACET clause is required for outlier threshold types. It's optional for static and baseline. SELECT function(attribute) FROM Event WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Copy Clause Notes SELECT function(attribute) Required Supported functions that return numbers include: apdex average count latest max min percentage percentile sum uniqueCount Tip If you use the percentile aggregator in a faceted alert condition with many facets, this may cause the following error to appear: An error occurred while fetching chart data. If you see this error, use average instead. FROM data type Required Only one data type can be targeted. Supported data types: Event Metric (RAW data points will be returned) WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Use the WHERE clause to specify a series of one or more conditions. All the operators are supported. FACET attribute Required for outlier conditions Include an optional FACET clause in your NRQL syntax depending on the threshold type: static or baseline. Use the FACET clause to separate your results by attribute and alert on each attribute independently. No LIMIT clause is allowed, but all queries will receive the maximum number of facets possible. Faceted queries can return a maximum of 5000 values for static and baseline conditions and a maximum of 500 values for outlier conditions. Important If the query returns more than the maximum number of values, the alert condition can't be created. If you create the condition and the query returns more than this number later, the alert will fail. Modify your query so that it returns a fewer number of values. Reformatting incompatible NRQL Some elements of NRQL used in charts don’t make sense in the streaming context of alerts. Here’s a list of the most common incompatible elements and suggestions for reformatting a NRQL alert query to achieve the same effect. Element Notes SINCE and UNTIL Example: SELECT percentile(largestContentfulPaint, 75) FROM PageViewTiming WHERE (appId = 837807) SINCE yesterday Copy NRQL Alerting produces a never-ending stream of windowed query results, so the SINCE and UNTIL keywords to scope the query to a point in time are not compatible. As a convenience, we automatically strip SINCE and UNTIL from a query when creating a NRQL Alert Condition from the context of a chart. TIMESERIES In NRQL queries, the TIMESERIES clause is used to return data as a time series broken out by a specified period of time. For NRQL alerts, the equivalent property of a signal is the aggregation window. histogram() The histogram() aggregation function is used to generate histograms. histogram() is not compatible with NRQL alerting: histogram aggregations can not be formatted as a time series. To create an alert from a portion of a histogram (e.g. 95th percentile), use the percentile() aggregation function. Multiple Aggregation Functions Each alert condition can only target a single aggregated stream of data. To alert on multiple streams simultaneously, you’ll need to decompose them into individual conditions within the same policy. Original Query: SELECT count(foo), average(bar), max(baz) from Transaction Copy Decomposed: SELECT count(foo) from Transaction SELECT average(bar) from Transaction SELECT max(baz) from Transaction Copy COMPARE WITH The COMPARE WITH clause is used to compare the values for two different time ranges. This type of query is incompatible with NRQL alerting. We recommend using a Baseline Alert Condition to dynamically detect deviations for a particular signal. SLIDE BY The SLIDE BY clause supports a feature known as sliding windows. With sliding windows, SLIDE BY data is gathered into \"windows\" of time that overlap with each other. These windows can help to smooth out line graphs with a lot of variation in cases where the rolling aggregate (such as a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. Sliding windows are not currently supported in NRQL alerts. LIMIT In NRQL queries, the LIMIT clause is used to control the amount of data a query returns, either the maximum number of facet values returned by FACET queries or the maximum number of items returned by SELECT * queries. LIMIT is not compatible with NRQL alerting: evaluation is always performed on the full result set. NRQL alert threshold examples Here are some common use cases for NRQL alert conditions. These queries will work for static and baseline threshold types. The outlier threshold type will require additional FACET clauses. Alert on specific segments of your data Create constrained alerts that target a specific segment of your data, such as a few key customers or a range of data. Use the WHERE clause to define those conditions. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction WHERE account_id in (91290, 102021, 20230) Copy SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction WHERE name LIKE 'Controller/checkout/%' Copy Alert on Nth percentile of your data Create alerts when an Nth percentile of your data hits a specified threshold; for example, maintaining SLA service levels. Since we evaluate the NRQL query in one-minute time windows, percentiles will be calculated for each minute separately. SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentile(databaseDuration, 75) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on max, min, avg of your data Create alerts when your data hits a certain maximum, minimum, or average; for example, ensuring that a duration or response time does not pass a certain threshold. SELECT max(duration) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on a percentage of your data Create alerts when a proportion of your data goes above or below a certain threshold. SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE duration > 2) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE httpResponseCode = '500') FROM Transaction Copy Alert on Apdex with any T-value Create alerts on Apdex, applying your own T-value for certain transactions. For example, get an alert notification when your Apdex for a T-value of 500ms on transactions for production apps goes below 0.8. SELECT apdex(duration, t:0.5) FROM Transaction WHERE appName like '%prod%' Copy Alert conditions and query order of operations By default, the aggregation window is 1 minute, but you can change the window to suit your needs. Whatever the aggregation window, New Relic will collect data for that window using the function in the NRQL alert condition’s query. The query is parsed and executed by our systems in the following order: FROM clause – which event type needs to be grabbed? WHERE clause – what can be filtered out? SELECT clause – what information needs to be returned from the now-filtered data set? Example: null value returned Let's say this is your alert condition query: SELECT count(*) FROM SyntheticCheck WHERE monitorName = 'My Cool Monitor' AND result = 'FAILURE' Copy If there are no failures for the aggregation window: The system will execute the FROM clause by grabbing all SyntheticCheck events on your account. Then it will execute the WHERE clause to filter through those events by looking only for the ones that match the monitor name and result specified. If there are still events left to scan through after completing the FROM and WHERE operations, the SELECT clause will be executed. If there are no remaining events, the SELECT clause will not be executed. This means that aggregators like count() and uniqueCount() will never return a zero value. When there is a count of 0, the SELECT clause is ignored and no data is returned, resulting in a value of NULL. Example: zero value returned If you have a data source delivering legitimate numeric zeroes, the query will return zero values and not null values. Let's say this is your alert condition query, and that MyCoolEvent is an attribute that can sometimes return a zero value. SELECT average(MyCoolAttribute) FROM MyCoolEvent Copy If, in the aggregation window being evaluated, there's at least one instance of MyCoolEvent and if the average value of all MyCoolAttribute attributes from that window is equal to zero, then a 0 value will be returned. If there are no MyCoolEvent events during that minute, then a NULL will be returned due to the order of operations. Tip For more information about this topic, you can check out our blog post on troubleshooting for zero versus null values. Tip You can determine how null values will be handled by adjusting loss of signal and gap filling settings in the Alert Conditions UI. Tip You can avoid NULL values entirely with a query order of operations shortcut. Do this by using a filter sub-clause, then including all filter elements within that sub-clause. The main body of the query will run and return data, at which point the SELECT clause will then run and apply the filter elements. The query will return a value of 0 if the filter elements result in no matching data. Here's an example: SELECT filter(count(*), WHERE result = 'SUCCESS' AND monitorName = 'My Favorite Monitor') FROM SyntheticCheck Copy Nested aggregation NRQL alerts Nested aggregation queries are a powerful way to query your data. However, they have a few restrictions that are important to note. Nested queries with a non-faceted innermost query are not currently supported Without a FACET, the inner query produces a single result, giving the outer query nothing to aggregate. If you're using a nested query, make sure your inner query is faceted. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu) ​​​​​ Copy Queries at all levels must have the same aggregation window size With an alert aggregation window of 1 minute, the inner query would produce two smaller windows of 30 seconds. In theory, these two windows could be aggregated by the outer query. However, this is not currently supported. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu TIMESERIES 30 seconds)​​ Copy Signal loss is not yet supported for nested queries For more information on signal loss, see NerdGraph API: Loss of signal and gap filling. Nested queries containing 'WITH METRIC_FORMAT' in the inner query are not currently supported You can't use a nested query containing the WITH METRIC_FORMAT in the inner query to create NRQL alert conditions. NRQL condition creation tips Here are some tips for creating and using a NRQL condition: Topic Tips Condition threshold types NRQL condition threshold types include static, baseline, and outlier. Create a description For NRQL conditions, you can create a custom description to add to each violation. Descriptions can be enhanced with variable substitution based on metadata in the specific violation. For details, see Description Query results Queries must return a number. The condition evaluates the returned number against the thresholds you've set. Time period As with all alert conditions, NRQL conditions evaluate one single minute at a time. The implicit SINCE ... UNTIL clause specifying which minute to evaluate is controlled by your Evaluation offset setting. Since very recent data may be incomplete, you may want to query data from 3 minutes ago or longer, especially for: Applications that run on multiple hosts. SyntheticCheck data: Timeouts can take 3 minutes, so 5 minutes or more is recommended. Also, if a query will generate intermittent data, consider using the sum of query results option. Lost signal threshold (loss of signal detection) You can use loss of signal detection to alert on when your data (a telemetry signal) should be considered lost. A signal loss can indicate that a service or entity is no longer online or that a periodic job failed to run. You can also use this to make sure that violations for sporadic data, such as error counts, are closed when no signal is coming in. Advanced signal settings These settings give you options for better handling continuous, streaming data signals that may sometimes be missing. These settings include the aggregation window, the evaluation offset, and an option for filling data gaps. For more on using these, see Advanced signal settings. Condition settings Use the Condition settings to: Create a concise, descriptive condition name. Provide a custom violation description for the condition that will be included in violations and notifications. Add the runbook URL to include your organization's procedures for handling incidents. You may also add this information to the custom violation description. Limits on conditions See the maximum values. Health status NRQL alert conditions don't affect an entity's health status display. Examples For more information, see: Expected NRQL syntax Examples of NRQL condition queries Alert threshold types When you create a NRQL alert, you can choose from different types of thresholds: NRQL alert threshold types Description Static This is the simplest type of NRQL threshold. It allows you to create a condition based on a NRQL query that returns a numeric value. Optional: Include a FACET clause. Baseline (Dynamic) Uses a self-adjusting condition based on the past behavior of the monitored values. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type. Outlier Looks for group behavior and values that are outliers from those groups. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type, but requires a FACET clause. Sum of query results (limited or intermittent data) Important Available only for static (basic) threshold types. If a query returns intermittent or limited data, it may be difficult to set a meaningful threshold. Missing or limited data will sometimes generate false positives or false negatives. You can use loss of signal, aggregation duration, and gap filling settings to minimize these false notifications. To avoid this problem when using the static threshold type, you can set the selector to sum of query results. This lets you set the alert on an aggregated sum instead of a value from a single harvest cycle. Up to two hours of one-minute data checks can be aggregated. The duration you select determines the width of the rolling sum and the preview chart will update accordingly. Set the loss of signal threshold Loss of signal occurs when no data matches the NRQL condition over a specific period of time. You can set your loss of signal threshold duration and and also what happens when the threshold is crossed. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Loss of signal is only available for NRQL conditions. You may also manage these settings using the GraphQL API (recommended), or the REST API. Go here for specific GraphQL API examples. Loss of signal settings: Loss of signal settings include a time duration and two possible actions. Signal loss expiration time UI label: Signal is lost after: GraphQL Node: expiration.expirationDuration Expiration duration is a timer that starts and resets when we receive a data point in the streaming alerts pipeline. If we don't receive another data point before your 'expiration time' expires, we consider that signal to be lost. This can be because no data is being sent to New Relic or the WHERE clause of your NRQL query is filtering that data out before it is streamed to the alerts pipeline. The loss of signal expiration time is independent of the threshold duration and triggers as soon as the timer expires. The maximum expiration duration is 48 hours. This is helpful when monitoring for the execution of infrequent jobs. The minimum is 30 seconds, but we recommend using at least 3-5 minutes. Loss of signal actions Once a signal is considered lost, you can close open violations, open new violations, or both. Close all current open violations: This closes all open violations that are related to a specific signal. It won't necessarily close all violations for a condition. If you're alerting on an ephemeral service, or on a sporadic signal, you'll want to choose this action to ensure that violations are closed properly. The GraphQL node name for this is \"closeViolationsOnExpiration\" Open new violations: This will open a new violation when the signal is considered lost. These violations will indicate that they are due to a loss of signal. Based on your incident preferences, this should trigger a notification. The graphQL node name for this is \"openViolationOnExpiration\" When you enable both actions, we'll close all open violations first, and then open a new violation for loss of signal. To create a NRQL alert configured with loss of signal detection in the UI: For a policy, when you create a condition, under Select a product, click NRQL, then click Next, define thresholds. Write a NRQL query that returns the values you want to alert on. For Threshold type, select Static or Baseline. Click + Add lost signal threshold, then set the signal expiration duration time in minutes or seconds in the Signal is lost after field. Choose what you want to happen when the signal is lost. You can check one or both of Close all current open violations and Open new \"lost signal\" violation. These control how loss of signal violations will be handled for the condition. Make sure you name your condition before you save it. Violations open due to loss of signal close when the signal comes back. Newly opened lost signal violations will close immediately when new data is evaluated. the condition they belong to expires. By default, conditions expire after 3 days. you manually close the violation with the Close all current open violations option. Tip Loss of signal detection doesn't work on NRQL queries that use nested aggregation or sub-queries. Advanced signal settings When creating a NRQL alert condition, the advanced signal settings gives you better control over streaming alert data and helps you avoid false alarms. When creating a NRQL condition, there are several advanced signal settings: Aggregation window Evaluation offset Fill data gaps To read an explanation of what these settings are and how they relate to each other, see Streaming alerts concepts. Below are instructions and tips on how to configure them. Aggregation window You can set the aggregation window duration to choose how long data is accumulated in a streaming time window before it's aggregated. You can set it to anything between one second and 15 minutes. The default is one minute. Tip Baseline alert condition thresholds don't support editing the aggregation window. They use the 1 minute default. Evaluation offset You can adjust the evaluation offset to coordinate our streaming alerting algorithm with your data's latency. If it takes a while for your data to arrive, then you may need to increase the evaluation offset. The total supported latency is the product of the aggregation window duration multiplied by the evaluation offset. In the example screenshot above, the supported latency is 3 minutes (a 1-minute aggregation window multiplied by three windows). If the data type comes from an APM language agent and is aggregated from many app instances (for example, Transactions, TransactionErrors, etc.), we recommend using an evaluation offset of 3 with 1 minute aggregation windows. Important When creating NRQL conditions for data collected from Infrastructure Cloud Integrations such as AWS Cloudwatch or Azure, we recommend that you start with an evaluation offset of 15 minutes, then adjust up or down depending on how long it takes to collect your data. Fill data gaps Gap filling lets you customize the values to use when your signals don't have any data. You can fill gaps in your data streams with one of these settings: None: (Default) Choose this if you don't want to take any action on empty aggregation windows. On evaluation, an empty aggregation window will reset the threshold duration timer. For example, if a condition says that all aggregation windows must have data points above the threshold for 5 minutes, and 1 of the 5 aggregation windows is empty, then the condition won't be in violation. Custom static value: Choose this if you'd like to insert a custom static value into the empty aggregation windows before they're evaluated. This option has an additional, required parameter of fillValue (as named in the API) that specifies what static value should be used. This defaults to 0. Last known value: This option inserts the last seen value before evaluation occurs. We maintain the state of the last seen value for 2 hours. Tip The alerts system fills gaps in actively reported signals. This signal history is dropped after 2 hours of inactivity. For gap filling, data points received after this period of inactivity are treated as new signals. To learn more about signal loss, gap filling, and how to request access to these features, see this Explorers Hub post. Options for editing data gap settings: In the NRQL conditions UI, go to Condition settings > Advanced signal settings > fill data gaps with and choose an option. If using our Nerdgraph API (preferred), this node is located at: actor : account : alerts : nrqlCondition : signal : fillOption | fillValue NerdGraph is our recommended API for this but if you're using our REST API, you can find this setting in the REST API explorer under the \"signal\" section of the Alert NRQL conditions API.",

      "body": "You can use NRQL queries to create alert conditions. Once you've defined your signal, you can further define your warning and critical threshold levels. This determines when an alerts violation is created. Read on to learn more about how to do this. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Click NRQL, and then Next, define thresholds. Tip For more information on key concepts relating to NRQL alert conditions and streaming alerts, see Streaming alerts: key terms and concepts. Create a NRQL alert condition To create a NRQL alert condition for a policy: On one.newrelic.com, in the header click Alerts & AI, then in the left sidebar click Policies. Select an existing policy or click New alert policy to create a new policy. Click Add a condition. Under Select a product click NRQL, and then click Next, define thresholds. Create a condition from a chart You can use a chart to create a NRQL alert condition. To create a NRQL alerts condition from a chart, click the chart menu , then click Create alert condition. Once you've named and customized your condition, you can add it to an existing policy or create a new one. Caution A small number of our older charts don't include the option to create an alert condition. NRQL alert syntax Here's the basic syntax for creating all NRQL alert conditions. The FACET clause is required for outlier threshold types. It's optional for static and baseline. SELECT function(attribute) FROM Event WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Copy Clause Notes SELECT function(attribute) Required Supported functions that return numbers include: apdex average count latest max min percentage percentile sum uniqueCount Tip If you use the percentile aggregator in a faceted alert condition with many facets, this may cause the following error to appear: An error occurred while fetching chart data. If you see this error, use average instead. FROM data type Required Only one data type can be targeted. Supported data types: Event Metric (RAW data points will be returned) WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Use the WHERE clause to specify a series of one or more conditions. All the operators are supported. FACET attribute Required for outlier conditions Include an optional FACET clause in your NRQL syntax depending on the threshold type: static or baseline. Use the FACET clause to separate your results by attribute and alert on each attribute independently. No LIMIT clause is allowed, but all queries will receive the maximum number of facets possible. Faceted queries can return a maximum of 5000 values for static and baseline conditions and a maximum of 500 values for outlier conditions. Important If the query returns more than the maximum number of values, the alert condition can't be created. If you create the condition and the query returns more than this number later, the alert will fail. Modify your query so that it returns a fewer number of values. Reformatting incompatible NRQL Some elements of NRQL used in charts don’t make sense in the streaming context of alerts. Here’s a list of the most common incompatible elements and suggestions for reformatting a NRQL alert query to achieve the same effect. Element Notes SINCE and UNTIL Example: SELECT percentile(largestContentfulPaint, 75) FROM PageViewTiming WHERE (appId = 837807) SINCE yesterday Copy NRQL Alerting produces a never-ending stream of windowed query results, so the SINCE and UNTIL keywords to scope the query to a point in time are not compatible. As a convenience, we automatically strip SINCE and UNTIL from a query when creating a NRQL Alert Condition from the context of a chart. TIMESERIES In NRQL queries, the TIMESERIES clause is used to return data as a time series broken out by a specified period of time. For NRQL alerts, the equivalent property of a signal is the aggregation window. histogram() The histogram() aggregation function is used to generate histograms. histogram() is not compatible with NRQL alerting: histogram aggregations can not be formatted as a time series. To create an alert from a portion of a histogram (e.g. 95th percentile), use the percentile() aggregation function. Multiple Aggregation Functions Each alert condition can only target a single aggregated stream of data. To alert on multiple streams simultaneously, you’ll need to decompose them into individual conditions within the same policy. Original Query: SELECT count(foo), average(bar), max(baz) from Transaction Copy Decomposed: SELECT count(foo) from Transaction SELECT average(bar) from Transaction SELECT max(baz) from Transaction Copy COMPARE WITH The COMPARE WITH clause is used to compare the values for two different time ranges. This type of query is incompatible with NRQL alerting. We recommend using a Baseline Alert Condition to dynamically detect deviations for a particular signal. SLIDE BY The SLIDE BY clause supports a feature known as sliding windows. With sliding windows, SLIDE BY data is gathered into \"windows\" of time that overlap with each other. These windows can help to smooth out line graphs with a lot of variation in cases where the rolling aggregate (such as a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. Sliding windows are not currently supported in NRQL alerts. LIMIT In NRQL queries, the LIMIT clause is used to control the amount of data a query returns, either the maximum number of facet values returned by FACET queries or the maximum number of items returned by SELECT * queries. LIMIT is not compatible with NRQL alerting: evaluation is always performed on the full result set. NRQL alert threshold examples Here are some common use cases for NRQL alert conditions. These queries will work for static and baseline threshold types. The outlier threshold type will require additional FACET clauses. Alert on specific segments of your data Create constrained alerts that target a specific segment of your data, such as a few key customers or a range of data. Use the WHERE clause to define those conditions. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction WHERE account_id in (91290, 102021, 20230) Copy SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction WHERE name LIKE 'Controller/checkout/%' Copy Alert on Nth percentile of your data Create alerts when an Nth percentile of your data hits a specified threshold; for example, maintaining SLA service levels. Since we evaluate the NRQL query in one-minute time windows, percentiles will be calculated for each minute separately. SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentile(databaseDuration, 75) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on max, min, avg of your data Create alerts when your data hits a certain maximum, minimum, or average; for example, ensuring that a duration or response time does not pass a certain threshold. SELECT max(duration) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on a percentage of your data Create alerts when a proportion of your data goes above or below a certain threshold. SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE duration > 2) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE httpResponseCode = '500') FROM Transaction Copy Alert on Apdex with any T-value Create alerts on Apdex, applying your own T-value for certain transactions. For example, get an alert notification when your Apdex for a T-value of 500ms on transactions for production apps goes below 0.8. SELECT apdex(duration, t:0.5) FROM Transaction WHERE appName like '%prod%' Copy Alert conditions and query order of operations By default, the aggregation window is 1 minute, but you can change the window to suit your needs. Whatever the aggregation window, New Relic will collect data for that window using the function in the NRQL alert condition’s query. The query is parsed and executed by our systems in the following order: FROM clause – which event type needs to be grabbed? WHERE clause – what can be filtered out? SELECT clause – what information needs to be returned from the now-filtered data set? Example: null value returned Let's say this is your alert condition query: SELECT count(*) FROM SyntheticCheck WHERE monitorName = 'My Cool Monitor' AND result = 'FAILURE' Copy If there are no failures for the aggregation window: The system will execute the FROM clause by grabbing all SyntheticCheck events on your account. Then it will execute the WHERE clause to filter through those events by looking only for the ones that match the monitor name and result specified. If there are still events left to scan through after completing the FROM and WHERE operations, the SELECT clause will be executed. If there are no remaining events, the SELECT clause will not be executed. This means that aggregators like count() and uniqueCount() will never return a zero value. When there is a count of 0, the SELECT clause is ignored and no data is returned, resulting in a value of NULL. Example: zero value returned If you have a data source delivering legitimate numeric zeroes, the query will return zero values and not null values. Let's say this is your alert condition query, and that MyCoolEvent is an attribute that can sometimes return a zero value. SELECT average(MyCoolAttribute) FROM MyCoolEvent Copy If, in the aggregation window being evaluated, there's at least one instance of MyCoolEvent and if the average value of all MyCoolAttribute attributes from that window is equal to zero, then a 0 value will be returned. If there are no MyCoolEvent events during that minute, then a NULL will be returned due to the order of operations. Tip For more information about this topic, you can check out our blog post on troubleshooting for zero versus null values. Tip You can determine how null values will be handled by adjusting loss of signal and gap filling settings in the Alert Conditions UI. Tip You can avoid NULL values entirely with a query order of operations shortcut. Do this by using a filter sub-clause, then including all filter elements within that sub-clause. The main body of the query will run and return data, at which point the SELECT clause will then run and apply the filter elements. The query will return a value of 0 if the filter elements result in no matching data. Here's an example: SELECT filter(count(*), WHERE result = 'SUCCESS' AND monitorName = 'My Favorite Monitor') FROM SyntheticCheck Copy Nested aggregation NRQL alerts Nested aggregation queries are a powerful way to query your data. However, they have a few restrictions that are important to note. Nested queries with a non-faceted innermost query are not currently supported Without a FACET, the inner query produces a single result, giving the outer query nothing to aggregate. If you're using a nested query, make sure your inner query is faceted. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu) ​​​​​ Copy Queries at all levels must have the same aggregation window size With an alert aggregation window of 1 minute, the inner query would produce two smaller windows of 30 seconds. In theory, these two windows could be aggregated by the outer query. However, this is not currently supported. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu TIMESERIES 30 seconds)​​ Copy Signal loss is not yet supported for nested queries For more information on signal loss, see NerdGraph API: Loss of signal and gap filling. Nested queries containing 'WITH METRIC_FORMAT' in the inner query are not currently supported You can't use a nested query containing the WITH METRIC_FORMAT in the inner query to create NRQL alert conditions. NRQL condition creation tips Here are some tips for creating and using a NRQL condition: Topic Tips Condition threshold types NRQL condition threshold types include static, baseline, and outlier. Create a description For NRQL conditions, you can create a custom description to add to each violation. Descriptions can be enhanced with variable substitution based on metadata in the specific violation. For details, see Description Query results Queries must return a number. The condition evaluates the returned number against the thresholds you've set. Time period As with all alert conditions, NRQL conditions evaluate one single minute at a time. The implicit SINCE ... UNTIL clause specifying which minute to evaluate is controlled by your Evaluation offset setting. Since very recent data may be incomplete, you may want to query data from 3 minutes ago or longer, especially for: Applications that run on multiple hosts. SyntheticCheck data: Timeouts can take 3 minutes, so 5 minutes or more is recommended. Also, if a query will generate intermittent data, consider using the sum of query results option. Lost signal threshold (loss of signal detection) You can use loss of signal detection to alert on when your data (a telemetry signal) should be considered lost. A signal loss can indicate that a service or entity is no longer online or that a periodic job failed to run. You can also use this to make sure that violations for sporadic data, such as error counts, are closed when no signal is coming in. Advanced signal settings These settings give you options for better handling continuous, streaming data signals that may sometimes be missing. These settings include the aggregation window, the evaluation offset, and an option for filling data gaps. For more on using these, see Advanced signal settings. Condition settings Use the Condition settings to: Create a concise, descriptive condition name. Provide a custom violation description for the condition that will be included in violations and notifications. Add the runbook URL to include your organization's procedures for handling incidents. You may also add this information to the custom violation description. Limits on conditions See the maximum values. Health status NRQL alert conditions don't affect an entity's health status display. Examples For more information, see: Expected NRQL syntax Examples of NRQL condition queries Alert threshold types When you create a NRQL alert, you can choose from different types of thresholds: NRQL alert threshold types Description Static This is the simplest type of NRQL threshold. It allows you to create a condition based on a NRQL query that returns a numeric value. Optional: Include a FACET clause. Baseline (Dynamic) Uses a self-adjusting condition based on the past behavior of the monitored values. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type. Outlier Looks for group behavior and values that are outliers from those groups. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type, but requires a FACET clause. Sum of query results (limited or intermittent data) Important Available only for static (basic) threshold types. If a query returns intermittent or limited data, it may be difficult to set a meaningful threshold. Missing or limited data will sometimes generate false positives or false negatives. You can use loss of signal, aggregation duration, and gap filling settings to minimize these false notifications. To avoid this problem when using the static threshold type, you can set the selector to sum of query results. This lets you set the alert on an aggregated sum instead of a value from a single harvest cycle. Up to two hours of one-minute data checks can be aggregated. The duration you select determines the width of the rolling sum and the preview chart will update accordingly. Set the loss of signal threshold Loss of signal occurs when no data matches the NRQL condition over a specific period of time. You can set your loss of signal threshold duration and and also what happens when the threshold is crossed. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Loss of signal is only available for NRQL conditions. You may also manage these settings using the GraphQL API (recommended), or the REST API. Go here for specific GraphQL API examples. Loss of signal settings: Loss of signal settings include a time duration and two possible actions. Signal loss expiration time UI label: Signal is lost after: GraphQL Node: expiration.expirationDuration Expiration duration is a timer that starts and resets when we receive a data point in the streaming alerts pipeline. If we don't receive another data point before your 'expiration time' expires, we consider that signal to be lost. This can be because no data is being sent to New Relic or the WHERE clause of your NRQL query is filtering that data out before it is streamed to the alerts pipeline. The loss of signal expiration time is independent of the threshold duration and triggers as soon as the timer expires. The maximum expiration duration is 48 hours. This is helpful when monitoring for the execution of infrequent jobs. The minimum is 30 seconds, but we recommend using at least 3-5 minutes. Loss of signal actions Once a signal is considered lost, you can close open violations, open new violations, or both. Close all current open violations: This closes all open violations that are related to a specific signal. It won't necessarily close all violations for a condition. If you're alerting on an ephemeral service, or on a sporadic signal, you'll want to choose this action to ensure that violations are closed properly. The GraphQL node name for this is \"closeViolationsOnExpiration\" Open new violations: This will open a new violation when the signal is considered lost. These violations will indicate that they are due to a loss of signal. Based on your incident preferences, this should trigger a notification. The graphQL node name for this is \"openViolationOnExpiration\" When you enable both actions, we'll close all open violations first, and then open a new violation for loss of signal. To create a NRQL alert configured with loss of signal detection in the UI: For a policy, when you create a condition, under Select a product, click NRQL, then click Next, define thresholds. Write a NRQL query that returns the values you want to alert on. For Threshold type, select Static or Baseline. Click + Add lost signal threshold, then set the signal expiration duration time in minutes or seconds in the Signal is lost after field. Choose what you want to happen when the signal is lost. You can check one or both of Close all current open violations and Open new \"lost signal\" violation. These control how loss of signal violations will be handled for the condition. Make sure you name your condition before you save it. Violations open due to loss of signal close when the signal comes back. Newly opened lost signal violations will close immediately when new data is evaluated. the condition they belong to expires. By default, conditions expire after 3 days. you manually close the violation with the Close all current open violations option. Tip Loss of signal detection doesn't work on NRQL queries that use nested aggregation or sub-queries. Advanced signal settings When creating a NRQL alert condition, the advanced signal settings gives you better control over streaming alert data and helps you avoid false alarms. When creating a NRQL condition, there are several advanced signal settings: Aggregation window Evaluation offset Fill data gaps To read an explanation of what these settings are and how they relate to each other, see Streaming alerts concepts. Below are instructions and tips on how to configure them. Aggregation window You can set the aggregation window duration to choose how long data is accumulated in a streaming time window before it's aggregated. You can set it to anything between one second and 15 minutes. The default is one minute. Tip Baseline alert condition thresholds don't support editing the aggregation window. They use the 1 minute default. Evaluation offset You can adjust the evaluation offset to coordinate our streaming alerting algorithm with your data's latency. If it takes a while for your data to arrive, then you may need to increase the evaluation offset. The total supported latency is the product of the aggregation window duration multiplied by the evaluation offset. In the example screenshot above, the supported latency is 3 minutes (a 1-minute aggregation window multiplied by three windows). If the data type comes from an APM language agent and is aggregated from many app instances (for example, Transactions, TransactionErrors, etc.), we recommend using an evaluation offset of 3 with 1 minute aggregation windows. Important When creating NRQL conditions for data collected from Infrastructure Cloud Integrations such as AWS Cloudwatch or Azure, we recommend that you start with an evaluation offset of 15 minutes, then adjust up or down depending on how long it takes to collect your data. Fill data gaps Gap filling lets you customize the values to use when your signals don't have any data. You can fill gaps in your data streams with one of these settings: None: (Default) Choose this if you don't want to take any action on empty aggregation windows. On evaluation, an empty aggregation window will reset the threshold duration timer. For example, if a condition says that all aggregation windows must have data points above the threshold for 5 minutes, and 1 of the 5 aggregation windows is empty, then the condition won't be in violation. Custom static value: Choose this if you'd like to insert a custom static value into the empty aggregation windows before they're evaluated. This option has an additional, required parameter of fillValue (as named in the API) that specifies what static value should be used. This defaults to 0. Last known value: This option inserts the last seen value before evaluation occurs. We maintain the state of the last seen value for 2 hours. Tip The alerts system fills gaps in actively reported signals. This signal history is dropped after 2 hours of inactivity. For gap filling, data points received after this period of inactivity are treated as new signals.

      "body": "This document explains the different ways violations can be closed. How violations automatically close A violation will automatically close when the targeted signal returns to a non-violating state for the time period indicated in the condition's thresholds. This wait time is called the recovery period. For example: If the violating behavior is \"Apdex score below 0.80 at least once in 5 minutes,\" then the violation will automatically close when the Apdex score is equal to or higher than .80 for 5 consecutive minutes. The same applies to a \"for at least x minutes\" threshold: x minutes of non-violating behavior are required to automatically close the violation. When a violation closes automatically: The closing timestamp is backdated to the start of the recovery period. The evaluation resets and restarts from when the previous violation ended. All conditions have a violation time limit setting that will automatically force-close a long-lasting violation. Manually close a violation You can manually close an open violation. This is useful, for example, when a signal has violated the threshold, but it no longer exists and also doesn't have a violation time limit. (A time limit would automatically close a long-lasting violation.) To close a violation: Go to the open violation you want to close. Click Manually close violation. To close all violations associated with a condition: Go to the condition you want to close. Disable the condition and then re-enable it. Important An incident will close automatically when all of its associated critical violations have been closed. Set a time limit for long-lasting violations The violation time limit setting will automatically force-close a long-lasting violation after the number of days/hours you select. This is most useful for ephemeral entities that, when they disappear, cause a continual violation that won't automatically close. Limits and Defaults All alert violations will have a violation time limit applied to them. Most alert conditions will allow you to edit this field. The default value, if one is not supplied during configuration, is 3 days (24 hours for Infrastructure conditions). The violation time limit for non-Infrastructure conditions can be set as low as 5 minutes, and as high as 30 days. If, for some reason, the signal is still violating in 30 days, the violation will close, and a new violation will open. Infrastructure conditions can be set to the following hours: 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48, or 72. Examples: You set the violation time limit to 12 hours. If that violation lasts for 12 hours, it will be closed at 12 hours and the condition's evaluation of that entity will be reset. Your JVM has a CPU spike and this creates a violation. The JVM then crashes and is replaced by a new JVM. If you have not set a violation time limit, the crashed JVM’s violation will never close.",

      "body": "You can use NRQL queries to create alert conditions. Once you've defined your signal, you can further define your warning and critical threshold levels. This determines when an alerts violation is created. Read on to learn more about how to do this. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Click NRQL, and then Next, define thresholds. Tip For more information on key concepts relating to NRQL alert conditions and streaming alerts, see Streaming alerts: key terms and concepts. Create a NRQL alert condition To create a NRQL alert condition for a policy: On one.newrelic.com, in the header click Alerts & AI, then in the left sidebar click Policies. Select an existing policy or click New alert policy to create a new policy. Click Add a condition. Under Select a product click NRQL, and then click Next, define thresholds. Create a condition from a chart You can use a chart to create a NRQL alert condition. To create a NRQL alerts condition from a chart, click the chart menu , then click Create alert condition. Once you've named and customized your condition, you can add it to an existing policy or create a new one. Caution A small number of our older charts don't include the option to create an alert condition. NRQL alert syntax Here's the basic syntax for creating all NRQL alert conditions. The FACET clause is required for outlier threshold types. It's optional for static and baseline. SELECT function(attribute) FROM Event WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Copy Clause Notes SELECT function(attribute) Required Supported functions that return numbers include: apdex average count latest max min percentage percentile sum uniqueCount Tip If you use the percentile aggregator in a faceted alert condition with many facets, this may cause the following error to appear: An error occurred while fetching chart data. If you see this error, use average instead. FROM data type Required Only one data type can be targeted. Supported data types: Event Metric (RAW data points will be returned) WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Use the WHERE clause to specify a series of one or more conditions. All the operators are supported. FACET attribute Required for outlier conditions Include an optional FACET clause in your NRQL syntax depending on the threshold type: static or baseline. Use the FACET clause to separate your results by attribute and alert on each attribute independently. No LIMIT clause is allowed, but all queries will receive the maximum number of facets possible. Faceted queries can return a maximum of 5000 values for static and baseline conditions and a maximum of 500 values for outlier conditions. Important If the query returns more than the maximum number of values, the alert condition can't be created. If you create the condition and the query returns more than this number later, the alert will fail. Modify your query so that it returns a fewer number of values. Reformatting incompatible NRQL Some elements of NRQL used in charts don’t make sense in the streaming context of alerts. Here’s a list of the most common incompatible elements and suggestions for reformatting a NRQL alert query to achieve the same effect. Element Notes SINCE and UNTIL Example: SELECT percentile(largestContentfulPaint, 75) FROM PageViewTiming WHERE (appId = 837807) SINCE yesterday Copy NRQL Alerting produces a never-ending stream of windowed query results, so the SINCE and UNTIL keywords to scope the query to a point in time are not compatible. As a convenience, we automatically strip SINCE and UNTIL from a query when creating a NRQL Alert Condition from the context of a chart. TIMESERIES In NRQL queries, the TIMESERIES clause is used to return data as a time series broken out by a specified period of time. For NRQL alerts, the equivalent property of a signal is the aggregation window. histogram() The histogram() aggregation function is used to generate histograms. histogram() is not compatible with NRQL alerting: histogram aggregations can not be formatted as a time series. To create an alert from a portion of a histogram (e.g. 95th percentile), use the percentile() aggregation function. Multiple Aggregation Functions Each alert condition can only target a single aggregated stream of data. To alert on multiple streams simultaneously, you’ll need to decompose them into individual conditions within the same policy. Original Query: SELECT count(foo), average(bar), max(baz) from Transaction Copy Decomposed: SELECT count(foo) from Transaction SELECT average(bar) from Transaction SELECT max(baz) from Transaction Copy COMPARE WITH The COMPARE WITH clause is used to compare the values for two different time ranges. This type of query is incompatible with NRQL alerting. We recommend using a Baseline Alert Condition to dynamically detect deviations for a particular signal. SLIDE BY The SLIDE BY clause supports a feature known as sliding windows. With sliding windows, SLIDE BY data is gathered into \"windows\" of time that overlap with each other. These windows can help to smooth out line graphs with a lot of variation in cases where the rolling aggregate (such as a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. Sliding windows are not currently supported in NRQL alerts. LIMIT In NRQL queries, the LIMIT clause is used to control the amount of data a query returns, either the maximum number of facet values returned by FACET queries or the maximum number of items returned by SELECT * queries. LIMIT is not compatible with NRQL alerting: evaluation is always performed on the full result set. NRQL alert threshold examples Here are some common use cases for NRQL alert conditions. These queries will work for static and baseline threshold types. The outlier threshold type will require additional FACET clauses. Alert on specific segments of your data Create constrained alerts that target a specific segment of your data, such as a few key customers or a range of data. Use the WHERE clause to define those conditions. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction WHERE account_id in (91290, 102021, 20230) Copy SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction WHERE name LIKE 'Controller/checkout/%' Copy Alert on Nth percentile of your data Create alerts when an Nth percentile of your data hits a specified threshold; for example, maintaining SLA service levels. Since we evaluate the NRQL query in one-minute time windows, percentiles will be calculated for each minute separately. SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentile(databaseDuration, 75) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on max, min, avg of your data Create alerts when your data hits a certain maximum, minimum, or average; for example, ensuring that a duration or response time does not pass a certain threshold. SELECT max(duration) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on a percentage of your data Create alerts when a proportion of your data goes above or below a certain threshold. SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE duration > 2) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE httpResponseCode = '500') FROM Transaction Copy Alert on Apdex with any T-value Create alerts on Apdex, applying your own T-value for certain transactions. For example, get an alert notification when your Apdex for a T-value of 500ms on transactions for production apps goes below 0.8. SELECT apdex(duration, t:0.5) FROM Transaction WHERE appName like '%prod%' Copy Alert conditions and query order of operations By default, the aggregation window is 1 minute, but you can change the window to suit your needs. Whatever the aggregation window, New Relic will collect data for that window using the function in the NRQL alert condition’s query. The query is parsed and executed by our systems in the following order: FROM clause – which event type needs to be grabbed? WHERE clause – what can be filtered out? SELECT clause – what information needs to be returned from the now-filtered data set? Example: null value returned Let's say this is your alert condition query: SELECT count(*) FROM SyntheticCheck WHERE monitorName = 'My Cool Monitor' AND result = 'FAILURE' Copy If there are no failures for the aggregation window: The system will execute the FROM clause by grabbing all SyntheticCheck events on your account. Then it will execute the WHERE clause to filter through those events by looking only for the ones that match the monitor name and result specified. If there are still events left to scan through after completing the FROM and WHERE operations, the SELECT clause will be executed. If there are no remaining events, the SELECT clause will not be executed. This means that aggregators like count() and uniqueCount() will never return a zero value. When there is a count of 0, the SELECT clause is ignored and no data is returned, resulting in a value of NULL. Example: zero value returned If you have a data source delivering legitimate numeric zeroes, the query will return zero values and not null values. Let's say this is your alert condition query, and that MyCoolEvent is an attribute that can sometimes return a zero value. SELECT average(MyCoolAttribute) FROM MyCoolEvent Copy If, in the aggregation window being evaluated, there's at least one instance of MyCoolEvent and if the average value of all MyCoolAttribute attributes from that window is equal to zero, then a 0 value will be returned. If there are no MyCoolEvent events during that minute, then a NULL will be returned due to the order of operations. Tip For more information about this topic, you can check out our blog post on troubleshooting for zero versus null values. Tip You can determine how null values will be handled by adjusting loss of signal and gap filling settings in the Alert Conditions UI. Tip You can avoid NULL values entirely with a query order of operations shortcut. Do this by using a filter sub-clause, then including all filter elements within that sub-clause. The main body of the query will run and return data, at which point the SELECT clause will then run and apply the filter elements. The query will return a value of 0 if the filter elements result in no matching data. Here's an example: SELECT filter(count(*), WHERE result = 'SUCCESS' AND monitorName = 'My Favorite Monitor') FROM SyntheticCheck Copy Nested aggregation NRQL alerts Nested aggregation queries are a powerful way to query your data. However, they have a few restrictions that are important to note. Nested queries with a non-faceted innermost query are not currently supported Without a FACET, the inner query produces a single result, giving the outer query nothing to aggregate. If you're using a nested query, make sure your inner query is faceted. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu) ​​​​​ Copy Queries at all levels must have the same aggregation window size With an alert aggregation window of 1 minute, the inner query would produce two smaller windows of 30 seconds. In theory, these two windows could be aggregated by the outer query. However, this is not currently supported. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu TIMESERIES 30 seconds)​​ Copy Signal loss is not yet supported for nested queries For more information on signal loss, see NerdGraph API: Loss of signal and gap filling. Nested queries containing 'WITH METRIC_FORMAT' in the inner query are not currently supported You can't use a nested query containing the WITH METRIC_FORMAT in the inner query to create NRQL alert conditions. NRQL condition creation tips Here are some tips for creating and using a NRQL condition: Topic Tips Condition threshold types NRQL condition threshold types include static, baseline, and outlier. Create a description For NRQL conditions, you can create a custom description to add to each violation. Descriptions can be enhanced with variable substitution based on metadata in the specific violation. For details, see Description Query results Queries must return a number. The condition evaluates the returned number against the thresholds you've set. Time period As with all alert conditions, NRQL conditions evaluate one single minute at a time. The implicit SINCE ... UNTIL clause specifying which minute to evaluate is controlled by your Evaluation offset setting. Since very recent data may be incomplete, you may want to query data from 3 minutes ago or longer, especially for: Applications that run on multiple hosts. SyntheticCheck data: Timeouts can take 3 minutes, so 5 minutes or more is recommended. Also, if a query will generate intermittent data, consider using the sum of query results option. Lost signal threshold (loss of signal detection) You can use loss of signal detection to alert on when your data (a telemetry signal) should be considered lost. A signal loss can indicate that a service or entity is no longer online or that a periodic job failed to run. You can also use this to make sure that violations for sporadic data, such as error counts, are closed when no signal is coming in. Advanced signal settings These settings give you options for better handling continuous, streaming data signals that may sometimes be missing. These settings include the aggregation window, the evaluation offset, and an option for filling data gaps. For more on using these, see Advanced signal settings. Condition settings Use the Condition settings to: Create a concise, descriptive condition name. Provide a custom violation description for the condition that will be included in violations and notifications. Add the runbook URL to include your organization's procedures for handling incidents. You may also add this information to the custom violation description. Limits on conditions See the maximum values. Health status NRQL alert conditions don't affect an entity's health status display. Examples For more information, see: Expected NRQL syntax Examples of NRQL condition queries Alert threshold types When you create a NRQL alert, you can choose from different types of thresholds: NRQL alert threshold types Description Static This is the simplest type of NRQL threshold. It allows you to create a condition based on a NRQL query that returns a numeric value. Optional: Include a FACET clause. Baseline (Dynamic) Uses a self-adjusting condition based on the past behavior of the monitored values. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type. Outlier Looks for group behavior and values that are outliers from those groups. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type, but requires a FACET clause. Sum of query results (limited or intermittent data) Important Available only for static (basic) threshold types. If a query returns intermittent or limited data, it may be difficult to set a meaningful threshold. Missing or limited data will sometimes generate false positives or false negatives. You can use loss of signal, aggregation duration, and gap filling settings to minimize these false notifications. To avoid this problem when using the static threshold type, you can set the selector to sum of query results. This lets you set the alert on an aggregated sum instead of a value from a single harvest cycle. Up to two hours of one-minute data checks can be aggregated. The duration you select determines the width of the rolling sum and the preview chart will update accordingly. Set the loss of signal threshold Loss of signal occurs when no data matches the NRQL condition over a specific period of time. You can set your loss of signal threshold duration and and also what happens when the threshold is crossed. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Loss of signal is only available for NRQL conditions. You may also manage these settings using the GraphQL API (recommended), or the REST API. Go here for specific GraphQL API examples. Loss of signal settings: Loss of signal settings include a time duration and two possible actions. Signal loss expiration time UI label: Signal is lost after: GraphQL Node: expiration.expirationDuration Expiration duration is a timer that starts and resets when we receive a data point in the streaming alerts pipeline. If we don't receive another data point before your 'expiration time' expires, we consider that signal to be lost. This can be because no data is being sent to New Relic or the WHERE clause of your NRQL query is filtering that data out before it is streamed to the alerts pipeline. The loss of signal expiration time is independent of the threshold duration and triggers as soon as the timer expires. The maximum expiration duration is 48 hours. This is helpful when monitoring for the execution of infrequent jobs. The minimum is 30 seconds, but we recommend using at least 3-5 minutes. Loss of signal actions Once a signal is considered lost, you can close open violations, open new violations, or both. Close all current open violations: This closes all open violations that are related to a specific signal. It won't necessarily close all violations for a condition. If you're alerting on an ephemeral service, or on a sporadic signal, you'll want to choose this action to ensure that violations are closed properly. The GraphQL node name for this is \"closeViolationsOnExpiration\" Open new violations: This will open a new violation when the signal is considered lost. These violations will indicate that they are due to a loss of signal. Based on your incident preferences, this should trigger a notification. The graphQL node name for this is \"openViolationOnExpiration\" When you enable both actions, we'll close all open violations first, and then open a new violation for loss of signal. To create a NRQL alert configured with loss of signal detection in the UI: For a policy, when you create a condition, under Select a product, click NRQL, then click Next, define thresholds. Write a NRQL query that returns the values you want to alert on. For Threshold type, select Static or Baseline. Click + Add lost signal threshold, then set the signal expiration duration time in minutes or seconds in the Signal is lost after field. Choose what you want to happen when the signal is lost. You can check one or both of Close all current open violations and Open new \"lost signal\" violation. These control how loss of signal violations will be handled for the condition. Make sure you name your condition before you save it. Violations open due to loss of signal close when the signal comes back. Newly opened lost signal violations will close immediately when new data is evaluated. the condition they belong to expires. By default, conditions expire after 3 days. you manually close the violation with the Close all current open violations option. Tip Loss of signal detection doesn't work on NRQL queries that use nested aggregation or sub-queries. Advanced signal settings When creating a NRQL alert condition, the advanced signal settings gives you better control over streaming alert data and helps you avoid false alarms. When creating a NRQL condition, there are several advanced signal settings: Aggregation window Evaluation offset Fill data gaps To read an explanation of what these settings are and how they relate to each other, see Streaming alerts concepts. Below are instructions and tips on how to configure them. Aggregation window You can set the aggregation window duration to choose how long data is accumulated in a streaming time window before it's aggregated. You can set it to anything between one second and 15 minutes. The default is one minute. Tip Baseline alert condition thresholds don't support editing the aggregation window. They use the 1 minute default. Evaluation offset You can adjust the evaluation offset to coordinate our streaming alerting algorithm with your data's latency. If it takes a while for your data to arrive, then you may need to increase the evaluation offset. The total supported latency is the product of the aggregation window duration multiplied by the evaluation offset. In the example screenshot above, the supported latency is 3 minutes (a 1-minute aggregation window multiplied by three windows). If the data type comes from an APM language agent and is aggregated from many app instances (for example, Transactions, TransactionErrors, etc.), we recommend using an evaluation offset of 3 with 1 minute aggregation windows. Important When creating NRQL conditions for data collected from Infrastructure Cloud Integrations such as AWS Cloudwatch or Azure, we recommend that you start with an evaluation offset of 15 minutes, then adjust up or down depending on how long it takes to collect your data. Fill data gaps Gap filling lets you customize the values to use when your signals don't have any data. You can fill gaps in your data streams with one of these settings: None: (Default) Choose this if you don't want to take any action on empty aggregation windows. On evaluation, an empty aggregation window will reset the threshold duration timer. For example, if a condition says that all aggregation windows must have data points above the threshold for 5 minutes, and 1 of the 5 aggregation windows is empty, then the condition won't be in violation. Custom static value: Choose this if you'd like to insert a custom static value into the empty aggregation windows before they're evaluated. This option has an additional, required parameter of fillValue (as named in the API) that specifies what static value should be used. This defaults to 0. Last known value: This option inserts the last seen value before evaluation occurs. We maintain the state of the last seen value for 2 hours. Tip The alerts system fills gaps in actively reported signals. This signal history is dropped after 2 hours of inactivity. For gap filling, data points received after this period of inactivity are treated as new signals. To learn more about signal loss, gap filling, and how to request access to these features, see this Explorers Hub post. Options for editing data gap settings: In the NRQL conditions UI, go to Condition settings > Advanced signal settings > fill data gaps with and choose an option. If using our Nerdgraph API (preferred), this node is located at: actor : account : alerts : nrqlCondition : signal : fillOption | fillValue NerdGraph is our recommended API for this but if you're using our REST API, you can find this setting in the REST API explorer under the \"signal\" section of the Alert NRQL conditions API.",

      "body": "You can use NRQL queries to create alert conditions. Once you've defined your signal, you can further define your warning and critical threshold levels. This determines when an alerts violation is created. Read on to learn more about how to do this. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Click NRQL, and then Next, define thresholds. Tip For more information on key concepts relating to NRQL alert conditions and streaming alerts, see Streaming alerts: key terms and concepts. Create a NRQL alert condition To create a NRQL alert condition for a policy: On one.newrelic.com, in the header click Alerts & AI, then in the left sidebar click Policies. Select an existing policy or click New alert policy to create a new policy. Click Add a condition. Under Select a product click NRQL, and then click Next, define thresholds. Create a condition from a chart You can use a chart to create a NRQL alert condition. To create a NRQL alerts condition from a chart, click the chart menu , then click Create alert condition. Once you've named and customized your condition, you can add it to an existing policy or create a new one. Caution A small number of our older charts don't include the option to create an alert condition. NRQL alert syntax Here's the basic syntax for creating all NRQL alert conditions. The FACET clause is required for outlier threshold types. It's optional for static and baseline. SELECT function(attribute) FROM Event WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Copy Clause Notes SELECT function(attribute) Required Supported functions that return numbers include: apdex average count latest max min percentage percentile sum uniqueCount Tip If you use the percentile aggregator in a faceted alert condition with many facets, this may cause the following error to appear: An error occurred while fetching chart data. If you see this error, use average instead. FROM data type Required Only one data type can be targeted. Supported data types: Event Metric (RAW data points will be returned) WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Use the WHERE clause to specify a series of one or more conditions. All the operators are supported. FACET attribute Required for outlier conditions Include an optional FACET clause in your NRQL syntax depending on the threshold type: static or baseline. Use the FACET clause to separate your results by attribute and alert on each attribute independently. No LIMIT clause is allowed, but all queries will receive the maximum number of facets possible. Faceted queries can return a maximum of 5000 values for static and baseline conditions and a maximum of 500 values for outlier conditions. Important If the query returns more than the maximum number of values, the alert condition can't be created. If you create the condition and the query returns more than this number later, the alert will fail. Modify your query so that it returns a fewer number of values. Reformatting incompatible NRQL Some elements of NRQL used in charts don’t make sense in the streaming context of alerts. Here’s a list of the most common incompatible elements and suggestions for reformatting a NRQL alert query to achieve the same effect. Element Notes SINCE and UNTIL Example: SELECT percentile(largestContentfulPaint, 75) FROM PageViewTiming WHERE (appId = 837807) SINCE yesterday Copy NRQL Alerting produces a never-ending stream of windowed query results, so the SINCE and UNTIL keywords to scope the query to a point in time are not compatible. As a convenience, we automatically strip SINCE and UNTIL from a query when creating a NRQL Alert Condition from the context of a chart. TIMESERIES In NRQL queries, the TIMESERIES clause is used to return data as a time series broken out by a specified period of time. For NRQL alerts, the equivalent property of a signal is the aggregation window. histogram() The histogram() aggregation function is used to generate histograms. histogram() is not compatible with NRQL alerting: histogram aggregations can not be formatted as a time series. To create an alert from a portion of a histogram (e.g. 95th percentile), use the percentile() aggregation function. Multiple Aggregation Functions Each alert condition can only target a single aggregated stream of data. To alert on multiple streams simultaneously, you’ll need to decompose them into individual conditions within the same policy. Original Query: SELECT count(foo), average(bar), max(baz) from Transaction Copy Decomposed: SELECT count(foo) from Transaction SELECT average(bar) from Transaction SELECT max(baz) from Transaction Copy COMPARE WITH The COMPARE WITH clause is used to compare the values for two different time ranges. This type of query is incompatible with NRQL alerting. We recommend using a Baseline Alert Condition to dynamically detect deviations for a particular signal. SLIDE BY The SLIDE BY clause supports a feature known as sliding windows. With sliding windows, SLIDE BY data is gathered into \"windows\" of time that overlap with each other. These windows can help to smooth out line graphs with a lot of variation in cases where the rolling aggregate (such as a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. Sliding windows are not currently supported in NRQL alerts. LIMIT In NRQL queries, the LIMIT clause is used to control the amount of data a query returns, either the maximum number of facet values returned by FACET queries or the maximum number of items returned by SELECT * queries. LIMIT is not compatible with NRQL alerting: evaluation is always performed on the full result set. NRQL alert threshold examples Here are some common use cases for NRQL alert conditions. These queries will work for static and baseline threshold types. The outlier threshold type will require additional FACET clauses. Alert on specific segments of your data Create constrained alerts that target a specific segment of your data, such as a few key customers or a range of data. Use the WHERE clause to define those conditions. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction WHERE account_id in (91290, 102021, 20230) Copy SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction WHERE name LIKE 'Controller/checkout/%' Copy Alert on Nth percentile of your data Create alerts when an Nth percentile of your data hits a specified threshold; for example, maintaining SLA service levels. Since we evaluate the NRQL query in one-minute time windows, percentiles will be calculated for each minute separately. SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentile(databaseDuration, 75) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on max, min, avg of your data Create alerts when your data hits a certain maximum, minimum, or average; for example, ensuring that a duration or response time does not pass a certain threshold. SELECT max(duration) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on a percentage of your data Create alerts when a proportion of your data goes above or below a certain threshold. SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE duration > 2) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE httpResponseCode = '500') FROM Transaction Copy Alert on Apdex with any T-value Create alerts on Apdex, applying your own T-value for certain transactions. For example, get an alert notification when your Apdex for a T-value of 500ms on transactions for production apps goes below 0.8. SELECT apdex(duration, t:0.5) FROM Transaction WHERE appName like '%prod%' Copy Alert conditions and query order of operations By default, the aggregation window is 1 minute, but you can change the window to suit your needs. Whatever the aggregation window, New Relic will collect data for that window using the function in the NRQL alert condition’s query. The query is parsed and executed by our systems in the following order: FROM clause – which event type needs to be grabbed? WHERE clause – what can be filtered out? SELECT clause – what information needs to be returned from the now-filtered data set? Example: null value returned Let's say this is your alert condition query: SELECT count(*) FROM SyntheticCheck WHERE monitorName = 'My Cool Monitor' AND result = 'FAILURE' Copy If there are no failures for the aggregation window: The system will execute the FROM clause by grabbing all SyntheticCheck events on your account. Then it will execute the WHERE clause to filter through those events by looking only for the ones that match the monitor name and result specified. If there are still events left to scan through after completing the FROM and WHERE operations, the SELECT clause will be executed. If there are no remaining events, the SELECT clause will not be executed. This means that aggregators like count() and uniqueCount() will never return a zero value. When there is a count of 0, the SELECT clause is ignored and no data is returned, resulting in a value of NULL. Example: zero value returned If you have a data source delivering legitimate numeric zeroes, the query will return zero values and not null values. Let's say this is your alert condition query, and that MyCoolEvent is an attribute that can sometimes return a zero value. SELECT average(MyCoolAttribute) FROM MyCoolEvent Copy If, in the aggregation window being evaluated, there's at least one instance of MyCoolEvent and if the average value of all MyCoolAttribute attributes from that window is equal to zero, then a 0 value will be returned. If there are no MyCoolEvent events during that minute, then a NULL will be returned due to the order of operations. Tip For more information about this topic, you can check out our blog post on troubleshooting for zero versus null values. Tip You can determine how null values will be handled by adjusting loss of signal and gap filling settings in the Alert Conditions UI. Tip You can avoid NULL values entirely with a query order of operations shortcut. Do this by using a filter sub-clause, then including all filter elements within that sub-clause. The main body of the query will run and return data, at which point the SELECT clause will then run and apply the filter elements. The query will return a value of 0 if the filter elements result in no matching data. Here's an example: SELECT filter(count(*), WHERE result = 'SUCCESS' AND monitorName = 'My Favorite Monitor') FROM SyntheticCheck Copy Nested aggregation NRQL alerts Nested aggregation queries are a powerful way to query your data. However, they have a few restrictions that are important to note. Nested queries with a non-faceted innermost query are not currently supported Without a FACET, the inner query produces a single result, giving the outer query nothing to aggregate. If you're using a nested query, make sure your inner query is faceted. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu) ​​​​​ Copy Queries at all levels must have the same aggregation window size With an alert aggregation window of 1 minute, the inner query would produce two smaller windows of 30 seconds. In theory, these two windows could be aggregated by the outer query. However, this is not currently supported. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu TIMESERIES 30 seconds)​​ Copy Signal loss is not yet supported for nested queries For more information on signal loss, see NerdGraph API: Loss of signal and gap filling. Nested queries containing 'WITH METRIC_FORMAT' in the inner query are not currently supported You can't use a nested query containing the WITH METRIC_FORMAT in the inner query to create NRQL alert conditions. NRQL condition creation tips Here are some tips for creating and using a NRQL condition: Topic Tips Condition threshold types NRQL condition threshold types include static, baseline, and outlier. Create a description For NRQL conditions, you can create a custom description to add to each violation. Descriptions can be enhanced with variable substitution based on metadata in the specific violation. For details, see Description Query results Queries must return a number. The condition evaluates the returned number against the thresholds you've set. Time period As with all alert conditions, NRQL conditions evaluate one single minute at a time. The implicit SINCE ... UNTIL clause specifying which minute to evaluate is controlled by your Evaluation offset setting. Since very recent data may be incomplete, you may want to query data from 3 minutes ago or longer, especially for: Applications that run on multiple hosts. SyntheticCheck data: Timeouts can take 3 minutes, so 5 minutes or more is recommended. Also, if a query will generate intermittent data, consider using the sum of query results option. Lost signal threshold (loss of signal detection) You can use loss of signal detection to alert on when your data (a telemetry signal) should be considered lost. A signal loss can indicate that a service or entity is no longer online or that a periodic job failed to run. You can also use this to make sure that violations for sporadic data, such as error counts, are closed when no signal is coming in. Advanced signal settings These settings give you options for better handling continuous, streaming data signals that may sometimes be missing. These settings include the aggregation window, the evaluation offset, and an option for filling data gaps. For more on using these, see Advanced signal settings. Condition settings Use the Condition settings to: Create a concise, descriptive condition name. Provide a custom violation description for the condition that will be included in violations and notifications. Add the runbook URL to include your organization's procedures for handling incidents. You may also add this information to the custom violation description. Limits on conditions See the maximum values. Health status NRQL alert conditions don't affect an entity's health status display. Examples For more information, see: Expected NRQL syntax Examples of NRQL condition queries Alert threshold types When you create a NRQL alert, you can choose from different types of thresholds: NRQL alert threshold types Description Static This is the simplest type of NRQL threshold. It allows you to create a condition based on a NRQL query that returns a numeric value. Optional: Include a FACET clause. Baseline (Dynamic) Uses a self-adjusting condition based on the past behavior of the monitored values. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type. Outlier Looks for group behavior and values that are outliers from those groups. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type, but requires a FACET clause. Sum of query results (limited or intermittent data) Important Available only for static (basic) threshold types. If a query returns intermittent or limited data, it may be difficult to set a meaningful threshold. Missing or limited data will sometimes generate false positives or false negatives. You can use loss of signal, aggregation duration, and gap filling settings to minimize these false notifications. To avoid this problem when using the static threshold type, you can set the selector to sum of query results. This lets you set the alert on an aggregated sum instead of a value from a single harvest cycle. Up to two hours of one-minute data checks can be aggregated. The duration you select determines the width of the rolling sum and the preview chart will update accordingly. Set the loss of signal threshold Loss of signal occurs when no data matches the NRQL condition over a specific period of time. You can set your loss of signal threshold duration and and also what happens when the threshold is crossed. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Loss of signal is only available for NRQL conditions. You may also manage these settings using the GraphQL API (recommended), or the REST API. Go here for specific GraphQL API examples. Loss of signal settings: Loss of signal settings include a time duration and two possible actions. Signal loss expiration time UI label: Signal is lost after: GraphQL Node: expiration.expirationDuration Expiration duration is a timer that starts and resets when we receive a data point in the streaming alerts pipeline. If we don't receive another data point before your 'expiration time' expires, we consider that signal to be lost. This can be because no data is being sent to New Relic or the WHERE clause of your NRQL query is filtering that data out before it is streamed to the alerts pipeline. The loss of signal expiration time is independent of the threshold duration and triggers as soon as the timer expires. The maximum expiration duration is 48 hours. This is helpful when monitoring for the execution of infrequent jobs. The minimum is 30 seconds, but we recommend using at least 3-5 minutes. Loss of signal actions Once a signal is considered lost, you can close open violations, open new violations, or both. Close all current open violations: This closes all open violations that are related to a specific signal. It won't necessarily close all violations for a condition. If you're alerting on an ephemeral service, or on a sporadic signal, you'll want to choose this action to ensure that violations are closed properly. The GraphQL node name for this is \"closeViolationsOnExpiration\" Open new violations: This will open a new violation when the signal is considered lost. These violations will indicate that they are due to a loss of signal. Based on your incident preferences, this should trigger a notification. The graphQL node name for this is \"openViolationOnExpiration\" When you enable both actions, we'll close all open violations first, and then open a new violation for loss of signal. To create a NRQL alert configured with loss of signal detection in the UI: For a policy, when you create a condition, under Select a product, click NRQL, then click Next, define thresholds. Write a NRQL query that returns the values you want to alert on. For Threshold type, select Static or Baseline. Click + Add lost signal threshold, then set the signal expiration duration time in minutes or seconds in the Signal is lost after field. Choose what you want to happen when the signal is lost. You can check one or both of Close all current open violations and Open new \"lost signal\" violation. These control how loss of signal violations will be handled for the condition. Make sure you name your condition before you save it. Violations open due to loss of signal close when the signal comes back. Newly opened lost signal violations will close immediately when new data is evaluated. the condition they belong to expires. By default, conditions expire after 3 days. you manually close the violation with the Close all current open violations option. Tip Loss of signal detection doesn't work on NRQL queries that use nested aggregation or sub-queries. Advanced signal settings When creating a NRQL alert condition, the advanced signal settings gives you better control over streaming alert data and helps you avoid false alarms. When creating a NRQL condition, there are several advanced signal settings: Aggregation window Evaluation offset Fill data gaps To read an explanation of what these settings are and how they relate to each other, see Streaming alerts concepts. Below are instructions and tips on how to configure them. Aggregation window You can set the aggregation window duration to choose how long data is accumulated in a streaming time window before it's aggregated. You can set it to anything between one second and 15 minutes. The default is one minute. Tip Baseline alert condition thresholds don't support editing the aggregation window. They use the 1 minute default. Evaluation offset You can adjust the evaluation offset to coordinate our streaming alerting algorithm with your data's latency. If it takes a while for your data to arrive, then you may need to increase the evaluation offset. The total supported latency is the product of the aggregation window duration multiplied by the evaluation offset. In the example screenshot above, the supported latency is 3 minutes (a 1-minute aggregation window multiplied by three windows). If the data type comes from an APM language agent and is aggregated from many app instances (for example, Transactions, TransactionErrors, etc.), we recommend using an evaluation offset of 3 with 1 minute aggregation windows. Important When creating NRQL conditions for data collected from Infrastructure Cloud Integrations such as AWS Cloudwatch or Azure, we recommend that you start with an evaluation offset of 15 minutes, then adjust up or down depending on how long it takes to collect your data. Fill data gaps Gap filling lets you customize the values to use when your signals don't have any data. You can fill gaps in your data streams with one of these settings: None: (Default) Choose this if you don't want to take any action on empty aggregation windows. On evaluation, an empty aggregation window will reset the threshold duration timer. For example, if a condition says that all aggregation windows must have data points above the threshold for 5 minutes, and 1 of the 5 aggregation windows is empty, then the condition won't be in violation. Custom static value: Choose this if you'd like to insert a custom static value into the empty aggregation windows before they're evaluated. This option has an additional, required parameter of fillValue (as named in the API) that specifies what static value should be used. This defaults to 0. Last known value: This option inserts the last seen value before evaluation occurs. We maintain the state of the last seen value for 2 hours. Tip The alerts system fills gaps in actively reported signals. This signal history is dropped after 2 hours of inactivity. For gap filling, data points received after this period of inactivity are treated as new signals. To learn more about signal loss, gap filling, and how to request access to these features, see this Explorers Hub post. Options for editing data gap settings: In the NRQL conditions UI, go to Condition settings > Advanced signal settings > fill data gaps with and choose an option. If using our Nerdgraph API (preferred), this node is located at: actor : account : alerts : nrqlCondition : signal : fillOption | fillValue NerdGraph is our recommended API for this but if you're using our REST API, you can find this setting in the REST API explorer under the \"signal\" section of the Alert NRQL conditions API.",

      "body": "Important This feature is a limited release. We’ve expanded anomaly detection coverage beyond your APM applications. Configure anomaly detection for your browser applications, mobile applications, infrastructure hosts, and nearly anything you want to monitor. Requirements Expanded anomaly detection is available as a limited beta. You can request access here. Why it matters When starting to configure alert conditions for a variety of applications and hosts, it can be difficult to know what you’ll want to be notified about ahead of time. Anomaly detection helps you distinguish between what’s typical performance in your system and where you’re starting to have trouble. Instead of creating your alert conditions manually, you can simply tell us what you want to monitor. Anomaly detection will help you identify baseline performance in your system and flags anomalous activity in your system. Get started with anomaly detection To get started with expanded anomaly detection: From one.newrelic.com, go to Alerts & AI > Proactive Detection > Settings. Click the Custom tab, and then click + Add a configuration. Select the account you want to use to record anomaly data, then select the workload or entities you’d like to monitor. Select the detection sensitivity. We recommend Low sensitivity so that you don’t see too many anomalies. Finally, name your configuration and save. Detect anomalies with a faceted NRQL query To detect anomalies with a faceted NRQL query: From one.newrelic.com, go to Alerts & AI > Proactive Detection > Settings. Click the Custom tab, and then click + Add a configuration. Click Use a query instead. You may need to select an account, if you have more than one. Add one or more queries with a FACET clause. Name the query and confirm the facets you want to monitor for anomalies. Select the detection sensitivity. We recommend Low sensitivity so that you don’t see too many anomalies. Finally, name the configuration and save. See your anomalies in one place When you set up anomaly detection, New Relic starts analyzing the golden signals of your entities and workloads. Anomalies appear in your activity feeds throughout New Relic One and the Anomalies tab as soon as they’re detected. Click any anomaly to get more detail about it, including analysis and context for the anomaly. Tip For this limited release, anomaly detection won’t generate notifications. However, you can configure a NRQL alert condition for the NrAiAnomaly event. To view anomalies, from one.newrelic.com, go to Alerts & AI > Issues & activity > Anomalies. Query anomaly data Detected anomalies are written to the NrAiAnomaly event in your NRDB account. You can learn more about this event and how to query it here. Reduce the number of detected anomalies If you’re seeing too many anomalies, the first step is to make sure your sensitivity level is set to Low. If it’s already set to Low, you can define specific thresholds to distinguish between normal and anomalous behavior. To define custom thresholds: From one.newrelic.com, go to Alerts & AI > Proactive Detection > Settings. Click the Custom tab and the configuration you want to modify. Select an entity or workload, and then change the sensitivity level. You can use custom sensitivity to define specific thresholds for different entity types.",

      "body": "Applied Intelligence (AI) is our AIOps solution for DevOps, site reliability engineers, and on-call teams. At its core, Applied Intelligence helps you find, troubleshoot, and resolve problems more quickly. Specifically, it’s a hybrid machine learning engine that reduces alert noise, correlates incidents, and automatically detects anomalies. By applying machine learning to your data and feedback, Applied Intelligence is designed to improve functionality and deliver smarter context over time. After connecting your data sources to Applied Intelligence, it looks for potential problems and improves based on your feedback. Why use Applied Intelligence? How you respond to an incident can mean thousands of dollars or clicks for your company. Applied Intelligence helps you solve problems faster. Feature Description Troubleshoot and respond to incidents Our solution helps you understand your incidents and gives you ideas for what to do next. Here are a few examples: Automatically classifies incidents based on the golden signals of site reliability engineering. Identifies entities in your stack that may relate to the underlying issue. Suggests responses for incidents based on historical context. Less noise, more focus As tools and systems become more complex, alert noise can overwhelm DevOps and SRE teams. Applied Intelligence correlates related incidents and suppresses noise, so you're only notified when human action is required. Incidents with a hybrid approach Applied Intelligence streamlines your incidents by combining its built-in inputs with your knowledge and feedback. Over time, the system delivers more accurate insights. For example: Our correlation and classification engine adjusts based on your feedback. The system automatically suggests new correlation rules based on your production data. You can create custom logic using the decision builder. Automatic anomaly detection Applied Intelligence provides automatic anomaly detection on all your APM-monitored applications. We detect anomalies in throughput, latency, and error rate, with no action required from you. Benefits include: No setup required. See anomalies surfaced automatically in the anomalies feed. See them in various New Relic activity streams (for example, on the New Relic One home page). Ability to run NRQL queries of anomalies and create custom dashboards with that data. Determine root causes with Incident Intelligence As part of Applied Intelligence, Incident Intelligence helps you correlate incident events and reduce noise in your environment. With it, you can get an overview of all your issues, see suggested responders, and configure your own correlation logic. To get started, see Incident Intelligence. Find unknowns with Proactive Detection Another feature of Applied Intelligence is Proactive Detection. Proactive Detection is, by default, always on and detecting anomalies. These anomalies are surfaced in the Applied Intelligence anomalies feed, New Relic One activity streams, and can be queried, alerted on, and added to dashboards. Anomalies can be sent to Slack or via webhooks, and/or added as a source for Incident Intelligence correlation and issue notification. Proactive Detection also provides automatic analysis of anomalies and alerts via the analysis page. To get started, see Proactive Detection.",

      "body": "You can use NRQL queries to create alert conditions. Once you've defined your signal, you can further define your warning and critical threshold levels. This determines when an alerts violation is created. Read on to learn more about how to do this. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Click NRQL, and then Next, define thresholds. Tip For more information on key concepts relating to NRQL alert conditions and streaming alerts, see Streaming alerts: key terms and concepts. Create a NRQL alert condition To create a NRQL alert condition for a policy: On one.newrelic.com, in the header click Alerts & AI, then in the left sidebar click Policies. Select an existing policy or click New alert policy to create a new policy. Click Add a condition. Under Select a product click NRQL, and then click Next, define thresholds. Create a condition from a chart You can use a chart to create a NRQL alert condition. To create a NRQL alerts condition from a chart, click the chart menu , then click Create alert condition. Once you've named and customized your condition, you can add it to an existing policy or create a new one. Caution A small number of our older charts don't include the option to create an alert condition. NRQL alert syntax Here's the basic syntax for creating all NRQL alert conditions. The FACET clause is required for outlier threshold types. It's optional for static and baseline. SELECT function(attribute) FROM Event WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Copy Clause Notes SELECT function(attribute) Required Supported functions that return numbers include: apdex average count latest max min percentage percentile sum uniqueCount Tip If you use the percentile aggregator in a faceted alert condition with many facets, this may cause the following error to appear: An error occurred while fetching chart data. If you see this error, use average instead. FROM data type Required Only one data type can be targeted. Supported data types: Event Metric (RAW data points will be returned) WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Use the WHERE clause to specify a series of one or more conditions. All the operators are supported. FACET attribute Required for outlier conditions Include an optional FACET clause in your NRQL syntax depending on the threshold type: static or baseline. Use the FACET clause to separate your results by attribute and alert on each attribute independently. No LIMIT clause is allowed, but all queries will receive the maximum number of facets possible. Faceted queries can return a maximum of 5000 values for static and baseline conditions and a maximum of 500 values for outlier conditions. Important If the query returns more than the maximum number of values, the alert condition can't be created. If you create the condition and the query returns more than this number later, the alert will fail. Modify your query so that it returns a fewer number of values. Reformatting incompatible NRQL Some elements of NRQL used in charts don’t make sense in the streaming context of alerts. Here’s a list of the most common incompatible elements and suggestions for reformatting a NRQL alert query to achieve the same effect. Element Notes SINCE and UNTIL Example: SELECT percentile(largestContentfulPaint, 75) FROM PageViewTiming WHERE (appId = 837807) SINCE yesterday Copy NRQL Alerting produces a never-ending stream of windowed query results, so the SINCE and UNTIL keywords to scope the query to a point in time are not compatible. As a convenience, we automatically strip SINCE and UNTIL from a query when creating a NRQL Alert Condition from the context of a chart. TIMESERIES In NRQL queries, the TIMESERIES clause is used to return data as a time series broken out by a specified period of time. For NRQL alerts, the equivalent property of a signal is the aggregation window. histogram() The histogram() aggregation function is used to generate histograms. histogram() is not compatible with NRQL alerting: histogram aggregations can not be formatted as a time series. To create an alert from a portion of a histogram (e.g. 95th percentile), use the percentile() aggregation function. Multiple Aggregation Functions Each alert condition can only target a single aggregated stream of data. To alert on multiple streams simultaneously, you’ll need to decompose them into individual conditions within the same policy. Original Query: SELECT count(foo), average(bar), max(baz) from Transaction Copy Decomposed: SELECT count(foo) from Transaction SELECT average(bar) from Transaction SELECT max(baz) from Transaction Copy COMPARE WITH The COMPARE WITH clause is used to compare the values for two different time ranges. This type of query is incompatible with NRQL alerting. We recommend using a Baseline Alert Condition to dynamically detect deviations for a particular signal. SLIDE BY The SLIDE BY clause supports a feature known as sliding windows. With sliding windows, SLIDE BY data is gathered into \"windows\" of time that overlap with each other. These windows can help to smooth out line graphs with a lot of variation in cases where the rolling aggregate (such as a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. Sliding windows are not currently supported in NRQL alerts. LIMIT In NRQL queries, the LIMIT clause is used to control the amount of data a query returns, either the maximum number of facet values returned by FACET queries or the maximum number of items returned by SELECT * queries. LIMIT is not compatible with NRQL alerting: evaluation is always performed on the full result set. NRQL alert threshold examples Here are some common use cases for NRQL alert conditions. These queries will work for static and baseline threshold types. The outlier threshold type will require additional FACET clauses. Alert on specific segments of your data Create constrained alerts that target a specific segment of your data, such as a few key customers or a range of data. Use the WHERE clause to define those conditions. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction WHERE account_id in (91290, 102021, 20230) Copy SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction WHERE name LIKE 'Controller/checkout/%' Copy Alert on Nth percentile of your data Create alerts when an Nth percentile of your data hits a specified threshold; for example, maintaining SLA service levels. Since we evaluate the NRQL query in one-minute time windows, percentiles will be calculated for each minute separately. SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentile(databaseDuration, 75) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on max, min, avg of your data Create alerts when your data hits a certain maximum, minimum, or average; for example, ensuring that a duration or response time does not pass a certain threshold. SELECT max(duration) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on a percentage of your data Create alerts when a proportion of your data goes above or below a certain threshold. SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE duration > 2) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE httpResponseCode = '500') FROM Transaction Copy Alert on Apdex with any T-value Create alerts on Apdex, applying your own T-value for certain transactions. For example, get an alert notification when your Apdex for a T-value of 500ms on transactions for production apps goes below 0.8. SELECT apdex(duration, t:0.5) FROM Transaction WHERE appName like '%prod%' Copy Alert conditions and query order of operations By default, the aggregation window is 1 minute, but you can change the window to suit your needs. Whatever the aggregation window, New Relic will collect data for that window using the function in the NRQL alert condition’s query. The query is parsed and executed by our systems in the following order: FROM clause – which event type needs to be grabbed? WHERE clause – what can be filtered out? SELECT clause – what information needs to be returned from the now-filtered data set? Example: null value returned Let's say this is your alert condition query: SELECT count(*) FROM SyntheticCheck WHERE monitorName = 'My Cool Monitor' AND result = 'FAILURE' Copy If there are no failures for the aggregation window: The system will execute the FROM clause by grabbing all SyntheticCheck events on your account. Then it will execute the WHERE clause to filter through those events by looking only for the ones that match the monitor name and result specified. If there are still events left to scan through after completing the FROM and WHERE operations, the SELECT clause will be executed. If there are no remaining events, the SELECT clause will not be executed. This means that aggregators like count() and uniqueCount() will never return a zero value. When there is a count of 0, the SELECT clause is ignored and no data is returned, resulting in a value of NULL. Example: zero value returned If you have a data source delivering legitimate numeric zeroes, the query will return zero values and not null values. Let's say this is your alert condition query, and that MyCoolEvent is an attribute that can sometimes return a zero value. SELECT average(MyCoolAttribute) FROM MyCoolEvent Copy If, in the aggregation window being evaluated, there's at least one instance of MyCoolEvent and if the average value of all MyCoolAttribute attributes from that window is equal to zero, then a 0 value will be returned. If there are no MyCoolEvent events during that minute, then a NULL will be returned due to the order of operations. Tip For more information about this topic, you can check out our blog post on troubleshooting for zero versus null values. Tip You can determine how null values will be handled by adjusting loss of signal and gap filling settings in the Alert Conditions UI. Tip You can avoid NULL values entirely with a query order of operations shortcut. Do this by using a filter sub-clause, then including all filter elements within that sub-clause. The main body of the query will run and return data, at which point the SELECT clause will then run and apply the filter elements. The query will return a value of 0 if the filter elements result in no matching data. Here's an example: SELECT filter(count(*), WHERE result = 'SUCCESS' AND monitorName = 'My Favorite Monitor') FROM SyntheticCheck Copy Nested aggregation NRQL alerts Nested aggregation queries are a powerful way to query your data. However, they have a few restrictions that are important to note. Nested queries with a non-faceted innermost query are not currently supported Without a FACET, the inner query produces a single result, giving the outer query nothing to aggregate. If you're using a nested query, make sure your inner query is faceted. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu) ​​​​​ Copy Queries at all levels must have the same aggregation window size With an alert aggregation window of 1 minute, the inner query would produce two smaller windows of 30 seconds. In theory, these two windows could be aggregated by the outer query. However, this is not currently supported. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu TIMESERIES 30 seconds)​​ Copy Signal loss is not yet supported for nested queries For more information on signal loss, see NerdGraph API: Loss of signal and gap filling. Nested queries containing 'WITH METRIC_FORMAT' in the inner query are not currently supported You can't use a nested query containing the WITH METRIC_FORMAT in the inner query to create NRQL alert conditions. NRQL condition creation tips Here are some tips for creating and using a NRQL condition: Topic Tips Condition threshold types NRQL condition threshold types include static, baseline, and outlier. Create a description For NRQL conditions, you can create a custom description to add to each violation. Descriptions can be enhanced with variable substitution based on metadata in the specific violation. For details, see Description Query results Queries must return a number. The condition evaluates the returned number against the thresholds you've set. Time period As with all alert conditions, NRQL conditions evaluate one single minute at a time. The implicit SINCE ... UNTIL clause specifying which minute to evaluate is controlled by your Evaluation offset setting. Since very recent data may be incomplete, you may want to query data from 3 minutes ago or longer, especially for: Applications that run on multiple hosts. SyntheticCheck data: Timeouts can take 3 minutes, so 5 minutes or more is recommended. Also, if a query will generate intermittent data, consider using the sum of query results option. Lost signal threshold (loss of signal detection) You can use loss of signal detection to alert on when your data (a telemetry signal) should be considered lost. A signal loss can indicate that a service or entity is no longer online or that a periodic job failed to run. You can also use this to make sure that violations for sporadic data, such as error counts, are closed when no signal is coming in. Advanced signal settings These settings give you options for better handling continuous, streaming data signals that may sometimes be missing. These settings include the aggregation window, the evaluation offset, and an option for filling data gaps. For more on using these, see Advanced signal settings. Condition settings Use the Condition settings to: Create a concise, descriptive condition name. Provide a custom violation description for the condition that will be included in violations and notifications. Add the runbook URL to include your organization's procedures for handling incidents. You may also add this information to the custom violation description. Limits on conditions See the maximum values. Health status NRQL alert conditions don't affect an entity's health status display. Examples For more information, see: Expected NRQL syntax Examples of NRQL condition queries Alert threshold types When you create a NRQL alert, you can choose from different types of thresholds: NRQL alert threshold types Description Static This is the simplest type of NRQL threshold. It allows you to create a condition based on a NRQL query that returns a numeric value. Optional: Include a FACET clause. Baseline (Dynamic) Uses a self-adjusting condition based on the past behavior of the monitored values. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type. Outlier Looks for group behavior and values that are outliers from those groups. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type, but requires a FACET clause. Sum of query results (limited or intermittent data) Important Available only for static (basic) threshold types. If a query returns intermittent or limited data, it may be difficult to set a meaningful threshold. Missing or limited data will sometimes generate false positives or false negatives. You can use loss of signal, aggregation duration, and gap filling settings to minimize these false notifications. To avoid this problem when using the static threshold type, you can set the selector to sum of query results. This lets you set the alert on an aggregated sum instead of a value from a single harvest cycle. Up to two hours of one-minute data checks can be aggregated. The duration you select determines the width of the rolling sum and the preview chart will update accordingly. Set the loss of signal threshold Loss of signal occurs when no data matches the NRQL condition over a specific period of time. You can set your loss of signal threshold duration and and also what happens when the threshold is crossed. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Loss of signal is only available for NRQL conditions. You may also manage these settings using the GraphQL API (recommended), or the REST API. Go here for specific GraphQL API examples. Loss of signal settings: Loss of signal settings include a time duration and two possible actions. Signal loss expiration time UI label: Signal is lost after: GraphQL Node: expiration.expirationDuration Expiration duration is a timer that starts and resets when we receive a data point in the streaming alerts pipeline. If we don't receive another data point before your 'expiration time' expires, we consider that signal to be lost. This can be because no data is being sent to New Relic or the WHERE clause of your NRQL query is filtering that data out before it is streamed to the alerts pipeline. The loss of signal expiration time is independent of the threshold duration and triggers as soon as the timer expires. The maximum expiration duration is 48 hours. This is helpful when monitoring for the execution of infrequent jobs. The minimum is 30 seconds, but we recommend using at least 3-5 minutes. Loss of signal actions Once a signal is considered lost, you can close open violations, open new violations, or both. Close all current open violations: This closes all open violations that are related to a specific signal. It won't necessarily close all violations for a condition. If you're alerting on an ephemeral service, or on a sporadic signal, you'll want to choose this action to ensure that violations are closed properly. The GraphQL node name for this is \"closeViolationsOnExpiration\" Open new violations: This will open a new violation when the signal is considered lost. These violations will indicate that they are due to a loss of signal. Based on your incident preferences, this should trigger a notification. The graphQL node name for this is \"openViolationOnExpiration\" When you enable both actions, we'll close all open violations first, and then open a new violation for loss of signal. To create a NRQL alert configured with loss of signal detection in the UI: For a policy, when you create a condition, under Select a product, click NRQL, then click Next, define thresholds. Write a NRQL query that returns the values you want to alert on. For Threshold type, select Static or Baseline. Click + Add lost signal threshold, then set the signal expiration duration time in minutes or seconds in the Signal is lost after field. Choose what you want to happen when the signal is lost. You can check one or both of Close all current open violations and Open new \"lost signal\" violation. These control how loss of signal violations will be handled for the condition. Make sure you name your condition before you save it. Violations open due to loss of signal close when the signal comes back. Newly opened lost signal violations will close immediately when new data is evaluated. the condition they belong to expires. By default, conditions expire after 3 days. you manually close the violation with the Close all current open violations option. Tip Loss of signal detection doesn't work on NRQL queries that use nested aggregation or sub-queries. Advanced signal settings When creating a NRQL alert condition, the advanced signal settings gives you better control over streaming alert data and helps you avoid false alarms. When creating a NRQL condition, there are several advanced signal settings: Aggregation window Evaluation offset Fill data gaps To read an explanation of what these settings are and how they relate to each other, see Streaming alerts concepts. Below are instructions and tips on how to configure them. Aggregation window You can set the aggregation window duration to choose how long data is accumulated in a streaming time window before it's aggregated. You can set it to anything between one second and 15 minutes. The default is one minute. Tip Baseline alert condition thresholds don't support editing the aggregation window. They use the 1 minute default. Evaluation offset You can adjust the evaluation offset to coordinate our streaming alerting algorithm with your data's latency. If it takes a while for your data to arrive, then you may need to increase the evaluation offset. The total supported latency is the product of the aggregation window duration multiplied by the evaluation offset. In the example screenshot above, the supported latency is 3 minutes (a 1-minute aggregation window multiplied by three windows). If the data type comes from an APM language agent and is aggregated from many app instances (for example, Transactions, TransactionErrors, etc.), we recommend using an evaluation offset of 3 with 1 minute aggregation windows. Important When creating NRQL conditions for data collected from Infrastructure Cloud Integrations such as AWS Cloudwatch or Azure, we recommend that you start with an evaluation offset of 15 minutes, then adjust up or down depending on how long it takes to collect your data. Fill data gaps Gap filling lets you customize the values to use when your signals don't have any data. You can fill gaps in your data streams with one of these settings: None: (Default) Choose this if you don't want to take any action on empty aggregation windows. On evaluation, an empty aggregation window will reset the threshold duration timer. For example, if a condition says that all aggregation windows must have data points above the threshold for 5 minutes, and 1 of the 5 aggregation windows is empty, then the condition won't be in violation. Custom static value: Choose this if you'd like to insert a custom static value into the empty aggregation windows before they're evaluated. This option has an additional, required parameter of fillValue (as named in the API) that specifies what static value should be used. This defaults to 0. Last known value: This option inserts the last seen value before evaluation occurs. We maintain the state of the last seen value for 2 hours. Tip The alerts system fills gaps in actively reported signals. This signal history is dropped after 2 hours of inactivity. For gap filling, data points received after this period of inactivity are treated as new signals. To learn more about signal loss, gap filling, and how to request access to these features, see this Explorers Hub post. Options for editing data gap settings: In the NRQL conditions UI, go to Condition settings > Advanced signal settings > fill data gaps with and choose an option. If using our Nerdgraph API (preferred), this node is located at: actor : account : alerts : nrqlCondition : signal : fillOption | fillValue NerdGraph is our recommended API for this but if you're using our REST API, you can find this setting in the REST API explorer under the \"signal\" section of the Alert NRQL conditions API.",

      "body": "Applied Intelligence (AI) is our AIOps solution for DevOps, site reliability engineers, and on-call teams. At its core, Applied Intelligence helps you find, troubleshoot, and resolve problems more quickly. Specifically, it’s a hybrid machine learning engine that reduces alert noise, correlates incidents, and automatically detects anomalies. By applying machine learning to your data and feedback, Applied Intelligence is designed to improve functionality and deliver smarter context over time. After connecting your data sources to Applied Intelligence, it looks for potential problems and improves based on your feedback. Why use Applied Intelligence? How you respond to an incident can mean thousands of dollars or clicks for your company. Applied Intelligence helps you solve problems faster. Feature Description Troubleshoot and respond to incidents Our solution helps you understand your incidents and gives you ideas for what to do next. Here are a few examples: Automatically classifies incidents based on the golden signals of site reliability engineering. Identifies entities in your stack that may relate to the underlying issue. Suggests responses for incidents based on historical context. Less noise, more focus As tools and systems become more complex, alert noise can overwhelm DevOps and SRE teams. Applied Intelligence correlates related incidents and suppresses noise, so you're only notified when human action is required. Incidents with a hybrid approach Applied Intelligence streamlines your incidents by combining its built-in inputs with your knowledge and feedback. Over time, the system delivers more accurate insights. For example: Our correlation and classification engine adjusts based on your feedback. The system automatically suggests new correlation rules based on your production data. You can create custom logic using the decision builder. Automatic anomaly detection Applied Intelligence provides automatic anomaly detection on all your APM-monitored applications. We detect anomalies in throughput, latency, and error rate, with no action required from you. Benefits include: No setup required. See anomalies surfaced automatically in the anomalies feed. See them in various New Relic activity streams (for example, on the New Relic One home page). Ability to run NRQL queries of anomalies and create custom dashboards with that data. Determine root causes with Incident Intelligence As part of Applied Intelligence, Incident Intelligence helps you correlate incident events and reduce noise in your environment. With it, you can get an overview of all your issues, see suggested responders, and configure your own correlation logic. To get started, see Incident Intelligence. Find unknowns with Proactive Detection Another feature of Applied Intelligence is Proactive Detection. Proactive Detection is, by default, always on and detecting anomalies. These anomalies are surfaced in the Applied Intelligence anomalies feed, New Relic One activity streams, and can be queried, alerted on, and added to dashboards. Anomalies can be sent to Slack or via webhooks, and/or added as a source for Incident Intelligence correlation and issue notification. Proactive Detection also provides automatic analysis of anomalies and alerts via the analysis page. To get started, see Proactive Detection.",

      "body": "You can use NRQL queries to create alert conditions. Once you've defined your signal, you can further define your warning and critical threshold levels. This determines when an alerts violation is created. Read on to learn more about how to do this. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Click NRQL, and then Next, define thresholds. Tip For more information on key concepts relating to NRQL alert conditions and streaming alerts, see Streaming alerts: key terms and concepts. Create a NRQL alert condition To create a NRQL alert condition for a policy: On one.newrelic.com, in the header click Alerts & AI, then in the left sidebar click Policies. Select an existing policy or click New alert policy to create a new policy. Click Add a condition. Under Select a product click NRQL, and then click Next, define thresholds. Create a condition from a chart You can use a chart to create a NRQL alert condition. To create a NRQL alerts condition from a chart, click the chart menu , then click Create alert condition. Once you've named and customized your condition, you can add it to an existing policy or create a new one. Caution A small number of our older charts don't include the option to create an alert condition. NRQL alert syntax Here's the basic syntax for creating all NRQL alert conditions. The FACET clause is required for outlier threshold types. It's optional for static and baseline. SELECT function(attribute) FROM Event WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Copy Clause Notes SELECT function(attribute) Required Supported functions that return numbers include: apdex average count latest max min percentage percentile sum uniqueCount Tip If you use the percentile aggregator in a faceted alert condition with many facets, this may cause the following error to appear: An error occurred while fetching chart data. If you see this error, use average instead. FROM data type Required Only one data type can be targeted. Supported data types: Event Metric (RAW data points will be returned) WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Use the WHERE clause to specify a series of one or more conditions. All the operators are supported. FACET attribute Required for outlier conditions Include an optional FACET clause in your NRQL syntax depending on the threshold type: static or baseline. Use the FACET clause to separate your results by attribute and alert on each attribute independently. No LIMIT clause is allowed, but all queries will receive the maximum number of facets possible. Faceted queries can return a maximum of 5000 values for static and baseline conditions and a maximum of 500 values for outlier conditions. Important If the query returns more than the maximum number of values, the alert condition can't be created. If you create the condition and the query returns more than this number later, the alert will fail. Modify your query so that it returns a fewer number of values. Reformatting incompatible NRQL Some elements of NRQL used in charts don’t make sense in the streaming context of alerts. Here’s a list of the most common incompatible elements and suggestions for reformatting a NRQL alert query to achieve the same effect. Element Notes SINCE and UNTIL Example: SELECT percentile(largestContentfulPaint, 75) FROM PageViewTiming WHERE (appId = 837807) SINCE yesterday Copy NRQL Alerting produces a never-ending stream of windowed query results, so the SINCE and UNTIL keywords to scope the query to a point in time are not compatible. As a convenience, we automatically strip SINCE and UNTIL from a query when creating a NRQL Alert Condition from the context of a chart. TIMESERIES In NRQL queries, the TIMESERIES clause is used to return data as a time series broken out by a specified period of time. For NRQL alerts, the equivalent property of a signal is the aggregation window. histogram() The histogram() aggregation function is used to generate histograms. histogram() is not compatible with NRQL alerting: histogram aggregations can not be formatted as a time series. To create an alert from a portion of a histogram (e.g. 95th percentile), use the percentile() aggregation function. Multiple Aggregation Functions Each alert condition can only target a single aggregated stream of data. To alert on multiple streams simultaneously, you’ll need to decompose them into individual conditions within the same policy. Original Query: SELECT count(foo), average(bar), max(baz) from Transaction Copy Decomposed: SELECT count(foo) from Transaction SELECT average(bar) from Transaction SELECT max(baz) from Transaction Copy COMPARE WITH The COMPARE WITH clause is used to compare the values for two different time ranges. This type of query is incompatible with NRQL alerting. We recommend using a Baseline Alert Condition to dynamically detect deviations for a particular signal. SLIDE BY The SLIDE BY clause supports a feature known as sliding windows. With sliding windows, SLIDE BY data is gathered into \"windows\" of time that overlap with each other. These windows can help to smooth out line graphs with a lot of variation in cases where the rolling aggregate (such as a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. Sliding windows are not currently supported in NRQL alerts. LIMIT In NRQL queries, the LIMIT clause is used to control the amount of data a query returns, either the maximum number of facet values returned by FACET queries or the maximum number of items returned by SELECT * queries. LIMIT is not compatible with NRQL alerting: evaluation is always performed on the full result set. NRQL alert threshold examples Here are some common use cases for NRQL alert conditions. These queries will work for static and baseline threshold types. The outlier threshold type will require additional FACET clauses. Alert on specific segments of your data Create constrained alerts that target a specific segment of your data, such as a few key customers or a range of data. Use the WHERE clause to define those conditions. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction WHERE account_id in (91290, 102021, 20230) Copy SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction WHERE name LIKE 'Controller/checkout/%' Copy Alert on Nth percentile of your data Create alerts when an Nth percentile of your data hits a specified threshold; for example, maintaining SLA service levels. Since we evaluate the NRQL query in one-minute time windows, percentiles will be calculated for each minute separately. SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentile(databaseDuration, 75) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on max, min, avg of your data Create alerts when your data hits a certain maximum, minimum, or average; for example, ensuring that a duration or response time does not pass a certain threshold. SELECT max(duration) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on a percentage of your data Create alerts when a proportion of your data goes above or below a certain threshold. SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE duration > 2) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE httpResponseCode = '500') FROM Transaction Copy Alert on Apdex with any T-value Create alerts on Apdex, applying your own T-value for certain transactions. For example, get an alert notification when your Apdex for a T-value of 500ms on transactions for production apps goes below 0.8. SELECT apdex(duration, t:0.5) FROM Transaction WHERE appName like '%prod%' Copy Alert conditions and query order of operations By default, the aggregation window is 1 minute, but you can change the window to suit your needs. Whatever the aggregation window, New Relic will collect data for that window using the function in the NRQL alert condition’s query. The query is parsed and executed by our systems in the following order: FROM clause – which event type needs to be grabbed? WHERE clause – what can be filtered out? SELECT clause – what information needs to be returned from the now-filtered data set? Example: null value returned Let's say this is your alert condition query: SELECT count(*) FROM SyntheticCheck WHERE monitorName = 'My Cool Monitor' AND result = 'FAILURE' Copy If there are no failures for the aggregation window: The system will execute the FROM clause by grabbing all SyntheticCheck events on your account. Then it will execute the WHERE clause to filter through those events by looking only for the ones that match the monitor name and result specified. If there are still events left to scan through after completing the FROM and WHERE operations, the SELECT clause will be executed. If there are no remaining events, the SELECT clause will not be executed. This means that aggregators like count() and uniqueCount() will never return a zero value. When there is a count of 0, the SELECT clause is ignored and no data is returned, resulting in a value of NULL. Example: zero value returned If you have a data source delivering legitimate numeric zeroes, the query will return zero values and not null values. Let's say this is your alert condition query, and that MyCoolEvent is an attribute that can sometimes return a zero value. SELECT average(MyCoolAttribute) FROM MyCoolEvent Copy If, in the aggregation window being evaluated, there's at least one instance of MyCoolEvent and if the average value of all MyCoolAttribute attributes from that window is equal to zero, then a 0 value will be returned. If there are no MyCoolEvent events during that minute, then a NULL will be returned due to the order of operations. Tip For more information about this topic, you can check out our blog post on troubleshooting for zero versus null values. Tip You can determine how null values will be handled by adjusting loss of signal and gap filling settings in the Alert Conditions UI. Tip You can avoid NULL values entirely with a query order of operations shortcut. Do this by using a filter sub-clause, then including all filter elements within that sub-clause. The main body of the query will run and return data, at which point the SELECT clause will then run and apply the filter elements. The query will return a value of 0 if the filter elements result in no matching data. Here's an example: SELECT filter(count(*), WHERE result = 'SUCCESS' AND monitorName = 'My Favorite Monitor') FROM SyntheticCheck Copy Nested aggregation NRQL alerts Nested aggregation queries are a powerful way to query your data. However, they have a few restrictions that are important to note. Nested queries with a non-faceted innermost query are not currently supported Without a FACET, the inner query produces a single result, giving the outer query nothing to aggregate. If you're using a nested query, make sure your inner query is faceted. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu) ​​​​​ Copy Queries at all levels must have the same aggregation window size With an alert aggregation window of 1 minute, the inner query would produce two smaller windows of 30 seconds. In theory, these two windows could be aggregated by the outer query. However, this is not currently supported. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu TIMESERIES 30 seconds)​​ Copy Signal loss is not yet supported for nested queries For more information on signal loss, see NerdGraph API: Loss of signal and gap filling. Nested queries containing 'WITH METRIC_FORMAT' in the inner query are not currently supported You can't use a nested query containing the WITH METRIC_FORMAT in the inner query to create NRQL alert conditions. NRQL condition creation tips Here are some tips for creating and using a NRQL condition: Topic Tips Condition threshold types NRQL condition threshold types include static, baseline, and outlier. Create a description For NRQL conditions, you can create a custom description to add to each violation. Descriptions can be enhanced with variable substitution based on metadata in the specific violation. For details, see Description Query results Queries must return a number. The condition evaluates the returned number against the thresholds you've set. Time period As with all alert conditions, NRQL conditions evaluate one single minute at a time. The implicit SINCE ... UNTIL clause specifying which minute to evaluate is controlled by your Evaluation offset setting. Since very recent data may be incomplete, you may want to query data from 3 minutes ago or longer, especially for: Applications that run on multiple hosts. SyntheticCheck data: Timeouts can take 3 minutes, so 5 minutes or more is recommended. Also, if a query will generate intermittent data, consider using the sum of query results option. Lost signal threshold (loss of signal detection) You can use loss of signal detection to alert on when your data (a telemetry signal) should be considered lost. A signal loss can indicate that a service or entity is no longer online or that a periodic job failed to run. You can also use this to make sure that violations for sporadic data, such as error counts, are closed when no signal is coming in. Advanced signal settings These settings give you options for better handling continuous, streaming data signals that may sometimes be missing. These settings include the aggregation window, the evaluation offset, and an option for filling data gaps. For more on using these, see Advanced signal settings. Condition settings Use the Condition settings to: Create a concise, descriptive condition name. Provide a custom violation description for the condition that will be included in violations and notifications. Add the runbook URL to include your organization's procedures for handling incidents. You may also add this information to the custom violation description. Limits on conditions See the maximum values. Health status NRQL alert conditions don't affect an entity's health status display. Examples For more information, see: Expected NRQL syntax Examples of NRQL condition queries Alert threshold types When you create a NRQL alert, you can choose from different types of thresholds: NRQL alert threshold types Description Static This is the simplest type of NRQL threshold. It allows you to create a condition based on a NRQL query that returns a numeric value. Optional: Include a FACET clause. Baseline (Dynamic) Uses a self-adjusting condition based on the past behavior of the monitored values. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type. Outlier Looks for group behavior and values that are outliers from those groups. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type, but requires a FACET clause. Sum of query results (limited or intermittent data) Important Available only for static (basic) threshold types. If a query returns intermittent or limited data, it may be difficult to set a meaningful threshold. Missing or limited data will sometimes generate false positives or false negatives. You can use loss of signal, aggregation duration, and gap filling settings to minimize these false notifications. To avoid this problem when using the static threshold type, you can set the selector to sum of query results. This lets you set the alert on an aggregated sum instead of a value from a single harvest cycle. Up to two hours of one-minute data checks can be aggregated. The duration you select determines the width of the rolling sum and the preview chart will update accordingly. Set the loss of signal threshold Loss of signal occurs when no data matches the NRQL condition over a specific period of time. You can set your loss of signal threshold duration and and also what happens when the threshold is crossed. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Loss of signal is only available for NRQL conditions. You may also manage these settings using the GraphQL API (recommended), or the REST API. Go here for specific GraphQL API examples. Loss of signal settings: Loss of signal settings include a time duration and two possible actions. Signal loss expiration time UI label: Signal is lost after: GraphQL Node: expiration.expirationDuration Expiration duration is a timer that starts and resets when we receive a data point in the streaming alerts pipeline. If we don't receive another data point before your 'expiration time' expires, we consider that signal to be lost. This can be because no data is being sent to New Relic or the WHERE clause of your NRQL query is filtering that data out before it is streamed to the alerts pipeline. The loss of signal expiration time is independent of the threshold duration and triggers as soon as the timer expires. The maximum expiration duration is 48 hours. This is helpful when monitoring for the execution of infrequent jobs. The minimum is 30 seconds, but we recommend using at least 3-5 minutes. Loss of signal actions Once a signal is considered lost, you can close open violations, open new violations, or both. Close all current open violations: This closes all open violations that are related to a specific signal. It won't necessarily close all violations for a condition. If you're alerting on an ephemeral service, or on a sporadic signal, you'll want to choose this action to ensure that violations are closed properly. The GraphQL node name for this is \"closeViolationsOnExpiration\" Open new violations: This will open a new violation when the signal is considered lost. These violations will indicate that they are due to a loss of signal. Based on your incident preferences, this should trigger a notification. The graphQL node name for this is \"openViolationOnExpiration\" When you enable both actions, we'll close all open violations first, and then open a new violation for loss of signal. To create a NRQL alert configured with loss of signal detection in the UI: For a policy, when you create a condition, under Select a product, click NRQL, then click Next, define thresholds. Write a NRQL query that returns the values you want to alert on. For Threshold type, select Static or Baseline. Click + Add lost signal threshold, then set the signal expiration duration time in minutes or seconds in the Signal is lost after field. Choose what you want to happen when the signal is lost. You can check one or both of Close all current open violations and Open new \"lost signal\" violation. These control how loss of signal violations will be handled for the condition. Make sure you name your condition before you save it. Violations open due to loss of signal close when the signal comes back. Newly opened lost signal violations will close immediately when new data is evaluated. the condition they belong to expires. By default, conditions expire after 3 days. you manually close the violation with the Close all current open violations option. Tip Loss of signal detection doesn't work on NRQL queries that use nested aggregation or sub-queries. Advanced signal settings When creating a NRQL alert condition, the advanced signal settings gives you better control over streaming alert data and helps you avoid false alarms. When creating a NRQL condition, there are several advanced signal settings: Aggregation window Evaluation offset Fill data gaps To read an explanation of what these settings are and how they relate to each other, see Streaming alerts concepts. Below are instructions and tips on how to configure them. Aggregation window You can set the aggregation window duration to choose how long data is accumulated in a streaming time window before it's aggregated. You can set it to anything between one second and 15 minutes. The default is one minute. Tip Baseline alert condition thresholds don't support editing the aggregation window. They use the 1 minute default. Evaluation offset You can adjust the evaluation offset to coordinate our streaming alerting algorithm with your data's latency. If it takes a while for your data to arrive, then you may need to increase the evaluation offset. The total supported latency is the product of the aggregation window duration multiplied by the evaluation offset. In the example screenshot above, the supported latency is 3 minutes (a 1-minute aggregation window multiplied by three windows). If the data type comes from an APM language agent and is aggregated from many app instances (for example, Transactions, TransactionErrors, etc.), we recommend using an evaluation offset of 3 with 1 minute aggregation windows. Important When creating NRQL conditions for data collected from Infrastructure Cloud Integrations such as AWS Cloudwatch or Azure, we recommend that you start with an evaluation offset of 15 minutes, then adjust up or down depending on how long it takes to collect your data. Fill data gaps Gap filling lets you customize the values to use when your signals don't have any data. You can fill gaps in your data streams with one of these settings: None: (Default) Choose this if you don't want to take any action on empty aggregation windows. On evaluation, an empty aggregation window will reset the threshold duration timer. For example, if a condition says that all aggregation windows must have data points above the threshold for 5 minutes, and 1 of the 5 aggregation windows is empty, then the condition won't be in violation. Custom static value: Choose this if you'd like to insert a custom static value into the empty aggregation windows before they're evaluated. This option has an additional, required parameter of fillValue (as named in the API) that specifies what static value should be used. This defaults to 0. Last known value: This option inserts the last seen value before evaluation occurs. We maintain the state of the last seen value for 2 hours. Tip The alerts system fills gaps in actively reported signals. This signal history is dropped after 2 hours of inactivity. For gap filling, data points received after this period of inactivity are treated as new signals. To learn more about signal loss, gap filling, and how to request access to these features, see this Explorers Hub post. Options for editing data gap settings: In the NRQL conditions UI, go to Condition settings > Advanced signal settings > fill data gaps with and choose an option. If using our Nerdgraph API (preferred), this node is located at: actor : account : alerts : nrqlCondition : signal : fillOption | fillValue NerdGraph is our recommended API for this but if you're using our REST API, you can find this setting in the REST API explorer under the \"signal\" section of the Alert NRQL conditions API.",

Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Click NRQL, and then Next, define thresholds. Tip For more information on key concepts relating to NRQL alert conditions and streaming alerts, see Streaming alerts: key terms and concepts. Create a NRQL alert condition To create a NRQL alert condition for a policy: On one.newrelic.com, in the header click Alerts & AI, then in the left sidebar click Policies. Select an existing policy or click New alert policy to create a new policy. Click Add a condition. Under Select a product click NRQL, and then click Next, define thresholds. Create a condition from a chart You can use a chart to create a NRQL alert condition. To create a NRQL alerts condition from a chart, click the chart menu , then click Create alert condition. Once you've named and customized your condition, you can add it to an existing policy or create a new one. Caution A small number of our older charts don't include the option to create an alert condition. NRQL alert syntax Here's the basic syntax for creating all NRQL alert conditions. The FACET clause is required for outlier threshold types. It's optional for static and baseline. SELECT function(attribute) FROM Event WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Copy Clause Notes SELECT function(attribute) Required Supported functions that return numbers include: apdex average count latest max min percentage percentile sum uniqueCount Tip If you use the percentile aggregator in a faceted alert condition with many facets, this may cause the following error to appear: An error occurred while fetching chart data. If you see this error, use average instead. FROM data type Required Only one data type can be targeted. Supported data types: Event Metric (RAW data points will be returned) WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Use the WHERE clause to specify a series of one or more conditions. All the operators are supported. FACET attribute Required for outlier conditions Include an optional FACET clause in your NRQL syntax depending on the threshold type: static or baseline. Use the FACET clause to separate your results by attribute and alert on each attribute independently. No LIMIT clause is allowed, but all queries will receive the maximum number of facets possible. Faceted queries can return a maximum of 5000 values for static and baseline conditions and a maximum of 500 values for outlier conditions. Important If the query returns more than the maximum number of values, the alert condition can't be created. If you create the condition and the query returns more than this number later, the alert will fail. Modify your query so that it returns a fewer number of values. Reformatting incompatible NRQL Some elements of NRQL used in charts don’t make sense in the streaming context of alerts. Here’s a list of the most common incompatible elements and suggestions for reformatting a NRQL alert query to achieve the same effect. Element Notes SINCE and UNTIL Example: SELECT percentile(largestContentfulPaint, 75) FROM PageViewTiming WHERE (appId = 837807) SINCE yesterday Copy NRQL Alerting produces a never-ending stream of windowed query results, so the SINCE and UNTIL keywords to scope the query to a point in time are not compatible. As a convenience, we automatically strip SINCE and UNTIL from a query when creating a NRQL Alert Condition from the context of a chart. TIMESERIES In NRQL queries, the TIMESERIES clause is used to return data as a time series broken out by a specified period of time. For NRQL alerts, the equivalent property of a signal is the aggregation window. histogram() The histogram() aggregation function is used to generate histograms. histogram() is not compatible with NRQL alerting: histogram aggregations can not be formatted as a time series. To create an alert from a portion of a histogram (e.g. 95th percentile), use the percentile() aggregation function. Multiple Aggregation Functions Each alert condition can only target a single aggregated stream of data. To alert on multiple streams simultaneously, you’ll need to decompose them into individual conditions within the same policy. Original Query: SELECT count(foo), average(bar), max(baz) from Transaction Copy Decomposed: SELECT count(foo) from Transaction SELECT average(bar) from Transaction SELECT max(baz) from Transaction Copy COMPARE WITH The COMPARE WITH clause is used to compare the values for two different time ranges. This type of query is incompatible with NRQL alerting. We recommend using a Baseline Alert Condition to dynamically detect deviations for a particular signal. SLIDE BY The SLIDE BY clause supports a feature known as sliding windows. With sliding windows, SLIDE BY data is gathered into \"windows\" of time that overlap with each other. These windows can help to smooth out line graphs with a lot of variation in cases where the rolling aggregate (such as a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. Sliding windows are not currently supported in NRQL alerts. LIMIT In NRQL queries, the LIMIT clause is used to control the amount of data a query returns, either the maximum number of facet values returned by FACET queries or the maximum number of items returned by SELECT * queries. LIMIT is not compatible with NRQL alerting: evaluation is always performed on the full result set. NRQL alert threshold examples Here are some common use cases for NRQL alert conditions. These queries will work for static and baseline threshold types. The outlier threshold type will require additional FACET clauses. Alert on specific segments of your data Create constrained alerts that target a specific segment of your data, such as a few key customers or a range of data. Use the WHERE clause to define those conditions. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction WHERE account_id in (91290, 102021, 20230) Copy SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction WHERE name LIKE 'Controller/checkout/%' Copy Alert on Nth percentile of your data Create alerts when an Nth percentile of your data hits a specified threshold; for example, maintaining SLA service levels. Since we evaluate the NRQL query in one-minute time windows, percentiles will be calculated for each minute separately. SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentile(databaseDuration, 75) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on max, min, avg of your data Create alerts when your data hits a certain maximum, minimum, or average; for example, ensuring that a duration or response time does not pass a certain threshold. SELECT max(duration) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on a percentage of your data Create alerts when a proportion of your data goes above or below a certain threshold. SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE duration > 2) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE httpResponseCode = '500') FROM Transaction Copy Alert on Apdex with any T-value Create alerts on Apdex, applying your own T-value for certain transactions. For example, get an alert notification when your Apdex for a T-value of 500ms on transactions for production apps goes below 0.8. SELECT apdex(duration, t:0.5) FROM Transaction WHERE appName like '%prod%' Copy Alert conditions and query order of operations By default, the aggregation window is 1 minute, but you can change the window to suit your needs. Whatever the aggregation window, New Relic will collect data for that window using the function in the NRQL alert condition’s query. The query is parsed and executed by our systems in the following order: FROM clause – which event type needs to be grabbed? WHERE clause – what can be filtered out? SELECT clause – what information needs to be returned from the now-filtered data set? Example: null value returned Let's say this is your alert condition query: SELECT count(*) FROM SyntheticCheck WHERE monitorName = 'My Cool Monitor' AND result = 'FAILURE' Copy If there are no failures for the aggregation window: The system will execute the FROM clause by grabbing all SyntheticCheck events on your account. Then it will execute the WHERE clause to filter through those events by looking only for the ones that match the monitor name and result specified. If there are still events left to scan through after completing the FROM and WHERE operations, the SELECT clause will be executed. If there are no remaining events, the SELECT clause will not be executed. This means that aggregators like count() and uniqueCount() will never return a zero value. When there is a count of 0, the SELECT clause is ignored and no data is returned, resulting in a value of NULL. Example: zero value returned If you have a data source delivering legitimate numeric zeroes, the query will return zero values and not null values. Let's say this is your alert condition query, and that MyCoolEvent is an attribute that can sometimes return a zero value. SELECT average(MyCoolAttribute) FROM MyCoolEvent Copy If, in the aggregation window being evaluated, there's at least one instance of MyCoolEvent and if the average value of all MyCoolAttribute attributes from that window is equal to zero, then a 0 value will be returned. If there are no MyCoolEvent events during that minute, then a NULL will be returned due to the order of operations. Tip For more information about this topic, you can check out our blog post on troubleshooting for zero versus null values. Tip You can determine how null values will be handled by adjusting loss of signal and gap filling settings in the Alert Conditions UI. Tip You can avoid NULL values entirely with a query order of operations shortcut. Do this by using a filter sub-clause, then including all filter elements within that sub-clause. The main body of the query will run and return data, at which point the SELECT clause will then run and apply the filter elements. The query will return a value of 0 if the filter elements result in no matching data. Here's an example: SELECT filter(count(*), WHERE result = 'SUCCESS' AND monitorName = 'My Favorite Monitor') FROM SyntheticCheck Copy Nested aggregation NRQL alerts Nested aggregation queries are a powerful way to query your data. However, they have a few restrictions that are important to note. Nested queries with a non-faceted innermost query are not currently supported Without a FACET, the inner query produces a single result, giving the outer query nothing to aggregate. If you're using a nested query, make sure your inner query is faceted. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu) ​​​​​ Copy Queries at all levels must have the same aggregation window size With an alert aggregation window of 1 minute, the inner query would produce two smaller windows of 30 seconds. In theory, these two windows could be aggregated by the outer query. However, this is not currently supported. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu TIMESERIES 30 seconds)​​ Copy Signal loss is not yet supported for nested queries For more information on signal loss, see NerdGraph API: Loss of signal and gap filling. Nested queries containing 'WITH METRIC_FORMAT' in the inner query are not currently supported You can't use a nested query containing the WITH METRIC_FORMAT in the inner query to create NRQL alert conditions. NRQL condition creation tips Here are some tips for creating and using a NRQL condition: Topic Tips Condition threshold types NRQL condition threshold types include static, baseline, and outlier. Create a description For NRQL conditions, you can create a custom description to add to each violation. Descriptions can be enhanced with variable substitution based on metadata in the specific violation. For details, see Description Query results Queries must return a number. The condition evaluates the returned number against the thresholds you've set. Time period As with all alert conditions, NRQL conditions evaluate one single minute at a time. The implicit SINCE ... UNTIL clause specifying which minute to evaluate is controlled by your Evaluation offset setting. Since very recent data may be incomplete, you may want to query data from 3 minutes ago or longer, especially for: Applications that run on multiple hosts. SyntheticCheck data: Timeouts can take 3 minutes, so 5 minutes or more is recommended. Also, if a query will generate intermittent data, consider using the sum of query results option. Lost signal threshold (loss of signal detection) You can use loss of signal detection to alert on when your data (a telemetry signal) should be considered lost. A signal loss can indicate that a service or entity is no longer online or that a periodic job failed to run. You can also use this to make sure that violations for sporadic data, such as error counts, are closed when no signal is coming in. Advanced signal settings These settings give you options for better handling continuous, streaming data signals that may sometimes be missing. These settings include the aggregation window, the evaluation offset, and an option for filling data gaps. For more on using these, see Advanced signal settings. Condition settings Use the Condition settings to: Create a concise, descriptive condition name. Provide a custom violation description for the condition that will be included in violations and notifications. Add the runbook URL to include your organization's procedures for handling incidents. You may also add this information to the custom violation description. Limits on conditions See the maximum values. Health status NRQL alert conditions don't affect an entity's health status display. Examples For more information, see: Expected NRQL syntax Examples of NRQL condition queries Alert threshold types When you create a NRQL alert, you can choose from different types of thresholds: NRQL alert threshold types Description Static This is the simplest type of NRQL threshold. It allows you to create a condition based on a NRQL query that returns a numeric value. Optional: Include a FACET clause. Baseline (Dynamic) Uses a self-adjusting condition based on the past behavior of the monitored values. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type. Outlier Looks for group behavior and values that are outliers from those groups. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type, but requires a FACET clause. Sum of query results (limited or intermittent data) Important Available only for static (basic) threshold types. If a query returns intermittent or limited data, it may be difficult to set a meaningful threshold. Missing or limited data will sometimes generate false positives or false negatives. You can use loss of signal, aggregation duration, and gap filling settings to minimize these false notifications. To avoid this problem when using the static threshold type, you can set the selector to sum of query results. This lets you set the alert on an aggregated sum instead of a value from a single harvest cycle. Up to two hours of one-minute data checks can be aggregated. The duration you select determines the width of the rolling sum and the preview chart will update accordingly. Set the loss of signal threshold Loss of signal occurs when no data matches the NRQL condition over a specific period of time. You can set your loss of signal threshold duration and and also what happens when the threshold is crossed. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Loss of signal is only available for NRQL conditions. You may also manage these settings using the GraphQL API (recommended), or the REST API. Go here for specific GraphQL API examples. Loss of signal settings: Loss of signal settings include a time duration and two possible actions. Signal loss expiration time UI label: Signal is lost after: GraphQL Node: expiration.expirationDuration Expiration duration is a timer that starts and resets when we receive a data point in the streaming alerts pipeline. If we don't receive another data point before your 'expiration time' expires, we consider that signal to be lost. This can be because no data is being sent to New Relic or the WHERE clause of your NRQL query is filtering that data out before it is streamed to the alerts pipeline. The loss of signal expiration time is independent of the threshold duration and triggers as soon as the timer expires. The maximum expiration duration is 48 hours. This is helpful when monitoring for the execution of infrequent jobs. The minimum is 30 seconds, but we recommend using at least 3-5 minutes. Loss of signal actions Once a signal is considered lost, you can close open violations, open new violations, or both. Close all current open violations: This closes all open violations that are related to a specific signal. It won't necessarily close all violations for a condition. If you're alerting on an ephemeral service, or on a sporadic signal, you'll want to choose this action to ensure that violations are closed properly. The GraphQL node name for this is \"closeViolationsOnExpiration\" Open new violations: This will open a new violation when the signal is considered lost. These violations will indicate that they are due to a loss of signal. Based on your incident preferences, this should trigger a notification. The graphQL node name for this is \"openViolationOnExpiration\" When you enable both actions, we'll close all open violations first, and then open a new violation for loss of signal. To create a NRQL alert configured with loss of signal detection in the UI: For a policy, when you create a condition, under Select a product, click NRQL, then click Next, define thresholds. Write a NRQL query that returns the values you want to alert on. For Threshold type, select Static or Baseline. Click + Add lost signal threshold, then set the signal expiration duration time in minutes or seconds in the Signal is lost after field. Choose what you want to happen when the signal is lost. You can check one or both of Close all current open violations and Open new \"lost signal\" violation. These control how loss of signal violations will be handled for the condition. Make sure you name your condition before you save it. Violations open due to loss of signal close when the signal comes back. Newly opened lost signal violations will close immediately when new data is evaluated. the condition they belong to expires. By default, conditions expire after 3 days. you manually close the violation with the Close all current open violations option. Tip Loss of signal detection doesn't work on NRQL queries that use nested aggregation or sub-queries. Advanced signal settings When creating a NRQL alert condition, the advanced signal settings gives you better control over streaming alert data and helps you avoid false alarms. When creating a NRQL condition, there are several advanced signal settings: Aggregation window Evaluation offset Fill data gaps To read an explanation of what these settings are and how they relate to each other, see Streaming alerts concepts. Below are instructions and tips on how to configure them. Aggregation window You can set the aggregation window duration to choose how long data is accumulated in a streaming time window before it's aggregated. You can set it to anything between one second and 15 minutes. The default is one minute. Tip Baseline alert condition thresholds don't support editing the aggregation window. They use the 1 minute default. Evaluation offset You can adjust the evaluation offset to coordinate our streaming alerting algorithm with your data's latency. If it takes a while for your data to arrive, then you may need to increase the evaluation offset. The total supported latency is the product of the aggregation window duration multiplied by the evaluation offset. In the example screenshot above, the supported latency is 3 minutes (a 1-minute aggregation window multiplied by three windows). If the data type comes from an APM language agent and is aggregated from many app instances (for example, Transactions, TransactionErrors, etc.), we recommend using an evaluation offset of 3 with 1 minute aggregation windows. Important When creating NRQL conditions for data collected from Infrastructure Cloud Integrations such as AWS Cloudwatch or Azure, we recommend that you start with an evaluation offset of 15 minutes, then adjust up or down depending on how long it takes to collect your data. Fill data gaps Gap filling lets you customize the values to use when your signals don't have any data. You can fill gaps in your data streams with one of these settings: None: (Default) Choose this if you don't want to take any action on empty aggregation windows. On evaluation, an empty aggregation window will reset the threshold duration timer. For example, if a condition says that all aggregation windows must have data points above the threshold for 5 minutes, and 1 of the 5 aggregation windows is empty, then the condition won't be in violation. Custom static value: Choose this if you'd like to insert a custom static value into the empty aggregation windows before they're evaluated. This option has an additional, required parameter of fillValue (as named in the API) that specifies what static value should be used. This defaults to 0. Last known value: This option inserts the last seen value before evaluation occurs. We maintain the state of the last seen value for 2 hours. Tip The alerts system fills gaps in actively reported signals. This signal history is dropped after 2 hours of inactivity. For gap filling, data points received after this period of inactivity are treated as new signals. To learn more about signal loss, gap filling, and how to request access to these features, see this Explorers Hub post. Options for editing data gap settings: In the NRQL conditions UI, go to Condition settings > Advanced signal settings > fill data gaps with and choose an option. If using our Nerdgraph API (preferred), this node is located at: actor : account : alerts : nrqlCondition : signal : fillOption | fillValue NerdGraph is our recommended API for this but if you're using our REST API, you can find this setting in the REST API explorer under the \"signal\" section of the Alert NRQL conditions API.",

This determines when an alerts violation is created. Read on to learn more about how to do this. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Click NRQL, and then Next, define thresholds. Tip For more information on key concepts relating to NRQL alert conditions and streaming alerts, see Streaming alerts: key terms and concepts. Create a NRQL alert condition To create a NRQL alert condition for a policy: On one.newrelic.com, in the header click Alerts & AI, then in the left sidebar click Policies. Select an existing policy or click New alert policy to create a new policy. Click Add a condition. Under Select a product click NRQL, and then click Next, define thresholds. Create a condition from a chart You can use a chart to create a NRQL alert condition. To create a NRQL alerts condition from a chart, click the chart menu , then click Create alert condition. Once you've named and customized your condition, you can add it to an existing policy or create a new one. Caution A small number of our older charts don't include the option to create an alert condition. NRQL alert syntax Here's the basic syntax for creating all NRQL alert conditions. The FACET clause is required for outlier threshold types. It's optional for static and baseline. SELECT function(attribute) FROM Event WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Copy Clause Notes SELECT function(attribute) Required Supported functions that return numbers include: apdex average count latest max min percentage percentile sum uniqueCount Tip If you use the percentile aggregator in a faceted alert condition with many facets, this may cause the following error to appear: An error occurred while fetching chart data. If you see this error, use average instead. FROM data type Required Only one data type can be targeted. Supported data types: Event Metric (RAW data points will be returned) WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Use the WHERE clause to specify a series of one or more conditions. All the operators are supported. FACET attribute Required for outlier conditions Include an optional FACET clause in your NRQL syntax depending on the threshold type: static or baseline. Use the FACET clause to separate your results by attribute and alert on each attribute independently. No LIMIT clause is allowed, but all queries will receive the maximum number of facets possible. Faceted queries can return a maximum of 5000 values for static and baseline conditions and a maximum of 500 values for outlier conditions. Important If the query returns more than the maximum number of values, the alert condition can't be created. If you create the condition and the query returns more than this number later, the alert will fail. Modify your query so that it returns a fewer number of values. Reformatting incompatible NRQL Some elements of NRQL used in charts don’t make sense in the streaming context of alerts. Here’s a list of the most common incompatible elements and suggestions for reformatting a NRQL alert query to achieve the same effect. Element Notes SINCE and UNTIL Example: SELECT percentile(largestContentfulPaint, 75) FROM PageViewTiming WHERE (appId = 837807) SINCE yesterday Copy NRQL Alerting produces a never-ending stream of windowed query results, so the SINCE and UNTIL keywords to scope the query to a point in time are not compatible. As a convenience, we automatically strip SINCE and UNTIL from a query when creating a NRQL Alert Condition from the context of a chart. TIMESERIES In NRQL queries, the TIMESERIES clause is used to return data as a time series broken out by a specified period of time. For NRQL alerts, the equivalent property of a signal is the aggregation window. histogram() The histogram() aggregation function is used to generate histograms. histogram() is not compatible with NRQL alerting: histogram aggregations can not be formatted as a time series. To create an alert from a portion of a histogram (e.g. 95th percentile), use the percentile() aggregation function. Multiple Aggregation Functions Each alert condition can only target a single aggregated stream of data. To alert on multiple streams simultaneously, you’ll need to decompose them into individual conditions within the same policy. Original Query: SELECT count(foo), average(bar), max(baz) from Transaction Copy Decomposed: SELECT count(foo) from Transaction SELECT average(bar) from Transaction SELECT max(baz) from Transaction Copy COMPARE WITH The COMPARE WITH clause is used to compare the values for two different time ranges. This type of query is incompatible with NRQL alerting. We recommend using a Baseline Alert Condition to dynamically detect deviations for a particular signal. SLIDE BY The SLIDE BY clause supports a feature known as sliding windows. With sliding windows, SLIDE BY data is gathered into \"windows\" of time that overlap with each other. These windows can help to smooth out line graphs with a lot of variation in cases where the rolling aggregate (such as a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. Sliding windows are not currently supported in NRQL alerts. LIMIT In NRQL queries, the LIMIT clause is used to control the amount of data a query returns, either the maximum number of facet values returned by FACET queries or the maximum number of items returned by SELECT * queries. LIMIT is not compatible with NRQL alerting: evaluation is always performed on the full result set. NRQL alert threshold examples Here are some common use cases for NRQL alert conditions. These queries will work for static and baseline threshold types. The outlier threshold type will require additional FACET clauses. Alert on specific segments of your data Create constrained alerts that target a specific segment of your data, such as a few key customers or a range of data. Use the WHERE clause to define those conditions. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction WHERE account_id in (91290, 102021, 20230) Copy SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction WHERE name LIKE 'Controller/checkout/%' Copy Alert on Nth percentile of your data Create alerts when an Nth percentile of your data hits a specified threshold; for example, maintaining SLA service levels. Since we evaluate the NRQL query in one-minute time windows, percentiles will be calculated for each minute separately. SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentile(databaseDuration, 75) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on max, min, avg of your data Create alerts when your data hits a certain maximum, minimum, or average; for example, ensuring that a duration or response time does not pass a certain threshold. SELECT max(duration) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on a percentage of your data Create alerts when a proportion of your data goes above or below a certain threshold. SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE duration > 2) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE httpResponseCode = '500') FROM Transaction Copy Alert on Apdex with any T-value Create alerts on Apdex, applying your own T-value for certain transactions. For example, get an alert notification when your Apdex for a T-value of 500ms on transactions for production apps goes below 0.8. SELECT apdex(duration, t:0.5) FROM Transaction WHERE appName like '%prod%' Copy Alert conditions and query order of operations By default, the aggregation window is 1 minute, but you can change the window to suit your needs. Whatever the aggregation window, New Relic will collect data for that window using the function in the NRQL alert condition’s query. The query is parsed and executed by our systems in the following order: FROM clause – which event type needs to be grabbed? WHERE clause – what can be filtered out? SELECT clause – what information needs to be returned from the now-filtered data set? Example: null value returned Let's say this is your alert condition query: SELECT count(*) FROM SyntheticCheck WHERE monitorName = 'My Cool Monitor' AND result = 'FAILURE' Copy If there are no failures for the aggregation window: The system will execute the FROM clause by grabbing all SyntheticCheck events on your account. Then it will execute the WHERE clause to filter through those events by looking only for the ones that match the monitor name and result specified. If there are still events left to scan through after completing the FROM and WHERE operations, the SELECT clause will be executed. If there are no remaining events, the SELECT clause will not be executed. This means that aggregators like count() and uniqueCount() will never return a zero value. When there is a count of 0, the SELECT clause is ignored and no data is returned, resulting in a value of NULL. Example: zero value returned If you have a data source delivering legitimate numeric zeroes, the query will return zero values and not null values. Let's say this is your alert condition query, and that MyCoolEvent is an attribute that can sometimes return a zero value. SELECT average(MyCoolAttribute) FROM MyCoolEvent Copy If, in the aggregation window being evaluated, there's at least one instance of MyCoolEvent and if the average value of all MyCoolAttribute attributes from that window is equal to zero, then a 0 value will be returned. If there are no MyCoolEvent events during that minute, then a NULL will be returned due to the order of operations. Tip For more information about this topic, you can check out our blog post on troubleshooting for zero versus null values. Tip You can determine how null values will be handled by adjusting loss of signal and gap filling settings in the Alert Conditions UI. Tip You can avoid NULL values entirely with a query order of operations shortcut. Do this by using a filter sub-clause, then including all filter elements within that sub-clause. The main body of the query will run and return data, at which point the SELECT clause will then run and apply the filter elements. The query will return a value of 0 if the filter elements result in no matching data. Here's an example: SELECT filter(count(*), WHERE result = 'SUCCESS' AND monitorName = 'My Favorite Monitor') FROM SyntheticCheck Copy Nested aggregation NRQL alerts Nested aggregation queries are a powerful way to query your data. However, they have a few restrictions that are important to note. Nested queries with a non-faceted innermost query are not currently supported Without a FACET, the inner query produces a single result, giving the outer query nothing to aggregate. If you're using a nested query, make sure your inner query is faceted. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu) ​​​​​ Copy Queries at all levels must have the same aggregation window size With an alert aggregation window of 1 minute, the inner query would produce two smaller windows of 30 seconds. In theory, these two windows could be aggregated by the outer query. However, this is not currently supported. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu TIMESERIES 30 seconds)​​ Copy Signal loss is not yet supported for nested queries For more information on signal loss, see NerdGraph API: Loss of signal and gap filling. Nested queries containing 'WITH METRIC_FORMAT' in the inner query are not currently supported You can't use a nested query containing the WITH METRIC_FORMAT in the inner query to create NRQL alert conditions. NRQL condition creation tips Here are some tips for creating and using a NRQL condition: Topic Tips Condition threshold types NRQL condition threshold types include static, baseline, and outlier. Create a description For NRQL conditions, you can create a custom description to add to each violation. Descriptions can be enhanced with variable substitution based on metadata in the specific violation. For details, see Description Query results Queries must return a number. The condition evaluates the returned number against the thresholds you've set. Time period As with all alert conditions, NRQL conditions evaluate one single minute at a time. The implicit SINCE ... UNTIL clause specifying which minute to evaluate is controlled by your Evaluation offset setting. Since very recent data may be incomplete, you may want to query data from 3 minutes ago or longer, especially for: Applications that run on multiple hosts. SyntheticCheck data: Timeouts can take 3 minutes, so 5 minutes or more is recommended. Also, if a query will generate intermittent data, consider using the sum of query results option. Lost signal threshold (loss of signal detection) You can use loss of signal detection to alert on when your data (a telemetry signal) should be considered lost. A signal loss can indicate that a service or entity is no longer online or that a periodic job failed to run. You can also use this to make sure that violations for sporadic data, such as error counts, are closed when no signal is coming in. Advanced signal settings These settings give you options for better handling continuous, streaming data signals that may sometimes be missing. These settings include the aggregation window, the evaluation offset, and an option for filling data gaps. For more on using these, see Advanced signal settings. Condition settings Use the Condition settings to: Create a concise, descriptive condition name. Provide a custom violation description for the condition that will be included in violations and notifications. Add the runbook URL to include your organization's procedures for handling incidents. You may also add this information to the custom violation description. Limits on conditions See the maximum values. Health status NRQL alert conditions don't affect an entity's health status display. Examples For more information, see: Expected NRQL syntax Examples of NRQL condition queries Alert threshold types When you create a NRQL alert, you can choose from different types of thresholds: NRQL alert threshold types Description Static This is the simplest type of NRQL threshold. It allows you to create a condition based on a NRQL query that returns a numeric value. Optional: Include a FACET clause. Baseline (Dynamic) Uses a self-adjusting condition based on the past behavior of the monitored values. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type. Outlier Looks for group behavior and values that are outliers from those groups. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type, but requires a FACET clause. Sum of query results (limited or intermittent data) Important Available only for static (basic) threshold types. If a query returns intermittent or limited data, it may be difficult to set a meaningful threshold. Missing or limited data will sometimes generate false positives or false negatives. You can use loss of signal, aggregation duration, and gap filling settings to minimize these false notifications. To avoid this problem when using the static threshold type, you can set the selector to sum of query results. This lets you set the alert on an aggregated sum instead of a value from a single harvest cycle. Up to two hours of one-minute data checks can be aggregated. The duration you select determines the width of the rolling sum and the preview chart will update accordingly. Set the loss of signal threshold Loss of signal occurs when no data matches the NRQL condition over a specific period of time. You can set your loss of signal threshold duration and and also what happens when the threshold is crossed. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Loss of signal is only available for NRQL conditions. You may also manage these settings using the GraphQL API (recommended), or the REST API. Go here for specific GraphQL API examples. Loss of signal settings: Loss of signal settings include a time duration and two possible actions. Signal loss expiration time UI label: Signal is lost after: GraphQL Node: expiration.expirationDuration Expiration duration is a timer that starts and resets when we receive a data point in the streaming alerts pipeline. If we don't receive another data point before your 'expiration time' expires, we consider that signal to be lost. This can be because no data is being sent to New Relic or the WHERE clause of your NRQL query is filtering that data out before it is streamed to the alerts pipeline. The loss of signal expiration time is independent of the threshold duration and triggers as soon as the timer expires. The maximum expiration duration is 48 hours. This is helpful when monitoring for the execution of infrequent jobs. The minimum is 30 seconds, but we recommend using at least 3-5 minutes. Loss of signal actions Once a signal is considered lost, you can close open violations, open new violations, or both. Close all current open violations: This closes all open violations that are related to a specific signal. It won't necessarily close all violations for a condition. If you're alerting on an ephemeral service, or on a sporadic signal, you'll want to choose this action to ensure that violations are closed properly. The GraphQL node name for this is \"closeViolationsOnExpiration\" Open new violations: This will open a new violation when the signal is considered lost. These violations will indicate that they are due to a loss of signal. Based on your incident preferences, this should trigger a notification. The graphQL node name for this is \"openViolationOnExpiration\" When you enable both actions, we'll close all open violations first, and then open a new violation for loss of signal. To create a NRQL alert configured with loss of signal detection in the UI: For a policy, when you create a condition, under Select a product, click NRQL, then click Next, define thresholds. Write a NRQL query that returns the values you want to alert on. For Threshold type, select Static or Baseline. Click + Add lost signal threshold, then set the signal expiration duration time in minutes or seconds in the Signal is lost after field. Choose what you want to happen when the signal is lost. You can check one or both of Close all current open violations and Open new \"lost signal\" violation. These control how loss of signal violations will be handled for the condition. Make sure you name your condition before you save it. Violations open due to loss of signal close when the signal comes back. Newly opened lost signal violations will close immediately when new data is evaluated. the condition they belong to expires. By default, conditions expire after 3 days. you manually close the violation with the Close all current open violations option. Tip Loss of signal detection doesn't work on NRQL queries that use nested aggregation or sub-queries. Advanced signal settings When creating a NRQL alert condition, the advanced signal settings gives you better control over streaming alert data and helps you avoid false alarms. When creating a NRQL condition, there are several advanced signal settings: Aggregation window Evaluation offset Fill data gaps To read an explanation of what these settings are and how they relate to each other, see Streaming alerts concepts. Below are instructions and tips on how to configure them. Aggregation window You can set the aggregation window duration to choose how long data is accumulated in a streaming time window before it's aggregated. You can set it to anything between one second and 15 minutes. The default is one minute. Tip Baseline alert condition thresholds don't support editing the aggregation window. They use the 1 minute default. Evaluation offset You can adjust the evaluation offset to coordinate our streaming alerting algorithm with your data's latency. If it takes a while for your data to arrive, then you may need to increase the evaluation offset. The total supported latency is the product of the aggregation window duration multiplied by the evaluation offset. In the example screenshot above, the supported latency is 3 minutes (a 1-minute aggregation window multiplied by three windows). If the data type comes from an APM language agent and is aggregated from many app instances (for example, Transactions, TransactionErrors, etc.), we recommend using an evaluation offset of 3 with 1 minute aggregation windows. Important When creating NRQL conditions for data collected from Infrastructure Cloud Integrations such as AWS Cloudwatch or Azure, we recommend that you start with an evaluation offset of 15 minutes, then adjust up or down depending on how long it takes to collect your data. Fill data gaps Gap filling lets you customize the values to use when your signals don't have any data. You can fill gaps in your data streams with one of these settings: None: (Default) Choose this if you don't want to take any action on empty aggregation windows. On evaluation, an empty aggregation window will reset the threshold duration timer. For example, if a condition says that all aggregation windows must have data points above the threshold for 5 minutes, and 1 of the 5 aggregation windows is empty, then the condition won't be in violation. Custom static value: Choose this if you'd like to insert a custom static value into the empty aggregation windows before they're evaluated. This option has an additional, required parameter of fillValue (as named in the API) that specifies what static value should be used. This defaults to 0. Last known value: This option inserts the last seen value before evaluation occurs. We maintain the state of the last seen value for 2 hours. Tip The alerts system fills gaps in actively reported signals. This signal history is dropped after 2 hours of inactivity. For gap filling, data points received after this period of inactivity are treated as new signals. To learn more about signal loss, gap filling, and how to request access to these features, see this Explorers Hub post. Options for editing data gap settings: In the NRQL conditions UI, go to Condition settings > Advanced signal settings > fill data gaps with and choose an option. If using our Nerdgraph API (preferred), this node is located at: actor : account : alerts : nrqlCondition : signal : fillOption | fillValue NerdGraph is our recommended API for this but if you're using our REST API, you can find this setting in the REST API explorer under the \"signal\" section of the Alert NRQL conditions API.",
