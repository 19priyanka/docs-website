      "body": "The New Relic Ruby agent provides a public API with documentation available on GitHub. The GitHub documentation tells you how to set up custom instrumentation of your Ruby app and collect more in-depth data: Overview Public API methods The following sections explain common goals, solutions, and links to relevant parts of the documentation. Important When using the Ruby agent API, ensure that you have the latest Ruby agent release. Several APIs used in the following examples require Ruby agent version 4.6.0 or higher. Instrument missing sections of your code with transactions To instrument your app, New Relic separates each path through your code into its own transaction. New Relic times (or \"instruments\") the parent method in these transactions to measure your app's overall performance, and collects transaction traces from long-running transactions for additional detail. Use these methods when New Relic is not instrumenting a particular part of your code at all: If you want to... Do this... Time a method New Relic is not instrumenting automatically Create a new transaction. See Tracing transaction entry points. Time something other than a single method call Use the Tracer API. Prevent a transaction from reporting to New Relic Ignore the transaction. Time specific methods using segments If a transaction is already visible in the New Relic UI, but you don't have enough data about a particular method that was called during that transaction, you can create segments to time those individual methods in greater detail. For example, you might want to time a particularly critical method with complex logic. Use these methods when you want to instrument a method within an existing transaction: If you want to... Do this... Time a particular method See Method tracers. Time something other than a single method call Use the Tracer API. Enhance the metadata of a transaction Sometimes the code you are targeting is visible in the New Relic UI, but some details of the method are not useful. For example: The default name is causing a metric grouping issue. You want to add custom attributes to your transactions so you can filter them in the query builder. Use these methods when you want to change how New Relic instruments a transaction that is already visible in the New Relic UI: If you want to... Do this... Change the name of a transaction See Naming transactions. Add metadata (such as your customer's account name or subscription level) to your transactions Use custom attributes. See Adding custom attributes. Mark a transaction as a background job See Monitor custom background jobs. Mark a transaction as a web transaction Pass a :category => :controller option to set_transaction_name(). For more information, see Naming transactions. Prevent a transaction from affecting your Apdex score See Ignoring Apdex contributions. Collect or ignore errors Usually the agent detects errors automatically. However, you can manually mark an error with the agent. You can also mark errors as ignored or expected. If you want to... Do this... Report an error the agent does not report automatically See Sending New Relic handled errors. Prevent the agent from reporting an error at all Mark the error as ignored. See Error Collector to use the error_collector.ignore_errors config option. Prevent an error from affecting your Apdex or error rate, but still report it to New Relic Mark the error as expected. See Sending New Relic handled errors, and set :expected to true. Send custom event and metric data from your app APM includes a number of ways to record arbitrary custom data. For an explanation of New Relic data types, see Data collection. If you want to... Do this... Send data about an event so you can analyze it in dashboards Create a custom event. See record_custom_event(). Tag your events with metadata to filter and facet them in dashboards or error analytics Add custom attributes. Pass a hash of attributes to record_custom_event(). Report custom performance data Create a custom metric. See record_metric(). Control the browser agent Usually the browser agent is added automatically to your pages or deployed by copy/pasting the JavaScript snippet. For more information about these recommended methods, see Add apps to browser monitoring. However, you can also retrieve the browser agent via APM agent API calls. For more information, see browser_timing_header(). Instrument calls to datastores Use these methods to collect data about your app's connections to other datastores: If you want to... Do this... Time a call to a datastore not instrumented automatically by New Relic See wrap(). Time a datastore call that can't cleanly be wrapped in a Ruby block See Tracer.start_datastore_segment(). You must call finish on the object returned by this method. Capture SQL queries along with timing See notice_sql(). Capture non-SQL queries along with timing See notice_statement(). Instrument calls to externals Use these methods to collect data for external requests: If you want to... Do this... Time a call to an external request not instrumented automatically by New Relic Use Tracer.start_external_segment(). You must call finish on the object returned by this method. Add cross-application tracing (CAT) headers to an outbound HTTP request Use add_request_headers(). Read CAT headers from an inbound HTTP request Use read_response_headers(). Generate an obfuscated string to transport CAT information in an outbound request Use get_request_metadata(). Process an obfuscated string containing CAT information received from an inbound request Use process_response_metadata(). Instrument calls for distributed tracing Important The following API examples require Ruby agent version 6.9.0 or higher. These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. Distributed tracing lets you see the paths requests take as they travel through a distributed system. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. If you want to... Do this... Send a payload/header to the called service. See insert_distributed_trace_headers(). Accept a payload/header received from the first service, which will link these services together in a trace See accept_distributed_trace_headers().",

      "body": "The New Relic Ruby agent provides a public API with documentation available on GitHub. The GitHub documentation tells you how to set up custom instrumentation of your Ruby app and collect more in-depth data: Overview Public API methods The following sections explain common goals, solutions, and links to relevant parts of the documentation. Important When using the Ruby agent API, ensure that you have the latest Ruby agent release. Several APIs used in the following examples require Ruby agent version 4.6.0 or higher. Instrument missing sections of your code with transactions To instrument your app, New Relic separates each path through your code into its own transaction. New Relic times (or \"instruments\") the parent method in these transactions to measure your app's overall performance, and collects transaction traces from long-running transactions for additional detail. Use these methods when New Relic is not instrumenting a particular part of your code at all: If you want to... Do this... Time a method New Relic is not instrumenting automatically Create a new transaction. See Tracing transaction entry points. Time something other than a single method call Use the Tracer API. Prevent a transaction from reporting to New Relic Ignore the transaction. Time specific methods using segments If a transaction is already visible in the New Relic UI, but you don't have enough data about a particular method that was called during that transaction, you can create segments to time those individual methods in greater detail. For example, you might want to time a particularly critical method with complex logic. Use these methods when you want to instrument a method within an existing transaction: If you want to... Do this... Time a particular method See Method tracers. Time something other than a single method call Use the Tracer API. Enhance the metadata of a transaction Sometimes the code you are targeting is visible in the New Relic UI, but some details of the method are not useful. For example: The default name is causing a metric grouping issue. You want to add custom attributes to your transactions so you can filter them in the query builder. Use these methods when you want to change how New Relic instruments a transaction that is already visible in the New Relic UI: If you want to... Do this... Change the name of a transaction See Naming transactions. Add metadata (such as your customer's account name or subscription level) to your transactions Use custom attributes. See Adding custom attributes. Mark a transaction as a background job See Monitor custom background jobs. Mark a transaction as a web transaction Pass a :category => :controller option to set_transaction_name(). For more information, see Naming transactions. Prevent a transaction from affecting your Apdex score See Ignoring Apdex contributions. Collect or ignore errors Usually the agent detects errors automatically. However, you can manually mark an error with the agent. You can also mark errors as ignored or expected. If you want to... Do this... Report an error the agent does not report automatically See Sending New Relic handled errors. Prevent the agent from reporting an error at all Mark the error as ignored. See Error Collector to use the error_collector.ignore_errors config option. Prevent an error from affecting your Apdex or error rate, but still report it to New Relic Mark the error as expected. See Sending New Relic handled errors, and set :expected to true. Send custom event and metric data from your app APM includes a number of ways to record arbitrary custom data. For an explanation of New Relic data types, see Data collection. If you want to... Do this... Send data about an event so you can analyze it in dashboards Create a custom event. See record_custom_event(). Tag your events with metadata to filter and facet them in dashboards or error analytics Add custom attributes. Pass a hash of attributes to record_custom_event(). Report custom performance data Create a custom metric. See record_metric(). Control the browser agent Usually the browser agent is added automatically to your pages or deployed by copy/pasting the JavaScript snippet. For more information about these recommended methods, see Add apps to browser monitoring. However, you can also retrieve the browser agent via APM agent API calls. For more information, see browser_timing_header(). Instrument calls to datastores Use these methods to collect data about your app's connections to other datastores: If you want to... Do this... Time a call to a datastore not instrumented automatically by New Relic See wrap(). Time a datastore call that can't cleanly be wrapped in a Ruby block See Tracer.start_datastore_segment(). You must call finish on the object returned by this method. Capture SQL queries along with timing See notice_sql(). Capture non-SQL queries along with timing See notice_statement(). Instrument calls to externals Use these methods to collect data for external requests: If you want to... Do this... Time a call to an external request not instrumented automatically by New Relic Use Tracer.start_external_segment(). You must call finish on the object returned by this method. Add cross-application tracing (CAT) headers to an outbound HTTP request Use add_request_headers(). Read CAT headers from an inbound HTTP request Use read_response_headers(). Generate an obfuscated string to transport CAT information in an outbound request Use get_request_metadata(). Process an obfuscated string containing CAT information received from an inbound request Use process_response_metadata(). Instrument calls for distributed tracing Important The following API examples require Ruby agent version 6.9.0 or higher. These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. Distributed tracing lets you see the paths requests take as they travel through a distributed system. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. If you want to... Do this... Send a payload/header to the called service. See insert_distributed_trace_headers(). Accept a payload/header received from the first service, which will link these services together in a trace See accept_distributed_trace_headers().",

      "body": "New Relic for Ruby allows you to selectively disable instrumentation for particular requests within your Rails or Sinatra application. Blocking all instrumentation Call newrelic_ignore with no arguments from within a Rails controller or Sinatra application to prevent instrumentation of all requests serviced by that controller or application: newrelic_ignore Copy Using newrelic_ignore prevents the agent from recording any performance data (metrics, transaction traces, events, traced errors, and so on) for the targeted transactions, and will also prevent the transactions from contributing to your overall Apdex score. Ignoring specific actions with Rails If you want to ignore only specific actions with a Rails controller, you can use the :only or :except options with newrelic_ignore. For example, to ignore only the index and show actions on the controller, use: newrelic_ignore :only => [:index, :show] Copy To ignore all actions on the controller except index: newrelic_ignore :except => [:index] Copy Ignoring specific routes with Sinatra If you want to ignore only specific routes within your Sinatra application, you can pass a Sinatra-style route definition to newrelic_ignore from within your Sinatra application. For more information, see Sinatra: Ignoring routes. Ignoring Apdex contributions If you want to prevent all actions in a controller from contributing to your Apdex score, but still want other performance data, use newrelic_ignore_apdex: newrelic_ignore_apdex Copy In a Rails application, newrelic_ignore_apdex supports the same :only and :except options as newrelic_ignore. In a Sinatra application, it will accept the same Sinatra-style route for targeting specific transactions. Blocking browser instrumentation Using newrelic_ignore_enduser prevents the agent from automatically inserting the JavaScript used to capture browser monitoring data. Server-side instrumentation will be unaffected. To prevent browser agent injection for all actions in a controller, add a call like this to the controller class: newrelic_ignore_enduser Copy In a Rails application, newrelic_ignore_enduser supports the same :only and :except options as newrelic_ignore. In a Sinatra application, it will accept the same Sinatra-style route for targeting specific transactions. Ignoring transactions dynamically In some cases, you may want to base the decision to ignore a specific transaction on criteria only known at runtime, during the request. For scenarios like this, the declarative mechanisms explained above aren't a good fit. Starting in Ruby agent version 3.9.2, you can instead use the following family of API calls from any point within your transaction: NewRelic::Agent.ignore_transaction NewRelic::Agent.ignore_apdex NewRelic::Agent.ignore_enduser Copy These methods will have a similar results to the newrelic_ignore, newrelic_ignore_apdex, and newrelic_ignore_enduser calls, but can be called during a request instead of during the class definition. Ignoring transactions by URL with configuration You can ignore transactions by URL using the rules.ignore_url_regexes configuration setting: rules: ignore_url_regexes: [\"secret\", \"^/admin\"] Copy This configuration will only prevent Transaction events that match the set pattern from reporting. Use any of the newrelic_ignore* family of methods if you would like to prevent all data, such as trace data, from reporting from a transaction. Note that regexes do not include any type of anchoring by default. The /secret/ regex will match 'newrelic.com/secret/login' and it will also match 'newrelic.com/users/secretpanda'. The anchored admin regex will match 'newrelic.com/admin/praetorians' but it will not match 'newrelic.com/users/totally-real-admin'. If necessary you may also provide a list of regexes in a comma-separated string, allowing you to set ignore regexes with an environment variable: NEW_RELIC_RULES_IGNORE_URL_REGEXES=\"secret,^/admin\" Copy As always configuration from environment variables will override configuration in newrelic.yml. Troubleshooting The newrelic_ignore* family of methods will only work from within Rails controller classes, or Sinatra applications (subclasses of Sinatra::Base). Other applications should use the NewRelic::Agent.ignore_* family of calls from within each request that you would like to ignore, which will work in any context. If you get a NoMethodError when trying to use newrelic_ignore from within a Rails controller or Sinatra application, make sure that newrelic_rpm has been required before you try to call newrelic_ignore inside of your class definition.

Use these methods when you want to change how New Relic instruments a transaction that is already visible in the New Relic UI: If you want to... Do this... Change the name of a transaction See Naming transactions. Add metadata (such as your customer's account name or subscription level) to your transactions Use custom attributes. See Adding custom attributes. Mark a transaction as a background job See Monitor custom background jobs. Mark a transaction as a web transaction Pass a :category => :controller option to set_transaction_name(). For more information, see Naming transactions. Prevent a transaction from affecting your Apdex score See Ignoring Apdex contributions. Collect or ignore errors Usually the agent detects errors automatically. However, you can manually mark an error with the agent. You can also mark errors as ignored or expected. If you want to... Do this... Report an error the agent does not report automatically See Sending New Relic handled errors. Prevent the agent from reporting an error at all Mark the error as ignored. See Error Collector to use the error_collector.ignore_errors config option. Prevent an error from affecting your Apdex or error rate, but still report it to New Relic Mark the error as expected. See Sending New Relic handled errors, and set :expected to true. Send custom event and metric data from your app APM includes a number of ways to record arbitrary custom data. For an explanation of New Relic data types, see Data collection. If you want to... Do this... Send data about an event so you can analyze it in dashboards Create a custom event. See record_custom_event(). Tag your events with metadata to filter and facet them in dashboards or error analytics Add custom attributes. Pass a hash of attributes to record_custom_event(). Report custom performance data Create a custom metric. See record_metric(). Control the browser agent Usually the browser agent is added automatically to your pages or deployed by copy/pasting the JavaScript snippet. For more information about these recommended methods, see Add apps to browser monitoring. However, you can also retrieve the browser agent via APM agent API calls. For more information, see browser_timing_header(). Instrument calls to datastores Use these methods to collect data about your app's connections to other datastores: If you want to... Do this... Time a call to a datastore not instrumented automatically by New Relic See wrap(). Time a datastore call that can't cleanly be wrapped in a Ruby block See Tracer.start_datastore_segment(). You must call finish on the object returned by this method. Capture SQL queries along with timing See notice_sql(). Capture non-SQL queries along with timing See notice_statement(). Instrument calls to externals Use these methods to collect data for external requests: If you want to... Do this... Time a call to an external request not instrumented automatically by New Relic Use Tracer.start_external_segment(). You must call finish on the object returned by this method. Add cross-application tracing (CAT) headers to an outbound HTTP request Use add_request_headers(). Read CAT headers from an inbound HTTP request Use read_response_headers(). Generate an obfuscated string to transport CAT information in an outbound request Use get_request_metadata(). Process an obfuscated string containing CAT information received from an inbound request Use process_response_metadata(). Instrument calls for distributed tracing Important The following API examples require Ruby agent version 6.9.0 or higher. These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. Distributed tracing lets you see the paths requests take as they travel through a distributed system. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. If you want to... Do this... Send a payload/header to the called service. See insert_distributed_trace_headers(). Accept a payload/header received from the first service, which will link these services together in a trace See accept_distributed_trace_headers().",

      "body": "New Relic for Ruby allows you to selectively disable instrumentation for particular requests within your Rails or Sinatra application. Blocking all instrumentation Call newrelic_ignore with no arguments from within a Rails controller or Sinatra application to prevent instrumentation of all requests serviced by that controller or application: newrelic_ignore Copy Using newrelic_ignore prevents the agent from recording any performance data (metrics, transaction traces, events, traced errors, and so on) for the targeted transactions, and will also prevent the transactions from contributing to your overall Apdex score. Ignoring specific actions with Rails If you want to ignore only specific actions with a Rails controller, you can use the :only or :except options with newrelic_ignore. For example, to ignore only the index and show actions on the controller, use: newrelic_ignore :only => [:index, :show] Copy To ignore all actions on the controller except index: newrelic_ignore :except => [:index] Copy Ignoring specific routes with Sinatra If you want to ignore only specific routes within your Sinatra application, you can pass a Sinatra-style route definition to newrelic_ignore from within your Sinatra application. For more information, see Sinatra: Ignoring routes. Ignoring Apdex contributions If you want to prevent all actions in a controller from contributing to your Apdex score, but still want other performance data, use newrelic_ignore_apdex: newrelic_ignore_apdex Copy In a Rails application, newrelic_ignore_apdex supports the same :only and :except options as newrelic_ignore. In a Sinatra application, it will accept the same Sinatra-style route for targeting specific transactions. Blocking browser instrumentation Using newrelic_ignore_enduser prevents the agent from automatically inserting the JavaScript used to capture browser monitoring data. Server-side instrumentation will be unaffected. To prevent browser agent injection for all actions in a controller, add a call like this to the controller class: newrelic_ignore_enduser Copy In a Rails application, newrelic_ignore_enduser supports the same :only and :except options as newrelic_ignore. In a Sinatra application, it will accept the same Sinatra-style route for targeting specific transactions. Ignoring transactions dynamically In some cases, you may want to base the decision to ignore a specific transaction on criteria only known at runtime, during the request. For scenarios like this, the declarative mechanisms explained above aren't a good fit. Starting in Ruby agent version 3.9.2, you can instead use the following family of API calls from any point within your transaction: NewRelic::Agent.ignore_transaction NewRelic::Agent.ignore_apdex NewRelic::Agent.ignore_enduser Copy These methods will have a similar results to the newrelic_ignore, newrelic_ignore_apdex, and newrelic_ignore_enduser calls, but can be called during a request instead of during the class definition. Ignoring transactions by URL with configuration You can ignore transactions by URL using the rules.ignore_url_regexes configuration setting: rules: ignore_url_regexes: [\"secret\", \"^/admin\"] Copy This configuration will only prevent Transaction events that match the set pattern from reporting. Use any of the newrelic_ignore* family of methods if you would like to prevent all data, such as trace data, from reporting from a transaction. Note that regexes do not include any type of anchoring by default. The /secret/ regex will match 'newrelic.com/secret/login' and it will also match 'newrelic.com/users/secretpanda'. The anchored admin regex will match 'newrelic.com/admin/praetorians' but it will not match 'newrelic.com/users/totally-real-admin'. If necessary you may also provide a list of regexes in a comma-separated string, allowing you to set ignore regexes with an environment variable: NEW_RELIC_RULES_IGNORE_URL_REGEXES=\"secret,^/admin\" Copy As always configuration from environment variables will override configuration in newrelic.yml. Troubleshooting The newrelic_ignore* family of methods will only work from within Rails controller classes, or Sinatra applications (subclasses of Sinatra::Base). Other applications should use the NewRelic::Agent.ignore_* family of calls from within each request that you would like to ignore, which will work in any context. If you get a NoMethodError when trying to use newrelic_ignore from within a Rails controller or Sinatra application, make sure that newrelic_rpm has been required before you try to call newrelic_ignore inside of your class definition.

The GitHub documentation tells you how to set up custom instrumentation of your Ruby app and collect more in-depth data: Overview Public API methods The following sections explain common goals, solutions, and links to relevant parts of the documentation. Important When using the Ruby agent API, ensure that you have the latest Ruby agent release. Several APIs used in the following examples require Ruby agent version 4.6.0 or higher. Instrument missing sections of your code with transactions To instrument your app, New Relic separates each path through your code into its own transaction. New Relic times (or \"instruments\") the parent method in these transactions to measure your app's overall performance, and collects transaction traces from long-running transactions for additional detail. Use these methods when New Relic is not instrumenting a particular part of your code at all: If you want to... Do this... Time a method New Relic is not instrumenting automatically Create a new transaction. See Tracing transaction entry points. Time something other than a single method call Use the Tracer API. Prevent a transaction from reporting to New Relic Ignore the transaction. Time specific methods using segments If a transaction is already visible in the New Relic UI, but you don't have enough data about a particular method that was called during that transaction, you can create segments to time those individual methods in greater detail. For example, you might want to time a particularly critical method with complex logic. Use these methods when you want to instrument a method within an existing transaction: If you want to... Do this... Time a particular method See Method tracers. Time something other than a single method call Use the Tracer API.

      "body": "New Relic for Ruby allows you to selectively disable instrumentation for particular requests within your Rails or Sinatra application. Blocking all instrumentation Call newrelic_ignore with no arguments from within a Rails controller or Sinatra application to prevent instrumentation of all requests serviced by that controller or application: newrelic_ignore Copy Using newrelic_ignore prevents the agent from recording any performance data (metrics, transaction traces, events, traced errors, and so on) for the targeted transactions, and will also prevent the transactions from contributing to your overall Apdex score. Ignoring specific actions with Rails If you want to ignore only specific actions with a Rails controller, you can use the :only or :except options with newrelic_ignore. For example, to ignore only the index and show actions on the controller, use: newrelic_ignore :only => [:index, :show] Copy To ignore all actions on the controller except index: newrelic_ignore :except => [:index] Copy Ignoring specific routes with Sinatra If you want to ignore only specific routes within your Sinatra application, you can pass a Sinatra-style route definition to newrelic_ignore from within your Sinatra application. For more information, see Sinatra: Ignoring routes. Ignoring Apdex contributions If you want to prevent all actions in a controller from contributing to your Apdex score, but still want other performance data, use newrelic_ignore_apdex: newrelic_ignore_apdex Copy In a Rails application, newrelic_ignore_apdex supports the same :only and :except options as newrelic_ignore. In a Sinatra application, it will accept the same Sinatra-style route for targeting specific transactions. Blocking browser instrumentation Using newrelic_ignore_enduser prevents the agent from automatically inserting the JavaScript used to capture browser monitoring data. Server-side instrumentation will be unaffected. To prevent browser agent injection for all actions in a controller, add a call like this to the controller class: newrelic_ignore_enduser Copy In a Rails application, newrelic_ignore_enduser supports the same :only and :except options as newrelic_ignore. In a Sinatra application, it will accept the same Sinatra-style route for targeting specific transactions. Ignoring transactions dynamically In some cases, you may want to base the decision to ignore a specific transaction on criteria only known at runtime, during the request. For scenarios like this, the declarative mechanisms explained above aren't a good fit. Starting in Ruby agent version 3.9.2, you can instead use the following family of API calls from any point within your transaction: NewRelic::Agent.ignore_transaction NewRelic::Agent.ignore_apdex NewRelic::Agent.ignore_enduser Copy These methods will have a similar results to the newrelic_ignore, newrelic_ignore_apdex, and newrelic_ignore_enduser calls, but can be called during a request instead of during the class definition. Ignoring transactions by URL with configuration You can ignore transactions by URL using the rules.ignore_url_regexes configuration setting: rules: ignore_url_regexes: [\"secret\", \"^/admin\"] Copy This configuration will only prevent Transaction events that match the set pattern from reporting. Use any of the newrelic_ignore* family of methods if you would like to prevent all data, such as trace data, from reporting from a transaction. Note that regexes do not include any type of anchoring by default. The /secret/ regex will match 'newrelic.com/secret/login' and it will also match 'newrelic.com/users/secretpanda'. The anchored admin regex will match 'newrelic.com/admin/praetorians' but it will not match 'newrelic.com/users/totally-real-admin'. If necessary you may also provide a list of regexes in a comma-separated string, allowing you to set ignore regexes with an environment variable: NEW_RELIC_RULES_IGNORE_URL_REGEXES=\"secret,^/admin\" Copy As always configuration from environment variables will override configuration in newrelic.yml. Troubleshooting The newrelic_ignore* family of methods will only work from within Rails controller classes, or Sinatra applications (subclasses of Sinatra::Base). Other applications should use the NewRelic::Agent.ignore_* family of calls from within each request that you would like to ignore, which will work in any context. If you get a NoMethodError when trying to use newrelic_ignore from within a Rails controller or Sinatra application, make sure that newrelic_rpm has been required before you try to call newrelic_ignore inside of your class definition.

Capability Integration Browser monitoring The Ruby agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see the browser and Ruby agent documentation. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in infrastructure monitoring. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from Synthetics monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

      "body": "The New Relic Ruby agent provides a public API with documentation available on GitHub. The GitHub documentation tells you how to set up custom instrumentation of your Ruby app and collect more in-depth data: Overview Public API methods The following sections explain common goals, solutions, and links to relevant parts of the documentation. Important When using the Ruby agent API, ensure that you have the latest Ruby agent release. Several APIs used in the following examples require Ruby agent version 4.6.0 or higher. Instrument missing sections of your code with transactions To instrument your app, New Relic separates each path through your code into its own transaction. New Relic times (or \"instruments\") the parent method in these transactions to measure your app's overall performance, and collects transaction traces from long-running transactions for additional detail. Use these methods when New Relic is not instrumenting a particular part of your code at all: If you want to... Do this... Time a method New Relic is not instrumenting automatically Create a new transaction. See Tracing transaction entry points. Time something other than a single method call Use the Tracer API. Prevent a transaction from reporting to New Relic Ignore the transaction. Time specific methods using segments If a transaction is already visible in the New Relic UI, but you don't have enough data about a particular method that was called during that transaction, you can create segments to time those individual methods in greater detail. For example, you might want to time a particularly critical method with complex logic. Use these methods when you want to instrument a method within an existing transaction: If you want to... Do this... Time a particular method See Method tracers. Time something other than a single method call Use the Tracer API. Enhance the metadata of a transaction Sometimes the code you are targeting is visible in the New Relic UI, but some details of the method are not useful. For example: The default name is causing a metric grouping issue. You want to add custom attributes to your transactions so you can filter them in the query builder. Use these methods when you want to change how New Relic instruments a transaction that is already visible in the New Relic UI: If you want to... Do this... Change the name of a transaction See Naming transactions. Add metadata (such as your customer's account name or subscription level) to your transactions Use custom attributes. See Adding custom attributes. Mark a transaction as a background job See Monitor custom background jobs. Mark a transaction as a web transaction Pass a :category => :controller option to set_transaction_name(). For more information, see Naming transactions. Prevent a transaction from affecting your Apdex score See Ignoring Apdex contributions. Collect or ignore errors Usually the agent detects errors automatically. However, you can manually mark an error with the agent. You can also mark errors as ignored or expected. If you want to... Do this... Report an error the agent does not report automatically See Sending New Relic handled errors. Prevent the agent from reporting an error at all Mark the error as ignored. See Error Collector to use the error_collector.ignore_errors config option. Prevent an error from affecting your Apdex or error rate, but still report it to New Relic Mark the error as expected. See Sending New Relic handled errors, and set :expected to true. Send custom event and metric data from your app APM includes a number of ways to record arbitrary custom data. For an explanation of New Relic data types, see Data collection. If you want to... Do this... Send data about an event so you can analyze it in dashboards Create a custom event. See record_custom_event(). Tag your events with metadata to filter and facet them in dashboards or error analytics Add custom attributes. Pass a hash of attributes to record_custom_event(). Report custom performance data Create a custom metric. See record_metric(). Control the browser agent Usually the browser agent is added automatically to your pages or deployed by copy/pasting the JavaScript snippet. For more information about these recommended methods, see Add apps to browser monitoring. However, you can also retrieve the browser agent via APM agent API calls. For more information, see browser_timing_header(). Instrument calls to datastores Use these methods to collect data about your app's connections to other datastores: If you want to... Do this... Time a call to a datastore not instrumented automatically by New Relic See wrap(). Time a datastore call that can't cleanly be wrapped in a Ruby block See Tracer.start_datastore_segment(). You must call finish on the object returned by this method. Capture SQL queries along with timing See notice_sql(). Capture non-SQL queries along with timing See notice_statement(). Instrument calls to externals Use these methods to collect data for external requests: If you want to... Do this... Time a call to an external request not instrumented automatically by New Relic Use Tracer.start_external_segment(). You must call finish on the object returned by this method. Add cross-application tracing (CAT) headers to an outbound HTTP request Use add_request_headers(). Read CAT headers from an inbound HTTP request Use read_response_headers(). Generate an obfuscated string to transport CAT information in an outbound request Use get_request_metadata(). Process an obfuscated string containing CAT information received from an inbound request Use process_response_metadata(). Instrument calls for distributed tracing Important The following API examples require Ruby agent version 6.9.0 or higher. These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. Distributed tracing lets you see the paths requests take as they travel through a distributed system. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. If you want to... Do this... Send a payload/header to the called service. See insert_distributed_trace_headers(). Accept a payload/header received from the first service, which will link these services together in a trace See accept_distributed_trace_headers().",

These key-value pairs can be viewed within transaction traces in APM, traced errors in APM, transaction events in dashboards, and page views in dashboards. You can customize exactly which attributes will be sent to each of these destinations. These attribute settings apply to version 3.12.0 or higher of the Ruby agent. Ruby agent attributes The following table lists the attributes that can be automatically captured by the Ruby agent: httpResponseCode The response status code for a web request. Defaults: Transaction traces: Enabled Error collector (traced errors): Enabled Transaction events: Enabled Page views (browser monitoring): Unavailable Note: The httpResponseCode attribute (string value) is deprecated as of agent version 6.12.0. http.statusCode (integer value) should be used instead. request.headers.referer The HTTP referrer header if present (minus the query string). Defaults: Transaction traces: Disabled Error collector (traced errors): Enabled Transaction events: Disabled Page views (browser monitoring): Unavailable request.parameters.* The HTTP request parameters, associated with the transaction. Available for Rails, Sinatra, and Grape applications only. Defaults: Transaction traces: Disabled Error collector (traced errors): Disabled Transaction events: Disabled Page views (browser monitoring): Disabled Note: The capture_params property is deprecated. However, if set to true, it will enable request parameters for transaction traces and traced errors. job.resque.args.* Job arguments passed to the Resque worker. Arguments passed to Resque workers are positional. These arguments are stored as keys of the form job.resque.args.<position> where position is the index of the argument to the perform method.

      "body": "The New Relic Ruby agent monitors your applications to help you identify and solve performance issues. You can also extend the agent's performance monitoring to collect and analyze business data to help you improve the customer experience and make data-driven business decisions. Compatibility and requirements The Ruby agent supports many of the most common Ruby frameworks and platforms. You can also use the Ruby agent in a Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment. Before you install the Ruby agent, ensure your system meets the system requirements. Monitor app performance View the big picture of your app Monitor your app's Apdex (user satisfaction). Get a high-level summary of your app. Create architectural maps of your app. Enable distributed tracing to understand activity in an environment that relies on many services. Install New Relic Infrastructure and view detailed host data for your app. Find errors and problems quickly Track key transactions. Create customized dashboards for important metrics. Alert your team when errors or problems occur before they affect your users. Track performance after a deployment. Drill down into performance details Examine code-level transaction traces and cross application traces. Examine database query traces. Examine error traces. Monitor Ruby background processes and daemons. Analyze business data Use the Ruby agent to organize, query, and visualize your data to answer key questions about application performance and customer experience. Use default transaction attributes or add your own. Query your data using NRQL. Send your own event data. Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards. Install the agent After creating a New Relic account, use our launcher or see the installation instructions. Install docs for gem (recommended) Install docs for rails plugin Add Ruby data Extend agent instrumentation After installing the agent, go further and extend the agent's instrumentation: Page load timing: Automatically inject the browser monitoring agent to get visibility into end-user activity. Custom instrumentation: Instrument transactions not captured as part of our framework instrumentation. Agent API: Use the agent API to fully customize the agent's behavior. For example, you can collect custom metrics, flag an error, or ignore a particular transaction entirely. Custom metrics: Record additional metrics as part of a transaction to gain more insights into your app's performance and business data. Agent attributes: Customize the attributes attached to transactions. Customizing attributes allows you to avoid sending sensitive attributes, or to collect additional attributes for deeper visibility into your transactions. Troubleshooting If you encounter issues with the Ruby agent, see our full list of troubleshooting documentation. Common issues include: No data appears (Ruby) Gems incompatible with the Ruby agent Sending handled errors to New Relic Controlling when the Ruby agent starts Check the source code The Ruby agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

Analyze business data Use the Ruby agent to organize, query, and visualize your data to answer key questions about application performance and customer experience. Use default transaction attributes or add your own. Query your data using NRQL. Send your own event data. Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards. Install the agent After creating a New Relic account, use our launcher or see the installation instructions. Install docs for gem (recommended) Install docs for rails plugin Add Ruby data Extend agent instrumentation After installing the agent, go further and extend the agent's instrumentation: Page load timing: Automatically inject the browser monitoring agent to get visibility into end-user activity. Custom instrumentation: Instrument transactions not captured as part of our framework instrumentation. Agent API: Use the agent API to fully customize the agent's behavior. For example, you can collect custom metrics, flag an error, or ignore a particular transaction entirely. Custom metrics: Record additional metrics as part of a transaction to gain more insights into your app's performance and business data. Agent attributes: Customize the attributes attached to transactions. Customizing attributes allows you to avoid sending sensitive attributes, or to collect additional attributes for deeper visibility into your transactions. Troubleshooting If you encounter issues with the Ruby agent, see our full list of troubleshooting documentation. Common issues include: No data appears (Ruby) Gems incompatible with the Ruby agent Sending handled errors to New Relic Controlling when the Ruby agent starts Check the source code The Ruby agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "Summary This guide covers the major changes between the 6.x and 7.x series of the Ruby agent, issues that may be encountered while upgrading, and how to migrate successfully to version 7.x. Main changes include: Support for Ruby 2.0 and 2.1 is dropped SSL Certificate Bundle is removed Several APIs that were deprecated in various 6.x releases are now removed Auto-instrumentation defaults to prepend over method chaining Auto-instrumentation gets consistent configuration attributes See the milestone for 7.0 target release for more information. Support for Ruby 2.0 and 2.1 is dropped Ruby 2.0 and 2.1 reached EOL in February 2016, and New Relic is following suit with dropping support for these versions in the 7.0 release. There are no known changes that would inherently prevent these versions from continuing to work, but we are no longer guaranteeing the Ruby agent continues to function without issues going forward. If you need Ruby 2.0 or 2.1, then continue to use 6.15.0, which is the last release published to support these Ruby versions. Prepend instrumentation configuration Relevant pull request: Prepend instrumentation #565. Potential issue: The agent fails to initialize and start reporting data. A stack level too deep error message is reported in the logs. Solution: Our configuration and dependency detection mechanism can now be controlled through configuration. By default all auto-instrumented gems/libraries are activated with the prepend strategy. The default configuration setting for these libraries in the absence of any settings appearing in the configuration file is auto, which will pick the best strategy. In the case of a known conflict with prepend strategies, auto instructs the agent to fall back to method-chaining when such conflicts are detected. Below is a complete explanation of our changes to the configuration section for auto-instrumentation using sidekiq as an example. instrumentation: sidekiq: chain Copy Tip The use case for this is when an unknown gem is found to be conflicting. The user is able to revert to method-chaining to deal with the conflict until the agent can be updated to auto-detect and handle the conflict. To disable instrumentation altogether: instrumentation: sidekiq: disable Copy In some cases, we may know specific gems conflict with prepend. To facilitate, we offer by default an auto config option, which automatically degrades to chain in such cases. The default setting in most cases is thus: instrumentation: sidekiq: auto Copy It's possible to force using prepend strategy by specifying it in the config file: instrumentation: sidekiq: prepend Copy Tip The use case for this is when a newer version of the conflicting gem is released and it's known to no longer conflict with prepend strategy. If you encounter stack level too deep errors, see our troubleshooting guide on how to resolve these issues. After working through this troubleshooting guide, you can let us know about the prepend conflict you find by commenting on this GitHub issue. We appreciate your feedback so we may detect and automatically fall back to method-chaining in such scenarios. Modernized auto-instrumentation strategy Ruby introduced prepend as a way to insert method definitions earlier into the method resolution stack in Ruby 2.0 (released in 2013) with the intent that prepend eliminates the need to do method-chaining as a means of patching original gem libraries' implementations with trace/observability logic. Mixing prepend with method-chaining (a.k.a. method _ alias monkey patching) can lead to a known stack level too deep scenario as described in our blog post on the topic. New Relic has previously updated many auto-instrumented libraries over the years to use prepend strategy. The 7.0 release makes prepend the default strategy of choice to auto-instrument over method-chaining, except when known scenarios exist that would lead to triggering stack level too deep errors. A best effort to identify conflicting external gems that would lead to this scenario was made, but there are bound to be others out in the wild that we have not identified. In the past, we had only one way to auto-instrument for most gems and that was method-chaining. With 7.0 release, we can instrument most gems using either method-chaining or prepend and our configuration of all auto-instrumented gems has been updated to reflect this. With the modernization of our auto-instrumentation, we have also introduced new functionality in our dependency detection mechanism to identify conflicting external gems and automatically switch from prepend strategy to method-chaining. This means you no longer have to depend on the maintainers of other gems to make changes to their gem libraries in order to facilitate using the Ruby agent in conjunction with those gems. However, we are not aware of such conflicts until our users report them to us, so only a few of our auto-instrumented libraries can auto-detect these conflicts and auto-switch to method-chaining strategies. We need your help to hear about these scenarios and to add auto-detection to future Ruby agent releases. The SSL Certificate bundle is removed In the early days of Ruby (1.8, 1.9, etc.), integration with OpenSSL and making HTTPS connections was not well-handled. To ensure customers would be able to consistently make HTTPS connections to New Relic's Collector servers, a selection of SSL CA Certificates were bundled and distributed with the Ruby Agent. Over time, the Ruby ecosystem has stabilized and now supports system installed CA Certificates in a standard manner that largely obsoletes the need to bundle and distribute the certificate bundle. The vast majority of certificates bundled have expired or are nearing expiration, so we have decided to remove this dependency from the agent. If you're deploying a Ruby application and agent to a container or server that does not have CA certificates installed, you will need to ensure they're now installed for 7.0+ releases of the agent to make successful HTTPS connections to New Relic servers. For more information, see Remove cert bundle #478. Potential issue: If you're deploying to a host that does not have OpenSSL and system CA certificates installed, you may experience issues connecting to New Relic servers and experience loss of APM data. Solution: New Relic servers require HTTPS, which uses CA certificates to initiate successful connections. These may be installed, and depending on your host, in various ways. The following are helpful links for testing the readiness of your host and installing CA certificates: Troubleshooting SSL Certificate Errors Automated SSL Check Installing CA Certificates How to handle Certificates in Docker If needed, the agent can be configured to use any CA bundle by giving the path to the CA bundle file via configuration: :ca\\_bundle\\_path. Please see Custom SSL certificate for Ruby for more info. Deprecated API's and configuration attributes All deprecated API's have replacement API's that either expand scope and/or improve robustness of the deprecated API. Relevant pull requests are: Remove references to whitelist and blacklist in codebase #479 Remove deprecated ActiveRecord config options #480 Remove httpResponseCode attribute #481 Remove deprecated option from notice _ error API #597 Remove deprecated distributed trace API methods #598 Denied and allowed lists enabled Potential issue: Black/White listed attributes no longer work.

Solution: Change the following configuration settings: :disable _ active _ record _ 4 => :disable _ active _ record _ notifications :disable _ active _ record _ 5 => :disable _ active _ record _ notifications httpResponseCode Potential issue: The attribute httpResponseCode no longer appears in UI in the traces reported. Solution: httpResponseCode was replaced with http.statusCode. Notice Error (trace _ only) Potential issue: Passing the :trace\\_only option to NewRelic::Agent.notice\\_error no longer works. Solution: Replace :trace\\_only with the :expected attribute. Distributed Tracing APIs Potential issue: Errors are raised in application code while calling the api methods create_distributed_trace_payload and accept_distributed_trace_payload. Solution: Instead, please see insert _ distributed _ trace _ headers and accept _ distributed _ trace _ headers, respectively.",

You can also extend the agent's performance monitoring to collect and analyze business data to help you improve the customer experience and make data-driven business decisions. Compatibility and requirements The Ruby agent supports many of the most common Ruby frameworks and platforms. You can also use the Ruby agent in a Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment. Before you install the Ruby agent, ensure your system meets the system requirements. Monitor app performance View the big picture of your app Monitor your app's Apdex (user satisfaction). Get a high-level summary of your app. Create architectural maps of your app. Enable distributed tracing to understand activity in an environment that relies on many services. Install New Relic Infrastructure and view detailed host data for your app. Find errors and problems quickly Track key transactions. Create customized dashboards for important metrics. Alert your team when errors or problems occur before they affect your users. Track performance after a deployment. Drill down into performance details Examine code-level transaction traces and cross application traces. Examine database query traces. Examine error traces. Monitor Ruby background processes and daemons. Analyze business data Use the Ruby agent to organize, query, and visualize your data to answer key questions about application performance and customer experience. Use default transaction attributes or add your own. Query your data using NRQL. Send your own event data. Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards. Install the agent After creating a New Relic account, use our launcher or see the installation instructions. Install docs for gem (recommended) Install docs for rails plugin Add Ruby data Extend agent instrumentation After installing the agent, go further and extend the agent's instrumentation: Page load timing: Automatically inject the browser monitoring agent to get visibility into end-user activity. Custom instrumentation: Instrument transactions not captured as part of our framework instrumentation. Agent API: Use the agent API to fully customize the agent's behavior. For example, you can collect custom metrics, flag an error, or ignore a particular transaction entirely. Custom metrics: Record additional metrics as part of a transaction to gain more insights into your app's performance and business data. Agent attributes: Customize the attributes attached to transactions. Customizing attributes allows you to avoid sending sensitive attributes, or to collect additional attributes for deeper visibility into your transactions. Troubleshooting If you encounter issues with the Ruby agent, see our full list of troubleshooting documentation. Common issues include: No data appears (Ruby) Gems incompatible with the Ruby agent Sending handled errors to New Relic Controlling when the Ruby agent starts Check the source code The Ruby agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "Our Ruby agent automatically instruments several common background job frameworks. You can also customize it to trace any background tasks. Data from background jobs appears in the Transactions page in APM as Non-web transactions. Supported frameworks The following background job frameworks are supported by default in recent versions of the Ruby agent: Resque instrumentation (Ruby agent 3.4.0) Sidekiq instrumentation (Ruby agent 3.6.0) Delayed::Job instrumentation (Ruby agent 2.10) Important JRuby users may see issues with CPU metrics. If you are using these frameworks, monitoring background jobs typically doesn't require additional configuration. Monitor custom background jobs You can instrument custom background jobs to appear in the APM Transactions page as Non-web transactions. To monitor Non-web transactions while using an unsupported framework, you must add custom instrumentation. As an example, a background job periodically runs a task called SalesOrganization#find_new_leads. Add the ControllerInstrumentation module. Use the add_transaction_tracer directive below the method definition Add :category => :task to tell the agent this trace is a Non-web transaction. require 'newrelic_rpm' class SalesOrganization include ::NewRelic::Agent::Instrumentation::ControllerInstrumentation def find_new_leads ... end add_transaction_tracer :find_new_leads, :category => :task end Copy You can pass a string to the :category, but values will only appear on the APM Transactions page if the string begins with OtherTransaction/. Monitor custom background methods Using the Ruby agent API, you can designate specific methods to trace the Non-web transactions. This gathers traces for slow running jobs and associates captured errors to transactions. To instrument a class method, use the class singleton. As an example, a background job periodically runs a task called SalesOrganization#find_new_leads. Add the ControllerInstrumentation module below the method definition. Use the add_transaction_tracer directive Add :category => :task to tell the agent this trace is a Non-web transaction. require 'newrelic_rpm' class SalesOrganization def self.find_new_leads ... end class << self include ::NewRelic::Agent::Instrumentation::ControllerInstrumentation add_transaction_tracer :find_new_leads, :category => :task end end Copy For more information, see Ruby custom metrics. Monitor short-lived processes Make sure the process isn't running before the agent connects to the back-end servers. To do so, make the Ruby agent synchronously connect to New Relic, rather than the default asynchronous behavior. Use manual_start and pass in the :sync_startup => true option: require 'new_relic/agent' NewRelic::Agent.manual_start(:sync_startup => true) Copy Using require 'new_relic/agent' will require the agent's code, and it will make sure the agent doesn't run until you manually start it. If the process is shorter than the agent harvest cycle, you need to manually shut down the agent with ::NewRelic::Agents.shutdown to ensure all queued data is sent. Configure newrelic.yml for background processes Configuring your newrelic.yml depends on the context of the background application. Non-Rails background application If your background app is non-Rails application already running the Ruby agent, copy your newrelic.yml file to the directory where you launch the background job or in the config subdirectory. Make sure it includes your license key. Background jobs that do not run in a Rails context will examine the NEW_RELIC_ENV environment variable to determine which section of the configuration file to read, falling back to the RUBY_ENV, RAILS_ENV, and RACK_ENV environment variables in sequence, and finally defaulting to development if none of these environment variables are set. Background job environment monitored by New Relic If your background job runs in the context of an existing web application that is already monitored with New Relic, the Ruby agent will automatically pick up your existing newrelic.yml file. Background jobs that boot your application's Rails environment will use the RAILS_ENV environment variable in order to determine which section of the newrelic.yml file to read. Report to an alternate application name You can make jobs that run in the context of an existing New Relic web application appear under a different application name in the APM UI. Begin before newrelic_rpm gets required by your worker code. Set the NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME environment variable to the application name to use for your background jobs when starting your background worker processes. This will override the app_name setting in your newrelic.yml. $ NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"My Background Jobs\" ./bin/my_background_worker.rb Copy Ensure the agent starts The Ruby agent will automatically start in most cases as soon as you require 'newrelic_rpm', unless the agent detects a blacklisted executable name, rake task name, or constant. This prevents it from starting during common rake tasks and interactive console sessions. Non-Rails standalone script Standalone scripts running without Rails generally will start the agent as soon as they require 'newrelic_rpm'. If you have a script that forks or daemonizes before it begins its main work, you may want to defer this require call until after the initial setup finishes. Background tasks with daemons gem If you use the daemons gem to start background tasks, the Ruby agent may fail to start and also not emit any logging. This happens because the daemons gem changes the working directory to / before executing your background code. The agent then attempts to resolve the paths to its configuration file and log file relative to the current working directory of the host process. To allow the agent to start in this situation, set environment variables with the locations of the agent configuration file and log file; for example: ENV['NRCONFIG'] ||= File.dirname(__FILE__) + '/../../config/newrelic.yml' ENV['NEW_RELIC_LOG'] ||= File.dirname(__FILE__) + '/../../log/newrelic_agent.log' Copy For more information, see the documentation about controlling agent startup Monitor scripts The agent startup instructions apply when running background jobs in a daemon. If a script executes a single background task and exits, manually shut down the agent with ::NewRelic::Agents.shutdown when the script finishes. This ensures the New Relic collector receives the data. For example: require 'newrelic_rpm' class SalesOrganization include ::NewRelic::Agent::Instrumentation::ControllerInstrumentation def find_new_leads ... end add_transaction_tracer :find_new_leads, :category => :task end SalesOrganization.new.find_new_leads ::NewRelic::Agent.shutdown Copy For more help Additional documentation resources include: Ruby custom metrics (method tracers, metric names, stats, examples Ruby agent API (public API methods for the New Relic Ruby agent)",

Data for background jobs appears in APM's Transactions page, complete with transaction traces and errors, by selecting Non-web transactions as the transaction type. Capture job arguments Starting with Ruby agent version 3.6.9, you can optionally configure the Ruby agent to capture Sidekiq job arguments in transaction traces and traced errors. This can be especially useful in attempting to reproduce failed jobs. By default this feature is off in case your job arguments contain sensitive information. To enable this feature, edit your newrelic.yml as appropriate for your agent version: newrelic_rpm 3.12.0 or higher: attributes.include: job.sidekiq.args.* newrelic_rpm 3.6.9 to 3.11.x: sidekiq.capture_params: true Tip This feature is distinct from the generic capture_params top-level setting, which controls whether HTTP request parameters are captured on transaction traces and traced errors for web requests. You can configure these two settings independently. Troubleshoot Sidekiq jobs If it appears that jobs are not being monitored, review your newrelic_agent.log file generated when the worker starts.

After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see the browser and Ruby agent documentation. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in infrastructure monitoring. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from Synthetics monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

You can configure these two settings independently. Resque versions 1.23.1 or higher If you are running Resque 1.23.1 or higher, you should not need to make any code changes outside of the normal agent installation procedures in order for New Relic's Resque instrumentation to work. Exception: If you have leftover calls to NewRelic::Agent methods from your Resque before_first_fork, before_fork, or after_fork hooks from when you were running an older version of Resque, be sure to remove those calls after upgrading to Resque 1.23.1 or higher. Alternate forking modes The resque-multi-job-forks or resque-jobs-per-fork gems change the forking behavior of Resque so that it will not fork for each individual job, but instead fork once per batch of jobs. Similarly, you can set the FORK_PER_JOB environment variable to false in order to completely disable forking in Resque. If you use any of these alternate forking modes in your application, make sure you are running Ruby agent version 3.9.7 or higher. Earlier versions of the Ruby agent do not work correctly with these alternate forking modes. If you are upgrading to 3.9.7 or higher, make sure to remove any direct calls to NewRelic::Agent methods such as manual_start or after_fork that you may have previously been using in order to get the agent to work in these environments. Old Resque versions ( < 1.23.1) It is possible to use New Relic's Ruby agent with Resque versions older than 1.23.1. However, New Relic recommends that you upgrade to Resque 1.23.1 or higher for best results. Many applications use the hooks exposed by Resque (before_fork, after_fork, etc.) in order to inject custom code at critical points during the lifetime of Resque jobs. The New Relic Ruby agent also must use these hooks in order to be able to place its instrumentation. Resque versions before 1.23.1 do not allow hooks to be defined multiple times; the last definition will take precedence. If you cannot upgrade to a Resque version >= 1.23.1 (which allows hooks to be defined multiple times without overwriting each other), you can modify your custom Resque hooks by adding the necessary New Relic code. Here is an example. Example: Modifying custom Resque hooks You may omit definitions for any hooks that you have no custom code for. They will be automatically installed by the agent in this case. Resque.before_first_fork do # ... your custom hook code ... NewRelic::Agent.manual_start(:dispatcher => :resque, :sync_startup => true, :start_channel_listener => true) end Resque.before_fork do |job| # ... your custom hook code ... NewRelic::Agent.register_report_channel(job.object_id) end Resque.after_fork do |job| # ... your custom hook code ... NewRelic::Agent.after_fork(:report_to_channel => job.object_id, :report_instance_busy => false) end Copy Deadlocking jobs Some customers (particularly those with very high job throughput) have reported intermittent deadlocks in their Resque worker processes with the Ruby agent enabled. These deadlocks are due to a bad interaction between the background thread that the Ruby agent uses to send data to New Relic servers and Resque's forking behavior. Use either of these options to resolve these issues: Disable Resque's forking behavior by setting the FORK_PER_JOB environment variable to false when spawning Resque processes. Use the resolv-replace library from Ruby's standard library to replace Ruby's native DNS resolution code with a pure Ruby version. The Ruby agent uses a background thread in the Resque master process to send data to the New Relic collector. In some environments, this thread will acquire a native lock during DNS resolution (when resolving the hostnames of New Relic collectors). If this native lock is held by the background thread while the main Resque master process's main thread calls fork to create a child process, it will still be marked as held in the forked child process. However, since fork only copies the calling thread, the background thread that was holding the native lock will not exist in the child process, and thus the native lock will never be released. If the child process attempts to do any DNS resolution, it will attempt to acquire the same native lock and deadlock. To avoid this Github issue, use resolv-replace instead of Ruby's default DNS resolution path.",

      "body": "Our Ruby agent automatically instruments several common background job frameworks. You can also customize it to trace any background tasks. Data from background jobs appears in the Transactions page in APM as Non-web transactions. Supported frameworks The following background job frameworks are supported by default in recent versions of the Ruby agent: Resque instrumentation (Ruby agent 3.4.0) Sidekiq instrumentation (Ruby agent 3.6.0) Delayed::Job instrumentation (Ruby agent 2.10) Important JRuby users may see issues with CPU metrics. If you are using these frameworks, monitoring background jobs typically doesn't require additional configuration. Monitor custom background jobs You can instrument custom background jobs to appear in the APM Transactions page as Non-web transactions. To monitor Non-web transactions while using an unsupported framework, you must add custom instrumentation. As an example, a background job periodically runs a task called SalesOrganization#find_new_leads. Add the ControllerInstrumentation module. Use the add_transaction_tracer directive below the method definition Add :category => :task to tell the agent this trace is a Non-web transaction. require 'newrelic_rpm' class SalesOrganization include ::NewRelic::Agent::Instrumentation::ControllerInstrumentation def find_new_leads ... end add_transaction_tracer :find_new_leads, :category => :task end Copy You can pass a string to the :category, but values will only appear on the APM Transactions page if the string begins with OtherTransaction/. Monitor custom background methods Using the Ruby agent API, you can designate specific methods to trace the Non-web transactions. This gathers traces for slow running jobs and associates captured errors to transactions. To instrument a class method, use the class singleton. As an example, a background job periodically runs a task called SalesOrganization#find_new_leads. Add the ControllerInstrumentation module below the method definition. Use the add_transaction_tracer directive Add :category => :task to tell the agent this trace is a Non-web transaction. require 'newrelic_rpm' class SalesOrganization def self.find_new_leads ... end class << self include ::NewRelic::Agent::Instrumentation::ControllerInstrumentation add_transaction_tracer :find_new_leads, :category => :task end end Copy For more information, see Ruby custom metrics. Monitor short-lived processes Make sure the process isn't running before the agent connects to the back-end servers. To do so, make the Ruby agent synchronously connect to New Relic, rather than the default asynchronous behavior. Use manual_start and pass in the :sync_startup => true option: require 'new_relic/agent' NewRelic::Agent.manual_start(:sync_startup => true) Copy Using require 'new_relic/agent' will require the agent's code, and it will make sure the agent doesn't run until you manually start it. If the process is shorter than the agent harvest cycle, you need to manually shut down the agent with ::NewRelic::Agents.shutdown to ensure all queued data is sent. Configure newrelic.yml for background processes Configuring your newrelic.yml depends on the context of the background application. Non-Rails background application If your background app is non-Rails application already running the Ruby agent, copy your newrelic.yml file to the directory where you launch the background job or in the config subdirectory. Make sure it includes your license key. Background jobs that do not run in a Rails context will examine the NEW_RELIC_ENV environment variable to determine which section of the configuration file to read, falling back to the RUBY_ENV, RAILS_ENV, and RACK_ENV environment variables in sequence, and finally defaulting to development if none of these environment variables are set. Background job environment monitored by New Relic If your background job runs in the context of an existing web application that is already monitored with New Relic, the Ruby agent will automatically pick up your existing newrelic.yml file. Background jobs that boot your application's Rails environment will use the RAILS_ENV environment variable in order to determine which section of the newrelic.yml file to read. Report to an alternate application name You can make jobs that run in the context of an existing New Relic web application appear under a different application name in the APM UI. Begin before newrelic_rpm gets required by your worker code. Set the NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME environment variable to the application name to use for your background jobs when starting your background worker processes. This will override the app_name setting in your newrelic.yml. $ NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"My Background Jobs\" ./bin/my_background_worker.rb Copy Ensure the agent starts The Ruby agent will automatically start in most cases as soon as you require 'newrelic_rpm', unless the agent detects a blacklisted executable name, rake task name, or constant. This prevents it from starting during common rake tasks and interactive console sessions. Non-Rails standalone script Standalone scripts running without Rails generally will start the agent as soon as they require 'newrelic_rpm'. If you have a script that forks or daemonizes before it begins its main work, you may want to defer this require call until after the initial setup finishes. Background tasks with daemons gem If you use the daemons gem to start background tasks, the Ruby agent may fail to start and also not emit any logging. This happens because the daemons gem changes the working directory to / before executing your background code. The agent then attempts to resolve the paths to its configuration file and log file relative to the current working directory of the host process. To allow the agent to start in this situation, set environment variables with the locations of the agent configuration file and log file; for example: ENV['NRCONFIG'] ||= File.dirname(__FILE__) + '/../../config/newrelic.yml' ENV['NEW_RELIC_LOG'] ||= File.dirname(__FILE__) + '/../../log/newrelic_agent.log' Copy For more information, see the documentation about controlling agent startup Monitor scripts The agent startup instructions apply when running background jobs in a daemon. If a script executes a single background task and exits, manually shut down the agent with ::NewRelic::Agents.shutdown when the script finishes. This ensures the New Relic collector receives the data. For example: require 'newrelic_rpm' class SalesOrganization include ::NewRelic::Agent::Instrumentation::ControllerInstrumentation def find_new_leads ... end add_transaction_tracer :find_new_leads, :category => :task end SalesOrganization.new.find_new_leads ::NewRelic::Agent.shutdown Copy For more help Additional documentation resources include: Ruby custom metrics (method tracers, metric names, stats, examples Ruby agent API (public API methods for the New Relic Ruby agent)",

Data for background jobs appears in APM's Transactions page, complete with transaction traces and errors, by selecting Non-web transactions as the transaction type. Capture job arguments Starting with Ruby agent version 3.6.9, you can optionally configure the Ruby agent to capture Sidekiq job arguments in transaction traces and traced errors. This can be especially useful in attempting to reproduce failed jobs. By default this feature is off in case your job arguments contain sensitive information. To enable this feature, edit your newrelic.yml as appropriate for your agent version: newrelic_rpm 3.12.0 or higher: attributes.include: job.sidekiq.args.* newrelic_rpm 3.6.9 to 3.11.x: sidekiq.capture_params: true Tip This feature is distinct from the generic capture_params top-level setting, which controls whether HTTP request parameters are captured on transaction traces and traced errors for web requests. You can configure these two settings independently. Troubleshoot Sidekiq jobs If it appears that jobs are not being monitored, review your newrelic_agent.log file generated when the worker starts. It should indicate whether the agent detects Sidekiq and communicates with the server. If you need support, note the exact command line that you used to start Sidekiq.",

Monitor short-lived processes Make sure the process isn't running before the agent connects to the back-end servers. To do so, make the Ruby agent synchronously connect to New Relic, rather than the default asynchronous behavior. Use manual_start and pass in the :sync_startup => true option: require 'new_relic/agent' NewRelic::Agent.manual_start(:sync_startup => true) Copy Using require 'new_relic/agent' will require the agent's code, and it will make sure the agent doesn't run until you manually start it. If the process is shorter than the agent harvest cycle, you need to manually shut down the agent with ::NewRelic::Agents.shutdown to ensure all queued data is sent. Configure newrelic.yml for background processes Configuring your newrelic.yml depends on the context of the background application. Non-Rails background application If your background app is non-Rails application already running the Ruby agent, copy your newrelic.yml file to the directory where you launch the background job or in the config subdirectory. Make sure it includes your license key. Background jobs that do not run in a Rails context will examine the NEW_RELIC_ENV environment variable to determine which section of the configuration file to read, falling back to the RUBY_ENV, RAILS_ENV, and RACK_ENV environment variables in sequence, and finally defaulting to development if none of these environment variables are set. Background job environment monitored by New Relic If your background job runs in the context of an existing web application that is already monitored with New Relic, the Ruby agent will automatically pick up your existing newrelic.yml file. Background jobs that boot your application's Rails environment will use the RAILS_ENV environment variable in order to determine which section of the newrelic.yml file to read. Report to an alternate application name You can make jobs that run in the context of an existing New Relic web application appear under a different application name in the APM UI. Begin before newrelic_rpm gets required by your worker code. Set the NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME environment variable to the application name to use for your background jobs when starting your background worker processes. This will override the app_name setting in your newrelic.yml. $ NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"My Background Jobs\" ./bin/my_background_worker.rb Copy Ensure the agent starts The Ruby agent will automatically start in most cases as soon as you require 'newrelic_rpm', unless the agent detects a blacklisted executable name, rake task name, or constant. This prevents it from starting during common rake tasks and interactive console sessions. Non-Rails standalone script Standalone scripts running without Rails generally will start the agent as soon as they require 'newrelic_rpm'. If you have a script that forks or daemonizes before it begins its main work, you may want to defer this require call until after the initial setup finishes. Background tasks with daemons gem If you use the daemons gem to start background tasks, the Ruby agent may fail to start and also not emit any logging. This happens because the daemons gem changes the working directory to / before executing your background code. The agent then attempts to resolve the paths to its configuration file and log file relative to the current working directory of the host process. To allow the agent to start in this situation, set environment variables with the locations of the agent configuration file and log file; for example: ENV['NRCONFIG'] ||= File.dirname(__FILE__) + '/../../config/newrelic.yml' ENV['NEW_RELIC_LOG'] ||= File.dirname(__FILE__) + '/../../log/newrelic_agent.log' Copy For more information, see the documentation about controlling agent startup Monitor scripts The agent startup instructions apply when running background jobs in a daemon. If a script executes a single background task and exits, manually shut down the agent with ::NewRelic::Agents.shutdown when the script finishes. This ensures the New Relic collector receives the data. For example: require 'newrelic_rpm' class SalesOrganization include ::NewRelic::Agent::Instrumentation::ControllerInstrumentation def find_new_leads ... end add_transaction_tracer :find_new_leads, :category => :task end SalesOrganization.new.find_new_leads ::NewRelic::Agent.shutdown Copy For more help Additional documentation resources include: Ruby custom metrics (method tracers, metric names, stats, examples Ruby agent API (public API methods for the New Relic Ruby agent)",

Data for background jobs appears in APM's Transactions page, complete with transaction traces and errors, by selecting Non-web transactions as the transaction type. Capture job arguments Starting with Ruby agent version 3.6.9, you can optionally configure the Ruby agent to capture Sidekiq job arguments in transaction traces and traced errors. This can be especially useful in attempting to reproduce failed jobs. By default this feature is off in case your job arguments contain sensitive information. To enable this feature, edit your newrelic.yml as appropriate for your agent version: newrelic_rpm 3.12.0 or higher: attributes.include: job.sidekiq.args.* newrelic_rpm 3.6.9 to 3.11.x: sidekiq.capture_params: true Tip This feature is distinct from the generic capture_params top-level setting, which controls whether HTTP request parameters are captured on transaction traces and traced errors for web requests. You can configure these two settings independently. Troubleshoot Sidekiq jobs If it appears that jobs are not being monitored, review your newrelic_agent.log file generated when the worker starts. It should indicate whether the agent detects Sidekiq and communicates with the server. If you need support, note the exact command line that you used to start Sidekiq.",

      "body": "Our Ruby agent automatically instruments several common background job frameworks. You can also customize it to trace any background tasks. Data from background jobs appears in the Transactions page in APM as Non-web transactions. Supported frameworks The following background job frameworks are supported by default in recent versions of the Ruby agent: Resque instrumentation (Ruby agent 3.4.0) Sidekiq instrumentation (Ruby agent 3.6.0) Delayed::Job instrumentation (Ruby agent 2.10) Important JRuby users may see issues with CPU metrics. If you are using these frameworks, monitoring background jobs typically doesn't require additional configuration. Monitor custom background jobs You can instrument custom background jobs to appear in the APM Transactions page as Non-web transactions. To monitor Non-web transactions while using an unsupported framework, you must add custom instrumentation. As an example, a background job periodically runs a task called SalesOrganization#find_new_leads. Add the ControllerInstrumentation module. Use the add_transaction_tracer directive below the method definition Add :category => :task to tell the agent this trace is a Non-web transaction. require 'newrelic_rpm' class SalesOrganization include ::NewRelic::Agent::Instrumentation::ControllerInstrumentation def find_new_leads ... end add_transaction_tracer :find_new_leads, :category => :task end Copy You can pass a string to the :category, but values will only appear on the APM Transactions page if the string begins with OtherTransaction/. Monitor custom background methods Using the Ruby agent API, you can designate specific methods to trace the Non-web transactions. This gathers traces for slow running jobs and associates captured errors to transactions. To instrument a class method, use the class singleton. As an example, a background job periodically runs a task called SalesOrganization#find_new_leads. Add the ControllerInstrumentation module below the method definition. Use the add_transaction_tracer directive Add :category => :task to tell the agent this trace is a Non-web transaction. require 'newrelic_rpm' class SalesOrganization def self.find_new_leads ... end class << self include ::NewRelic::Agent::Instrumentation::ControllerInstrumentation add_transaction_tracer :find_new_leads, :category => :task end end Copy For more information, see Ruby custom metrics.

This can be especially useful in attempting to reproduce failed jobs. By default this feature is off in case your job arguments contain sensitive information. To enable this feature, edit your newrelic.yml as appropriate for your agent version: For newrelic_rpm 3.12.0 or higher: attributes.include: job.resque.args.* For newrelic_rpm 3.6.9 to 3.11.X: resque.capture_params: true This feature is distinct from the generic capture_params top-level setting, which controls whether HTTP request parameters are captured on transaction traces and traced errors for web requests. You can configure these two settings independently. Resque versions 1.23.1 or higher If you are running Resque 1.23.1 or higher, you should not need to make any code changes outside of the normal agent installation procedures in order for New Relic's Resque instrumentation to work. Exception: If you have leftover calls to NewRelic::Agent methods from your Resque before_first_fork, before_fork, or after_fork hooks from when you were running an older version of Resque, be sure to remove those calls after upgrading to Resque 1.23.1 or higher. Alternate forking modes The resque-multi-job-forks or resque-jobs-per-fork gems change the forking behavior of Resque so that it will not fork for each individual job, but instead fork once per batch of jobs. Similarly, you can set the FORK_PER_JOB environment variable to false in order to completely disable forking in Resque. If you use any of these alternate forking modes in your application, make sure you are running Ruby agent version 3.9.7 or higher. Earlier versions of the Ruby agent do not work correctly with these alternate forking modes. If you are upgrading to 3.9.7 or higher, make sure to remove any direct calls to NewRelic::Agent methods such as manual_start or after_fork that you may have previously been using in order to get the agent to work in these environments. Old Resque versions ( < 1.23.1) It is possible to use New Relic's Ruby agent with Resque versions older than 1.23.1. However, New Relic recommends that you upgrade to Resque 1.23.1 or higher for best results. Many applications use the hooks exposed by Resque (before_fork, after_fork, etc.) in order to inject custom code at critical points during the lifetime of Resque jobs. The New Relic Ruby agent also must use these hooks in order to be able to place its instrumentation. Resque versions before 1.23.1 do not allow hooks to be defined multiple times; the last definition will take precedence. If you cannot upgrade to a Resque version >= 1.23.1 (which allows hooks to be defined multiple times without overwriting each other), you can modify your custom Resque hooks by adding the necessary New Relic code. Here is an example. Example: Modifying custom Resque hooks You may omit definitions for any hooks that you have no custom code for. They will be automatically installed by the agent in this case. Resque.before_first_fork do # ... your custom hook code ... NewRelic::Agent.manual_start(:dispatcher => :resque, :sync_startup => true, :start_channel_listener => true) end Resque.before_fork do |job| # ... your custom hook code ... NewRelic::Agent.register_report_channel(job.object_id) end Resque.after_fork do |job| # ... your custom hook code ... NewRelic::Agent.after_fork(:report_to_channel => job.object_id, :report_instance_busy => false) end Copy Deadlocking jobs Some customers (particularly those with very high job throughput) have reported intermittent deadlocks in their Resque worker processes with the Ruby agent enabled. These deadlocks are due to a bad interaction between the background thread that the Ruby agent uses to send data to New Relic servers and Resque's forking behavior. Use either of these options to resolve these issues: Disable Resque's forking behavior by setting the FORK_PER_JOB environment variable to false when spawning Resque processes. Use the resolv-replace library from Ruby's standard library to replace Ruby's native DNS resolution code with a pure Ruby version. The Ruby agent uses a background thread in the Resque master process to send data to the New Relic collector. In some environments, this thread will acquire a native lock during DNS resolution (when resolving the hostnames of New Relic collectors). If this native lock is held by the background thread while the main Resque master process's main thread calls fork to create a child process, it will still be marked as held in the forked child process. However, since fork only copies the calling thread, the background thread that was holding the native lock will not exist in the child process, and thus the native lock will never be released. If the child process attempts to do any DNS resolution, it will attempt to acquire the same native lock and deadlock. To avoid this Github issue, use resolv-replace instead of Ruby's default DNS resolution path.",

      "body": "New Relic has APM language agents for C, Go, Java, Node.js, .NET, PHP, Python, and Ruby. Each of these offers several ways to leverage the power of distributed tracing: Quick start for standard distributed tracing (recommended): A fast way to get started Infinite Tracing: An advanced alternative to standard distributed tracing Older APM agents: Tracing options if you have older APM agents Manual instrumentation: Tips if automatic instrumentation doesn't work Tip If you want to get more background before getting started, check out these topics: How span sampling works explains distributed tracing options. Impacts to APM tells you what to expect if you are a current APM user but haven't set up distributed tracing. Quick start for standard distributed tracing (recommended): This is the best approach to set up standard distributed tracing if you haven't installed any New Relic APM agents for your services yet, or if you want to instrument additional services. Tip You'll need a New Relic account to set up distributed tracing. If you don't already have one, you can quickly create a free account. Step 1. Identify services Figure out which services you want to instrument so they each send trace data to New Relic. Step 2. Instrument each service with an APM agent We have installation assistants for a variety of languages to help you instrument each service. You should run the installation assistant for each service you want to instrument to ensure that each installation has a unique application name. To start the assistant, click the link for your language: New Relic APM: C New Relic APM: Golang New Relic APM: Java New Relic APM: .NET New Relic APM: Node.js New Relic APM: PHP New Relic APM: Python New Relic APM: Ruby Tip This quick-start approach with the installation assistant automatically enables distributed tracing for each service you run it on, but if you already have a New Relic APM agent that you want to participate in distributed tracing, you'll need to manually enable distributed tracing. See Options for older APM agents. Step 3. View traces After you instrument each of your services with APM agents, generate some traffic in your application so we can capture some traces. Here are two ways to view your traces in the UI: View traces that include a specific service Here's one way you can see traces for a particular service: Go to one.newrelic.com. Click APM in the top menu bar. Click your service. In the left navigation's Monitor section, click Distributed tracing. If you don't see the traces you want, you can filter by the trace.id. View traces across accounts This option allows you to search all traces across all New Relic accounts in your organization that you have access to. Go to one.newrelic.com. Click Browse data in the top menu bar, and then click Traces. Select your entity in the left pane. If you don't see the traces you want, you can filter by the trace.id. For more help finding your traces in the UI: Understand and use the distributed tracing UI Query distributed trace data Set up Infinite Tracing (advanced option) Standard distributed tracing for APM agents (above) captures up to 10% of your traces, but if you want us to analyze all your data and find the most relevant traces, you can set up Infinite Tracing. This alternative to standard distributed tracing is available for all APM language agents except C SDK. Tip To learn more about this feature, see Infinite Tracing. Before beginning, first ensure you meet the requirements. Step 1. Complete the instrumentation for standard distributed tracing in the quick start above The Infinite Tracing setup builds on the instrumentation step from the Quick start for standard distributed tracing. Step 2. Set up the trace observer The trace observer is a New Relic AWS-based service that collects and analyzes all your traces. Follow the instructions in Set up trace observer. When you're done, return here with your trace observer information and continue with the next step to configure the agent. Step 3: Configure the agent for Infinite Tracing Infinite Tracing configuration settings include the standard distributed tracing plus information about the trace observer.

Manual instrumentation (If automatic instrumentation doesn't work) Recommendation: Before performing any custom instrumentation, read: How distributed tracing works Troubleshoot missing data If a service is not passing the trace header to other services, you can use the distributed tracing payload APIs to instrument the calling service and the called service. The calling service uses an API call to generate a payload, which is accepted by the called service. Instrument the calling service To instrument the calling service: Ensure the version of the APM agent that monitors the calling service supports distributed tracing. Invoke the agent API call for generating a distributed trace payload: C SDK | Go | Java | .NET | Node.js | PHP | Python | Ruby. Important To maintain proper ordering of spans in a trace, ensure you generate the payload in the context of the span that sends it. Add that payload to the call made to the destination service (for example, in a header). (Optional) Identify the call as an external call: C SDK Go Java .NET: n/a Node.js PHP: n/a Python Ruby Instrument the called service To instrument the called service: Ensure the version of the APM agent that monitors the called service supports distributed tracing. If the New Relic agent on the called service does not identify a New Relic transaction, use the agent API to declare a transaction: C SDK One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload() is called, a NULL pointer is returned. To solve this problem, follow the procedures to create a transaction with the C SDK. Go One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when Transaction.InsertDistributedTraceHeaders(h http.Header) is called, no headers are inserted. To create a transaction, see Instrument Go transactions. Java One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when Transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(Headers) is called, no headers are inserted (this API requires agent 6.4.0+). To create a transaction, see Java agent transaction-related APIs. .NET One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: CreateDistributedTracePayload() returns an empty payload. To create a transaction, see Introduction to .NET custom instrumentation. Node.js One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: the Node.js agent logs will report an error similar to this: No transaction found when calling Transaction.acceptDistributedTracePayload. Copy Use startWebTransaction to create a web transaction or startBackgroundTransaction to capture a non-web transaction. PHP One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers() returns false. To create a transaction, see newrelic_start_transaction. Python To tell that a transaction is not in progress: when transaction = current_transaction() is run, transaction is None. Or, if result = accept_distributed_trace_payload(payload) is run, then the result is False. Use background_task to report a non-web transaction. For more on Python instrumentation, see Monitor transactions and segments. Ruby If you are using a Rack-based web framework and have enabled New Relic's Rack instrumentation, the Ruby agent will handle starting a transaction for you. For other use cases, see the add_transaction_tracer API method. Extract the payload from the call that you received (for example, in a header). Invoke the call for accepting the payload: C SDK | Go | Java | .NET | PHP | Node.js | Python | Ruby.",

      "body": "Summary This guide covers the major changes between the 6.x and 7.x series of the Ruby agent, issues that may be encountered while upgrading, and how to migrate successfully to version 7.x. Main changes include: Support for Ruby 2.0 and 2.1 is dropped SSL Certificate Bundle is removed Several APIs that were deprecated in various 6.x releases are now removed Auto-instrumentation defaults to prepend over method chaining Auto-instrumentation gets consistent configuration attributes See the milestone for 7.0 target release for more information. Support for Ruby 2.0 and 2.1 is dropped Ruby 2.0 and 2.1 reached EOL in February 2016, and New Relic is following suit with dropping support for these versions in the 7.0 release. There are no known changes that would inherently prevent these versions from continuing to work, but we are no longer guaranteeing the Ruby agent continues to function without issues going forward. If you need Ruby 2.0 or 2.1, then continue to use 6.15.0, which is the last release published to support these Ruby versions. Prepend instrumentation configuration Relevant pull request: Prepend instrumentation #565. Potential issue: The agent fails to initialize and start reporting data. A stack level too deep error message is reported in the logs. Solution: Our configuration and dependency detection mechanism can now be controlled through configuration. By default all auto-instrumented gems/libraries are activated with the prepend strategy. The default configuration setting for these libraries in the absence of any settings appearing in the configuration file is auto, which will pick the best strategy. In the case of a known conflict with prepend strategies, auto instructs the agent to fall back to method-chaining when such conflicts are detected. Below is a complete explanation of our changes to the configuration section for auto-instrumentation using sidekiq as an example. instrumentation: sidekiq: chain Copy Tip The use case for this is when an unknown gem is found to be conflicting. The user is able to revert to method-chaining to deal with the conflict until the agent can be updated to auto-detect and handle the conflict. To disable instrumentation altogether: instrumentation: sidekiq: disable Copy In some cases, we may know specific gems conflict with prepend. To facilitate, we offer by default an auto config option, which automatically degrades to chain in such cases. The default setting in most cases is thus: instrumentation: sidekiq: auto Copy It's possible to force using prepend strategy by specifying it in the config file: instrumentation: sidekiq: prepend Copy Tip The use case for this is when a newer version of the conflicting gem is released and it's known to no longer conflict with prepend strategy. If you encounter stack level too deep errors, see our troubleshooting guide on how to resolve these issues. After working through this troubleshooting guide, you can let us know about the prepend conflict you find by commenting on this GitHub issue. We appreciate your feedback so we may detect and automatically fall back to method-chaining in such scenarios. Modernized auto-instrumentation strategy Ruby introduced prepend as a way to insert method definitions earlier into the method resolution stack in Ruby 2.0 (released in 2013) with the intent that prepend eliminates the need to do method-chaining as a means of patching original gem libraries' implementations with trace/observability logic. Mixing prepend with method-chaining (a.k.a. method _ alias monkey patching) can lead to a known stack level too deep scenario as described in our blog post on the topic. New Relic has previously updated many auto-instrumented libraries over the years to use prepend strategy. The 7.0 release makes prepend the default strategy of choice to auto-instrument over method-chaining, except when known scenarios exist that would lead to triggering stack level too deep errors. A best effort to identify conflicting external gems that would lead to this scenario was made, but there are bound to be others out in the wild that we have not identified. In the past, we had only one way to auto-instrument for most gems and that was method-chaining. With 7.0 release, we can instrument most gems using either method-chaining or prepend and our configuration of all auto-instrumented gems has been updated to reflect this. With the modernization of our auto-instrumentation, we have also introduced new functionality in our dependency detection mechanism to identify conflicting external gems and automatically switch from prepend strategy to method-chaining. This means you no longer have to depend on the maintainers of other gems to make changes to their gem libraries in order to facilitate using the Ruby agent in conjunction with those gems. However, we are not aware of such conflicts until our users report them to us, so only a few of our auto-instrumented libraries can auto-detect these conflicts and auto-switch to method-chaining strategies. We need your help to hear about these scenarios and to add auto-detection to future Ruby agent releases. The SSL Certificate bundle is removed In the early days of Ruby (1.8, 1.9, etc.), integration with OpenSSL and making HTTPS connections was not well-handled. To ensure customers would be able to consistently make HTTPS connections to New Relic's Collector servers, a selection of SSL CA Certificates were bundled and distributed with the Ruby Agent. Over time, the Ruby ecosystem has stabilized and now supports system installed CA Certificates in a standard manner that largely obsoletes the need to bundle and distribute the certificate bundle. The vast majority of certificates bundled have expired or are nearing expiration, so we have decided to remove this dependency from the agent. If you're deploying a Ruby application and agent to a container or server that does not have CA certificates installed, you will need to ensure they're now installed for 7.0+ releases of the agent to make successful HTTPS connections to New Relic servers. For more information, see Remove cert bundle #478. Potential issue: If you're deploying to a host that does not have OpenSSL and system CA certificates installed, you may experience issues connecting to New Relic servers and experience loss of APM data. Solution: New Relic servers require HTTPS, which uses CA certificates to initiate successful connections. These may be installed, and depending on your host, in various ways. The following are helpful links for testing the readiness of your host and installing CA certificates: Troubleshooting SSL Certificate Errors Automated SSL Check Installing CA Certificates How to handle Certificates in Docker If needed, the agent can be configured to use any CA bundle by giving the path to the CA bundle file via configuration: :ca\\_bundle\\_path. Please see Custom SSL certificate for Ruby for more info. Deprecated API's and configuration attributes All deprecated API's have replacement API's that either expand scope and/or improve robustness of the deprecated API.

Solution: Change the following configuration settings: :disable _ active _ record _ 4 => :disable _ active _ record _ notifications :disable _ active _ record _ 5 => :disable _ active _ record _ notifications httpResponseCode Potential issue: The attribute httpResponseCode no longer appears in UI in the traces reported. Solution: httpResponseCode was replaced with http.statusCode. Notice Error (trace _ only) Potential issue: Passing the :trace\\_only option to NewRelic::Agent.notice\\_error no longer works. Solution: Replace :trace\\_only with the :expected attribute. Distributed Tracing APIs Potential issue: Errors are raised in application code while calling the api methods create_distributed_trace_payload and accept_distributed_trace_payload. Solution: Instead, please see insert _ distributed _ trace _ headers and accept _ distributed _ trace _ headers, respectively.",

      "body": "New Relic has APM language agents for C, Go, Java, Node.js, .NET, PHP, Python, and Ruby. Each of these offers several ways to leverage the power of distributed tracing: Quick start for standard distributed tracing (recommended): A fast way to get started Infinite Tracing: An advanced alternative to standard distributed tracing Older APM agents: Tracing options if you have older APM agents Manual instrumentation: Tips if automatic instrumentation doesn't work Tip If you want to get more background before getting started, check out these topics: How span sampling works explains distributed tracing options. Impacts to APM tells you what to expect if you are a current APM user but haven't set up distributed tracing. Quick start for standard distributed tracing (recommended): This is the best approach to set up standard distributed tracing if you haven't installed any New Relic APM agents for your services yet, or if you want to instrument additional services. Tip You'll need a New Relic account to set up distributed tracing. If you don't already have one, you can quickly create a free account. Step 1. Identify services Figure out which services you want to instrument so they each send trace data to New Relic. Step 2. Instrument each service with an APM agent We have installation assistants for a variety of languages to help you instrument each service. You should run the installation assistant for each service you want to instrument to ensure that each installation has a unique application name. To start the assistant, click the link for your language: New Relic APM: C New Relic APM: Golang New Relic APM: Java New Relic APM: .NET New Relic APM: Node.js New Relic APM: PHP New Relic APM: Python New Relic APM: Ruby Tip This quick-start approach with the installation assistant automatically enables distributed tracing for each service you run it on, but if you already have a New Relic APM agent that you want to participate in distributed tracing, you'll need to manually enable distributed tracing. See Options for older APM agents. Step 3. View traces After you instrument each of your services with APM agents, generate some traffic in your application so we can capture some traces. Here are two ways to view your traces in the UI: View traces that include a specific service Here's one way you can see traces for a particular service: Go to one.newrelic.com. Click APM in the top menu bar. Click your service. In the left navigation's Monitor section, click Distributed tracing. If you don't see the traces you want, you can filter by the trace.id. View traces across accounts This option allows you to search all traces across all New Relic accounts in your organization that you have access to. Go to one.newrelic.com. Click Browse data in the top menu bar, and then click Traces. Select your entity in the left pane. If you don't see the traces you want, you can filter by the trace.id. For more help finding your traces in the UI: Understand and use the distributed tracing UI Query distributed trace data Set up Infinite Tracing (advanced option) Standard distributed tracing for APM agents (above) captures up to 10% of your traces, but if you want us to analyze all your data and find the most relevant traces, you can set up Infinite Tracing. This alternative to standard distributed tracing is available for all APM language agents except C SDK. Tip To learn more about this feature, see Infinite Tracing. Before beginning, first ensure you meet the requirements. Step 1. Complete the instrumentation for standard distributed tracing in the quick start above The Infinite Tracing setup builds on the instrumentation step from the Quick start for standard distributed tracing. Step 2. Set up the trace observer The trace observer is a New Relic AWS-based service that collects and analyzes all your traces. Follow the instructions in Set up trace observer. When you're done, return here with your trace observer information and continue with the next step to configure the agent. Step 3: Configure the agent for Infinite Tracing Infinite Tracing configuration settings include the standard distributed tracing plus information about the trace observer. Find the settings for your language agent below: C SDK Infinite tracing is not available for C SDK. Go Here's an overview of the settings.

Manual instrumentation (If automatic instrumentation doesn't work) Recommendation: Before performing any custom instrumentation, read: How distributed tracing works Troubleshoot missing data If a service is not passing the trace header to other services, you can use the distributed tracing payload APIs to instrument the calling service and the called service. The calling service uses an API call to generate a payload, which is accepted by the called service. Instrument the calling service To instrument the calling service: Ensure the version of the APM agent that monitors the calling service supports distributed tracing. Invoke the agent API call for generating a distributed trace payload: C SDK | Go | Java | .NET | Node.js | PHP | Python | Ruby. Important To maintain proper ordering of spans in a trace, ensure you generate the payload in the context of the span that sends it. Add that payload to the call made to the destination service (for example, in a header). (Optional) Identify the call as an external call: C SDK Go Java .NET: n/a Node.js PHP: n/a Python Ruby Instrument the called service To instrument the called service: Ensure the version of the APM agent that monitors the called service supports distributed tracing. If the New Relic agent on the called service does not identify a New Relic transaction, use the agent API to declare a transaction: C SDK One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload() is called, a NULL pointer is returned. To solve this problem, follow the procedures to create a transaction with the C SDK. Go One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when Transaction.InsertDistributedTraceHeaders(h http.Header) is called, no headers are inserted. To create a transaction, see Instrument Go transactions. Java One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when Transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(Headers) is called, no headers are inserted (this API requires agent 6.4.0+). To create a transaction, see Java agent transaction-related APIs. .NET One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: CreateDistributedTracePayload() returns an empty payload. To create a transaction, see Introduction to .NET custom instrumentation. Node.js One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: the Node.js agent logs will report an error similar to this: No transaction found when calling Transaction.acceptDistributedTracePayload. Copy Use startWebTransaction to create a web transaction or startBackgroundTransaction to capture a non-web transaction. PHP One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers() returns false. To create a transaction, see newrelic_start_transaction. Python To tell that a transaction is not in progress: when transaction = current_transaction() is run, transaction is None. Or, if result = accept_distributed_trace_payload(payload) is run, then the result is False. Use background_task to report a non-web transaction. For more on Python instrumentation, see Monitor transactions and segments. Ruby If you are using a Rack-based web framework and have enabled New Relic's Rack instrumentation, the Ruby agent will handle starting a transaction for you. For other use cases, see the add_transaction_tracer API method. Extract the payload from the call that you received (for example, in a header). Invoke the call for accepting the payload: C SDK | Go | Java | .NET | PHP | Node.js | Python | Ruby.",

      "body": "Summary This guide covers the major changes between the 6.x and 7.x series of the Ruby agent, issues that may be encountered while upgrading, and how to migrate successfully to version 7.x. Main changes include: Support for Ruby 2.0 and 2.1 is dropped SSL Certificate Bundle is removed Several APIs that were deprecated in various 6.x releases are now removed Auto-instrumentation defaults to prepend over method chaining Auto-instrumentation gets consistent configuration attributes See the milestone for 7.0 target release for more information. Support for Ruby 2.0 and 2.1 is dropped Ruby 2.0 and 2.1 reached EOL in February 2016, and New Relic is following suit with dropping support for these versions in the 7.0 release. There are no known changes that would inherently prevent these versions from continuing to work, but we are no longer guaranteeing the Ruby agent continues to function without issues going forward. If you need Ruby 2.0 or 2.1, then continue to use 6.15.0, which is the last release published to support these Ruby versions. Prepend instrumentation configuration Relevant pull request: Prepend instrumentation #565. Potential issue: The agent fails to initialize and start reporting data. A stack level too deep error message is reported in the logs. Solution: Our configuration and dependency detection mechanism can now be controlled through configuration. By default all auto-instrumented gems/libraries are activated with the prepend strategy. The default configuration setting for these libraries in the absence of any settings appearing in the configuration file is auto, which will pick the best strategy. In the case of a known conflict with prepend strategies, auto instructs the agent to fall back to method-chaining when such conflicts are detected. Below is a complete explanation of our changes to the configuration section for auto-instrumentation using sidekiq as an example. instrumentation: sidekiq: chain Copy Tip The use case for this is when an unknown gem is found to be conflicting. The user is able to revert to method-chaining to deal with the conflict until the agent can be updated to auto-detect and handle the conflict. To disable instrumentation altogether: instrumentation: sidekiq: disable Copy In some cases, we may know specific gems conflict with prepend. To facilitate, we offer by default an auto config option, which automatically degrades to chain in such cases. The default setting in most cases is thus: instrumentation: sidekiq: auto Copy It's possible to force using prepend strategy by specifying it in the config file: instrumentation: sidekiq: prepend Copy Tip The use case for this is when a newer version of the conflicting gem is released and it's known to no longer conflict with prepend strategy. If you encounter stack level too deep errors, see our troubleshooting guide on how to resolve these issues. After working through this troubleshooting guide, you can let us know about the prepend conflict you find by commenting on this GitHub issue. We appreciate your feedback so we may detect and automatically fall back to method-chaining in such scenarios. Modernized auto-instrumentation strategy Ruby introduced prepend as a way to insert method definitions earlier into the method resolution stack in Ruby 2.0 (released in 2013) with the intent that prepend eliminates the need to do method-chaining as a means of patching original gem libraries' implementations with trace/observability logic. Mixing prepend with method-chaining (a.k.a. method _ alias monkey patching) can lead to a known stack level too deep scenario as described in our blog post on the topic. New Relic has previously updated many auto-instrumented libraries over the years to use prepend strategy. The 7.0 release makes prepend the default strategy of choice to auto-instrument over method-chaining, except when known scenarios exist that would lead to triggering stack level too deep errors. A best effort to identify conflicting external gems that would lead to this scenario was made, but there are bound to be others out in the wild that we have not identified. In the past, we had only one way to auto-instrument for most gems and that was method-chaining. With 7.0 release, we can instrument most gems using either method-chaining or prepend and our configuration of all auto-instrumented gems has been updated to reflect this. With the modernization of our auto-instrumentation, we have also introduced new functionality in our dependency detection mechanism to identify conflicting external gems and automatically switch from prepend strategy to method-chaining. This means you no longer have to depend on the maintainers of other gems to make changes to their gem libraries in order to facilitate using the Ruby agent in conjunction with those gems. However, we are not aware of such conflicts until our users report them to us, so only a few of our auto-instrumented libraries can auto-detect these conflicts and auto-switch to method-chaining strategies. We need your help to hear about these scenarios and to add auto-detection to future Ruby agent releases. The SSL Certificate bundle is removed In the early days of Ruby (1.8, 1.9, etc.), integration with OpenSSL and making HTTPS connections was not well-handled. To ensure customers would be able to consistently make HTTPS connections to New Relic's Collector servers, a selection of SSL CA Certificates were bundled and distributed with the Ruby Agent. Over time, the Ruby ecosystem has stabilized and now supports system installed CA Certificates in a standard manner that largely obsoletes the need to bundle and distribute the certificate bundle. The vast majority of certificates bundled have expired or are nearing expiration, so we have decided to remove this dependency from the agent. If you're deploying a Ruby application and agent to a container or server that does not have CA certificates installed, you will need to ensure they're now installed for 7.0+ releases of the agent to make successful HTTPS connections to New Relic servers. For more information, see Remove cert bundle #478. Potential issue: If you're deploying to a host that does not have OpenSSL and system CA certificates installed, you may experience issues connecting to New Relic servers and experience loss of APM data. Solution: New Relic servers require HTTPS, which uses CA certificates to initiate successful connections. These may be installed, and depending on your host, in various ways. The following are helpful links for testing the readiness of your host and installing CA certificates: Troubleshooting SSL Certificate Errors Automated SSL Check Installing CA Certificates How to handle Certificates in Docker If needed, the agent can be configured to use any CA bundle by giving the path to the CA bundle file via configuration: :ca\\_bundle\\_path. Please see Custom SSL certificate for Ruby for more info.

      "body": "New Relic has APM language agents for C, Go, Java, Node.js, .NET, PHP, Python, and Ruby. Each of these offers several ways to leverage the power of distributed tracing: Quick start for standard distributed tracing (recommended): A fast way to get started Infinite Tracing: An advanced alternative to standard distributed tracing Older APM agents: Tracing options if you have older APM agents Manual instrumentation: Tips if automatic instrumentation doesn't work Tip If you want to get more background before getting started, check out these topics: How span sampling works explains distributed tracing options. Impacts to APM tells you what to expect if you are a current APM user but haven't set up distributed tracing. Quick start for standard distributed tracing (recommended): This is the best approach to set up standard distributed tracing if you haven't installed any New Relic APM agents for your services yet, or if you want to instrument additional services. Tip You'll need a New Relic account to set up distributed tracing. If you don't already have one, you can quickly create a free account. Step 1. Identify services Figure out which services you want to instrument so they each send trace data to New Relic. Step 2. Instrument each service with an APM agent We have installation assistants for a variety of languages to help you instrument each service. You should run the installation assistant for each service you want to instrument to ensure that each installation has a unique application name. To start the assistant, click the link for your language: New Relic APM: C New Relic APM: Golang New Relic APM: Java New Relic APM: .NET New Relic APM: Node.js New Relic APM: PHP New Relic APM: Python New Relic APM: Ruby Tip This quick-start approach with the installation assistant automatically enables distributed tracing for each service you run it on, but if you already have a New Relic APM agent that you want to participate in distributed tracing, you'll need to manually enable distributed tracing. See Options for older APM agents. Step 3. View traces After you instrument each of your services with APM agents, generate some traffic in your application so we can capture some traces. Here are two ways to view your traces in the UI: View traces that include a specific service Here's one way you can see traces for a particular service: Go to one.newrelic.com. Click APM in the top menu bar. Click your service. In the left navigation's Monitor section, click Distributed tracing. If you don't see the traces you want, you can filter by the trace.id. View traces across accounts This option allows you to search all traces across all New Relic accounts in your organization that you have access to. Go to one.newrelic.com. Click Browse data in the top menu bar, and then click Traces. Select your entity in the left pane. If you don't see the traces you want, you can filter by the trace.id. For more help finding your traces in the UI: Understand and use the distributed tracing UI Query distributed trace data Set up Infinite Tracing (advanced option) Standard distributed tracing for APM agents (above) captures up to 10% of your traces, but if you want us to analyze all your data and find the most relevant traces, you can set up Infinite Tracing. This alternative to standard distributed tracing is available for all APM language agents except C SDK. Tip To learn more about this feature, see Infinite Tracing. Before beginning, first ensure you meet the requirements. Step 1. Complete the instrumentation for standard distributed tracing in the quick start above The Infinite Tracing setup builds on the instrumentation step from the Quick start for standard distributed tracing. Step 2. Set up the trace observer The trace observer is a New Relic AWS-based service that collects and analyzes all your traces. Follow the instructions in Set up trace observer. When you're done, return here with your trace observer information and continue with the next step to configure the agent. Step 3: Configure the agent for Infinite Tracing Infinite Tracing configuration settings include the standard distributed tracing plus information about the trace observer. Find the settings for your language agent below: C SDK Infinite tracing is not available for C SDK. Go Here's an overview of the settings.

(Optional) Customize Infinite Tracing After you add the agent configuration settings, you should start seeing data in the New Relic UI. After you spend some time analyzing your data, you may want to adjust some of the features of Infinite Tracing: Configure trace observer monitoring Configure span attribute trace filter Configure random trace filter Options for older APM agents If you have older APM agents, use this section to figure out if the distributed tracing features you want are supported. Following the compatibility information is a section showing the basic configuration settings to turn on standard distributed tracing. If your older agent supports Infinite Tracing and you want to set it up, see the steps above.

Manual instrumentation (If automatic instrumentation doesn't work) Recommendation: Before performing any custom instrumentation, read: How distributed tracing works Troubleshoot missing data If a service is not passing the trace header to other services, you can use the distributed tracing payload APIs to instrument the calling service and the called service. The calling service uses an API call to generate a payload, which is accepted by the called service. Instrument the calling service To instrument the calling service: Ensure the version of the APM agent that monitors the calling service supports distributed tracing. Invoke the agent API call for generating a distributed trace payload: C SDK | Go | Java | .NET | Node.js | PHP | Python | Ruby. Important To maintain proper ordering of spans in a trace, ensure you generate the payload in the context of the span that sends it. Add that payload to the call made to the destination service (for example, in a header). (Optional) Identify the call as an external call: C SDK Go Java .NET: n/a Node.js PHP: n/a Python Ruby Instrument the called service To instrument the called service: Ensure the version of the APM agent that monitors the called service supports distributed tracing. If the New Relic agent on the called service does not identify a New Relic transaction, use the agent API to declare a transaction: C SDK One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload() is called, a NULL pointer is returned. To solve this problem, follow the procedures to create a transaction with the C SDK. Go One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when Transaction.InsertDistributedTraceHeaders(h http.Header) is called, no headers are inserted. To create a transaction, see Instrument Go transactions. Java One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when Transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(Headers) is called, no headers are inserted (this API requires agent 6.4.0+). To create a transaction, see Java agent transaction-related APIs. .NET One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: CreateDistributedTracePayload() returns an empty payload. To create a transaction, see Introduction to .NET custom instrumentation. Node.js One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: the Node.js agent logs will report an error similar to this: No transaction found when calling Transaction.acceptDistributedTracePayload. Copy Use startWebTransaction to create a web transaction or startBackgroundTransaction to capture a non-web transaction. PHP One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers() returns false. To create a transaction, see newrelic_start_transaction. Python To tell that a transaction is not in progress: when transaction = current_transaction() is run, transaction is None. Or, if result = accept_distributed_trace_payload(payload) is run, then the result is False. Use background_task to report a non-web transaction. For more on Python instrumentation, see Monitor transactions and segments. Ruby If you are using a Rack-based web framework and have enabled New Relic's Rack instrumentation, the Ruby agent will handle starting a transaction for you. For other use cases, see the add_transaction_tracer API method. Extract the payload from the call that you received (for example, in a header). Invoke the call for accepting the payload: C SDK | Go | Java | .NET | PHP | Node.js | Python | Ruby.",

      "body": "Summary This guide covers the major changes between the 6.x and 7.x series of the Ruby agent, issues that may be encountered while upgrading, and how to migrate successfully to version 7.x. Main changes include: Support for Ruby 2.0 and 2.1 is dropped SSL Certificate Bundle is removed Several APIs that were deprecated in various 6.x releases are now removed Auto-instrumentation defaults to prepend over method chaining Auto-instrumentation gets consistent configuration attributes See the milestone for 7.0 target release for more information. Support for Ruby 2.0 and 2.1 is dropped Ruby 2.0 and 2.1 reached EOL in February 2016, and New Relic is following suit with dropping support for these versions in the 7.0 release. There are no known changes that would inherently prevent these versions from continuing to work, but we are no longer guaranteeing the Ruby agent continues to function without issues going forward. If you need Ruby 2.0 or 2.1, then continue to use 6.15.0, which is the last release published to support these Ruby versions. Prepend instrumentation configuration Relevant pull request: Prepend instrumentation #565. Potential issue: The agent fails to initialize and start reporting data. A stack level too deep error message is reported in the logs. Solution: Our configuration and dependency detection mechanism can now be controlled through configuration. By default all auto-instrumented gems/libraries are activated with the prepend strategy. The default configuration setting for these libraries in the absence of any settings appearing in the configuration file is auto, which will pick the best strategy. In the case of a known conflict with prepend strategies, auto instructs the agent to fall back to method-chaining when such conflicts are detected. Below is a complete explanation of our changes to the configuration section for auto-instrumentation using sidekiq as an example. instrumentation: sidekiq: chain Copy Tip The use case for this is when an unknown gem is found to be conflicting. The user is able to revert to method-chaining to deal with the conflict until the agent can be updated to auto-detect and handle the conflict. To disable instrumentation altogether: instrumentation: sidekiq: disable Copy In some cases, we may know specific gems conflict with prepend. To facilitate, we offer by default an auto config option, which automatically degrades to chain in such cases. The default setting in most cases is thus: instrumentation: sidekiq: auto Copy It's possible to force using prepend strategy by specifying it in the config file: instrumentation: sidekiq: prepend Copy Tip The use case for this is when a newer version of the conflicting gem is released and it's known to no longer conflict with prepend strategy. If you encounter stack level too deep errors, see our troubleshooting guide on how to resolve these issues. After working through this troubleshooting guide, you can let us know about the prepend conflict you find by commenting on this GitHub issue. We appreciate your feedback so we may detect and automatically fall back to method-chaining in such scenarios. Modernized auto-instrumentation strategy Ruby introduced prepend as a way to insert method definitions earlier into the method resolution stack in Ruby 2.0 (released in 2013) with the intent that prepend eliminates the need to do method-chaining as a means of patching original gem libraries' implementations with trace/observability logic. Mixing prepend with method-chaining (a.k.a. method _ alias monkey patching) can lead to a known stack level too deep scenario as described in our blog post on the topic. New Relic has previously updated many auto-instrumented libraries over the years to use prepend strategy. The 7.0 release makes prepend the default strategy of choice to auto-instrument over method-chaining, except when known scenarios exist that would lead to triggering stack level too deep errors. A best effort to identify conflicting external gems that would lead to this scenario was made, but there are bound to be others out in the wild that we have not identified. In the past, we had only one way to auto-instrument for most gems and that was method-chaining. With 7.0 release, we can instrument most gems using either method-chaining or prepend and our configuration of all auto-instrumented gems has been updated to reflect this. With the modernization of our auto-instrumentation, we have also introduced new functionality in our dependency detection mechanism to identify conflicting external gems and automatically switch from prepend strategy to method-chaining. This means you no longer have to depend on the maintainers of other gems to make changes to their gem libraries in order to facilitate using the Ruby agent in conjunction with those gems. However, we are not aware of such conflicts until our users report them to us, so only a few of our auto-instrumented libraries can auto-detect these conflicts and auto-switch to method-chaining strategies. We need your help to hear about these scenarios and to add auto-detection to future Ruby agent releases. The SSL Certificate bundle is removed In the early days of Ruby (1.8, 1.9, etc.), integration with OpenSSL and making HTTPS connections was not well-handled. To ensure customers would be able to consistently make HTTPS connections to New Relic's Collector servers, a selection of SSL CA Certificates were bundled and distributed with the Ruby Agent. Over time, the Ruby ecosystem has stabilized and now supports system installed CA Certificates in a standard manner that largely obsoletes the need to bundle and distribute the certificate bundle. The vast majority of certificates bundled have expired or are nearing expiration, so we have decided to remove this dependency from the agent. If you're deploying a Ruby application and agent to a container or server that does not have CA certificates installed, you will need to ensure they're now installed for 7.0+ releases of the agent to make successful HTTPS connections to New Relic servers. For more information, see Remove cert bundle #478. Potential issue: If you're deploying to a host that does not have OpenSSL and system CA certificates installed, you may experience issues connecting to New Relic servers and experience loss of APM data. Solution: New Relic servers require HTTPS, which uses CA certificates to initiate successful connections. These may be installed, and depending on your host, in various ways. The following are helpful links for testing the readiness of your host and installing CA certificates: Troubleshooting SSL Certificate Errors Automated SSL Check Installing CA Certificates How to handle Certificates in Docker If needed, the agent can be configured to use any CA bundle by giving the path to the CA bundle file via configuration: :ca\\_bundle\\_path. Please see Custom SSL certificate for Ruby for more info. Deprecated API's and configuration attributes All deprecated API's have replacement API's that either expand scope and/or improve robustness of the deprecated API. Relevant pull requests are: Remove references to whitelist and blacklist in codebase #479 Remove deprecated ActiveRecord config options #480 Remove httpResponseCode attribute #481 Remove deprecated option from notice _ error API #597 Remove deprecated distributed trace API methods #598 Denied and allowed lists enabled Potential issue: Black/White listed attributes no longer work. Solution : Change black to denied and white to allowed in your configuration or environment variable settings. :autostart.blacklisted _ constants => :autostart.denylisted _ constants :autostart.blacklisted _ executables => :autostart.denylisted _ executables :autostart.blacklisted _ rake _ tasks => :autostart.denylisted _ rake _ tasks :strip _ exception _ messages.whitelist => :strip _ exception _ messages.allowed _ classes Active Record Potential issue: Disabling older Active Record versions no longer works. Solution: Change the following configuration settings: :disable _ active _ record _ 4 => :disable _ active _ record _ notifications :disable _ active _ record _ 5 => :disable _ active _ record _ notifications httpResponseCode Potential issue: The attribute httpResponseCode no longer appears in UI in the traces reported. Solution: httpResponseCode was replaced with http.statusCode. Notice Error (trace _ only) Potential issue: Passing the :trace\\_only option to NewRelic::Agent.notice\\_error no longer works. Solution: Replace :trace\\_only with the :expected attribute. Distributed Tracing APIs Potential issue: Errors are raised in application code while calling the api methods create_distributed_trace_payload and accept_distributed_trace_payload. Solution: Instead, please see insert _ distributed _ trace _ headers and accept _ distributed _ trace _ headers, respectively.",

      "body": "With the Ruby agent, you can add browser monitoring agent instrumentation to your webpages either automatically or manually. To enable browser monitoring in the UI, follow the procedures to install the browser agent. Then follow the procedures in this section to set up the Ruby agent. Requirements Automatic browser instrumentation is supported for most recent versions of Rails: New Relic Ruby agent (version 3.0.1 or higher) For automatic instrumentation: Rails 2.3 or higher For manual instrumentation: Rails 2.0 to 2.2 Use auto-instrumentation Automatic instrumentation works with Rack, and requires Rails 2.3 or higher. Configure the agent to automatically instrument pages with end user monitoring scripts, by adding or editing the following flag in newrelic.yml. browser_monitoring: auto_instrument: true Copy This is the simplest way to monitor end users. The Ruby agent examines each page from your application and automatically injects the browser JavaScript in the header. Auto-instrumentation works for environments that support Rack. For performance reasons the agent scans only the first 50k of your application's response for the header instrumentation point. In cases where a X-UA-Compatible meta tag is present and the <head> tag is longer than 50k, auto-instrumentation will fail gracefully. Auto-instrumentation will look for an X-UA-Compatible meta tag and insert the JavaScript directly after it. If the auto-instrumentation cannot find an X-UA-Compatible meta tag, it will insert after the opening head tag, and failing that it will insert after the opening body tag. If any of these tags are wrapped in conditionals or comments, the automatic instrumentation will likely fail. If auto-instrumentation fails to correctly instrument your application’s pages, then you must manually instrument via agent API. Manually instrument via agent API If you are using Rails 2.1 to 2.2 or cannot use auto-instrumentation, you can still set up end user monitoring manually by including appropriate scripts in your pages. Use the New Relic Ruby agent's API to generate the script to be inserted into your pages. For example, to modify your application's template to call the agent, use: <head> <%= ::NewRelic::Agent.browser_timing_header rescue \"\" %> ... existing template code ... </head> Copy CSP Nonce support CSP Nonce usage in our browser instrumentation is supported in version 7.1.0+ of the Ruby agent. To use a nonce with the browser instrumentation, you must disable browser monitoring auto instrumentation and use the manual instrumentation via the agent API. You may now pass a nonce as an argument into the API method to allow the agent to insert the nonce into the browser instrumentation. For example, NewRelic::Agent.browser_timing_header(nonce). Troubleshooting If you do not see any browser data being reported, view the HTML source and confirm two blocks of script similar to this in your HTML head: <script type=\"text/javascript\">window.NREUM||(NREUM={});...</script> Copy If these are not present, check the auto-instrumentation settings or the placement of manual instrumentation in your template files. In versions of the Ruby agent prior to 3.7.0, <%=::NewRelic::Agent.browser_timing_footer rescue \"\" %> also needed to be called as close to the bottom of the document as possible. With 3.7.0, all the required script is included by browser_timing_header. browser_timing_footer returns an empty string for compatibility. Disable auto-instrumentation The default value of auto-instrument is true (even when unspecified). To disable auto-instrumentation, set this flag to false. To disable auto-instrumentation only for certain controllers or controller actions, use newrelic_ignore_enduser. Server-side instrumentation will be unaffected by this call.",

      "body": "With the Ruby agent, you can add browser monitoring agent instrumentation to your webpages either automatically or manually. To enable browser monitoring in the UI, follow the procedures to install the browser agent. Then follow the procedures in this section to set up the Ruby agent. Requirements Automatic browser instrumentation is supported for most recent versions of Rails: New Relic Ruby agent (version 3.0.1 or higher) For automatic instrumentation: Rails 2.3 or higher For manual instrumentation: Rails 2.0 to 2.2 Use auto-instrumentation Automatic instrumentation works with Rack, and requires Rails 2.3 or higher. Configure the agent to automatically instrument pages with end user monitoring scripts, by adding or editing the following flag in newrelic.yml. browser_monitoring: auto_instrument: true Copy This is the simplest way to monitor end users. The Ruby agent examines each page from your application and automatically injects the browser JavaScript in the header. Auto-instrumentation works for environments that support Rack. For performance reasons the agent scans only the first 50k of your application's response for the header instrumentation point. In cases where a X-UA-Compatible meta tag is present and the <head> tag is longer than 50k, auto-instrumentation will fail gracefully. Auto-instrumentation will look for an X-UA-Compatible meta tag and insert the JavaScript directly after it. If the auto-instrumentation cannot find an X-UA-Compatible meta tag, it will insert after the opening head tag, and failing that it will insert after the opening body tag. If any of these tags are wrapped in conditionals or comments, the automatic instrumentation will likely fail. If auto-instrumentation fails to correctly instrument your application’s pages, then you must manually instrument via agent API. Manually instrument via agent API If you are using Rails 2.1 to 2.2 or cannot use auto-instrumentation, you can still set up end user monitoring manually by including appropriate scripts in your pages. Use the New Relic Ruby agent's API to generate the script to be inserted into your pages. For example, to modify your application's template to call the agent, use: <head> <%= ::NewRelic::Agent.browser_timing_header rescue \"\" %> ... existing template code ... </head> Copy CSP Nonce support CSP Nonce usage in our browser instrumentation is supported in version 7.1.0+ of the Ruby agent. To use a nonce with the browser instrumentation, you must disable browser monitoring auto instrumentation and use the manual instrumentation via the agent API. You may now pass a nonce as an argument into the API method to allow the agent to insert the nonce into the browser instrumentation. For example, NewRelic::Agent.browser_timing_header(nonce). Troubleshooting If you do not see any browser data being reported, view the HTML source and confirm two blocks of script similar to this in your HTML head: <script type=\"text/javascript\">window.NREUM||(NREUM={});...</script> Copy If these are not present, check the auto-instrumentation settings or the placement of manual instrumentation in your template files. In versions of the Ruby agent prior to 3.7.0, <%=::NewRelic::Agent.browser_timing_footer rescue \"\" %> also needed to be called as close to the bottom of the document as possible. With 3.7.0, all the required script is included by browser_timing_header. browser_timing_footer returns an empty string for compatibility. Disable auto-instrumentation The default value of auto-instrument is true (even when unspecified). To disable auto-instrumentation, set this flag to false. To disable auto-instrumentation only for certain controllers or controller actions, use newrelic_ignore_enduser. Server-side instrumentation will be unaffected by this call.",

      "body": "With the Ruby agent, you can add browser monitoring agent instrumentation to your webpages either automatically or manually. To enable browser monitoring in the UI, follow the procedures to install the browser agent. Then follow the procedures in this section to set up the Ruby agent. Requirements Automatic browser instrumentation is supported for most recent versions of Rails: New Relic Ruby agent (version 3.0.1 or higher) For automatic instrumentation: Rails 2.3 or higher For manual instrumentation: Rails 2.0 to 2.2 Use auto-instrumentation Automatic instrumentation works with Rack, and requires Rails 2.3 or higher. Configure the agent to automatically instrument pages with end user monitoring scripts, by adding or editing the following flag in newrelic.yml. browser_monitoring: auto_instrument: true Copy This is the simplest way to monitor end users. The Ruby agent examines each page from your application and automatically injects the browser JavaScript in the header. Auto-instrumentation works for environments that support Rack. For performance reasons the agent scans only the first 50k of your application's response for the header instrumentation point. In cases where a X-UA-Compatible meta tag is present and the <head> tag is longer than 50k, auto-instrumentation will fail gracefully. Auto-instrumentation will look for an X-UA-Compatible meta tag and insert the JavaScript directly after it. If the auto-instrumentation cannot find an X-UA-Compatible meta tag, it will insert after the opening head tag, and failing that it will insert after the opening body tag. If any of these tags are wrapped in conditionals or comments, the automatic instrumentation will likely fail. If auto-instrumentation fails to correctly instrument your application’s pages, then you must manually instrument via agent API. Manually instrument via agent API If you are using Rails 2.1 to 2.2 or cannot use auto-instrumentation, you can still set up end user monitoring manually by including appropriate scripts in your pages. Use the New Relic Ruby agent's API to generate the script to be inserted into your pages. For example, to modify your application's template to call the agent, use: <head> <%= ::NewRelic::Agent.browser_timing_header rescue \"\" %> ... existing template code ... </head> Copy CSP Nonce support CSP Nonce usage in our browser instrumentation is supported in version 7.1.0+ of the Ruby agent. To use a nonce with the browser instrumentation, you must disable browser monitoring auto instrumentation and use the manual instrumentation via the agent API. You may now pass a nonce as an argument into the API method to allow the agent to insert the nonce into the browser instrumentation. For example, NewRelic::Agent.browser_timing_header(nonce). Troubleshooting If you do not see any browser data being reported, view the HTML source and confirm two blocks of script similar to this in your HTML head: <script type=\"text/javascript\">window.NREUM||(NREUM={});...</script> Copy If these are not present, check the auto-instrumentation settings or the placement of manual instrumentation in your template files. In versions of the Ruby agent prior to 3.7.0, <%=::NewRelic::Agent.browser_timing_footer rescue \"\" %> also needed to be called as close to the bottom of the document as possible. With 3.7.0, all the required script is included by browser_timing_header. browser_timing_footer returns an empty string for compatibility. Disable auto-instrumentation The default value of auto-instrument is true (even when unspecified). To disable auto-instrumentation, set this flag to false. To disable auto-instrumentation only for certain controllers or controller actions, use newrelic_ignore_enduser. Server-side instrumentation will be unaffected by this call.",

Capability Integration Browser monitoring The Ruby agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see the browser and Ruby agent documentation. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in infrastructure monitoring. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from Synthetics monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

      "body": "With the Ruby agent, you can add browser monitoring agent instrumentation to your webpages either automatically or manually. To enable browser monitoring in the UI, follow the procedures to install the browser agent. Then follow the procedures in this section to set up the Ruby agent. Requirements Automatic browser instrumentation is supported for most recent versions of Rails: New Relic Ruby agent (version 3.0.1 or higher) For automatic instrumentation: Rails 2.3 or higher For manual instrumentation: Rails 2.0 to 2.2 Use auto-instrumentation Automatic instrumentation works with Rack, and requires Rails 2.3 or higher. Configure the agent to automatically instrument pages with end user monitoring scripts, by adding or editing the following flag in newrelic.yml. browser_monitoring: auto_instrument: true Copy This is the simplest way to monitor end users. The Ruby agent examines each page from your application and automatically injects the browser JavaScript in the header. Auto-instrumentation works for environments that support Rack. For performance reasons the agent scans only the first 50k of your application's response for the header instrumentation point. In cases where a X-UA-Compatible meta tag is present and the <head> tag is longer than 50k, auto-instrumentation will fail gracefully. Auto-instrumentation will look for an X-UA-Compatible meta tag and insert the JavaScript directly after it. If the auto-instrumentation cannot find an X-UA-Compatible meta tag, it will insert after the opening head tag, and failing that it will insert after the opening body tag. If any of these tags are wrapped in conditionals or comments, the automatic instrumentation will likely fail. If auto-instrumentation fails to correctly instrument your application’s pages, then you must manually instrument via agent API. Manually instrument via agent API If you are using Rails 2.1 to 2.2 or cannot use auto-instrumentation, you can still set up end user monitoring manually by including appropriate scripts in your pages. Use the New Relic Ruby agent's API to generate the script to be inserted into your pages. For example, to modify your application's template to call the agent, use: <head> <%= ::NewRelic::Agent.browser_timing_header rescue \"\" %> ... existing template code ... </head> Copy CSP Nonce support CSP Nonce usage in our browser instrumentation is supported in version 7.1.0+ of the Ruby agent. To use a nonce with the browser instrumentation, you must disable browser monitoring auto instrumentation and use the manual instrumentation via the agent API. You may now pass a nonce as an argument into the API method to allow the agent to insert the nonce into the browser instrumentation. For example, NewRelic::Agent.browser_timing_header(nonce). Troubleshooting If you do not see any browser data being reported, view the HTML source and confirm two blocks of script similar to this in your HTML head: <script type=\"text/javascript\">window.NREUM||(NREUM={});...</script> Copy If these are not present, check the auto-instrumentation settings or the placement of manual instrumentation in your template files. In versions of the Ruby agent prior to 3.7.0, <%=::NewRelic::Agent.browser_timing_footer rescue \"\" %> also needed to be called as close to the bottom of the document as possible. With 3.7.0, all the required script is included by browser_timing_header. browser_timing_footer returns an empty string for compatibility. Disable auto-instrumentation The default value of auto-instrument is true (even when unspecified). To disable auto-instrumentation, set this flag to false. To disable auto-instrumentation only for certain controllers or controller actions, use newrelic_ignore_enduser. Server-side instrumentation will be unaffected by this call.",

The New Relic Ruby agent can collect information about how much time is spent in garbage collection for applications running on MRI 1.9.2 or higher or Ruby Enterprise Edition, but you must explicitly enable this feature in your application. Important Avoid using garbage collection in production for long periods of time, as it increases overhead. Enable garbage collection instrumentation To activate the feature, add the appropriate call in your application initialization.

Capability Integration Browser monitoring The Ruby agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see the browser and Ruby agent documentation. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in infrastructure monitoring. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from Synthetics monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

      "body": "With the Ruby agent, you can add browser monitoring agent instrumentation to your webpages either automatically or manually. To enable browser monitoring in the UI, follow the procedures to install the browser agent. Then follow the procedures in this section to set up the Ruby agent. Requirements Automatic browser instrumentation is supported for most recent versions of Rails: New Relic Ruby agent (version 3.0.1 or higher) For automatic instrumentation: Rails 2.3 or higher For manual instrumentation: Rails 2.0 to 2.2 Use auto-instrumentation Automatic instrumentation works with Rack, and requires Rails 2.3 or higher. Configure the agent to automatically instrument pages with end user monitoring scripts, by adding or editing the following flag in newrelic.yml. browser_monitoring: auto_instrument: true Copy This is the simplest way to monitor end users. The Ruby agent examines each page from your application and automatically injects the browser JavaScript in the header. Auto-instrumentation works for environments that support Rack. For performance reasons the agent scans only the first 50k of your application's response for the header instrumentation point. In cases where a X-UA-Compatible meta tag is present and the <head> tag is longer than 50k, auto-instrumentation will fail gracefully. Auto-instrumentation will look for an X-UA-Compatible meta tag and insert the JavaScript directly after it. If the auto-instrumentation cannot find an X-UA-Compatible meta tag, it will insert after the opening head tag, and failing that it will insert after the opening body tag. If any of these tags are wrapped in conditionals or comments, the automatic instrumentation will likely fail. If auto-instrumentation fails to correctly instrument your application’s pages, then you must manually instrument via agent API. Manually instrument via agent API If you are using Rails 2.1 to 2.2 or cannot use auto-instrumentation, you can still set up end user monitoring manually by including appropriate scripts in your pages. Use the New Relic Ruby agent's API to generate the script to be inserted into your pages. For example, to modify your application's template to call the agent, use: <head> <%= ::NewRelic::Agent.browser_timing_header rescue \"\" %> ... existing template code ... </head> Copy CSP Nonce support CSP Nonce usage in our browser instrumentation is supported in version 7.1.0+ of the Ruby agent. To use a nonce with the browser instrumentation, you must disable browser monitoring auto instrumentation and use the manual instrumentation via the agent API. You may now pass a nonce as an argument into the API method to allow the agent to insert the nonce into the browser instrumentation. For example, NewRelic::Agent.browser_timing_header(nonce). Troubleshooting If you do not see any browser data being reported, view the HTML source and confirm two blocks of script similar to this in your HTML head: <script type=\"text/javascript\">window.NREUM||(NREUM={});...</script> Copy If these are not present, check the auto-instrumentation settings or the placement of manual instrumentation in your template files. In versions of the Ruby agent prior to 3.7.0, <%=::NewRelic::Agent.browser_timing_footer rescue \"\" %> also needed to be called as close to the bottom of the document as possible. With 3.7.0, all the required script is included by browser_timing_header. browser_timing_footer returns an empty string for compatibility. Disable auto-instrumentation The default value of auto-instrument is true (even when unspecified). To disable auto-instrumentation, set this flag to false. To disable auto-instrumentation only for certain controllers or controller actions, use newrelic_ignore_enduser. Server-side instrumentation will be unaffected by this call.",

      "body": "With the Ruby agent, you can add browser monitoring agent instrumentation to your webpages either automatically or manually. To enable browser monitoring in the UI, follow the procedures to install the browser agent. Then follow the procedures in this section to set up the Ruby agent. Requirements Automatic browser instrumentation is supported for most recent versions of Rails: New Relic Ruby agent (version 3.0.1 or higher) For automatic instrumentation: Rails 2.3 or higher For manual instrumentation: Rails 2.0 to 2.2 Use auto-instrumentation Automatic instrumentation works with Rack, and requires Rails 2.3 or higher. Configure the agent to automatically instrument pages with end user monitoring scripts, by adding or editing the following flag in newrelic.yml. browser_monitoring: auto_instrument: true Copy This is the simplest way to monitor end users. The Ruby agent examines each page from your application and automatically injects the browser JavaScript in the header. Auto-instrumentation works for environments that support Rack. For performance reasons the agent scans only the first 50k of your application's response for the header instrumentation point. In cases where a X-UA-Compatible meta tag is present and the <head> tag is longer than 50k, auto-instrumentation will fail gracefully. Auto-instrumentation will look for an X-UA-Compatible meta tag and insert the JavaScript directly after it. If the auto-instrumentation cannot find an X-UA-Compatible meta tag, it will insert after the opening head tag, and failing that it will insert after the opening body tag. If any of these tags are wrapped in conditionals or comments, the automatic instrumentation will likely fail. If auto-instrumentation fails to correctly instrument your application’s pages, then you must manually instrument via agent API. Manually instrument via agent API If you are using Rails 2.1 to 2.2 or cannot use auto-instrumentation, you can still set up end user monitoring manually by including appropriate scripts in your pages. Use the New Relic Ruby agent's API to generate the script to be inserted into your pages. For example, to modify your application's template to call the agent, use: <head> <%= ::NewRelic::Agent.browser_timing_header rescue \"\" %> ... existing template code ... </head> Copy CSP Nonce support CSP Nonce usage in our browser instrumentation is supported in version 7.1.0+ of the Ruby agent. To use a nonce with the browser instrumentation, you must disable browser monitoring auto instrumentation and use the manual instrumentation via the agent API. You may now pass a nonce as an argument into the API method to allow the agent to insert the nonce into the browser instrumentation. For example, NewRelic::Agent.browser_timing_header(nonce). Troubleshooting If you do not see any browser data being reported, view the HTML source and confirm two blocks of script similar to this in your HTML head: <script type=\"text/javascript\">window.NREUM||(NREUM={});...</script> Copy If these are not present, check the auto-instrumentation settings or the placement of manual instrumentation in your template files. In versions of the Ruby agent prior to 3.7.0, <%=::NewRelic::Agent.browser_timing_footer rescue \"\" %> also needed to be called as close to the bottom of the document as possible. With 3.7.0, all the required script is included by browser_timing_header. browser_timing_footer returns an empty string for compatibility. Disable auto-instrumentation The default value of auto-instrument is true (even when unspecified). To disable auto-instrumentation, set this flag to false. To disable auto-instrumentation only for certain controllers or controller actions, use newrelic_ignore_enduser. Server-side instrumentation will be unaffected by this call.",

      "body": "The Ruby agent automatically instruments Rack middlewares. If you are unfamiliar with the basics of Rack middlewares, review the resources linked by the Rails on Rack guide. Additionally, the Ruby agent provides some features via Rack middlewares: Cross application traces Auto-instrumentation for browser monitoring New Relic automatically installs these middlewares for Rails and Sinatra. Rack instrumentation The two most common ways to configure Rack middlewares are the Rack::Builder API (most often from config.ru) and Rails' middleware stack configuration: Rack::Builder Middlewares in your config.ru file are configured using Rack::Builder. For the Ruby agent to instrument middlewares from Rack::Builder, your app must run version 1.1.0 or higher of the rack gem. This is the most common use of middlewares with Sinatra or pure-rack applications. Rails middlewares Rails uses its own class (ActionDispatch::MiddlewareStack) instead of Rack::Builder to configure middlewares. Even if you haven't explicitly added middlewares to your Rails application, many components of Rails itself are implemented as middleware, so middleware data will appear by default. The Ruby agent automatically instruments middlewares added via ActionDispatch::MiddlewareStack on Rails 3.0 or higher. For more information about configuring middlewares with Rails, see the Ruby on Rails guide. Viewing middleware data You can view middleware data in APM. In the APM Summary page The main chart on your app's APM Summary page includes a purple bar that shows average time per request spent in all Rack middlewares for your application. APM > (selected application) > Summary: Middleware time appears in purple on your app's main Overview chart. In the APM Transactions page You can also see time for individual middlewares for a specific transaction name from your app's APM Transactions page. APM > (selected application) > Monitor > Transactions > (selected transaction) > Trace details: Here is an example of middleware time for a selected transaction for your app. In APM transaction trace summary Transaction traces also capture detailed middleware call information. APM > (selected application) > Monitor > Transactions > (selected transaction trace): Here is an example of middleware details in a transaction trace. Disabling Rack instrumentation If you do not want to instrument Rack middlewares, you may disable Rack middleware instrumentation with the disable_middleware_instrumentation setting. You can also ignore specific transactions. Installing Ruby agent middlewares manually The Ruby agent's implementation of New Relic's Cross Application Tracing feature uses Rack middleware instrumentation to read and write HTTP headers that are necessary to pass information between monitored applications. If you have disabled middleware instrumentation as described above and want to use cross application tracing, you must manually add the NewRelic::Rack::AgentHooks middleware to your middleware stack. For more information, see Cross application tracing in Ruby. Manual Rack instrumentation Earlier versions of the Ruby agent supported manually instrumenting Rack middlewares via the NewRelic::Agent::Instrumentation::Rack module. This instrumentation is deprecated in Ruby agent versions 3.9.0 or higher, because it is unnecessary with automatic middleware instrumentation. New Relic recommends that you remove references to this module from your code after upgrading to 3.9.0 or higher.",

Contents Getting started To set up Sinatra: Install the latest newrelic_rpm gem. In your Sinatra app, immediately below the Sinatra require directive, add: require 'newrelic_rpm' Copy Set RACK_ENV to the environment corresponding to the configuration definitions in your newrelic.yml file; for example, development, staging, production, etc. Note: Developer mode only works with Rails. Middleware installation Ruby agent versions prior to 3.6.3 required manual addition of New Relic middlewares to enable certain features, such as cross application tracing and browser monitoring. For more information about required middlewares, see Rack middlewares, or upgrade to the most recent Ruby agent. Ignoring routes Ruby agent versions 3.6.3 or higher support ignoring certain routes, similar to what was previously available in Rails controller instrumentation. To specify these values, use the same style of routes that you use to define your Sinatra application. For example, to ignore a ping route in a Sinatra app, include the following code in the app: newrelic_ignore '/ping' get '/ping' do # ... end Copy If you want an entire application to be ignored (for example, in a mounted application), call newrelic_ignore without parameters: newrelic_ignore Copy Additionally, newrelic_ignore_apdex and newrelic_ignore_enduser are supported. The newrelic_ignore_apdex call will exclude a given route from consideration in overall Apdex calculations. The newrelic_ignore_enduser call will prevent automatic injection of the page load timing JavaScript when a route is rendered. Padrino Padrino is a framework built on top of Sinatra.

      "body": "Summary This guide covers the major changes between the 6.x and 7.x series of the Ruby agent, issues that may be encountered while upgrading, and how to migrate successfully to version 7.x. Main changes include: Support for Ruby 2.0 and 2.1 is dropped SSL Certificate Bundle is removed Several APIs that were deprecated in various 6.x releases are now removed Auto-instrumentation defaults to prepend over method chaining Auto-instrumentation gets consistent configuration attributes See the milestone for 7.0 target release for more information. Support for Ruby 2.0 and 2.1 is dropped Ruby 2.0 and 2.1 reached EOL in February 2016, and New Relic is following suit with dropping support for these versions in the 7.0 release. There are no known changes that would inherently prevent these versions from continuing to work, but we are no longer guaranteeing the Ruby agent continues to function without issues going forward. If you need Ruby 2.0 or 2.1, then continue to use 6.15.0, which is the last release published to support these Ruby versions. Prepend instrumentation configuration Relevant pull request: Prepend instrumentation #565. Potential issue: The agent fails to initialize and start reporting data. A stack level too deep error message is reported in the logs. Solution: Our configuration and dependency detection mechanism can now be controlled through configuration. By default all auto-instrumented gems/libraries are activated with the prepend strategy. The default configuration setting for these libraries in the absence of any settings appearing in the configuration file is auto, which will pick the best strategy. In the case of a known conflict with prepend strategies, auto instructs the agent to fall back to method-chaining when such conflicts are detected. Below is a complete explanation of our changes to the configuration section for auto-instrumentation using sidekiq as an example. instrumentation: sidekiq: chain Copy Tip The use case for this is when an unknown gem is found to be conflicting. The user is able to revert to method-chaining to deal with the conflict until the agent can be updated to auto-detect and handle the conflict. To disable instrumentation altogether: instrumentation: sidekiq: disable Copy In some cases, we may know specific gems conflict with prepend. To facilitate, we offer by default an auto config option, which automatically degrades to chain in such cases. The default setting in most cases is thus: instrumentation: sidekiq: auto Copy It's possible to force using prepend strategy by specifying it in the config file: instrumentation: sidekiq: prepend Copy Tip The use case for this is when a newer version of the conflicting gem is released and it's known to no longer conflict with prepend strategy. If you encounter stack level too deep errors, see our troubleshooting guide on how to resolve these issues. After working through this troubleshooting guide, you can let us know about the prepend conflict you find by commenting on this GitHub issue. We appreciate your feedback so we may detect and automatically fall back to method-chaining in such scenarios. Modernized auto-instrumentation strategy Ruby introduced prepend as a way to insert method definitions earlier into the method resolution stack in Ruby 2.0 (released in 2013) with the intent that prepend eliminates the need to do method-chaining as a means of patching original gem libraries' implementations with trace/observability logic. Mixing prepend with method-chaining (a.k.a. method _ alias monkey patching) can lead to a known stack level too deep scenario as described in our blog post on the topic. New Relic has previously updated many auto-instrumented libraries over the years to use prepend strategy. The 7.0 release makes prepend the default strategy of choice to auto-instrument over method-chaining, except when known scenarios exist that would lead to triggering stack level too deep errors. A best effort to identify conflicting external gems that would lead to this scenario was made, but there are bound to be others out in the wild that we have not identified. In the past, we had only one way to auto-instrument for most gems and that was method-chaining. With 7.0 release, we can instrument most gems using either method-chaining or prepend and our configuration of all auto-instrumented gems has been updated to reflect this. With the modernization of our auto-instrumentation, we have also introduced new functionality in our dependency detection mechanism to identify conflicting external gems and automatically switch from prepend strategy to method-chaining. This means you no longer have to depend on the maintainers of other gems to make changes to their gem libraries in order to facilitate using the Ruby agent in conjunction with those gems. However, we are not aware of such conflicts until our users report them to us, so only a few of our auto-instrumented libraries can auto-detect these conflicts and auto-switch to method-chaining strategies. We need your help to hear about these scenarios and to add auto-detection to future Ruby agent releases. The SSL Certificate bundle is removed In the early days of Ruby (1.8, 1.9, etc.), integration with OpenSSL and making HTTPS connections was not well-handled. To ensure customers would be able to consistently make HTTPS connections to New Relic's Collector servers, a selection of SSL CA Certificates were bundled and distributed with the Ruby Agent. Over time, the Ruby ecosystem has stabilized and now supports system installed CA Certificates in a standard manner that largely obsoletes the need to bundle and distribute the certificate bundle. The vast majority of certificates bundled have expired or are nearing expiration, so we have decided to remove this dependency from the agent. If you're deploying a Ruby application and agent to a container or server that does not have CA certificates installed, you will need to ensure they're now installed for 7.0+ releases of the agent to make successful HTTPS connections to New Relic servers. For more information, see Remove cert bundle #478. Potential issue: If you're deploying to a host that does not have OpenSSL and system CA certificates installed, you may experience issues connecting to New Relic servers and experience loss of APM data. Solution: New Relic servers require HTTPS, which uses CA certificates to initiate successful connections. These may be installed, and depending on your host, in various ways. The following are helpful links for testing the readiness of your host and installing CA certificates: Troubleshooting SSL Certificate Errors Automated SSL Check Installing CA Certificates How to handle Certificates in Docker If needed, the agent can be configured to use any CA bundle by giving the path to the CA bundle file via configuration: :ca\\_bundle\\_path.

      "body": "The Ruby agent automatically instruments Rack middlewares. If you are unfamiliar with the basics of Rack middlewares, review the resources linked by the Rails on Rack guide. Additionally, the Ruby agent provides some features via Rack middlewares: Cross application traces Auto-instrumentation for browser monitoring New Relic automatically installs these middlewares for Rails and Sinatra. Rack instrumentation The two most common ways to configure Rack middlewares are the Rack::Builder API (most often from config.ru) and Rails' middleware stack configuration: Rack::Builder Middlewares in your config.ru file are configured using Rack::Builder. For the Ruby agent to instrument middlewares from Rack::Builder, your app must run version 1.1.0 or higher of the rack gem. This is the most common use of middlewares with Sinatra or pure-rack applications. Rails middlewares Rails uses its own class (ActionDispatch::MiddlewareStack) instead of Rack::Builder to configure middlewares. Even if you haven't explicitly added middlewares to your Rails application, many components of Rails itself are implemented as middleware, so middleware data will appear by default. The Ruby agent automatically instruments middlewares added via ActionDispatch::MiddlewareStack on Rails 3.0 or higher. For more information about configuring middlewares with Rails, see the Ruby on Rails guide. Viewing middleware data You can view middleware data in APM. In the APM Summary page The main chart on your app's APM Summary page includes a purple bar that shows average time per request spent in all Rack middlewares for your application. APM > (selected application) > Summary: Middleware time appears in purple on your app's main Overview chart. In the APM Transactions page You can also see time for individual middlewares for a specific transaction name from your app's APM Transactions page. APM > (selected application) > Monitor > Transactions > (selected transaction) > Trace details: Here is an example of middleware time for a selected transaction for your app. In APM transaction trace summary Transaction traces also capture detailed middleware call information. APM > (selected application) > Monitor > Transactions > (selected transaction trace): Here is an example of middleware details in a transaction trace. Disabling Rack instrumentation If you do not want to instrument Rack middlewares, you may disable Rack middleware instrumentation with the disable_middleware_instrumentation setting. You can also ignore specific transactions. Installing Ruby agent middlewares manually The Ruby agent's implementation of New Relic's Cross Application Tracing feature uses Rack middleware instrumentation to read and write HTTP headers that are necessary to pass information between monitored applications. If you have disabled middleware instrumentation as described above and want to use cross application tracing, you must manually add the NewRelic::Rack::AgentHooks middleware to your middleware stack. For more information, see Cross application tracing in Ruby. Manual Rack instrumentation Earlier versions of the Ruby agent supported manually instrumenting Rack middlewares via the NewRelic::Agent::Instrumentation::Rack module. This instrumentation is deprecated in Ruby agent versions 3.9.0 or higher, because it is unnecessary with automatic middleware instrumentation. New Relic recommends that you remove references to this module from your code after upgrading to 3.9.0 or higher.",

The actions in the UI correspond to the pattern expression used to match them. HTTP operations are not distinguished. Multiple matches are all tracked as separate actions. Contents Getting started To set up Sinatra: Install the latest newrelic_rpm gem. In your Sinatra app, immediately below the Sinatra require directive, add: require 'newrelic_rpm' Copy Set RACK_ENV to the environment corresponding to the configuration definitions in your newrelic.yml file; for example, development, staging, production, etc. Note: Developer mode only works with Rails. Middleware installation Ruby agent versions prior to 3.6.3 required manual addition of New Relic middlewares to enable certain features, such as cross application tracing and browser monitoring. For more information about required middlewares, see Rack middlewares, or upgrade to the most recent Ruby agent. Ignoring routes Ruby agent versions 3.6.3 or higher support ignoring certain routes, similar to what was previously available in Rails controller instrumentation. To specify these values, use the same style of routes that you use to define your Sinatra application. For example, to ignore a ping route in a Sinatra app, include the following code in the app: newrelic_ignore '/ping' get '/ping' do # ... end Copy If you want an entire application to be ignored (for example, in a mounted application), call newrelic_ignore without parameters: newrelic_ignore Copy Additionally, newrelic_ignore_apdex and newrelic_ignore_enduser are supported. The newrelic_ignore_apdex call will exclude a given route from consideration in overall Apdex calculations. The newrelic_ignore_enduser call will prevent automatic injection of the page load timing JavaScript when a route is rendered. Padrino Padrino is a framework built on top of Sinatra. Starting with Ruby agent version 3.6.3, New Relic's Sinatra instrumentation works with Padrino versions 0.10.x or higher. Shotgun (not supported) The New Relic Ruby agent will not work with shotgun.

If you have disabled middleware instrumentation as described above and want to use cross application tracing, you must manually add the NewRelic::Rack::AgentHooks middleware to your middleware stack. For more information, see Cross application tracing in Ruby.

      "body": "Summary This guide covers the major changes between the 6.x and 7.x series of the Ruby agent, issues that may be encountered while upgrading, and how to migrate successfully to version 7.x. Main changes include: Support for Ruby 2.0 and 2.1 is dropped SSL Certificate Bundle is removed Several APIs that were deprecated in various 6.x releases are now removed Auto-instrumentation defaults to prepend over method chaining Auto-instrumentation gets consistent configuration attributes See the milestone for 7.0 target release for more information. Support for Ruby 2.0 and 2.1 is dropped Ruby 2.0 and 2.1 reached EOL in February 2016, and New Relic is following suit with dropping support for these versions in the 7.0 release. There are no known changes that would inherently prevent these versions from continuing to work, but we are no longer guaranteeing the Ruby agent continues to function without issues going forward. If you need Ruby 2.0 or 2.1, then continue to use 6.15.0, which is the last release published to support these Ruby versions. Prepend instrumentation configuration Relevant pull request: Prepend instrumentation #565. Potential issue: The agent fails to initialize and start reporting data. A stack level too deep error message is reported in the logs. Solution: Our configuration and dependency detection mechanism can now be controlled through configuration. By default all auto-instrumented gems/libraries are activated with the prepend strategy. The default configuration setting for these libraries in the absence of any settings appearing in the configuration file is auto, which will pick the best strategy. In the case of a known conflict with prepend strategies, auto instructs the agent to fall back to method-chaining when such conflicts are detected. Below is a complete explanation of our changes to the configuration section for auto-instrumentation using sidekiq as an example. instrumentation: sidekiq: chain Copy Tip The use case for this is when an unknown gem is found to be conflicting. The user is able to revert to method-chaining to deal with the conflict until the agent can be updated to auto-detect and handle the conflict. To disable instrumentation altogether: instrumentation: sidekiq: disable Copy In some cases, we may know specific gems conflict with prepend. To facilitate, we offer by default an auto config option, which automatically degrades to chain in such cases. The default setting in most cases is thus: instrumentation: sidekiq: auto Copy It's possible to force using prepend strategy by specifying it in the config file: instrumentation: sidekiq: prepend Copy Tip The use case for this is when a newer version of the conflicting gem is released and it's known to no longer conflict with prepend strategy. If you encounter stack level too deep errors, see our troubleshooting guide on how to resolve these issues. After working through this troubleshooting guide, you can let us know about the prepend conflict you find by commenting on this GitHub issue. We appreciate your feedback so we may detect and automatically fall back to method-chaining in such scenarios. Modernized auto-instrumentation strategy Ruby introduced prepend as a way to insert method definitions earlier into the method resolution stack in Ruby 2.0 (released in 2013) with the intent that prepend eliminates the need to do method-chaining as a means of patching original gem libraries' implementations with trace/observability logic. Mixing prepend with method-chaining (a.k.a. method _ alias monkey patching) can lead to a known stack level too deep scenario as described in our blog post on the topic. New Relic has previously updated many auto-instrumented libraries over the years to use prepend strategy. The 7.0 release makes prepend the default strategy of choice to auto-instrument over method-chaining, except when known scenarios exist that would lead to triggering stack level too deep errors. A best effort to identify conflicting external gems that would lead to this scenario was made, but there are bound to be others out in the wild that we have not identified. In the past, we had only one way to auto-instrument for most gems and that was method-chaining. With 7.0 release, we can instrument most gems using either method-chaining or prepend and our configuration of all auto-instrumented gems has been updated to reflect this. With the modernization of our auto-instrumentation, we have also introduced new functionality in our dependency detection mechanism to identify conflicting external gems and automatically switch from prepend strategy to method-chaining. This means you no longer have to depend on the maintainers of other gems to make changes to their gem libraries in order to facilitate using the Ruby agent in conjunction with those gems. However, we are not aware of such conflicts until our users report them to us, so only a few of our auto-instrumented libraries can auto-detect these conflicts and auto-switch to method-chaining strategies. We need your help to hear about these scenarios and to add auto-detection to future Ruby agent releases. The SSL Certificate bundle is removed In the early days of Ruby (1.8, 1.9, etc.), integration with OpenSSL and making HTTPS connections was not well-handled. To ensure customers would be able to consistently make HTTPS connections to New Relic's Collector servers, a selection of SSL CA Certificates were bundled and distributed with the Ruby Agent. Over time, the Ruby ecosystem has stabilized and now supports system installed CA Certificates in a standard manner that largely obsoletes the need to bundle and distribute the certificate bundle. The vast majority of certificates bundled have expired or are nearing expiration, so we have decided to remove this dependency from the agent. If you're deploying a Ruby application and agent to a container or server that does not have CA certificates installed, you will need to ensure they're now installed for 7.0+ releases of the agent to make successful HTTPS connections to New Relic servers. For more information, see Remove cert bundle #478. Potential issue: If you're deploying to a host that does not have OpenSSL and system CA certificates installed, you may experience issues connecting to New Relic servers and experience loss of APM data. Solution: New Relic servers require HTTPS, which uses CA certificates to initiate successful connections. These may be installed, and depending on your host, in various ways. The following are helpful links for testing the readiness of your host and installing CA certificates: Troubleshooting SSL Certificate Errors Automated SSL Check Installing CA Certificates How to handle Certificates in Docker If needed, the agent can be configured to use any CA bundle by giving the path to the CA bundle file via configuration: :ca\\_bundle\\_path. Please see Custom SSL certificate for Ruby for more info. Deprecated API's and configuration attributes All deprecated API's have replacement API's that either expand scope and/or improve robustness of the deprecated API.

Solution: Change the following configuration settings: :disable _ active _ record _ 4 => :disable _ active _ record _ notifications :disable _ active _ record _ 5 => :disable _ active _ record _ notifications httpResponseCode Potential issue: The attribute httpResponseCode no longer appears in UI in the traces reported. Solution: httpResponseCode was replaced with http.statusCode. Notice Error (trace _ only) Potential issue: Passing the :trace\\_only option to NewRelic::Agent.notice\\_error no longer works. Solution: Replace :trace\\_only with the :expected attribute. Distributed Tracing APIs Potential issue: Errors are raised in application code while calling the api methods create_distributed_trace_payload and accept_distributed_trace_payload. Solution: Instead, please see insert _ distributed _ trace _ headers and accept _ distributed _ trace _ headers, respectively.",

      "body": "Summary This guide covers the major changes between the 6.x and 7.x series of the Ruby agent, issues that may be encountered while upgrading, and how to migrate successfully to version 7.x. Main changes include: Support for Ruby 2.0 and 2.1 is dropped SSL Certificate Bundle is removed Several APIs that were deprecated in various 6.x releases are now removed Auto-instrumentation defaults to prepend over method chaining Auto-instrumentation gets consistent configuration attributes See the milestone for 7.0 target release for more information. Support for Ruby 2.0 and 2.1 is dropped Ruby 2.0 and 2.1 reached EOL in February 2016, and New Relic is following suit with dropping support for these versions in the 7.0 release. There are no known changes that would inherently prevent these versions from continuing to work, but we are no longer guaranteeing the Ruby agent continues to function without issues going forward. If you need Ruby 2.0 or 2.1, then continue to use 6.15.0, which is the last release published to support these Ruby versions. Prepend instrumentation configuration Relevant pull request: Prepend instrumentation #565. Potential issue: The agent fails to initialize and start reporting data. A stack level too deep error message is reported in the logs. Solution: Our configuration and dependency detection mechanism can now be controlled through configuration. By default all auto-instrumented gems/libraries are activated with the prepend strategy. The default configuration setting for these libraries in the absence of any settings appearing in the configuration file is auto, which will pick the best strategy. In the case of a known conflict with prepend strategies, auto instructs the agent to fall back to method-chaining when such conflicts are detected. Below is a complete explanation of our changes to the configuration section for auto-instrumentation using sidekiq as an example. instrumentation: sidekiq: chain Copy Tip The use case for this is when an unknown gem is found to be conflicting. The user is able to revert to method-chaining to deal with the conflict until the agent can be updated to auto-detect and handle the conflict. To disable instrumentation altogether: instrumentation: sidekiq: disable Copy In some cases, we may know specific gems conflict with prepend. To facilitate, we offer by default an auto config option, which automatically degrades to chain in such cases. The default setting in most cases is thus: instrumentation: sidekiq: auto Copy It's possible to force using prepend strategy by specifying it in the config file: instrumentation: sidekiq: prepend Copy Tip The use case for this is when a newer version of the conflicting gem is released and it's known to no longer conflict with prepend strategy. If you encounter stack level too deep errors, see our troubleshooting guide on how to resolve these issues. After working through this troubleshooting guide, you can let us know about the prepend conflict you find by commenting on this GitHub issue. We appreciate your feedback so we may detect and automatically fall back to method-chaining in such scenarios. Modernized auto-instrumentation strategy Ruby introduced prepend as a way to insert method definitions earlier into the method resolution stack in Ruby 2.0 (released in 2013) with the intent that prepend eliminates the need to do method-chaining as a means of patching original gem libraries' implementations with trace/observability logic. Mixing prepend with method-chaining (a.k.a. method _ alias monkey patching) can lead to a known stack level too deep scenario as described in our blog post on the topic. New Relic has previously updated many auto-instrumented libraries over the years to use prepend strategy. The 7.0 release makes prepend the default strategy of choice to auto-instrument over method-chaining, except when known scenarios exist that would lead to triggering stack level too deep errors. A best effort to identify conflicting external gems that would lead to this scenario was made, but there are bound to be others out in the wild that we have not identified. In the past, we had only one way to auto-instrument for most gems and that was method-chaining. With 7.0 release, we can instrument most gems using either method-chaining or prepend and our configuration of all auto-instrumented gems has been updated to reflect this. With the modernization of our auto-instrumentation, we have also introduced new functionality in our dependency detection mechanism to identify conflicting external gems and automatically switch from prepend strategy to method-chaining. This means you no longer have to depend on the maintainers of other gems to make changes to their gem libraries in order to facilitate using the Ruby agent in conjunction with those gems. However, we are not aware of such conflicts until our users report them to us, so only a few of our auto-instrumented libraries can auto-detect these conflicts and auto-switch to method-chaining strategies. We need your help to hear about these scenarios and to add auto-detection to future Ruby agent releases. The SSL Certificate bundle is removed In the early days of Ruby (1.8, 1.9, etc.), integration with OpenSSL and making HTTPS connections was not well-handled. To ensure customers would be able to consistently make HTTPS connections to New Relic's Collector servers, a selection of SSL CA Certificates were bundled and distributed with the Ruby Agent. Over time, the Ruby ecosystem has stabilized and now supports system installed CA Certificates in a standard manner that largely obsoletes the need to bundle and distribute the certificate bundle. The vast majority of certificates bundled have expired or are nearing expiration, so we have decided to remove this dependency from the agent. If you're deploying a Ruby application and agent to a container or server that does not have CA certificates installed, you will need to ensure they're now installed for 7.0+ releases of the agent to make successful HTTPS connections to New Relic servers. For more information, see Remove cert bundle #478. Potential issue: If you're deploying to a host that does not have OpenSSL and system CA certificates installed, you may experience issues connecting to New Relic servers and experience loss of APM data. Solution: New Relic servers require HTTPS, which uses CA certificates to initiate successful connections. These may be installed, and depending on your host, in various ways. The following are helpful links for testing the readiness of your host and installing CA certificates: Troubleshooting SSL Certificate Errors Automated SSL Check Installing CA Certificates How to handle Certificates in Docker If needed, the agent can be configured to use any CA bundle by giving the path to the CA bundle file via configuration: :ca\\_bundle\\_path. Please see Custom SSL certificate for Ruby for more info. Deprecated API's and configuration attributes All deprecated API's have replacement API's that either expand scope and/or improve robustness of the deprecated API. Relevant pull requests are: Remove references to whitelist and blacklist in codebase #479 Remove deprecated ActiveRecord config options #480 Remove httpResponseCode attribute #481 Remove deprecated option from notice _ error API #597 Remove deprecated distributed trace API methods #598 Denied and allowed lists enabled Potential issue: Black/White listed attributes no longer work. Solution : Change black to denied and white to allowed in your configuration or environment variable settings. :autostart.blacklisted _ constants => :autostart.denylisted _ constants :autostart.blacklisted _ executables => :autostart.denylisted _ executables :autostart.blacklisted _ rake _ tasks => :autostart.denylisted _ rake _ tasks :strip _ exception _ messages.whitelist => :strip _ exception _ messages.allowed _ classes Active Record Potential issue: Disabling older Active Record versions no longer works. Solution: Change the following configuration settings: :disable _ active _ record _ 4 => :disable _ active _ record _ notifications :disable _ active _ record _ 5 => :disable _ active _ record _ notifications httpResponseCode Potential issue: The attribute httpResponseCode no longer appears in UI in the traces reported. Solution: httpResponseCode was replaced with http.statusCode. Notice Error (trace _ only) Potential issue: Passing the :trace\\_only option to NewRelic::Agent.notice\\_error no longer works. Solution: Replace :trace\\_only with the :expected attribute. Distributed Tracing APIs Potential issue: Errors are raised in application code while calling the api methods create_distributed_trace_payload and accept_distributed_trace_payload. Solution: Instead, please see insert _ distributed _ trace _ headers and accept _ distributed _ trace _ headers, respectively.",

Modernized auto-instrumentation strategy Ruby introduced prepend as a way to insert method definitions earlier into the method resolution stack in Ruby 2.0 (released in 2013) with the intent that prepend eliminates the need to do method-chaining as a means of patching original gem libraries' implementations with trace/observability logic. Mixing prepend with method-chaining (a.k.a. method _ alias monkey patching) can lead to a known stack level too deep scenario as described in our blog post on the topic. New Relic has previously updated many auto-instrumented libraries over the years to use prepend strategy. The 7.0 release makes prepend the default strategy of choice to auto-instrument over method-chaining, except when known scenarios exist that would lead to triggering stack level too deep errors. A best effort to identify conflicting external gems that would lead to this scenario was made, but there are bound to be others out in the wild that we have not identified. In the past, we had only one way to auto-instrument for most gems and that was method-chaining. With 7.0 release, we can instrument most gems using either method-chaining or prepend and our configuration of all auto-instrumented gems has been updated to reflect this. With the modernization of our auto-instrumentation, we have also introduced new functionality in our dependency detection mechanism to identify conflicting external gems and automatically switch from prepend strategy to method-chaining. This means you no longer have to depend on the maintainers of other gems to make changes to their gem libraries in order to facilitate using the Ruby agent in conjunction with those gems. However, we are not aware of such conflicts until our users report them to us, so only a few of our auto-instrumented libraries can auto-detect these conflicts and auto-switch to method-chaining strategies. We need your help to hear about these scenarios and to add auto-detection to future Ruby agent releases. The SSL Certificate bundle is removed In the early days of Ruby (1.8, 1.9, etc.), integration with OpenSSL and making HTTPS connections was not well-handled. To ensure customers would be able to consistently make HTTPS connections to New Relic's Collector servers, a selection of SSL CA Certificates were bundled and distributed with the Ruby Agent. Over time, the Ruby ecosystem has stabilized and now supports system installed CA Certificates in a standard manner that largely obsoletes the need to bundle and distribute the certificate bundle. The vast majority of certificates bundled have expired or are nearing expiration, so we have decided to remove this dependency from the agent. If you're deploying a Ruby application and agent to a container or server that does not have CA certificates installed, you will need to ensure they're now installed for 7.0+ releases of the agent to make successful HTTPS connections to New Relic servers. For more information, see Remove cert bundle #478. Potential issue: If you're deploying to a host that does not have OpenSSL and system CA certificates installed, you may experience issues connecting to New Relic servers and experience loss of APM data. Solution: New Relic servers require HTTPS, which uses CA certificates to initiate successful connections. These may be installed, and depending on your host, in various ways. The following are helpful links for testing the readiness of your host and installing CA certificates: Troubleshooting SSL Certificate Errors Automated SSL Check Installing CA Certificates How to handle Certificates in Docker If needed, the agent can be configured to use any CA bundle by giving the path to the CA bundle file via configuration: :ca\\_bundle\\_path.

      "body": "Summary This guide covers the major changes between the 6.x and 7.x series of the Ruby agent, issues that may be encountered while upgrading, and how to migrate successfully to version 7.x. Main changes include: Support for Ruby 2.0 and 2.1 is dropped SSL Certificate Bundle is removed Several APIs that were deprecated in various 6.x releases are now removed Auto-instrumentation defaults to prepend over method chaining Auto-instrumentation gets consistent configuration attributes See the milestone for 7.0 target release for more information. Support for Ruby 2.0 and 2.1 is dropped Ruby 2.0 and 2.1 reached EOL in February 2016, and New Relic is following suit with dropping support for these versions in the 7.0 release. There are no known changes that would inherently prevent these versions from continuing to work, but we are no longer guaranteeing the Ruby agent continues to function without issues going forward. If you need Ruby 2.0 or 2.1, then continue to use 6.15.0, which is the last release published to support these Ruby versions. Prepend instrumentation configuration Relevant pull request: Prepend instrumentation #565. Potential issue: The agent fails to initialize and start reporting data. A stack level too deep error message is reported in the logs. Solution: Our configuration and dependency detection mechanism can now be controlled through configuration. By default all auto-instrumented gems/libraries are activated with the prepend strategy. The default configuration setting for these libraries in the absence of any settings appearing in the configuration file is auto, which will pick the best strategy. In the case of a known conflict with prepend strategies, auto instructs the agent to fall back to method-chaining when such conflicts are detected. Below is a complete explanation of our changes to the configuration section for auto-instrumentation using sidekiq as an example. instrumentation: sidekiq: chain Copy Tip The use case for this is when an unknown gem is found to be conflicting. The user is able to revert to method-chaining to deal with the conflict until the agent can be updated to auto-detect and handle the conflict. To disable instrumentation altogether: instrumentation: sidekiq: disable Copy In some cases, we may know specific gems conflict with prepend. To facilitate, we offer by default an auto config option, which automatically degrades to chain in such cases. The default setting in most cases is thus: instrumentation: sidekiq: auto Copy It's possible to force using prepend strategy by specifying it in the config file: instrumentation: sidekiq: prepend Copy Tip The use case for this is when a newer version of the conflicting gem is released and it's known to no longer conflict with prepend strategy. If you encounter stack level too deep errors, see our troubleshooting guide on how to resolve these issues. After working through this troubleshooting guide, you can let us know about the prepend conflict you find by commenting on this GitHub issue. We appreciate your feedback so we may detect and automatically fall back to method-chaining in such scenarios. Modernized auto-instrumentation strategy Ruby introduced prepend as a way to insert method definitions earlier into the method resolution stack in Ruby 2.0 (released in 2013) with the intent that prepend eliminates the need to do method-chaining as a means of patching original gem libraries' implementations with trace/observability logic.

The SSL Certificate bundle is removed In the early days of Ruby (1.8, 1.9, etc.), integration with OpenSSL and making HTTPS connections was not well-handled. To ensure customers would be able to consistently make HTTPS connections to New Relic's Collector servers, a selection of SSL CA Certificates were bundled and distributed with the Ruby Agent. Over time, the Ruby ecosystem has stabilized and now supports system installed CA Certificates in a standard manner that largely obsoletes the need to bundle and distribute the certificate bundle. The vast majority of certificates bundled have expired or are nearing expiration, so we have decided to remove this dependency from the agent. If you're deploying a Ruby application and agent to a container or server that does not have CA certificates installed, you will need to ensure they're now installed for 7.0+ releases of the agent to make successful HTTPS connections to New Relic servers. For more information, see Remove cert bundle #478. Potential issue: If you're deploying to a host that does not have OpenSSL and system CA certificates installed, you may experience issues connecting to New Relic servers and experience loss of APM data.

      "body": "Summary This guide covers the major changes between the 7.x and 8.x series of the Ruby agent, issues that may be encountered while upgrading, and how to successfully migrate to version 8.x. The main changes include: Changes to the add_method_tracer API method Distributed Tracing is enabled by default Cross Application Tracing is deprecated Removed deprecated API methods and legacy instrumentation See the milestone for 8.0 for more information. Changes to the add_method_tracer API method Metric name parameter accepts Procs; strings no longer interpolated The second argument to add_method_tracer is the name of the metric used to record calls to the traced method. Previously, this string could include Ruby-style interpolation to allow for the metric name to include variables from the method receiver. For example: # old (<= 7.2) add_method_tracer :foo, ‘metric_#{args[0]}’ Copy As of 8.0, this string will no longer be interpolated. To preserve the behavior described above, pass a Proc instead: # new (8.0+) add_method_tracer :foo, -> (*args) { “metric_#{args[0]}” } # note the double-quotes Copy Note that the arity of the Proc passed to add_method_tracer should match the arity of the original traced method (or use a compatible splat). :code_header and :code_footer parameters accept only Procs Similar to metric names, the :code_header and :code_footer options to add_method_tracer were previously given as strings that would be interpolated in the context of the method receiver. In Ruby Agent 8.0, :code_header and :code_footer will only be invoked if given as Procs, as in the example above. Call add_method_tracer once per method Calling add_method_tracer multiple times on the same method will overwrite any previously defined method tracers for that method. There should be only one add_method_tracer line for each traced method. Previously, the agent allowed adding multiple metrics to the same method by invoking add_method_tracer once for each such metric. This can still be done, but the metric names need to be passed as the second argument of add_method_tracer as an array of strings or procs. # old add_method_tracer :foo, ‘metric1’ add_method_tracer :foo, ‘metric2’, push_scope: false add_method_tracer :foo, ‘metric3’, push_scope: false Copy # new add_method_tracer :foo, [‘metric1’, ‘metric2’, ‘metric3’] Copy Note that the first metric name will be created as a scoped metric unless push_scope: false is specified. The following named metrics will be unscoped. Each traced method may only have one scoped metric. Distributed Tracing is enabled by default The default configuration option for distributed_tracing.enabled is set to true for versions 8.0 or higher. To disable distributed tracing, set this configuration option to false in your newrelic.yml. distributed_tracing: enabled: false Copy Cross Application Tracing is deprecated Cross Application Tracing is deprecated in 8.0 and will be removed in a future release. Tip Distributed tracing and cross application tracing cannot be used simultaneously. If both configuration options are enabled, then only distributed tracing is used. To continue using cross application tracing, settings for both distributed tracing and cross application tracing need to be updated in your newrelic.yml. cross_application_tracing: enabled: true distributed_tracing: enabled: false Copy Removed deprecated API methods and legacy instrumentation The following methods had been previously deprecated and are now removed. Removed Replacement disable_transaction_tracing API method disable_all_tracing or ignore_transaction API methods External.start_segment API method Tracer#start_external_request_segment API method Transaction.wrap API method Tracer#in_transaction API method Mongo < 2.1 instrumentation Upgrade to Mongo 2.1 or higher Excon < 0.19.0 instrumentation Upgrade to Excon 0.19.0 or higher",

      "body": "Summary This guide covers the major changes between the 6.x and 7.x series of the Ruby agent, issues that may be encountered while upgrading, and how to migrate successfully to version 7.x. Main changes include: Support for Ruby 2.0 and 2.1 is dropped SSL Certificate Bundle is removed Several APIs that were deprecated in various 6.x releases are now removed Auto-instrumentation defaults to prepend over method chaining Auto-instrumentation gets consistent configuration attributes See the milestone for 7.0 target release for more information. Support for Ruby 2.0 and 2.1 is dropped Ruby 2.0 and 2.1 reached EOL in February 2016, and New Relic is following suit with dropping support for these versions in the 7.0 release. There are no known changes that would inherently prevent these versions from continuing to work, but we are no longer guaranteeing the Ruby agent continues to function without issues going forward. If you need Ruby 2.0 or 2.1, then continue to use 6.15.0, which is the last release published to support these Ruby versions. Prepend instrumentation configuration Relevant pull request: Prepend instrumentation #565. Potential issue: The agent fails to initialize and start reporting data. A stack level too deep error message is reported in the logs. Solution: Our configuration and dependency detection mechanism can now be controlled through configuration. By default all auto-instrumented gems/libraries are activated with the prepend strategy. The default configuration setting for these libraries in the absence of any settings appearing in the configuration file is auto, which will pick the best strategy. In the case of a known conflict with prepend strategies, auto instructs the agent to fall back to method-chaining when such conflicts are detected. Below is a complete explanation of our changes to the configuration section for auto-instrumentation using sidekiq as an example. instrumentation: sidekiq: chain Copy Tip The use case for this is when an unknown gem is found to be conflicting. The user is able to revert to method-chaining to deal with the conflict until the agent can be updated to auto-detect and handle the conflict. To disable instrumentation altogether: instrumentation: sidekiq: disable Copy In some cases, we may know specific gems conflict with prepend. To facilitate, we offer by default an auto config option, which automatically degrades to chain in such cases. The default setting in most cases is thus: instrumentation: sidekiq: auto Copy It's possible to force using prepend strategy by specifying it in the config file: instrumentation: sidekiq: prepend Copy Tip The use case for this is when a newer version of the conflicting gem is released and it's known to no longer conflict with prepend strategy. If you encounter stack level too deep errors, see our troubleshooting guide on how to resolve these issues. After working through this troubleshooting guide, you can let us know about the prepend conflict you find by commenting on this GitHub issue. We appreciate your feedback so we may detect and automatically fall back to method-chaining in such scenarios. Modernized auto-instrumentation strategy Ruby introduced prepend as a way to insert method definitions earlier into the method resolution stack in Ruby 2.0 (released in 2013) with the intent that prepend eliminates the need to do method-chaining as a means of patching original gem libraries' implementations with trace/observability logic. Mixing prepend with method-chaining (a.k.a. method _ alias monkey patching) can lead to a known stack level too deep scenario as described in our blog post on the topic. New Relic has previously updated many auto-instrumented libraries over the years to use prepend strategy. The 7.0 release makes prepend the default strategy of choice to auto-instrument over method-chaining, except when known scenarios exist that would lead to triggering stack level too deep errors. A best effort to identify conflicting external gems that would lead to this scenario was made, but there are bound to be others out in the wild that we have not identified. In the past, we had only one way to auto-instrument for most gems and that was method-chaining. With 7.0 release, we can instrument most gems using either method-chaining or prepend and our configuration of all auto-instrumented gems has been updated to reflect this. With the modernization of our auto-instrumentation, we have also introduced new functionality in our dependency detection mechanism to identify conflicting external gems and automatically switch from prepend strategy to method-chaining. This means you no longer have to depend on the maintainers of other gems to make changes to their gem libraries in order to facilitate using the Ruby agent in conjunction with those gems. However, we are not aware of such conflicts until our users report them to us, so only a few of our auto-instrumented libraries can auto-detect these conflicts and auto-switch to method-chaining strategies. We need your help to hear about these scenarios and to add auto-detection to future Ruby agent releases. The SSL Certificate bundle is removed In the early days of Ruby (1.8, 1.9, etc.), integration with OpenSSL and making HTTPS connections was not well-handled. To ensure customers would be able to consistently make HTTPS connections to New Relic's Collector servers, a selection of SSL CA Certificates were bundled and distributed with the Ruby Agent. Over time, the Ruby ecosystem has stabilized and now supports system installed CA Certificates in a standard manner that largely obsoletes the need to bundle and distribute the certificate bundle. The vast majority of certificates bundled have expired or are nearing expiration, so we have decided to remove this dependency from the agent. If you're deploying a Ruby application and agent to a container or server that does not have CA certificates installed, you will need to ensure they're now installed for 7.0+ releases of the agent to make successful HTTPS connections to New Relic servers. For more information, see Remove cert bundle #478. Potential issue: If you're deploying to a host that does not have OpenSSL and system CA certificates installed, you may experience issues connecting to New Relic servers and experience loss of APM data. Solution: New Relic servers require HTTPS, which uses CA certificates to initiate successful connections. These may be installed, and depending on your host, in various ways. The following are helpful links for testing the readiness of your host and installing CA certificates: Troubleshooting SSL Certificate Errors Automated SSL Check Installing CA Certificates How to handle Certificates in Docker If needed, the agent can be configured to use any CA bundle by giving the path to the CA bundle file via configuration: :ca\\_bundle\\_path. Please see Custom SSL certificate for Ruby for more info. Deprecated API's and configuration attributes All deprecated API's have replacement API's that either expand scope and/or improve robustness of the deprecated API. Relevant pull requests are: Remove references to whitelist and blacklist in codebase #479 Remove deprecated ActiveRecord config options #480 Remove httpResponseCode attribute #481 Remove deprecated option from notice _ error API #597 Remove deprecated distributed trace API methods #598 Denied and allowed lists enabled Potential issue: Black/White listed attributes no longer work. Solution : Change black to denied and white to allowed in your configuration or environment variable settings. :autostart.blacklisted _ constants => :autostart.denylisted _ constants :autostart.blacklisted _ executables => :autostart.denylisted _ executables :autostart.blacklisted _ rake _ tasks => :autostart.denylisted _ rake _ tasks :strip _ exception _ messages.whitelist => :strip _ exception _ messages.allowed _ classes Active Record Potential issue: Disabling older Active Record versions no longer works. Solution: Change the following configuration settings: :disable _ active _ record _ 4 => :disable _ active _ record _ notifications :disable _ active _ record _ 5 => :disable _ active _ record _ notifications httpResponseCode Potential issue: The attribute httpResponseCode no longer appears in UI in the traces reported. Solution: httpResponseCode was replaced with http.statusCode. Notice Error (trace _ only) Potential issue: Passing the :trace\\_only option to NewRelic::Agent.notice\\_error no longer works. Solution: Replace :trace\\_only with the :expected attribute. Distributed Tracing APIs Potential issue: Errors are raised in application code while calling the api methods create_distributed_trace_payload and accept_distributed_trace_payload. Solution: Instead, please see insert _ distributed _ trace _ headers and accept _ distributed _ trace _ headers, respectively.",

      "body": "Summary This guide covers the major changes between the 6.x and 7.x series of the Ruby agent, issues that may be encountered while upgrading, and how to migrate successfully to version 7.x. Main changes include: Support for Ruby 2.0 and 2.1 is dropped SSL Certificate Bundle is removed Several APIs that were deprecated in various 6.x releases are now removed Auto-instrumentation defaults to prepend over method chaining Auto-instrumentation gets consistent configuration attributes See the milestone for 7.0 target release for more information. Support for Ruby 2.0 and 2.1 is dropped Ruby 2.0 and 2.1 reached EOL in February 2016, and New Relic is following suit with dropping support for these versions in the 7.0 release. There are no known changes that would inherently prevent these versions from continuing to work, but we are no longer guaranteeing the Ruby agent continues to function without issues going forward. If you need Ruby 2.0 or 2.1, then continue to use 6.15.0, which is the last release published to support these Ruby versions. Prepend instrumentation configuration Relevant pull request: Prepend instrumentation #565. Potential issue: The agent fails to initialize and start reporting data. A stack level too deep error message is reported in the logs. Solution: Our configuration and dependency detection mechanism can now be controlled through configuration. By default all auto-instrumented gems/libraries are activated with the prepend strategy. The default configuration setting for these libraries in the absence of any settings appearing in the configuration file is auto, which will pick the best strategy. In the case of a known conflict with prepend strategies, auto instructs the agent to fall back to method-chaining when such conflicts are detected. Below is a complete explanation of our changes to the configuration section for auto-instrumentation using sidekiq as an example. instrumentation: sidekiq: chain Copy Tip The use case for this is when an unknown gem is found to be conflicting. The user is able to revert to method-chaining to deal with the conflict until the agent can be updated to auto-detect and handle the conflict. To disable instrumentation altogether: instrumentation: sidekiq: disable Copy In some cases, we may know specific gems conflict with prepend. To facilitate, we offer by default an auto config option, which automatically degrades to chain in such cases. The default setting in most cases is thus: instrumentation: sidekiq: auto Copy It's possible to force using prepend strategy by specifying it in the config file: instrumentation: sidekiq: prepend Copy Tip The use case for this is when a newer version of the conflicting gem is released and it's known to no longer conflict with prepend strategy. If you encounter stack level too deep errors, see our troubleshooting guide on how to resolve these issues. After working through this troubleshooting guide, you can let us know about the prepend conflict you find by commenting on this GitHub issue. We appreciate your feedback so we may detect and automatically fall back to method-chaining in such scenarios. Modernized auto-instrumentation strategy Ruby introduced prepend as a way to insert method definitions earlier into the method resolution stack in Ruby 2.0 (released in 2013) with the intent that prepend eliminates the need to do method-chaining as a means of patching original gem libraries' implementations with trace/observability logic. Mixing prepend with method-chaining (a.k.a. method _ alias monkey patching) can lead to a known stack level too deep scenario as described in our blog post on the topic. New Relic has previously updated many auto-instrumented libraries over the years to use prepend strategy. The 7.0 release makes prepend the default strategy of choice to auto-instrument over method-chaining, except when known scenarios exist that would lead to triggering stack level too deep errors. A best effort to identify conflicting external gems that would lead to this scenario was made, but there are bound to be others out in the wild that we have not identified. In the past, we had only one way to auto-instrument for most gems and that was method-chaining. With 7.0 release, we can instrument most gems using either method-chaining or prepend and our configuration of all auto-instrumented gems has been updated to reflect this. With the modernization of our auto-instrumentation, we have also introduced new functionality in our dependency detection mechanism to identify conflicting external gems and automatically switch from prepend strategy to method-chaining. This means you no longer have to depend on the maintainers of other gems to make changes to their gem libraries in order to facilitate using the Ruby agent in conjunction with those gems. However, we are not aware of such conflicts until our users report them to us, so only a few of our auto-instrumented libraries can auto-detect these conflicts and auto-switch to method-chaining strategies. We need your help to hear about these scenarios and to add auto-detection to future Ruby agent releases. The SSL Certificate bundle is removed In the early days of Ruby (1.8, 1.9, etc.), integration with OpenSSL and making HTTPS connections was not well-handled. To ensure customers would be able to consistently make HTTPS connections to New Relic's Collector servers, a selection of SSL CA Certificates were bundled and distributed with the Ruby Agent. Over time, the Ruby ecosystem has stabilized and now supports system installed CA Certificates in a standard manner that largely obsoletes the need to bundle and distribute the certificate bundle. The vast majority of certificates bundled have expired or are nearing expiration, so we have decided to remove this dependency from the agent. If you're deploying a Ruby application and agent to a container or server that does not have CA certificates installed, you will need to ensure they're now installed for 7.0+ releases of the agent to make successful HTTPS connections to New Relic servers. For more information, see Remove cert bundle #478. Potential issue: If you're deploying to a host that does not have OpenSSL and system CA certificates installed, you may experience issues connecting to New Relic servers and experience loss of APM data. Solution: New Relic servers require HTTPS, which uses CA certificates to initiate successful connections. These may be installed, and depending on your host, in various ways. The following are helpful links for testing the readiness of your host and installing CA certificates: Troubleshooting SSL Certificate Errors Automated SSL Check Installing CA Certificates How to handle Certificates in Docker If needed, the agent can be configured to use any CA bundle by giving the path to the CA bundle file via configuration: :ca\\_bundle\\_path. Please see Custom SSL certificate for Ruby for more info.

      "body": "Summary This guide covers the major changes between the 7.x and 8.x series of the Ruby agent, issues that may be encountered while upgrading, and how to successfully migrate to version 8.x. The main changes include: Changes to the add_method_tracer API method Distributed Tracing is enabled by default Cross Application Tracing is deprecated Removed deprecated API methods and legacy instrumentation See the milestone for 8.0 for more information. Changes to the add_method_tracer API method Metric name parameter accepts Procs; strings no longer interpolated The second argument to add_method_tracer is the name of the metric used to record calls to the traced method. Previously, this string could include Ruby-style interpolation to allow for the metric name to include variables from the method receiver. For example: # old (<= 7.2) add_method_tracer :foo, ‘metric_#{args[0]}’ Copy As of 8.0, this string will no longer be interpolated. To preserve the behavior described above, pass a Proc instead: # new (8.0+) add_method_tracer :foo, -> (*args) { “metric_#{args[0]}” } # note the double-quotes Copy Note that the arity of the Proc passed to add_method_tracer should match the arity of the original traced method (or use a compatible splat). :code_header and :code_footer parameters accept only Procs Similar to metric names, the :code_header and :code_footer options to add_method_tracer were previously given as strings that would be interpolated in the context of the method receiver. In Ruby Agent 8.0, :code_header and :code_footer will only be invoked if given as Procs, as in the example above. Call add_method_tracer once per method Calling add_method_tracer multiple times on the same method will overwrite any previously defined method tracers for that method. There should be only one add_method_tracer line for each traced method. Previously, the agent allowed adding multiple metrics to the same method by invoking add_method_tracer once for each such metric. This can still be done, but the metric names need to be passed as the second argument of add_method_tracer as an array of strings or procs. # old add_method_tracer :foo, ‘metric1’ add_method_tracer :foo, ‘metric2’, push_scope: false add_method_tracer :foo, ‘metric3’, push_scope: false Copy # new add_method_tracer :foo, [‘metric1’, ‘metric2’, ‘metric3’] Copy Note that the first metric name will be created as a scoped metric unless push_scope: false is specified. The following named metrics will be unscoped. Each traced method may only have one scoped metric. Distributed Tracing is enabled by default The default configuration option for distributed_tracing.enabled is set to true for versions 8.0 or higher. To disable distributed tracing, set this configuration option to false in your newrelic.yml. distributed_tracing: enabled: false Copy Cross Application Tracing is deprecated Cross Application Tracing is deprecated in 8.0 and will be removed in a future release. Tip Distributed tracing and cross application tracing cannot be used simultaneously. If both configuration options are enabled, then only distributed tracing is used. To continue using cross application tracing, settings for both distributed tracing and cross application tracing need to be updated in your newrelic.yml. cross_application_tracing: enabled: true distributed_tracing: enabled: false Copy Removed deprecated API methods and legacy instrumentation The following methods had been previously deprecated and are now removed.

Sinatra: If you're using Sinatra or another framework, you must manually call require 'newrelic_rpm'. Additionally, if you're using Infinite Tracing, manually call require 'newrelic/infinite_tracing'. Alternately, manually call Bundler.require, which also enables Infinite Tracing. If not using Rails or Sinatra In order to use automatic browser application monitoring and Cross application tracing in a Rack application that does not use Sinatra or Rails, you must manually include additional Rack middlewares provided by the agent. Place the New Relic gem as low in the list as possible, allowing the frameworks above it to be instrumented when the gem initializes. Install the configuration file After installing the agent, you will need to install the newrelic.yml configuration file, and name your app: If you haven't already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Or, sign in. From the account dropdown, select Account settings. On the Account settings page, look for the Download a clean configuration file section and click the newrelic.yml file. Copy the newrelic.yml file into the config sub-directory of your application. Change the default application name to a meaningful name. Alternatively, you can generate a newrelic.yml file manually with the following command: newrelic install --license_key=\"YOUR_KEY\" \"My application\" Copy You may also use the --force option with this command if you need to overwrite an existing newrelic.yml. Update the agent See Upgrade Ruby agent versions. Install agent outside production environments Typically you will install the Ruby agent in your production environment. If you want to try out the Ruby agent in a development or localhost environment, verify in the relevant environment: block of the newrelic.yml file that the monitor_mode config value has been set to true. For example, to deploy New Relic in your development environment and still be able to view your app's performance metrics: In the development: block, set the monitor_mode config value to true. Uninstall the Ruby agent gem To uninstall the Ruby agent using Bundler, remove gem 'newrelic_rpm' from your Gemfile. If you are not using Bundler, remove all references to newrelic_rpm from your environment.rb file. Install on older versions of Rails If you're installing the Ruby agent on Rails 2.x, and aren't using Bundler, follow these procedures.

      "body": "Summary This guide covers the major changes between the 6.x and 7.x series of the Ruby agent, issues that may be encountered while upgrading, and how to migrate successfully to version 7.x. Main changes include: Support for Ruby 2.0 and 2.1 is dropped SSL Certificate Bundle is removed Several APIs that were deprecated in various 6.x releases are now removed Auto-instrumentation defaults to prepend over method chaining Auto-instrumentation gets consistent configuration attributes See the milestone for 7.0 target release for more information. Support for Ruby 2.0 and 2.1 is dropped Ruby 2.0 and 2.1 reached EOL in February 2016, and New Relic is following suit with dropping support for these versions in the 7.0 release. There are no known changes that would inherently prevent these versions from continuing to work, but we are no longer guaranteeing the Ruby agent continues to function without issues going forward. If you need Ruby 2.0 or 2.1, then continue to use 6.15.0, which is the last release published to support these Ruby versions. Prepend instrumentation configuration Relevant pull request: Prepend instrumentation #565. Potential issue: The agent fails to initialize and start reporting data. A stack level too deep error message is reported in the logs. Solution: Our configuration and dependency detection mechanism can now be controlled through configuration. By default all auto-instrumented gems/libraries are activated with the prepend strategy. The default configuration setting for these libraries in the absence of any settings appearing in the configuration file is auto, which will pick the best strategy. In the case of a known conflict with prepend strategies, auto instructs the agent to fall back to method-chaining when such conflicts are detected. Below is a complete explanation of our changes to the configuration section for auto-instrumentation using sidekiq as an example. instrumentation: sidekiq: chain Copy Tip The use case for this is when an unknown gem is found to be conflicting. The user is able to revert to method-chaining to deal with the conflict until the agent can be updated to auto-detect and handle the conflict. To disable instrumentation altogether: instrumentation: sidekiq: disable Copy In some cases, we may know specific gems conflict with prepend. To facilitate, we offer by default an auto config option, which automatically degrades to chain in such cases. The default setting in most cases is thus: instrumentation: sidekiq: auto Copy It's possible to force using prepend strategy by specifying it in the config file: instrumentation: sidekiq: prepend Copy Tip The use case for this is when a newer version of the conflicting gem is released and it's known to no longer conflict with prepend strategy. If you encounter stack level too deep errors, see our troubleshooting guide on how to resolve these issues. After working through this troubleshooting guide, you can let us know about the prepend conflict you find by commenting on this GitHub issue. We appreciate your feedback so we may detect and automatically fall back to method-chaining in such scenarios. Modernized auto-instrumentation strategy Ruby introduced prepend as a way to insert method definitions earlier into the method resolution stack in Ruby 2.0 (released in 2013) with the intent that prepend eliminates the need to do method-chaining as a means of patching original gem libraries' implementations with trace/observability logic. Mixing prepend with method-chaining (a.k.a. method _ alias monkey patching) can lead to a known stack level too deep scenario as described in our blog post on the topic. New Relic has previously updated many auto-instrumented libraries over the years to use prepend strategy. The 7.0 release makes prepend the default strategy of choice to auto-instrument over method-chaining, except when known scenarios exist that would lead to triggering stack level too deep errors. A best effort to identify conflicting external gems that would lead to this scenario was made, but there are bound to be others out in the wild that we have not identified. In the past, we had only one way to auto-instrument for most gems and that was method-chaining. With 7.0 release, we can instrument most gems using either method-chaining or prepend and our configuration of all auto-instrumented gems has been updated to reflect this. With the modernization of our auto-instrumentation, we have also introduced new functionality in our dependency detection mechanism to identify conflicting external gems and automatically switch from prepend strategy to method-chaining. This means you no longer have to depend on the maintainers of other gems to make changes to their gem libraries in order to facilitate using the Ruby agent in conjunction with those gems. However, we are not aware of such conflicts until our users report them to us, so only a few of our auto-instrumented libraries can auto-detect these conflicts and auto-switch to method-chaining strategies. We need your help to hear about these scenarios and to add auto-detection to future Ruby agent releases. The SSL Certificate bundle is removed In the early days of Ruby (1.8, 1.9, etc.), integration with OpenSSL and making HTTPS connections was not well-handled. To ensure customers would be able to consistently make HTTPS connections to New Relic's Collector servers, a selection of SSL CA Certificates were bundled and distributed with the Ruby Agent. Over time, the Ruby ecosystem has stabilized and now supports system installed CA Certificates in a standard manner that largely obsoletes the need to bundle and distribute the certificate bundle. The vast majority of certificates bundled have expired or are nearing expiration, so we have decided to remove this dependency from the agent. If you're deploying a Ruby application and agent to a container or server that does not have CA certificates installed, you will need to ensure they're now installed for 7.0+ releases of the agent to make successful HTTPS connections to New Relic servers. For more information, see Remove cert bundle #478. Potential issue: If you're deploying to a host that does not have OpenSSL and system CA certificates installed, you may experience issues connecting to New Relic servers and experience loss of APM data. Solution: New Relic servers require HTTPS, which uses CA certificates to initiate successful connections. These may be installed, and depending on your host, in various ways. The following are helpful links for testing the readiness of your host and installing CA certificates: Troubleshooting SSL Certificate Errors Automated SSL Check Installing CA Certificates How to handle Certificates in Docker If needed, the agent can be configured to use any CA bundle by giving the path to the CA bundle file via configuration: :ca\\_bundle\\_path. Please see Custom SSL certificate for Ruby for more info. Deprecated API's and configuration attributes All deprecated API's have replacement API's that either expand scope and/or improve robustness of the deprecated API.

Add Ruby data Install the gem Important If you are using the agent in a Docker container, install the agent within each container. The Ruby agent's gem is available from rubygems.org as newrelic_rpm. For applications using Bundler, add this gem to the Gemfile: gem 'newrelic_rpm' Copy To use Infinite Tracing, the Infinite Tracing gem is also available from rubygems.org as newrelic-infinite_tracing. For applications using Bundler, additionally include the Infinite Tracing gem in the Gemfile: gem 'newrelic-infinite_tracing' Copy The next step varies depending on if you are using Rails or Sinatra: Ruby installation Comments If using Rails or Sinatra Rails: If you're using Rails 3 or higher, or Rails 2.3 in the recommended configuration, Rails will automatically call Bundler.require and cause newrelic_rpm to be required during startup of your application. Sinatra: If you're using Sinatra or another framework, you must manually call require 'newrelic_rpm'. Additionally, if you're using Infinite Tracing, manually call require 'newrelic/infinite_tracing'. Alternately, manually call Bundler.require, which also enables Infinite Tracing. If not using Rails or Sinatra In order to use automatic browser application monitoring and Cross application tracing in a Rack application that does not use Sinatra or Rails, you must manually include additional Rack middlewares provided by the agent. Place the New Relic gem as low in the list as possible, allowing the frameworks above it to be instrumented when the gem initializes. Install the configuration file After installing the agent, you will need to install the newrelic.yml configuration file, and name your app: If you haven't already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Or, sign in. From the account dropdown, select Account settings. On the Account settings page, look for the Download a clean configuration file section and click the newrelic.yml file. Copy the newrelic.yml file into the config sub-directory of your application. Change the default application name to a meaningful name. Alternatively, you can generate a newrelic.yml file manually with the following command: newrelic install --license_key=\"YOUR_KEY\" \"My application\" Copy You may also use the --force option with this command if you need to overwrite an existing newrelic.yml. Update the agent See Upgrade Ruby agent versions. Install agent outside production environments Typically you will install the Ruby agent in your production environment. If you want to try out the Ruby agent in a development or localhost environment, verify in the relevant environment: block of the newrelic.yml file that the monitor_mode config value has been set to true. For example, to deploy New Relic in your development environment and still be able to view your app's performance metrics: In the development: block, set the monitor_mode config value to true. Uninstall the Ruby agent gem To uninstall the Ruby agent using Bundler, remove gem 'newrelic_rpm' from your Gemfile. If you are not using Bundler, remove all references to newrelic_rpm from your environment.rb file. Install on older versions of Rails If you're installing the Ruby agent on Rails 2.x, and aren't using Bundler, follow these procedures. Ruby installation Comments Rails 2.1 - 2.3 without Bundler Install the gem using gem install newrelic_rpm. Edit environment.rb, and add to the initializer block: config.gem \"newrelic_rpm\" Copy If enabling Infinite Tracing, add the following to the next line in the environment.rb file: config.gem \"newrelic-infinite_tracing\" Copy Rails earlier than 2.1 New Relic does not officially support Rails versions prior to 2.1. However, if you want to use New Relic for Rails versions 2.0. * , edit environment.rb and add this statement after the initializer: block: require \"newrelic_rpm\" Copy Infinite Tracing If enabling Infinite Tracing, add the following to the next line in the environment.rb file: require \"newrelic/infinite_tracing\" Copy",

      "body": "Heroku is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) solution for hosting web applications in various agent languages, including Ruby. With New Relic, you can extend Heroku using APM and browser monitoring metrics. This page describes special considerations for using Heroku as a hosting service with New Relic's Ruby agent. Install the New Relic agent add-on After deploying your Ruby app on Heroku, install the New Relic agent: Via the Heroku website To install the New Relic add-on through the Heroku website, you must be logged in to Heroku: From Heroku's Add-on page for New Relic, select a subscription plan. From Select an app, select your New Relic app. Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='Your Application Name' Copy Add the New Relic gem to your Gemfile. The New Relic Ruby agent's gem is available from rubygems.org as newrelic_rpm. If your app uses Bundler, add this gem to the Gemfile: gem 'newrelic_rpm' Copy Restart your dyno. Generate some traffic to your app. Via Heroku toolbelt To install the New Relic add-on with the Heroku toolbelt: Run the following toolbelt command, where $planlevel is the appropriate subscription plan: heroku addons:create newrelic:$planlevel Copy Give your application a descriptive name with this toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='Your Application Name' Copy Add the New Relic gem to your Gemfile. The New Relic Ruby agent's gem is available from rubygems.org as newrelic_rpm. If your app uses Bundler, add this gem to the Gemfile: gem 'newrelic_rpm' Copy Restart your dyno. Generate some traffic to your app. Non-Rails applications If you are using New Relic's Ruby agent with a non-Rails application, Heroku users need to install the plugin in your repository manually. For example, in a Sinatra app, add the newrelic_rpm gem to your Gemfile, and then add the following code to your app: configure :production do require 'newrelic_rpm' end Copy Installing the add-on automatically creates a private New Relic account and configures access for Heroku servers. New Relic will begin monitoring application performance, end user experience, and app server performance collected after the add-on is installed. Within a few minutes, data should start appearing in your APM summary page. Troubleshooting your installation Within a few minutes of installing and configuring New Relic, data should start appearing in your app's APM summary page. If no data appears, follow the Ruby agent troubleshooting procedures. Upgrade from an existing New Relic installation If New Relic is already installed, reinstall the add-on using the Heroku toolbelt command. heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='Your Application Name' Copy Configure the Ruby agent on Heroku You can configure New Relic in your newrelic.yml file, or you can use environment variables to take precedence over the values in your config file. Use heroku config:set to modify the agent's settings for your Heroku appication. For example, to set the analytics_events.max_samples_stored setting to 500: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_ANALYTICS_EVENTS_MAX_SAMPLES_STORED=500 Copy Hostnames on Heroku Knowing which data came from which host allows you to filter the metrics displayed in the UI to a specific host. On Heroku, hostnames within dynos are dynamically generated and not generally meaningful to you as an application developer. Starting in version 3.9.5, the Ruby agent reports the Heroku dyno name as the hostname (for example, web.1). This allows you to view your data scoped to a particular dyno name. You can disable this behavior by setting the heroku.use_dyno_names setting to false. The agent will then use a single aggregated placeholder name called Dynamic Hostname. Dyno hostname aggregation Some dynos have names that are dynamically generated, and these may take on many unique values over time. Examples include scheduler dynos created by the Scheduler add-on, and run dynos created by invoking heroku run on the command line. In order to keep the number of unique hostnames reasonable, the Ruby agent will automatically aggregate data from scheduler and run dynos into hostnames called scheduler.* and run.*. If you have other dyno types that are dynamically created, use the heroku.dyno_name_prefixes_to_shorten configuration setting to apply the same aggregation to these other dyno types. Logging for Heroku On Heroku, the Ruby agent logs to standard output, mixing agent logs with your normal application logs. Log entries generated by the Ruby agent include a [NewRelic] tag as a prefix. To retrieve logs on Heroku: Verify that your NEW_RELIC_LOG environment variable is set to stdout with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config Copy To reset the environment variable if necessary, run: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_LOG=\"stdout\" Copy Open your newrelic.yml file in an editor. Change the log_level to debug and save the file. Be sure you do not modify the indentation. Restart your web app. Generate some traffic to your app and run it for about five minutes. Run the following Heroku toolbelt command to view logs only from the New Relic agent: heroku logs -n 1500 | grep -i relic Copy If sending your log file to New Relic Support, attach the log file to your support ticket, along with newrelic.yml, your Gemfile, and Gemfile.lock. Edit newrelic.yml again, and change the log_level to the previous setting. Save the file.

      "body": "Heroku is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) solution for hosting web applications in various agent languages, including Ruby. With New Relic, you can extend Heroku using APM and browser monitoring metrics. This page describes special considerations for using Heroku as a hosting service with New Relic's Ruby agent. Install the New Relic agent add-on After deploying your Ruby app on Heroku, install the New Relic agent: Via the Heroku website To install the New Relic add-on through the Heroku website, you must be logged in to Heroku: From Heroku's Add-on page for New Relic, select a subscription plan. From Select an app, select your New Relic app. Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='Your Application Name' Copy Add the New Relic gem to your Gemfile. The New Relic Ruby agent's gem is available from rubygems.org as newrelic_rpm. If your app uses Bundler, add this gem to the Gemfile: gem 'newrelic_rpm' Copy Restart your dyno. Generate some traffic to your app. Via Heroku toolbelt To install the New Relic add-on with the Heroku toolbelt: Run the following toolbelt command, where $planlevel is the appropriate subscription plan: heroku addons:create newrelic:$planlevel Copy Give your application a descriptive name with this toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='Your Application Name' Copy Add the New Relic gem to your Gemfile. The New Relic Ruby agent's gem is available from rubygems.org as newrelic_rpm. If your app uses Bundler, add this gem to the Gemfile: gem 'newrelic_rpm' Copy Restart your dyno. Generate some traffic to your app. Non-Rails applications If you are using New Relic's Ruby agent with a non-Rails application, Heroku users need to install the plugin in your repository manually. For example, in a Sinatra app, add the newrelic_rpm gem to your Gemfile, and then add the following code to your app: configure :production do require 'newrelic_rpm' end Copy Installing the add-on automatically creates a private New Relic account and configures access for Heroku servers. New Relic will begin monitoring application performance, end user experience, and app server performance collected after the add-on is installed. Within a few minutes, data should start appearing in your APM summary page. Troubleshooting your installation Within a few minutes of installing and configuring New Relic, data should start appearing in your app's APM summary page. If no data appears, follow the Ruby agent troubleshooting procedures. Upgrade from an existing New Relic installation If New Relic is already installed, reinstall the add-on using the Heroku toolbelt command. heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='Your Application Name' Copy Configure the Ruby agent on Heroku You can configure New Relic in your newrelic.yml file, or you can use environment variables to take precedence over the values in your config file. Use heroku config:set to modify the agent's settings for your Heroku appication. For example, to set the analytics_events.max_samples_stored setting to 500: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_ANALYTICS_EVENTS_MAX_SAMPLES_STORED=500 Copy Hostnames on Heroku Knowing which data came from which host allows you to filter the metrics displayed in the UI to a specific host. On Heroku, hostnames within dynos are dynamically generated and not generally meaningful to you as an application developer. Starting in version 3.9.5, the Ruby agent reports the Heroku dyno name as the hostname (for example, web.1). This allows you to view your data scoped to a particular dyno name. You can disable this behavior by setting the heroku.use_dyno_names setting to false. The agent will then use a single aggregated placeholder name called Dynamic Hostname. Dyno hostname aggregation Some dynos have names that are dynamically generated, and these may take on many unique values over time. Examples include scheduler dynos created by the Scheduler add-on, and run dynos created by invoking heroku run on the command line. In order to keep the number of unique hostnames reasonable, the Ruby agent will automatically aggregate data from scheduler and run dynos into hostnames called scheduler.* and run.*. If you have other dyno types that are dynamically created, use the heroku.dyno_name_prefixes_to_shorten configuration setting to apply the same aggregation to these other dyno types. Logging for Heroku On Heroku, the Ruby agent logs to standard output, mixing agent logs with your normal application logs. Log entries generated by the Ruby agent include a [NewRelic] tag as a prefix. To retrieve logs on Heroku: Verify that your NEW_RELIC_LOG environment variable is set to stdout with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config Copy To reset the environment variable if necessary, run: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_LOG=\"stdout\" Copy Open your newrelic.yml file in an editor. Change the log_level to debug and save the file. Be sure you do not modify the indentation. Restart your web app. Generate some traffic to your app and run it for about five minutes. Run the following Heroku toolbelt command to view logs only from the New Relic agent: heroku logs -n 1500 | grep -i relic Copy If sending your log file to New Relic Support, attach the log file to your support ticket, along with newrelic.yml, your Gemfile, and Gemfile.lock. Edit newrelic.yml again, and change the log_level to the previous setting. Save the file.

      "body": "New Relic has APM language agents for C, Go, Java, Node.js, .NET, PHP, Python, and Ruby. Each of these offers several ways to leverage the power of distributed tracing: Quick start for standard distributed tracing (recommended): A fast way to get started Infinite Tracing: An advanced alternative to standard distributed tracing Older APM agents: Tracing options if you have older APM agents Manual instrumentation: Tips if automatic instrumentation doesn't work Tip If you want to get more background before getting started, check out these topics: How span sampling works explains distributed tracing options. Impacts to APM tells you what to expect if you are a current APM user but haven't set up distributed tracing. Quick start for standard distributed tracing (recommended): This is the best approach to set up standard distributed tracing if you haven't installed any New Relic APM agents for your services yet, or if you want to instrument additional services. Tip You'll need a New Relic account to set up distributed tracing. If you don't already have one, you can quickly create a free account. Step 1. Identify services Figure out which services you want to instrument so they each send trace data to New Relic. Step 2. Instrument each service with an APM agent We have installation assistants for a variety of languages to help you instrument each service. You should run the installation assistant for each service you want to instrument to ensure that each installation has a unique application name. To start the assistant, click the link for your language: New Relic APM: C New Relic APM: Golang New Relic APM: Java New Relic APM: .NET New Relic APM: Node.js New Relic APM: PHP New Relic APM: Python New Relic APM: Ruby Tip This quick-start approach with the installation assistant automatically enables distributed tracing for each service you run it on, but if you already have a New Relic APM agent that you want to participate in distributed tracing, you'll need to manually enable distributed tracing. See Options for older APM agents. Step 3. View traces After you instrument each of your services with APM agents, generate some traffic in your application so we can capture some traces. Here are two ways to view your traces in the UI: View traces that include a specific service Here's one way you can see traces for a particular service: Go to one.newrelic.com. Click APM in the top menu bar. Click your service. In the left navigation's Monitor section, click Distributed tracing. If you don't see the traces you want, you can filter by the trace.id. View traces across accounts This option allows you to search all traces across all New Relic accounts in your organization that you have access to. Go to one.newrelic.com. Click Browse data in the top menu bar, and then click Traces. Select your entity in the left pane. If you don't see the traces you want, you can filter by the trace.id. For more help finding your traces in the UI: Understand and use the distributed tracing UI Query distributed trace data Set up Infinite Tracing (advanced option) Standard distributed tracing for APM agents (above) captures up to 10% of your traces, but if you want us to analyze all your data and find the most relevant traces, you can set up Infinite Tracing. This alternative to standard distributed tracing is available for all APM language agents except C SDK. Tip To learn more about this feature, see Infinite Tracing. Before beginning, first ensure you meet the requirements. Step 1. Complete the instrumentation for standard distributed tracing in the quick start above The Infinite Tracing setup builds on the instrumentation step from the Quick start for standard distributed tracing. Step 2. Set up the trace observer The trace observer is a New Relic AWS-based service that collects and analyzes all your traces. Follow the instructions in Set up trace observer. When you're done, return here with your trace observer information and continue with the next step to configure the agent. Step 3: Configure the agent for Infinite Tracing Infinite Tracing configuration settings include the standard distributed tracing plus information about the trace observer.

Manual instrumentation (If automatic instrumentation doesn't work) Recommendation: Before performing any custom instrumentation, read: How distributed tracing works Troubleshoot missing data If a service is not passing the trace header to other services, you can use the distributed tracing payload APIs to instrument the calling service and the called service. The calling service uses an API call to generate a payload, which is accepted by the called service. Instrument the calling service To instrument the calling service: Ensure the version of the APM agent that monitors the calling service supports distributed tracing. Invoke the agent API call for generating a distributed trace payload: C SDK | Go | Java | .NET | Node.js | PHP | Python | Ruby. Important To maintain proper ordering of spans in a trace, ensure you generate the payload in the context of the span that sends it. Add that payload to the call made to the destination service (for example, in a header). (Optional) Identify the call as an external call: C SDK Go Java .NET: n/a Node.js PHP: n/a Python Ruby Instrument the called service To instrument the called service: Ensure the version of the APM agent that monitors the called service supports distributed tracing. If the New Relic agent on the called service does not identify a New Relic transaction, use the agent API to declare a transaction: C SDK One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload() is called, a NULL pointer is returned. To solve this problem, follow the procedures to create a transaction with the C SDK. Go One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when Transaction.InsertDistributedTraceHeaders(h http.Header) is called, no headers are inserted. To create a transaction, see Instrument Go transactions. Java One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when Transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(Headers) is called, no headers are inserted (this API requires agent 6.4.0+). To create a transaction, see Java agent transaction-related APIs. .NET One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: CreateDistributedTracePayload() returns an empty payload. To create a transaction, see Introduction to .NET custom instrumentation. Node.js One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: the Node.js agent logs will report an error similar to this: No transaction found when calling Transaction.acceptDistributedTracePayload. Copy Use startWebTransaction to create a web transaction or startBackgroundTransaction to capture a non-web transaction. PHP One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers() returns false. To create a transaction, see newrelic_start_transaction. Python To tell that a transaction is not in progress: when transaction = current_transaction() is run, transaction is None. Or, if result = accept_distributed_trace_payload(payload) is run, then the result is False. Use background_task to report a non-web transaction. For more on Python instrumentation, see Monitor transactions and segments. Ruby If you are using a Rack-based web framework and have enabled New Relic's Rack instrumentation, the Ruby agent will handle starting a transaction for you. For other use cases, see the add_transaction_tracer API method. Extract the payload from the call that you received (for example, in a header). Invoke the call for accepting the payload: C SDK | Go | Java | .NET | PHP | Node.js | Python | Ruby.",

For applications using Bundler, add this gem to the Gemfile: gem 'newrelic_rpm' Copy To use Infinite Tracing, the Infinite Tracing gem is also available from rubygems.org as newrelic-infinite_tracing. For applications using Bundler, additionally include the Infinite Tracing gem in the Gemfile: gem 'newrelic-infinite_tracing' Copy The next step varies depending on if you are using Rails or Sinatra: Ruby installation Comments If using Rails or Sinatra Rails: If you're using Rails 3 or higher, or Rails 2.3 in the recommended configuration, Rails will automatically call Bundler.require and cause newrelic_rpm to be required during startup of your application. Sinatra: If you're using Sinatra or another framework, you must manually call require 'newrelic_rpm'. Additionally, if you're using Infinite Tracing, manually call require 'newrelic/infinite_tracing'. Alternately, manually call Bundler.require, which also enables Infinite Tracing. If not using Rails or Sinatra In order to use automatic browser application monitoring and Cross application tracing in a Rack application that does not use Sinatra or Rails, you must manually include additional Rack middlewares provided by the agent. Place the New Relic gem as low in the list as possible, allowing the frameworks above it to be instrumented when the gem initializes. Install the configuration file After installing the agent, you will need to install the newrelic.yml configuration file, and name your app: If you haven't already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Or, sign in. From the account dropdown, select Account settings. On the Account settings page, look for the Download a clean configuration file section and click the newrelic.yml file. Copy the newrelic.yml file into the config sub-directory of your application. Change the default application name to a meaningful name. Alternatively, you can generate a newrelic.yml file manually with the following command: newrelic install --license_key=\"YOUR_KEY\" \"My application\" Copy You may also use the --force option with this command if you need to overwrite an existing newrelic.yml. Update the agent See Upgrade Ruby agent versions. Install agent outside production environments Typically you will install the Ruby agent in your production environment. If you want to try out the Ruby agent in a development or localhost environment, verify in the relevant environment: block of the newrelic.yml file that the monitor_mode config value has been set to true. For example, to deploy New Relic in your development environment and still be able to view your app's performance metrics: In the development: block, set the monitor_mode config value to true. Uninstall the Ruby agent gem To uninstall the Ruby agent using Bundler, remove gem 'newrelic_rpm' from your Gemfile. If you are not using Bundler, remove all references to newrelic_rpm from your environment.rb file. Install on older versions of Rails If you're installing the Ruby agent on Rails 2.x, and aren't using Bundler, follow these procedures. Ruby installation Comments Rails 2.1 - 2.3 without Bundler Install the gem using gem install newrelic_rpm.

      "body": "New Relic has APM language agents for C, Go, Java, Node.js, .NET, PHP, Python, and Ruby. Each of these offers several ways to leverage the power of distributed tracing: Quick start for standard distributed tracing (recommended): A fast way to get started Infinite Tracing: An advanced alternative to standard distributed tracing Older APM agents: Tracing options if you have older APM agents Manual instrumentation: Tips if automatic instrumentation doesn't work Tip If you want to get more background before getting started, check out these topics: How span sampling works explains distributed tracing options. Impacts to APM tells you what to expect if you are a current APM user but haven't set up distributed tracing. Quick start for standard distributed tracing (recommended): This is the best approach to set up standard distributed tracing if you haven't installed any New Relic APM agents for your services yet, or if you want to instrument additional services. Tip You'll need a New Relic account to set up distributed tracing. If you don't already have one, you can quickly create a free account. Step 1. Identify services Figure out which services you want to instrument so they each send trace data to New Relic. Step 2. Instrument each service with an APM agent We have installation assistants for a variety of languages to help you instrument each service. You should run the installation assistant for each service you want to instrument to ensure that each installation has a unique application name. To start the assistant, click the link for your language: New Relic APM: C New Relic APM: Golang New Relic APM: Java New Relic APM: .NET New Relic APM: Node.js New Relic APM: PHP New Relic APM: Python New Relic APM: Ruby Tip This quick-start approach with the installation assistant automatically enables distributed tracing for each service you run it on, but if you already have a New Relic APM agent that you want to participate in distributed tracing, you'll need to manually enable distributed tracing. See Options for older APM agents. Step 3. View traces After you instrument each of your services with APM agents, generate some traffic in your application so we can capture some traces. Here are two ways to view your traces in the UI: View traces that include a specific service Here's one way you can see traces for a particular service: Go to one.newrelic.com. Click APM in the top menu bar. Click your service. In the left navigation's Monitor section, click Distributed tracing. If you don't see the traces you want, you can filter by the trace.id. View traces across accounts This option allows you to search all traces across all New Relic accounts in your organization that you have access to. Go to one.newrelic.com. Click Browse data in the top menu bar, and then click Traces. Select your entity in the left pane. If you don't see the traces you want, you can filter by the trace.id. For more help finding your traces in the UI: Understand and use the distributed tracing UI Query distributed trace data Set up Infinite Tracing (advanced option) Standard distributed tracing for APM agents (above) captures up to 10% of your traces, but if you want us to analyze all your data and find the most relevant traces, you can set up Infinite Tracing. This alternative to standard distributed tracing is available for all APM language agents except C SDK. Tip To learn more about this feature, see Infinite Tracing. Before beginning, first ensure you meet the requirements. Step 1. Complete the instrumentation for standard distributed tracing in the quick start above The Infinite Tracing setup builds on the instrumentation step from the Quick start for standard distributed tracing. Step 2. Set up the trace observer The trace observer is a New Relic AWS-based service that collects and analyzes all your traces. Follow the instructions in Set up trace observer. When you're done, return here with your trace observer information and continue with the next step to configure the agent. Step 3: Configure the agent for Infinite Tracing Infinite Tracing configuration settings include the standard distributed tracing plus information about the trace observer. Find the settings for your language agent below: C SDK Infinite tracing is not available for C SDK. Go Here's an overview of the settings.

(Optional) Customize Infinite Tracing After you add the agent configuration settings, you should start seeing data in the New Relic UI. After you spend some time analyzing your data, you may want to adjust some of the features of Infinite Tracing: Configure trace observer monitoring Configure span attribute trace filter Configure random trace filter Options for older APM agents If you have older APM agents, use this section to figure out if the distributed tracing features you want are supported. Following the compatibility information is a section showing the basic configuration settings to turn on standard distributed tracing. If your older agent supports Infinite Tracing and you want to set it up, see the steps above.

Manual instrumentation (If automatic instrumentation doesn't work) Recommendation: Before performing any custom instrumentation, read: How distributed tracing works Troubleshoot missing data If a service is not passing the trace header to other services, you can use the distributed tracing payload APIs to instrument the calling service and the called service. The calling service uses an API call to generate a payload, which is accepted by the called service. Instrument the calling service To instrument the calling service: Ensure the version of the APM agent that monitors the calling service supports distributed tracing. Invoke the agent API call for generating a distributed trace payload: C SDK | Go | Java | .NET | Node.js | PHP | Python | Ruby. Important To maintain proper ordering of spans in a trace, ensure you generate the payload in the context of the span that sends it. Add that payload to the call made to the destination service (for example, in a header). (Optional) Identify the call as an external call: C SDK Go Java .NET: n/a Node.js PHP: n/a Python Ruby Instrument the called service To instrument the called service: Ensure the version of the APM agent that monitors the called service supports distributed tracing. If the New Relic agent on the called service does not identify a New Relic transaction, use the agent API to declare a transaction: C SDK One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload() is called, a NULL pointer is returned. To solve this problem, follow the procedures to create a transaction with the C SDK. Go One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when Transaction.InsertDistributedTraceHeaders(h http.Header) is called, no headers are inserted. To create a transaction, see Instrument Go transactions. Java One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when Transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(Headers) is called, no headers are inserted (this API requires agent 6.4.0+). To create a transaction, see Java agent transaction-related APIs. .NET One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: CreateDistributedTracePayload() returns an empty payload. To create a transaction, see Introduction to .NET custom instrumentation. Node.js One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: the Node.js agent logs will report an error similar to this: No transaction found when calling Transaction.acceptDistributedTracePayload. Copy Use startWebTransaction to create a web transaction or startBackgroundTransaction to capture a non-web transaction. PHP One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers() returns false. To create a transaction, see newrelic_start_transaction. Python To tell that a transaction is not in progress: when transaction = current_transaction() is run, transaction is None. Or, if result = accept_distributed_trace_payload(payload) is run, then the result is False. Use background_task to report a non-web transaction. For more on Python instrumentation, see Monitor transactions and segments. Ruby If you are using a Rack-based web framework and have enabled New Relic's Rack instrumentation, the Ruby agent will handle starting a transaction for you. For other use cases, see the add_transaction_tracer API method. Extract the payload from the call that you received (for example, in a header). Invoke the call for accepting the payload: C SDK | Go | Java | .NET | PHP | Node.js | Python | Ruby.",

Sinatra: If you're using Sinatra or another framework, you must manually call require 'newrelic_rpm'. Additionally, if you're using Infinite Tracing, manually call require 'newrelic/infinite_tracing'. Alternately, manually call Bundler.require, which also enables Infinite Tracing. If not using Rails or Sinatra In order to use automatic browser application monitoring and Cross application tracing in a Rack application that does not use Sinatra or Rails, you must manually include additional Rack middlewares provided by the agent. Place the New Relic gem as low in the list as possible, allowing the frameworks above it to be instrumented when the gem initializes. Install the configuration file After installing the agent, you will need to install the newrelic.yml configuration file, and name your app: If you haven't already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Or, sign in. From the account dropdown, select Account settings. On the Account settings page, look for the Download a clean configuration file section and click the newrelic.yml file. Copy the newrelic.yml file into the config sub-directory of your application. Change the default application name to a meaningful name. Alternatively, you can generate a newrelic.yml file manually with the following command: newrelic install --license_key=\"YOUR_KEY\" \"My application\" Copy You may also use the --force option with this command if you need to overwrite an existing newrelic.yml. Update the agent See Upgrade Ruby agent versions. Install agent outside production environments Typically you will install the Ruby agent in your production environment. If you want to try out the Ruby agent in a development or localhost environment, verify in the relevant environment: block of the newrelic.yml file that the monitor_mode config value has been set to true. For example, to deploy New Relic in your development environment and still be able to view your app's performance metrics: In the development: block, set the monitor_mode config value to true. Uninstall the Ruby agent gem To uninstall the Ruby agent using Bundler, remove gem 'newrelic_rpm' from your Gemfile.

Generate some traffic to your app. Via Heroku toolbelt To install the New Relic add-on with the Heroku toolbelt: Run the following toolbelt command, where $planlevel is the appropriate subscription plan: heroku addons:create newrelic:$planlevel Copy Give your application a descriptive name with this toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='Your Application Name' Copy Add the New Relic gem to your Gemfile. The New Relic Ruby agent's gem is available from rubygems.org as newrelic_rpm. If your app uses Bundler, add this gem to the Gemfile: gem 'newrelic_rpm' Copy Restart your dyno. Generate some traffic to your app. Non-Rails applications If you are using New Relic's Ruby agent with a non-Rails application, Heroku users need to install the plugin in your repository manually. For example, in a Sinatra app, add the newrelic_rpm gem to your Gemfile, and then add the following code to your app: configure :production do require 'newrelic_rpm' end Copy Installing the add-on automatically creates a private New Relic account and configures access for Heroku servers. New Relic will begin monitoring application performance, end user experience, and app server performance collected after the add-on is installed. Within a few minutes, data should start appearing in your APM summary page. Troubleshooting your installation Within a few minutes of installing and configuring New Relic, data should start appearing in your app's APM summary page. If no data appears, follow the Ruby agent troubleshooting procedures. Upgrade from an existing New Relic installation If New Relic is already installed, reinstall the add-on using the Heroku toolbelt command. heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='Your Application Name' Copy Configure the Ruby agent on Heroku You can configure New Relic in your newrelic.yml file, or you can use environment variables to take precedence over the values in your config file. Use heroku config:set to modify the agent's settings for your Heroku appication. For example, to set the analytics_events.max_samples_stored setting to 500: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_ANALYTICS_EVENTS_MAX_SAMPLES_STORED=500 Copy Hostnames on Heroku Knowing which data came from which host allows you to filter the metrics displayed in the UI to a specific host. On Heroku, hostnames within dynos are dynamically generated and not generally meaningful to you as an application developer. Starting in version 3.9.5, the Ruby agent reports the Heroku dyno name as the hostname (for example, web.1). This allows you to view your data scoped to a particular dyno name. You can disable this behavior by setting the heroku.use_dyno_names setting to false. The agent will then use a single aggregated placeholder name called Dynamic Hostname. Dyno hostname aggregation Some dynos have names that are dynamically generated, and these may take on many unique values over time. Examples include scheduler dynos created by the Scheduler add-on, and run dynos created by invoking heroku run on the command line. In order to keep the number of unique hostnames reasonable, the Ruby agent will automatically aggregate data from scheduler and run dynos into hostnames called scheduler.* and run.*. If you have other dyno types that are dynamically created, use the heroku.dyno_name_prefixes_to_shorten configuration setting to apply the same aggregation to these other dyno types. Logging for Heroku On Heroku, the Ruby agent logs to standard output, mixing agent logs with your normal application logs. Log entries generated by the Ruby agent include a [NewRelic] tag as a prefix. To retrieve logs on Heroku: Verify that your NEW_RELIC_LOG environment variable is set to stdout with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config Copy To reset the environment variable if necessary, run: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_LOG=\"stdout\" Copy Open your newrelic.yml file in an editor. Change the log_level to debug and save the file. Be sure you do not modify the indentation. Restart your web app. Generate some traffic to your app and run it for about five minutes. Run the following Heroku toolbelt command to view logs only from the New Relic agent: heroku logs -n 1500 | grep -i relic Copy If sending your log file to New Relic Support, attach the log file to your support ticket, along with newrelic.yml, your Gemfile, and Gemfile.lock. Edit newrelic.yml again, and change the log_level to the previous setting. Save the file.

For applications using Bundler, add this gem to the Gemfile: gem 'newrelic_rpm' Copy To use Infinite Tracing, the Infinite Tracing gem is also available from rubygems.org as newrelic-infinite_tracing. For applications using Bundler, additionally include the Infinite Tracing gem in the Gemfile: gem 'newrelic-infinite_tracing' Copy The next step varies depending on if you are using Rails or Sinatra: Ruby installation Comments If using Rails or Sinatra Rails: If you're using Rails 3 or higher, or Rails 2.3 in the recommended configuration, Rails will automatically call Bundler.require and cause newrelic_rpm to be required during startup of your application. Sinatra: If you're using Sinatra or another framework, you must manually call require 'newrelic_rpm'. Additionally, if you're using Infinite Tracing, manually call require 'newrelic/infinite_tracing'. Alternately, manually call Bundler.require, which also enables Infinite Tracing.

Place the New Relic gem as low in the list as possible, allowing the frameworks above it to be instrumented when the gem initializes. Install the configuration file After installing the agent, you will need to install the newrelic.yml configuration file, and name your app: If you haven't already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Or, sign in. From the account dropdown, select Account settings. On the Account settings page, look for the Download a clean configuration file section and click the newrelic.yml file. Copy the newrelic.yml file into the config sub-directory of your application. Change the default application name to a meaningful name. Alternatively, you can generate a newrelic.yml file manually with the following command: newrelic install --license_key=\"YOUR_KEY\" \"My application\" Copy You may also use the --force option with this command if you need to overwrite an existing newrelic.yml. Update the agent See Upgrade Ruby agent versions. Install agent outside production environments Typically you will install the Ruby agent in your production environment. If you want to try out the Ruby agent in a development or localhost environment, verify in the relevant environment: block of the newrelic.yml file that the monitor_mode config value has been set to true. For example, to deploy New Relic in your development environment and still be able to view your app's performance metrics: In the development: block, set the monitor_mode config value to true. Uninstall the Ruby agent gem To uninstall the Ruby agent using Bundler, remove gem 'newrelic_rpm' from your Gemfile. If you are not using Bundler, remove all references to newrelic_rpm from your environment.rb file.

For applications using Bundler, add this gem to the Gemfile: gem 'newrelic_rpm' Copy To use Infinite Tracing, the Infinite Tracing gem is also available from rubygems.org as newrelic-infinite_tracing. For applications using Bundler, additionally include the Infinite Tracing gem in the Gemfile: gem 'newrelic-infinite_tracing' Copy The next step varies depending on if you are using Rails or Sinatra: Ruby installation Comments If using Rails or Sinatra Rails: If you're using Rails 3 or higher, or Rails 2.3 in the recommended configuration, Rails will automatically call Bundler.require and cause newrelic_rpm to be required during startup of your application. Sinatra: If you're using Sinatra or another framework, you must manually call require 'newrelic_rpm'. Additionally, if you're using Infinite Tracing, manually call require 'newrelic/infinite_tracing'. Alternately, manually call Bundler.require, which also enables Infinite Tracing. If not using Rails or Sinatra In order to use automatic browser application monitoring and Cross application tracing in a Rack application that does not use Sinatra or Rails, you must manually include additional Rack middlewares provided by the agent. Place the New Relic gem as low in the list as possible, allowing the frameworks above it to be instrumented when the gem initializes. Install the configuration file After installing the agent, you will need to install the newrelic.yml configuration file, and name your app: If you haven't already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Or, sign in. From the account dropdown, select Account settings. On the Account settings page, look for the Download a clean configuration file section and click the newrelic.yml file. Copy the newrelic.yml file into the config sub-directory of your application. Change the default application name to a meaningful name. Alternatively, you can generate a newrelic.yml file manually with the following command: newrelic install --license_key=\"YOUR_KEY\" \"My application\" Copy You may also use the --force option with this command if you need to overwrite an existing newrelic.yml. Update the agent See Upgrade Ruby agent versions. Install agent outside production environments Typically you will install the Ruby agent in your production environment. If you want to try out the Ruby agent in a development or localhost environment, verify in the relevant environment: block of the newrelic.yml file that the monitor_mode config value has been set to true. For example, to deploy New Relic in your development environment and still be able to view your app's performance metrics: In the development: block, set the monitor_mode config value to true. Uninstall the Ruby agent gem To uninstall the Ruby agent using Bundler, remove gem 'newrelic_rpm' from your Gemfile. If you are not using Bundler, remove all references to newrelic_rpm from your environment.rb file. Install on older versions of Rails If you're installing the Ruby agent on Rails 2.x, and aren't using Bundler, follow these procedures. Ruby installation Comments Rails 2.1 - 2.3 without Bundler Install the gem using gem install newrelic_rpm.

      "body": "Heroku is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) solution for hosting web applications in various agent languages, including Ruby. With New Relic, you can extend Heroku using APM and browser monitoring metrics. This page describes special considerations for using Heroku as a hosting service with New Relic's Ruby agent. Install the New Relic agent add-on After deploying your Ruby app on Heroku, install the New Relic agent: Via the Heroku website To install the New Relic add-on through the Heroku website, you must be logged in to Heroku: From Heroku's Add-on page for New Relic, select a subscription plan. From Select an app, select your New Relic app. Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='Your Application Name' Copy Add the New Relic gem to your Gemfile. The New Relic Ruby agent's gem is available from rubygems.org as newrelic_rpm. If your app uses Bundler, add this gem to the Gemfile: gem 'newrelic_rpm' Copy Restart your dyno. Generate some traffic to your app. Via Heroku toolbelt To install the New Relic add-on with the Heroku toolbelt: Run the following toolbelt command, where $planlevel is the appropriate subscription plan: heroku addons:create newrelic:$planlevel Copy Give your application a descriptive name with this toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='Your Application Name' Copy Add the New Relic gem to your Gemfile. The New Relic Ruby agent's gem is available from rubygems.org as newrelic_rpm. If your app uses Bundler, add this gem to the Gemfile: gem 'newrelic_rpm' Copy Restart your dyno. Generate some traffic to your app. Non-Rails applications If you are using New Relic's Ruby agent with a non-Rails application, Heroku users need to install the plugin in your repository manually. For example, in a Sinatra app, add the newrelic_rpm gem to your Gemfile, and then add the following code to your app: configure :production do require 'newrelic_rpm' end Copy Installing the add-on automatically creates a private New Relic account and configures access for Heroku servers. New Relic will begin monitoring application performance, end user experience, and app server performance collected after the add-on is installed. Within a few minutes, data should start appearing in your APM summary page. Troubleshooting your installation Within a few minutes of installing and configuring New Relic, data should start appearing in your app's APM summary page. If no data appears, follow the Ruby agent troubleshooting procedures. Upgrade from an existing New Relic installation If New Relic is already installed, reinstall the add-on using the Heroku toolbelt command. heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='Your Application Name' Copy Configure the Ruby agent on Heroku You can configure New Relic in your newrelic.yml file, or you can use environment variables to take precedence over the values in your config file. Use heroku config:set to modify the agent's settings for your Heroku appication. For example, to set the analytics_events.max_samples_stored setting to 500: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_ANALYTICS_EVENTS_MAX_SAMPLES_STORED=500 Copy Hostnames on Heroku Knowing which data came from which host allows you to filter the metrics displayed in the UI to a specific host. On Heroku, hostnames within dynos are dynamically generated and not generally meaningful to you as an application developer. Starting in version 3.9.5, the Ruby agent reports the Heroku dyno name as the hostname (for example, web.1). This allows you to view your data scoped to a particular dyno name. You can disable this behavior by setting the heroku.use_dyno_names setting to false. The agent will then use a single aggregated placeholder name called Dynamic Hostname. Dyno hostname aggregation Some dynos have names that are dynamically generated, and these may take on many unique values over time. Examples include scheduler dynos created by the Scheduler add-on, and run dynos created by invoking heroku run on the command line. In order to keep the number of unique hostnames reasonable, the Ruby agent will automatically aggregate data from scheduler and run dynos into hostnames called scheduler.* and run.*. If you have other dyno types that are dynamically created, use the heroku.dyno_name_prefixes_to_shorten configuration setting to apply the same aggregation to these other dyno types. Logging for Heroku On Heroku, the Ruby agent logs to standard output, mixing agent logs with your normal application logs. Log entries generated by the Ruby agent include a [NewRelic] tag as a prefix. To retrieve logs on Heroku: Verify that your NEW_RELIC_LOG environment variable is set to stdout with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config Copy To reset the environment variable if necessary, run: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_LOG=\"stdout\" Copy Open your newrelic.yml file in an editor. Change the log_level to debug and save the file. Be sure you do not modify the indentation. Restart your web app. Generate some traffic to your app and run it for about five minutes. Run the following Heroku toolbelt command to view logs only from the New Relic agent: heroku logs -n 1500 | grep -i relic Copy If sending your log file to New Relic Support, attach the log file to your support ticket, along with newrelic.yml, your Gemfile, and Gemfile.lock. Edit newrelic.yml again, and change the log_level to the previous setting. Save the file.

Contents Getting started To set up Sinatra: Install the latest newrelic_rpm gem. In your Sinatra app, immediately below the Sinatra require directive, add: require 'newrelic_rpm' Copy Set RACK_ENV to the environment corresponding to the configuration definitions in your newrelic.yml file; for example, development, staging, production, etc. Note: Developer mode only works with Rails. Middleware installation Ruby agent versions prior to 3.6.3 required manual addition of New Relic middlewares to enable certain features, such as cross application tracing and browser monitoring. For more information about required middlewares, see Rack middlewares, or upgrade to the most recent Ruby agent. Ignoring routes Ruby agent versions 3.6.3 or higher support ignoring certain routes, similar to what was previously available in Rails controller instrumentation. To specify these values, use the same style of routes that you use to define your Sinatra application. For example, to ignore a ping route in a Sinatra app, include the following code in the app: newrelic_ignore '/ping' get '/ping' do # ... end Copy If you want an entire application to be ignored (for example, in a mounted application), call newrelic_ignore without parameters: newrelic_ignore Copy Additionally, newrelic_ignore_apdex and newrelic_ignore_enduser are supported. The newrelic_ignore_apdex call will exclude a given route from consideration in overall Apdex calculations. The newrelic_ignore_enduser call will prevent automatic injection of the page load timing JavaScript when a route is rendered. Padrino Padrino is a framework built on top of Sinatra.

      "body": "Summary This guide covers the major changes between the 6.x and 7.x series of the Ruby agent, issues that may be encountered while upgrading, and how to migrate successfully to version 7.x. Main changes include: Support for Ruby 2.0 and 2.1 is dropped SSL Certificate Bundle is removed Several APIs that were deprecated in various 6.x releases are now removed Auto-instrumentation defaults to prepend over method chaining Auto-instrumentation gets consistent configuration attributes See the milestone for 7.0 target release for more information. Support for Ruby 2.0 and 2.1 is dropped Ruby 2.0 and 2.1 reached EOL in February 2016, and New Relic is following suit with dropping support for these versions in the 7.0 release. There are no known changes that would inherently prevent these versions from continuing to work, but we are no longer guaranteeing the Ruby agent continues to function without issues going forward. If you need Ruby 2.0 or 2.1, then continue to use 6.15.0, which is the last release published to support these Ruby versions. Prepend instrumentation configuration Relevant pull request: Prepend instrumentation #565. Potential issue: The agent fails to initialize and start reporting data. A stack level too deep error message is reported in the logs. Solution: Our configuration and dependency detection mechanism can now be controlled through configuration. By default all auto-instrumented gems/libraries are activated with the prepend strategy. The default configuration setting for these libraries in the absence of any settings appearing in the configuration file is auto, which will pick the best strategy. In the case of a known conflict with prepend strategies, auto instructs the agent to fall back to method-chaining when such conflicts are detected. Below is a complete explanation of our changes to the configuration section for auto-instrumentation using sidekiq as an example. instrumentation: sidekiq: chain Copy Tip The use case for this is when an unknown gem is found to be conflicting. The user is able to revert to method-chaining to deal with the conflict until the agent can be updated to auto-detect and handle the conflict. To disable instrumentation altogether: instrumentation: sidekiq: disable Copy In some cases, we may know specific gems conflict with prepend. To facilitate, we offer by default an auto config option, which automatically degrades to chain in such cases. The default setting in most cases is thus: instrumentation: sidekiq: auto Copy It's possible to force using prepend strategy by specifying it in the config file: instrumentation: sidekiq: prepend Copy Tip The use case for this is when a newer version of the conflicting gem is released and it's known to no longer conflict with prepend strategy. If you encounter stack level too deep errors, see our troubleshooting guide on how to resolve these issues. After working through this troubleshooting guide, you can let us know about the prepend conflict you find by commenting on this GitHub issue. We appreciate your feedback so we may detect and automatically fall back to method-chaining in such scenarios. Modernized auto-instrumentation strategy Ruby introduced prepend as a way to insert method definitions earlier into the method resolution stack in Ruby 2.0 (released in 2013) with the intent that prepend eliminates the need to do method-chaining as a means of patching original gem libraries' implementations with trace/observability logic. Mixing prepend with method-chaining (a.k.a. method _ alias monkey patching) can lead to a known stack level too deep scenario as described in our blog post on the topic. New Relic has previously updated many auto-instrumented libraries over the years to use prepend strategy. The 7.0 release makes prepend the default strategy of choice to auto-instrument over method-chaining, except when known scenarios exist that would lead to triggering stack level too deep errors. A best effort to identify conflicting external gems that would lead to this scenario was made, but there are bound to be others out in the wild that we have not identified. In the past, we had only one way to auto-instrument for most gems and that was method-chaining. With 7.0 release, we can instrument most gems using either method-chaining or prepend and our configuration of all auto-instrumented gems has been updated to reflect this. With the modernization of our auto-instrumentation, we have also introduced new functionality in our dependency detection mechanism to identify conflicting external gems and automatically switch from prepend strategy to method-chaining. This means you no longer have to depend on the maintainers of other gems to make changes to their gem libraries in order to facilitate using the Ruby agent in conjunction with those gems. However, we are not aware of such conflicts until our users report them to us, so only a few of our auto-instrumented libraries can auto-detect these conflicts and auto-switch to method-chaining strategies. We need your help to hear about these scenarios and to add auto-detection to future Ruby agent releases. The SSL Certificate bundle is removed In the early days of Ruby (1.8, 1.9, etc.), integration with OpenSSL and making HTTPS connections was not well-handled. To ensure customers would be able to consistently make HTTPS connections to New Relic's Collector servers, a selection of SSL CA Certificates were bundled and distributed with the Ruby Agent. Over time, the Ruby ecosystem has stabilized and now supports system installed CA Certificates in a standard manner that largely obsoletes the need to bundle and distribute the certificate bundle. The vast majority of certificates bundled have expired or are nearing expiration, so we have decided to remove this dependency from the agent. If you're deploying a Ruby application and agent to a container or server that does not have CA certificates installed, you will need to ensure they're now installed for 7.0+ releases of the agent to make successful HTTPS connections to New Relic servers. For more information, see Remove cert bundle #478. Potential issue: If you're deploying to a host that does not have OpenSSL and system CA certificates installed, you may experience issues connecting to New Relic servers and experience loss of APM data. Solution: New Relic servers require HTTPS, which uses CA certificates to initiate successful connections. These may be installed, and depending on your host, in various ways. The following are helpful links for testing the readiness of your host and installing CA certificates: Troubleshooting SSL Certificate Errors Automated SSL Check Installing CA Certificates How to handle Certificates in Docker If needed, the agent can be configured to use any CA bundle by giving the path to the CA bundle file via configuration: :ca\\_bundle\\_path. Please see Custom SSL certificate for Ruby for more info. Deprecated API's and configuration attributes All deprecated API's have replacement API's that either expand scope and/or improve robustness of the deprecated API.

      "body": "The Ruby agent automatically instruments Rack middlewares. If you are unfamiliar with the basics of Rack middlewares, review the resources linked by the Rails on Rack guide. Additionally, the Ruby agent provides some features via Rack middlewares: Cross application traces Auto-instrumentation for browser monitoring New Relic automatically installs these middlewares for Rails and Sinatra. Rack instrumentation The two most common ways to configure Rack middlewares are the Rack::Builder API (most often from config.ru) and Rails' middleware stack configuration: Rack::Builder Middlewares in your config.ru file are configured using Rack::Builder. For the Ruby agent to instrument middlewares from Rack::Builder, your app must run version 1.1.0 or higher of the rack gem. This is the most common use of middlewares with Sinatra or pure-rack applications. Rails middlewares Rails uses its own class (ActionDispatch::MiddlewareStack) instead of Rack::Builder to configure middlewares. Even if you haven't explicitly added middlewares to your Rails application, many components of Rails itself are implemented as middleware, so middleware data will appear by default. The Ruby agent automatically instruments middlewares added via ActionDispatch::MiddlewareStack on Rails 3.0 or higher. For more information about configuring middlewares with Rails, see the Ruby on Rails guide. Viewing middleware data You can view middleware data in APM. In the APM Summary page The main chart on your app's APM Summary page includes a purple bar that shows average time per request spent in all Rack middlewares for your application. APM > (selected application) > Summary: Middleware time appears in purple on your app's main Overview chart. In the APM Transactions page You can also see time for individual middlewares for a specific transaction name from your app's APM Transactions page. APM > (selected application) > Monitor > Transactions > (selected transaction) > Trace details: Here is an example of middleware time for a selected transaction for your app. In APM transaction trace summary Transaction traces also capture detailed middleware call information. APM > (selected application) > Monitor > Transactions > (selected transaction trace): Here is an example of middleware details in a transaction trace. Disabling Rack instrumentation If you do not want to instrument Rack middlewares, you may disable Rack middleware instrumentation with the disable_middleware_instrumentation setting. You can also ignore specific transactions. Installing Ruby agent middlewares manually The Ruby agent's implementation of New Relic's Cross Application Tracing feature uses Rack middleware instrumentation to read and write HTTP headers that are necessary to pass information between monitored applications. If you have disabled middleware instrumentation as described above and want to use cross application tracing, you must manually add the NewRelic::Rack::AgentHooks middleware to your middleware stack. For more information, see Cross application tracing in Ruby. Manual Rack instrumentation Earlier versions of the Ruby agent supported manually instrumenting Rack middlewares via the NewRelic::Agent::Instrumentation::Rack module. This instrumentation is deprecated in Ruby agent versions 3.9.0 or higher, because it is unnecessary with automatic middleware instrumentation. New Relic recommends that you remove references to this module from your code after upgrading to 3.9.0 or higher.",

Middleware installation Ruby agent versions prior to 3.6.3 required manual addition of New Relic middlewares to enable certain features, such as cross application tracing and browser monitoring. For more information about required middlewares, see Rack middlewares, or upgrade to the most recent Ruby agent. Ignoring routes Ruby agent versions 3.6.3 or higher support ignoring certain routes, similar to what was previously available in Rails controller instrumentation. To specify these values, use the same style of routes that you use to define your Sinatra application. For example, to ignore a ping route in a Sinatra app, include the following code in the app: newrelic_ignore '/ping' get '/ping' do # ... end Copy If you want an entire application to be ignored (for example, in a mounted application), call newrelic_ignore without parameters: newrelic_ignore Copy Additionally, newrelic_ignore_apdex and newrelic_ignore_enduser are supported. The newrelic_ignore_apdex call will exclude a given route from consideration in overall Apdex calculations. The newrelic_ignore_enduser call will prevent automatic injection of the page load timing JavaScript when a route is rendered. Padrino Padrino is a framework built on top of Sinatra.

However, we are not aware of such conflicts until our users report them to us, so only a few of our auto-instrumented libraries can auto-detect these conflicts and auto-switch to method-chaining strategies. We need your help to hear about these scenarios and to add auto-detection to future Ruby agent releases. The SSL Certificate bundle is removed In the early days of Ruby (1.8, 1.9, etc.), integration with OpenSSL and making HTTPS connections was not well-handled. To ensure customers would be able to consistently make HTTPS connections to New Relic's Collector servers, a selection of SSL CA Certificates were bundled and distributed with the Ruby Agent. Over time, the Ruby ecosystem has stabilized and now supports system installed CA Certificates in a standard manner that largely obsoletes the need to bundle and distribute the certificate bundle. The vast majority of certificates bundled have expired or are nearing expiration, so we have decided to remove this dependency from the agent. If you're deploying a Ruby application and agent to a container or server that does not have CA certificates installed, you will need to ensure they're now installed for 7.0+ releases of the agent to make successful HTTPS connections to New Relic servers. For more information, see Remove cert bundle #478. Potential issue: If you're deploying to a host that does not have OpenSSL and system CA certificates installed, you may experience issues connecting to New Relic servers and experience loss of APM data. Solution: New Relic servers require HTTPS, which uses CA certificates to initiate successful connections. These may be installed, and depending on your host, in various ways. The following are helpful links for testing the readiness of your host and installing CA certificates: Troubleshooting SSL Certificate Errors Automated SSL Check Installing CA Certificates How to handle Certificates in Docker If needed, the agent can be configured to use any CA bundle by giving the path to the CA bundle file via configuration: :ca\\_bundle\\_path.

      "body": "The Ruby agent automatically instruments Rack middlewares. If you are unfamiliar with the basics of Rack middlewares, review the resources linked by the Rails on Rack guide. Additionally, the Ruby agent provides some features via Rack middlewares: Cross application traces Auto-instrumentation for browser monitoring New Relic automatically installs these middlewares for Rails and Sinatra. Rack instrumentation The two most common ways to configure Rack middlewares are the Rack::Builder API (most often from config.ru) and Rails' middleware stack configuration: Rack::Builder Middlewares in your config.ru file are configured using Rack::Builder. For the Ruby agent to instrument middlewares from Rack::Builder, your app must run version 1.1.0 or higher of the rack gem. This is the most common use of middlewares with Sinatra or pure-rack applications. Rails middlewares Rails uses its own class (ActionDispatch::MiddlewareStack) instead of Rack::Builder to configure middlewares. Even if you haven't explicitly added middlewares to your Rails application, many components of Rails itself are implemented as middleware, so middleware data will appear by default. The Ruby agent automatically instruments middlewares added via ActionDispatch::MiddlewareStack on Rails 3.0 or higher. For more information about configuring middlewares with Rails, see the Ruby on Rails guide. Viewing middleware data You can view middleware data in APM. In the APM Summary page The main chart on your app's APM Summary page includes a purple bar that shows average time per request spent in all Rack middlewares for your application. APM > (selected application) > Summary: Middleware time appears in purple on your app's main Overview chart. In the APM Transactions page You can also see time for individual middlewares for a specific transaction name from your app's APM Transactions page. APM > (selected application) > Monitor > Transactions > (selected transaction) > Trace details: Here is an example of middleware time for a selected transaction for your app. In APM transaction trace summary Transaction traces also capture detailed middleware call information. APM > (selected application) > Monitor > Transactions > (selected transaction trace): Here is an example of middleware details in a transaction trace. Disabling Rack instrumentation If you do not want to instrument Rack middlewares, you may disable Rack middleware instrumentation with the disable_middleware_instrumentation setting. You can also ignore specific transactions. Installing Ruby agent middlewares manually The Ruby agent's implementation of New Relic's Cross Application Tracing feature uses Rack middleware instrumentation to read and write HTTP headers that are necessary to pass information between monitored applications. If you have disabled middleware instrumentation as described above and want to use cross application tracing, you must manually add the NewRelic::Rack::AgentHooks middleware to your middleware stack. For more information, see Cross application tracing in Ruby. Manual Rack instrumentation Earlier versions of the Ruby agent supported manually instrumenting Rack middlewares via the NewRelic::Agent::Instrumentation::Rack module. This instrumentation is deprecated in Ruby agent versions 3.9.0 or higher, because it is unnecessary with automatic middleware instrumentation. New Relic recommends that you remove references to this module from your code after upgrading to 3.9.0 or higher.",

      "body": "Summary This guide covers the major changes between the 6.x and 7.x series of the Ruby agent, issues that may be encountered while upgrading, and how to migrate successfully to version 7.x. Main changes include: Support for Ruby 2.0 and 2.1 is dropped SSL Certificate Bundle is removed Several APIs that were deprecated in various 6.x releases are now removed Auto-instrumentation defaults to prepend over method chaining Auto-instrumentation gets consistent configuration attributes See the milestone for 7.0 target release for more information. Support for Ruby 2.0 and 2.1 is dropped Ruby 2.0 and 2.1 reached EOL in February 2016, and New Relic is following suit with dropping support for these versions in the 7.0 release. There are no known changes that would inherently prevent these versions from continuing to work, but we are no longer guaranteeing the Ruby agent continues to function without issues going forward. If you need Ruby 2.0 or 2.1, then continue to use 6.15.0, which is the last release published to support these Ruby versions. Prepend instrumentation configuration Relevant pull request: Prepend instrumentation #565. Potential issue: The agent fails to initialize and start reporting data. A stack level too deep error message is reported in the logs. Solution: Our configuration and dependency detection mechanism can now be controlled through configuration. By default all auto-instrumented gems/libraries are activated with the prepend strategy. The default configuration setting for these libraries in the absence of any settings appearing in the configuration file is auto, which will pick the best strategy. In the case of a known conflict with prepend strategies, auto instructs the agent to fall back to method-chaining when such conflicts are detected. Below is a complete explanation of our changes to the configuration section for auto-instrumentation using sidekiq as an example. instrumentation: sidekiq: chain Copy Tip The use case for this is when an unknown gem is found to be conflicting. The user is able to revert to method-chaining to deal with the conflict until the agent can be updated to auto-detect and handle the conflict. To disable instrumentation altogether: instrumentation: sidekiq: disable Copy In some cases, we may know specific gems conflict with prepend. To facilitate, we offer by default an auto config option, which automatically degrades to chain in such cases. The default setting in most cases is thus: instrumentation: sidekiq: auto Copy It's possible to force using prepend strategy by specifying it in the config file: instrumentation: sidekiq: prepend Copy Tip The use case for this is when a newer version of the conflicting gem is released and it's known to no longer conflict with prepend strategy. If you encounter stack level too deep errors, see our troubleshooting guide on how to resolve these issues. After working through this troubleshooting guide, you can let us know about the prepend conflict you find by commenting on this GitHub issue. We appreciate your feedback so we may detect and automatically fall back to method-chaining in such scenarios. Modernized auto-instrumentation strategy Ruby introduced prepend as a way to insert method definitions earlier into the method resolution stack in Ruby 2.0 (released in 2013) with the intent that prepend eliminates the need to do method-chaining as a means of patching original gem libraries' implementations with trace/observability logic. Mixing prepend with method-chaining (a.k.a. method _ alias monkey patching) can lead to a known stack level too deep scenario as described in our blog post on the topic. New Relic has previously updated many auto-instrumented libraries over the years to use prepend strategy. The 7.0 release makes prepend the default strategy of choice to auto-instrument over method-chaining, except when known scenarios exist that would lead to triggering stack level too deep errors. A best effort to identify conflicting external gems that would lead to this scenario was made, but there are bound to be others out in the wild that we have not identified. In the past, we had only one way to auto-instrument for most gems and that was method-chaining. With 7.0 release, we can instrument most gems using either method-chaining or prepend and our configuration of all auto-instrumented gems has been updated to reflect this. With the modernization of our auto-instrumentation, we have also introduced new functionality in our dependency detection mechanism to identify conflicting external gems and automatically switch from prepend strategy to method-chaining. This means you no longer have to depend on the maintainers of other gems to make changes to their gem libraries in order to facilitate using the Ruby agent in conjunction with those gems. However, we are not aware of such conflicts until our users report them to us, so only a few of our auto-instrumented libraries can auto-detect these conflicts and auto-switch to method-chaining strategies. We need your help to hear about these scenarios and to add auto-detection to future Ruby agent releases.

      "body": "Summary This guide covers the major changes between the 6.x and 7.x series of the Ruby agent, issues that may be encountered while upgrading, and how to migrate successfully to version 7.x. Main changes include: Support for Ruby 2.0 and 2.1 is dropped SSL Certificate Bundle is removed Several APIs that were deprecated in various 6.x releases are now removed Auto-instrumentation defaults to prepend over method chaining Auto-instrumentation gets consistent configuration attributes See the milestone for 7.0 target release for more information. Support for Ruby 2.0 and 2.1 is dropped Ruby 2.0 and 2.1 reached EOL in February 2016, and New Relic is following suit with dropping support for these versions in the 7.0 release. There are no known changes that would inherently prevent these versions from continuing to work, but we are no longer guaranteeing the Ruby agent continues to function without issues going forward. If you need Ruby 2.0 or 2.1, then continue to use 6.15.0, which is the last release published to support these Ruby versions. Prepend instrumentation configuration Relevant pull request: Prepend instrumentation #565. Potential issue: The agent fails to initialize and start reporting data. A stack level too deep error message is reported in the logs. Solution: Our configuration and dependency detection mechanism can now be controlled through configuration. By default all auto-instrumented gems/libraries are activated with the prepend strategy. The default configuration setting for these libraries in the absence of any settings appearing in the configuration file is auto, which will pick the best strategy. In the case of a known conflict with prepend strategies, auto instructs the agent to fall back to method-chaining when such conflicts are detected. Below is a complete explanation of our changes to the configuration section for auto-instrumentation using sidekiq as an example. instrumentation: sidekiq: chain Copy Tip The use case for this is when an unknown gem is found to be conflicting. The user is able to revert to method-chaining to deal with the conflict until the agent can be updated to auto-detect and handle the conflict. To disable instrumentation altogether: instrumentation: sidekiq: disable Copy In some cases, we may know specific gems conflict with prepend. To facilitate, we offer by default an auto config option, which automatically degrades to chain in such cases. The default setting in most cases is thus: instrumentation: sidekiq: auto Copy It's possible to force using prepend strategy by specifying it in the config file: instrumentation: sidekiq: prepend Copy Tip The use case for this is when a newer version of the conflicting gem is released and it's known to no longer conflict with prepend strategy. If you encounter stack level too deep errors, see our troubleshooting guide on how to resolve these issues. After working through this troubleshooting guide, you can let us know about the prepend conflict you find by commenting on this GitHub issue. We appreciate your feedback so we may detect and automatically fall back to method-chaining in such scenarios. Modernized auto-instrumentation strategy Ruby introduced prepend as a way to insert method definitions earlier into the method resolution stack in Ruby 2.0 (released in 2013) with the intent that prepend eliminates the need to do method-chaining as a means of patching original gem libraries' implementations with trace/observability logic. Mixing prepend with method-chaining (a.k.a. method _ alias monkey patching) can lead to a known stack level too deep scenario as described in our blog post on the topic. New Relic has previously updated many auto-instrumented libraries over the years to use prepend strategy. The 7.0 release makes prepend the default strategy of choice to auto-instrument over method-chaining, except when known scenarios exist that would lead to triggering stack level too deep errors. A best effort to identify conflicting external gems that would lead to this scenario was made, but there are bound to be others out in the wild that we have not identified. In the past, we had only one way to auto-instrument for most gems and that was method-chaining. With 7.0 release, we can instrument most gems using either method-chaining or prepend and our configuration of all auto-instrumented gems has been updated to reflect this. With the modernization of our auto-instrumentation, we have also introduced new functionality in our dependency detection mechanism to identify conflicting external gems and automatically switch from prepend strategy to method-chaining. This means you no longer have to depend on the maintainers of other gems to make changes to their gem libraries in order to facilitate using the Ruby agent in conjunction with those gems. However, we are not aware of such conflicts until our users report them to us, so only a few of our auto-instrumented libraries can auto-detect these conflicts and auto-switch to method-chaining strategies. We need your help to hear about these scenarios and to add auto-detection to future Ruby agent releases. The SSL Certificate bundle is removed In the early days of Ruby (1.8, 1.9, etc.), integration with OpenSSL and making HTTPS connections was not well-handled. To ensure customers would be able to consistently make HTTPS connections to New Relic's Collector servers, a selection of SSL CA Certificates were bundled and distributed with the Ruby Agent. Over time, the Ruby ecosystem has stabilized and now supports system installed CA Certificates in a standard manner that largely obsoletes the need to bundle and distribute the certificate bundle. The vast majority of certificates bundled have expired or are nearing expiration, so we have decided to remove this dependency from the agent. If you're deploying a Ruby application and agent to a container or server that does not have CA certificates installed, you will need to ensure they're now installed for 7.0+ releases of the agent to make successful HTTPS connections to New Relic servers. For more information, see Remove cert bundle #478. Potential issue: If you're deploying to a host that does not have OpenSSL and system CA certificates installed, you may experience issues connecting to New Relic servers and experience loss of APM data. Solution: New Relic servers require HTTPS, which uses CA certificates to initiate successful connections. These may be installed, and depending on your host, in various ways. The following are helpful links for testing the readiness of your host and installing CA certificates: Troubleshooting SSL Certificate Errors Automated SSL Check Installing CA Certificates How to handle Certificates in Docker If needed, the agent can be configured to use any CA bundle by giving the path to the CA bundle file via configuration: :ca\\_bundle\\_path. Please see Custom SSL certificate for Ruby for more info. Deprecated API's and configuration attributes All deprecated API's have replacement API's that either expand scope and/or improve robustness of the deprecated API. Relevant pull requests are: Remove references to whitelist and blacklist in codebase #479 Remove deprecated ActiveRecord config options #480 Remove httpResponseCode attribute #481 Remove deprecated option from notice _ error API #597 Remove deprecated distributed trace API methods #598 Denied and allowed lists enabled Potential issue: Black/White listed attributes no longer work.

Solution: Change the following configuration settings: :disable _ active _ record _ 4 => :disable _ active _ record _ notifications :disable _ active _ record _ 5 => :disable _ active _ record _ notifications httpResponseCode Potential issue: The attribute httpResponseCode no longer appears in UI in the traces reported. Solution: httpResponseCode was replaced with http.statusCode. Notice Error (trace _ only) Potential issue: Passing the :trace\\_only option to NewRelic::Agent.notice\\_error no longer works. Solution: Replace :trace\\_only with the :expected attribute. Distributed Tracing APIs Potential issue: Errors are raised in application code while calling the api methods create_distributed_trace_payload and accept_distributed_trace_payload. Solution: Instead, please see insert _ distributed _ trace _ headers and accept _ distributed _ trace _ headers, respectively.",

      "body": "Summary This guide covers the major changes between the 6.x and 7.x series of the Ruby agent, issues that may be encountered while upgrading, and how to migrate successfully to version 7.x. Main changes include: Support for Ruby 2.0 and 2.1 is dropped SSL Certificate Bundle is removed Several APIs that were deprecated in various 6.x releases are now removed Auto-instrumentation defaults to prepend over method chaining Auto-instrumentation gets consistent configuration attributes See the milestone for 7.0 target release for more information. Support for Ruby 2.0 and 2.1 is dropped Ruby 2.0 and 2.1 reached EOL in February 2016, and New Relic is following suit with dropping support for these versions in the 7.0 release. There are no known changes that would inherently prevent these versions from continuing to work, but we are no longer guaranteeing the Ruby agent continues to function without issues going forward. If you need Ruby 2.0 or 2.1, then continue to use 6.15.0, which is the last release published to support these Ruby versions. Prepend instrumentation configuration Relevant pull request: Prepend instrumentation #565. Potential issue: The agent fails to initialize and start reporting data. A stack level too deep error message is reported in the logs. Solution: Our configuration and dependency detection mechanism can now be controlled through configuration. By default all auto-instrumented gems/libraries are activated with the prepend strategy. The default configuration setting for these libraries in the absence of any settings appearing in the configuration file is auto, which will pick the best strategy. In the case of a known conflict with prepend strategies, auto instructs the agent to fall back to method-chaining when such conflicts are detected. Below is a complete explanation of our changes to the configuration section for auto-instrumentation using sidekiq as an example. instrumentation: sidekiq: chain Copy Tip The use case for this is when an unknown gem is found to be conflicting. The user is able to revert to method-chaining to deal with the conflict until the agent can be updated to auto-detect and handle the conflict. To disable instrumentation altogether: instrumentation: sidekiq: disable Copy In some cases, we may know specific gems conflict with prepend. To facilitate, we offer by default an auto config option, which automatically degrades to chain in such cases. The default setting in most cases is thus: instrumentation: sidekiq: auto Copy It's possible to force using prepend strategy by specifying it in the config file: instrumentation: sidekiq: prepend Copy Tip The use case for this is when a newer version of the conflicting gem is released and it's known to no longer conflict with prepend strategy. If you encounter stack level too deep errors, see our troubleshooting guide on how to resolve these issues. After working through this troubleshooting guide, you can let us know about the prepend conflict you find by commenting on this GitHub issue. We appreciate your feedback so we may detect and automatically fall back to method-chaining in such scenarios. Modernized auto-instrumentation strategy Ruby introduced prepend as a way to insert method definitions earlier into the method resolution stack in Ruby 2.0 (released in 2013) with the intent that prepend eliminates the need to do method-chaining as a means of patching original gem libraries' implementations with trace/observability logic. Mixing prepend with method-chaining (a.k.a. method _ alias monkey patching) can lead to a known stack level too deep scenario as described in our blog post on the topic. New Relic has previously updated many auto-instrumented libraries over the years to use prepend strategy. The 7.0 release makes prepend the default strategy of choice to auto-instrument over method-chaining, except when known scenarios exist that would lead to triggering stack level too deep errors. A best effort to identify conflicting external gems that would lead to this scenario was made, but there are bound to be others out in the wild that we have not identified. In the past, we had only one way to auto-instrument for most gems and that was method-chaining. With 7.0 release, we can instrument most gems using either method-chaining or prepend and our configuration of all auto-instrumented gems has been updated to reflect this. With the modernization of our auto-instrumentation, we have also introduced new functionality in our dependency detection mechanism to identify conflicting external gems and automatically switch from prepend strategy to method-chaining. This means you no longer have to depend on the maintainers of other gems to make changes to their gem libraries in order to facilitate using the Ruby agent in conjunction with those gems. However, we are not aware of such conflicts until our users report them to us, so only a few of our auto-instrumented libraries can auto-detect these conflicts and auto-switch to method-chaining strategies. We need your help to hear about these scenarios and to add auto-detection to future Ruby agent releases. The SSL Certificate bundle is removed In the early days of Ruby (1.8, 1.9, etc.), integration with OpenSSL and making HTTPS connections was not well-handled. To ensure customers would be able to consistently make HTTPS connections to New Relic's Collector servers, a selection of SSL CA Certificates were bundled and distributed with the Ruby Agent. Over time, the Ruby ecosystem has stabilized and now supports system installed CA Certificates in a standard manner that largely obsoletes the need to bundle and distribute the certificate bundle. The vast majority of certificates bundled have expired or are nearing expiration, so we have decided to remove this dependency from the agent. If you're deploying a Ruby application and agent to a container or server that does not have CA certificates installed, you will need to ensure they're now installed for 7.0+ releases of the agent to make successful HTTPS connections to New Relic servers. For more information, see Remove cert bundle #478. Potential issue: If you're deploying to a host that does not have OpenSSL and system CA certificates installed, you may experience issues connecting to New Relic servers and experience loss of APM data. Solution: New Relic servers require HTTPS, which uses CA certificates to initiate successful connections. These may be installed, and depending on your host, in various ways. The following are helpful links for testing the readiness of your host and installing CA certificates: Troubleshooting SSL Certificate Errors Automated SSL Check Installing CA Certificates How to handle Certificates in Docker If needed, the agent can be configured to use any CA bundle by giving the path to the CA bundle file via configuration: :ca\\_bundle\\_path. Please see Custom SSL certificate for Ruby for more info. Deprecated API's and configuration attributes All deprecated API's have replacement API's that either expand scope and/or improve robustness of the deprecated API. Relevant pull requests are: Remove references to whitelist and blacklist in codebase #479 Remove deprecated ActiveRecord config options #480 Remove httpResponseCode attribute #481 Remove deprecated option from notice _ error API #597 Remove deprecated distributed trace API methods #598 Denied and allowed lists enabled Potential issue: Black/White listed attributes no longer work.

Solution: httpResponseCode was replaced with http.statusCode. Notice Error (trace _ only) Potential issue: Passing the :trace\\_only option to NewRelic::Agent.notice\\_error no longer works. Solution: Replace :trace\\_only with the :expected attribute. Distributed Tracing APIs Potential issue: Errors are raised in application code while calling the api methods create_distributed_trace_payload and accept_distributed_trace_payload. Solution: Instead, please see insert _ distributed _ trace _ headers and accept _ distributed _ trace _ headers, respectively.",

By default all auto-instrumented gems/libraries are activated with the prepend strategy. The default configuration setting for these libraries in the absence of any settings appearing in the configuration file is auto, which will pick the best strategy. In the case of a known conflict with prepend strategies, auto instructs the agent to fall back to method-chaining when such conflicts are detected. Below is a complete explanation of our changes to the configuration section for auto-instrumentation using sidekiq as an example. instrumentation: sidekiq: chain Copy Tip The use case for this is when an unknown gem is found to be conflicting. The user is able to revert to method-chaining to deal with the conflict until the agent can be updated to auto-detect and handle the conflict. To disable instrumentation altogether: instrumentation: sidekiq: disable Copy In some cases, we may know specific gems conflict with prepend. To facilitate, we offer by default an auto config option, which automatically degrades to chain in such cases. The default setting in most cases is thus: instrumentation: sidekiq: auto Copy It's possible to force using prepend strategy by specifying it in the config file: instrumentation: sidekiq: prepend Copy Tip The use case for this is when a newer version of the conflicting gem is released and it's known to no longer conflict with prepend strategy. If you encounter stack level too deep errors, see our troubleshooting guide on how to resolve these issues. After working through this troubleshooting guide, you can let us know about the prepend conflict you find by commenting on this GitHub issue. We appreciate your feedback so we may detect and automatically fall back to method-chaining in such scenarios. Modernized auto-instrumentation strategy Ruby introduced prepend as a way to insert method definitions earlier into the method resolution stack in Ruby 2.0 (released in 2013) with the intent that prepend eliminates the need to do method-chaining as a means of patching original gem libraries' implementations with trace/observability logic. Mixing prepend with method-chaining (a.k.a. method _ alias monkey patching) can lead to a known stack level too deep scenario as described in our blog post on the topic. New Relic has previously updated many auto-instrumented libraries over the years to use prepend strategy. The 7.0 release makes prepend the default strategy of choice to auto-instrument over method-chaining, except when known scenarios exist that would lead to triggering stack level too deep errors. A best effort to identify conflicting external gems that would lead to this scenario was made, but there are bound to be others out in the wild that we have not identified. In the past, we had only one way to auto-instrument for most gems and that was method-chaining. With 7.0 release, we can instrument most gems using either method-chaining or prepend and our configuration of all auto-instrumented gems has been updated to reflect this. With the modernization of our auto-instrumentation, we have also introduced new functionality in our dependency detection mechanism to identify conflicting external gems and automatically switch from prepend strategy to method-chaining. This means you no longer have to depend on the maintainers of other gems to make changes to their gem libraries in order to facilitate using the Ruby agent in conjunction with those gems. However, we are not aware of such conflicts until our users report them to us, so only a few of our auto-instrumented libraries can auto-detect these conflicts and auto-switch to method-chaining strategies. We need your help to hear about these scenarios and to add auto-detection to future Ruby agent releases. The SSL Certificate bundle is removed In the early days of Ruby (1.8, 1.9, etc.), integration with OpenSSL and making HTTPS connections was not well-handled. To ensure customers would be able to consistently make HTTPS connections to New Relic's Collector servers, a selection of SSL CA Certificates were bundled and distributed with the Ruby Agent. Over time, the Ruby ecosystem has stabilized and now supports system installed CA Certificates in a standard manner that largely obsoletes the need to bundle and distribute the certificate bundle. The vast majority of certificates bundled have expired or are nearing expiration, so we have decided to remove this dependency from the agent. If you're deploying a Ruby application and agent to a container or server that does not have CA certificates installed, you will need to ensure they're now installed for 7.0+ releases of the agent to make successful HTTPS connections to New Relic servers. For more information, see Remove cert bundle #478. Potential issue: If you're deploying to a host that does not have OpenSSL and system CA certificates installed, you may experience issues connecting to New Relic servers and experience loss of APM data. Solution: New Relic servers require HTTPS, which uses CA certificates to initiate successful connections. These may be installed, and depending on your host, in various ways. The following are helpful links for testing the readiness of your host and installing CA certificates: Troubleshooting SSL Certificate Errors Automated SSL Check Installing CA Certificates How to handle Certificates in Docker If needed, the agent can be configured to use any CA bundle by giving the path to the CA bundle file via configuration: :ca\\_bundle\\_path.

Support for Ruby 2.0 and 2.1 is dropped Ruby 2.0 and 2.1 reached EOL in February 2016, and New Relic is following suit with dropping support for these versions in the 7.0 release. There are no known changes that would inherently prevent these versions from continuing to work, but we are no longer guaranteeing the Ruby agent continues to function without issues going forward.

The SSL Certificate bundle is removed In the early days of Ruby (1.8, 1.9, etc.), integration with OpenSSL and making HTTPS connections was not well-handled. To ensure customers would be able to consistently make HTTPS connections to New Relic's Collector servers, a selection of SSL CA Certificates were bundled and distributed with the Ruby Agent. Over time, the Ruby ecosystem has stabilized and now supports system installed CA Certificates in a standard manner that largely obsoletes the need to bundle and distribute the certificate bundle. The vast majority of certificates bundled have expired or are nearing expiration, so we have decided to remove this dependency from the agent. If you're deploying a Ruby application and agent to a container or server that does not have CA certificates installed, you will need to ensure they're now installed for 7.0+ releases of the agent to make successful HTTPS connections to New Relic servers. For more information, see Remove cert bundle #478. Potential issue: If you're deploying to a host that does not have OpenSSL and system CA certificates installed, you may experience issues connecting to New Relic servers and experience loss of APM data. Solution: New Relic servers require HTTPS, which uses CA certificates to initiate successful connections. These may be installed, and depending on your host, in various ways. The following are helpful links for testing the readiness of your host and installing CA certificates: Troubleshooting SSL Certificate Errors Automated SSL Check Installing CA Certificates How to handle Certificates in Docker If needed, the agent can be configured to use any CA bundle by giving the path to the CA bundle file via configuration: :ca\\_bundle\\_path.

      "body": "Summary This guide covers the major changes between the 6.x and 7.x series of the Ruby agent, issues that may be encountered while upgrading, and how to migrate successfully to version 7.x. Main changes include: Support for Ruby 2.0 and 2.1 is dropped SSL Certificate Bundle is removed Several APIs that were deprecated in various 6.x releases are now removed Auto-instrumentation defaults to prepend over method chaining Auto-instrumentation gets consistent configuration attributes See the milestone for 7.0 target release for more information. Support for Ruby 2.0 and 2.1 is dropped Ruby 2.0 and 2.1 reached EOL in February 2016, and New Relic is following suit with dropping support for these versions in the 7.0 release. There are no known changes that would inherently prevent these versions from continuing to work, but we are no longer guaranteeing the Ruby agent continues to function without issues going forward. If you need Ruby 2.0 or 2.1, then continue to use 6.15.0, which is the last release published to support these Ruby versions. Prepend instrumentation configuration Relevant pull request: Prepend instrumentation #565. Potential issue: The agent fails to initialize and start reporting data. A stack level too deep error message is reported in the logs. Solution: Our configuration and dependency detection mechanism can now be controlled through configuration. By default all auto-instrumented gems/libraries are activated with the prepend strategy. The default configuration setting for these libraries in the absence of any settings appearing in the configuration file is auto, which will pick the best strategy. In the case of a known conflict with prepend strategies, auto instructs the agent to fall back to method-chaining when such conflicts are detected. Below is a complete explanation of our changes to the configuration section for auto-instrumentation using sidekiq as an example. instrumentation: sidekiq: chain Copy Tip The use case for this is when an unknown gem is found to be conflicting. The user is able to revert to method-chaining to deal with the conflict until the agent can be updated to auto-detect and handle the conflict. To disable instrumentation altogether: instrumentation: sidekiq: disable Copy In some cases, we may know specific gems conflict with prepend. To facilitate, we offer by default an auto config option, which automatically degrades to chain in such cases. The default setting in most cases is thus: instrumentation: sidekiq: auto Copy It's possible to force using prepend strategy by specifying it in the config file: instrumentation: sidekiq: prepend Copy Tip The use case for this is when a newer version of the conflicting gem is released and it's known to no longer conflict with prepend strategy. If you encounter stack level too deep errors, see our troubleshooting guide on how to resolve these issues. After working through this troubleshooting guide, you can let us know about the prepend conflict you find by commenting on this GitHub issue. We appreciate your feedback so we may detect and automatically fall back to method-chaining in such scenarios. Modernized auto-instrumentation strategy Ruby introduced prepend as a way to insert method definitions earlier into the method resolution stack in Ruby 2.0 (released in 2013) with the intent that prepend eliminates the need to do method-chaining as a means of patching original gem libraries' implementations with trace/observability logic. Mixing prepend with method-chaining (a.k.a. method _ alias monkey patching) can lead to a known stack level too deep scenario as described in our blog post on the topic. New Relic has previously updated many auto-instrumented libraries over the years to use prepend strategy. The 7.0 release makes prepend the default strategy of choice to auto-instrument over method-chaining, except when known scenarios exist that would lead to triggering stack level too deep errors. A best effort to identify conflicting external gems that would lead to this scenario was made, but there are bound to be others out in the wild that we have not identified. In the past, we had only one way to auto-instrument for most gems and that was method-chaining. With 7.0 release, we can instrument most gems using either method-chaining or prepend and our configuration of all auto-instrumented gems has been updated to reflect this. With the modernization of our auto-instrumentation, we have also introduced new functionality in our dependency detection mechanism to identify conflicting external gems and automatically switch from prepend strategy to method-chaining. This means you no longer have to depend on the maintainers of other gems to make changes to their gem libraries in order to facilitate using the Ruby agent in conjunction with those gems. However, we are not aware of such conflicts until our users report them to us, so only a few of our auto-instrumented libraries can auto-detect these conflicts and auto-switch to method-chaining strategies. We need your help to hear about these scenarios and to add auto-detection to future Ruby agent releases. The SSL Certificate bundle is removed In the early days of Ruby (1.8, 1.9, etc.), integration with OpenSSL and making HTTPS connections was not well-handled. To ensure customers would be able to consistently make HTTPS connections to New Relic's Collector servers, a selection of SSL CA Certificates were bundled and distributed with the Ruby Agent. Over time, the Ruby ecosystem has stabilized and now supports system installed CA Certificates in a standard manner that largely obsoletes the need to bundle and distribute the certificate bundle. The vast majority of certificates bundled have expired or are nearing expiration, so we have decided to remove this dependency from the agent. If you're deploying a Ruby application and agent to a container or server that does not have CA certificates installed, you will need to ensure they're now installed for 7.0+ releases of the agent to make successful HTTPS connections to New Relic servers. For more information, see Remove cert bundle #478. Potential issue: If you're deploying to a host that does not have OpenSSL and system CA certificates installed, you may experience issues connecting to New Relic servers and experience loss of APM data. Solution: New Relic servers require HTTPS, which uses CA certificates to initiate successful connections. These may be installed, and depending on your host, in various ways. The following are helpful links for testing the readiness of your host and installing CA certificates: Troubleshooting SSL Certificate Errors Automated SSL Check Installing CA Certificates How to handle Certificates in Docker If needed, the agent can be configured to use any CA bundle by giving the path to the CA bundle file via configuration: :ca\\_bundle\\_path. Please see Custom SSL certificate for Ruby for more info.

      "body": "Summary This guide covers the major changes between the 6.x and 7.x series of the Ruby agent, issues that may be encountered while upgrading, and how to migrate successfully to version 7.x. Main changes include: Support for Ruby 2.0 and 2.1 is dropped SSL Certificate Bundle is removed Several APIs that were deprecated in various 6.x releases are now removed Auto-instrumentation defaults to prepend over method chaining Auto-instrumentation gets consistent configuration attributes See the milestone for 7.0 target release for more information. Support for Ruby 2.0 and 2.1 is dropped Ruby 2.0 and 2.1 reached EOL in February 2016, and New Relic is following suit with dropping support for these versions in the 7.0 release. There are no known changes that would inherently prevent these versions from continuing to work, but we are no longer guaranteeing the Ruby agent continues to function without issues going forward. If you need Ruby 2.0 or 2.1, then continue to use 6.15.0, which is the last release published to support these Ruby versions. Prepend instrumentation configuration Relevant pull request: Prepend instrumentation #565. Potential issue: The agent fails to initialize and start reporting data. A stack level too deep error message is reported in the logs. Solution: Our configuration and dependency detection mechanism can now be controlled through configuration. By default all auto-instrumented gems/libraries are activated with the prepend strategy. The default configuration setting for these libraries in the absence of any settings appearing in the configuration file is auto, which will pick the best strategy. In the case of a known conflict with prepend strategies, auto instructs the agent to fall back to method-chaining when such conflicts are detected. Below is a complete explanation of our changes to the configuration section for auto-instrumentation using sidekiq as an example. instrumentation: sidekiq: chain Copy Tip The use case for this is when an unknown gem is found to be conflicting. The user is able to revert to method-chaining to deal with the conflict until the agent can be updated to auto-detect and handle the conflict. To disable instrumentation altogether: instrumentation: sidekiq: disable Copy In some cases, we may know specific gems conflict with prepend. To facilitate, we offer by default an auto config option, which automatically degrades to chain in such cases. The default setting in most cases is thus: instrumentation: sidekiq: auto Copy It's possible to force using prepend strategy by specifying it in the config file: instrumentation: sidekiq: prepend Copy Tip The use case for this is when a newer version of the conflicting gem is released and it's known to no longer conflict with prepend strategy. If you encounter stack level too deep errors, see our troubleshooting guide on how to resolve these issues. After working through this troubleshooting guide, you can let us know about the prepend conflict you find by commenting on this GitHub issue. We appreciate your feedback so we may detect and automatically fall back to method-chaining in such scenarios. Modernized auto-instrumentation strategy Ruby introduced prepend as a way to insert method definitions earlier into the method resolution stack in Ruby 2.0 (released in 2013) with the intent that prepend eliminates the need to do method-chaining as a means of patching original gem libraries' implementations with trace/observability logic. Mixing prepend with method-chaining (a.k.a. method _ alias monkey patching) can lead to a known stack level too deep scenario as described in our blog post on the topic. New Relic has previously updated many auto-instrumented libraries over the years to use prepend strategy. The 7.0 release makes prepend the default strategy of choice to auto-instrument over method-chaining, except when known scenarios exist that would lead to triggering stack level too deep errors. A best effort to identify conflicting external gems that would lead to this scenario was made, but there are bound to be others out in the wild that we have not identified. In the past, we had only one way to auto-instrument for most gems and that was method-chaining. With 7.0 release, we can instrument most gems using either method-chaining or prepend and our configuration of all auto-instrumented gems has been updated to reflect this. With the modernization of our auto-instrumentation, we have also introduced new functionality in our dependency detection mechanism to identify conflicting external gems and automatically switch from prepend strategy to method-chaining. This means you no longer have to depend on the maintainers of other gems to make changes to their gem libraries in order to facilitate using the Ruby agent in conjunction with those gems. However, we are not aware of such conflicts until our users report them to us, so only a few of our auto-instrumented libraries can auto-detect these conflicts and auto-switch to method-chaining strategies. We need your help to hear about these scenarios and to add auto-detection to future Ruby agent releases. The SSL Certificate bundle is removed In the early days of Ruby (1.8, 1.9, etc.), integration with OpenSSL and making HTTPS connections was not well-handled. To ensure customers would be able to consistently make HTTPS connections to New Relic's Collector servers, a selection of SSL CA Certificates were bundled and distributed with the Ruby Agent. Over time, the Ruby ecosystem has stabilized and now supports system installed CA Certificates in a standard manner that largely obsoletes the need to bundle and distribute the certificate bundle. The vast majority of certificates bundled have expired or are nearing expiration, so we have decided to remove this dependency from the agent. If you're deploying a Ruby application and agent to a container or server that does not have CA certificates installed, you will need to ensure they're now installed for 7.0+ releases of the agent to make successful HTTPS connections to New Relic servers. For more information, see Remove cert bundle #478. Potential issue: If you're deploying to a host that does not have OpenSSL and system CA certificates installed, you may experience issues connecting to New Relic servers and experience loss of APM data. Solution: New Relic servers require HTTPS, which uses CA certificates to initiate successful connections. These may be installed, and depending on your host, in various ways. The following are helpful links for testing the readiness of your host and installing CA certificates: Troubleshooting SSL Certificate Errors Automated SSL Check Installing CA Certificates How to handle Certificates in Docker If needed, the agent can be configured to use any CA bundle by giving the path to the CA bundle file via configuration: :ca\\_bundle\\_path. Please see Custom SSL certificate for Ruby for more info. Deprecated API's and configuration attributes All deprecated API's have replacement API's that either expand scope and/or improve robustness of the deprecated API. Relevant pull requests are: Remove references to whitelist and blacklist in codebase #479 Remove deprecated ActiveRecord config options #480 Remove httpResponseCode attribute #481 Remove deprecated option from notice _ error API #597 Remove deprecated distributed trace API methods #598 Denied and allowed lists enabled Potential issue: Black/White listed attributes no longer work.

Solution: httpResponseCode was replaced with http.statusCode. Notice Error (trace _ only) Potential issue: Passing the :trace\\_only option to NewRelic::Agent.notice\\_error no longer works. Solution: Replace :trace\\_only with the :expected attribute. Distributed Tracing APIs Potential issue: Errors are raised in application code while calling the api methods create_distributed_trace_payload and accept_distributed_trace_payload. Solution: Instead, please see insert _ distributed _ trace _ headers and accept _ distributed _ trace _ headers, respectively.",

      "body": "Summary This guide covers the major changes between the 6.x and 7.x series of the Ruby agent, issues that may be encountered while upgrading, and how to migrate successfully to version 7.x. Main changes include: Support for Ruby 2.0 and 2.1 is dropped SSL Certificate Bundle is removed Several APIs that were deprecated in various 6.x releases are now removed Auto-instrumentation defaults to prepend over method chaining Auto-instrumentation gets consistent configuration attributes See the milestone for 7.0 target release for more information. Support for Ruby 2.0 and 2.1 is dropped Ruby 2.0 and 2.1 reached EOL in February 2016, and New Relic is following suit with dropping support for these versions in the 7.0 release. There are no known changes that would inherently prevent these versions from continuing to work, but we are no longer guaranteeing the Ruby agent continues to function without issues going forward. If you need Ruby 2.0 or 2.1, then continue to use 6.15.0, which is the last release published to support these Ruby versions. Prepend instrumentation configuration Relevant pull request: Prepend instrumentation #565. Potential issue: The agent fails to initialize and start reporting data. A stack level too deep error message is reported in the logs. Solution: Our configuration and dependency detection mechanism can now be controlled through configuration. By default all auto-instrumented gems/libraries are activated with the prepend strategy. The default configuration setting for these libraries in the absence of any settings appearing in the configuration file is auto, which will pick the best strategy. In the case of a known conflict with prepend strategies, auto instructs the agent to fall back to method-chaining when such conflicts are detected. Below is a complete explanation of our changes to the configuration section for auto-instrumentation using sidekiq as an example. instrumentation: sidekiq: chain Copy Tip The use case for this is when an unknown gem is found to be conflicting. The user is able to revert to method-chaining to deal with the conflict until the agent can be updated to auto-detect and handle the conflict. To disable instrumentation altogether: instrumentation: sidekiq: disable Copy In some cases, we may know specific gems conflict with prepend. To facilitate, we offer by default an auto config option, which automatically degrades to chain in such cases. The default setting in most cases is thus: instrumentation: sidekiq: auto Copy It's possible to force using prepend strategy by specifying it in the config file: instrumentation: sidekiq: prepend Copy Tip The use case for this is when a newer version of the conflicting gem is released and it's known to no longer conflict with prepend strategy. If you encounter stack level too deep errors, see our troubleshooting guide on how to resolve these issues. After working through this troubleshooting guide, you can let us know about the prepend conflict you find by commenting on this GitHub issue. We appreciate your feedback so we may detect and automatically fall back to method-chaining in such scenarios. Modernized auto-instrumentation strategy Ruby introduced prepend as a way to insert method definitions earlier into the method resolution stack in Ruby 2.0 (released in 2013) with the intent that prepend eliminates the need to do method-chaining as a means of patching original gem libraries' implementations with trace/observability logic. Mixing prepend with method-chaining (a.k.a. method _ alias monkey patching) can lead to a known stack level too deep scenario as described in our blog post on the topic. New Relic has previously updated many auto-instrumented libraries over the years to use prepend strategy. The 7.0 release makes prepend the default strategy of choice to auto-instrument over method-chaining, except when known scenarios exist that would lead to triggering stack level too deep errors. A best effort to identify conflicting external gems that would lead to this scenario was made, but there are bound to be others out in the wild that we have not identified. In the past, we had only one way to auto-instrument for most gems and that was method-chaining. With 7.0 release, we can instrument most gems using either method-chaining or prepend and our configuration of all auto-instrumented gems has been updated to reflect this. With the modernization of our auto-instrumentation, we have also introduced new functionality in our dependency detection mechanism to identify conflicting external gems and automatically switch from prepend strategy to method-chaining. This means you no longer have to depend on the maintainers of other gems to make changes to their gem libraries in order to facilitate using the Ruby agent in conjunction with those gems. However, we are not aware of such conflicts until our users report them to us, so only a few of our auto-instrumented libraries can auto-detect these conflicts and auto-switch to method-chaining strategies. We need your help to hear about these scenarios and to add auto-detection to future Ruby agent releases. The SSL Certificate bundle is removed In the early days of Ruby (1.8, 1.9, etc.), integration with OpenSSL and making HTTPS connections was not well-handled. To ensure customers would be able to consistently make HTTPS connections to New Relic's Collector servers, a selection of SSL CA Certificates were bundled and distributed with the Ruby Agent. Over time, the Ruby ecosystem has stabilized and now supports system installed CA Certificates in a standard manner that largely obsoletes the need to bundle and distribute the certificate bundle. The vast majority of certificates bundled have expired or are nearing expiration, so we have decided to remove this dependency from the agent. If you're deploying a Ruby application and agent to a container or server that does not have CA certificates installed, you will need to ensure they're now installed for 7.0+ releases of the agent to make successful HTTPS connections to New Relic servers. For more information, see Remove cert bundle #478. Potential issue: If you're deploying to a host that does not have OpenSSL and system CA certificates installed, you may experience issues connecting to New Relic servers and experience loss of APM data. Solution: New Relic servers require HTTPS, which uses CA certificates to initiate successful connections. These may be installed, and depending on your host, in various ways. The following are helpful links for testing the readiness of your host and installing CA certificates: Troubleshooting SSL Certificate Errors Automated SSL Check Installing CA Certificates How to handle Certificates in Docker If needed, the agent can be configured to use any CA bundle by giving the path to the CA bundle file via configuration: :ca\\_bundle\\_path. Please see Custom SSL certificate for Ruby for more info. Deprecated API's and configuration attributes All deprecated API's have replacement API's that either expand scope and/or improve robustness of the deprecated API. Relevant pull requests are: Remove references to whitelist and blacklist in codebase #479 Remove deprecated ActiveRecord config options #480 Remove httpResponseCode attribute #481 Remove deprecated option from notice _ error API #597 Remove deprecated distributed trace API methods #598 Denied and allowed lists enabled Potential issue: Black/White listed attributes no longer work.

Solution: Change the following configuration settings: :disable _ active _ record _ 4 => :disable _ active _ record _ notifications :disable _ active _ record _ 5 => :disable _ active _ record _ notifications httpResponseCode Potential issue: The attribute httpResponseCode no longer appears in UI in the traces reported. Solution: httpResponseCode was replaced with http.statusCode. Notice Error (trace _ only) Potential issue: Passing the :trace\\_only option to NewRelic::Agent.notice\\_error no longer works. Solution: Replace :trace\\_only with the :expected attribute. Distributed Tracing APIs Potential issue: Errors are raised in application code while calling the api methods create_distributed_trace_payload and accept_distributed_trace_payload. Solution: Instead, please see insert _ distributed _ trace _ headers and accept _ distributed _ trace _ headers, respectively.",

      "body": "Summary This guide covers the major changes between the 6.x and 7.x series of the Ruby agent, issues that may be encountered while upgrading, and how to migrate successfully to version 7.x. Main changes include: Support for Ruby 2.0 and 2.1 is dropped SSL Certificate Bundle is removed Several APIs that were deprecated in various 6.x releases are now removed Auto-instrumentation defaults to prepend over method chaining Auto-instrumentation gets consistent configuration attributes See the milestone for 7.0 target release for more information. Support for Ruby 2.0 and 2.1 is dropped Ruby 2.0 and 2.1 reached EOL in February 2016, and New Relic is following suit with dropping support for these versions in the 7.0 release. There are no known changes that would inherently prevent these versions from continuing to work, but we are no longer guaranteeing the Ruby agent continues to function without issues going forward. If you need Ruby 2.0 or 2.1, then continue to use 6.15.0, which is the last release published to support these Ruby versions. Prepend instrumentation configuration Relevant pull request: Prepend instrumentation #565. Potential issue: The agent fails to initialize and start reporting data. A stack level too deep error message is reported in the logs. Solution: Our configuration and dependency detection mechanism can now be controlled through configuration. By default all auto-instrumented gems/libraries are activated with the prepend strategy. The default configuration setting for these libraries in the absence of any settings appearing in the configuration file is auto, which will pick the best strategy. In the case of a known conflict with prepend strategies, auto instructs the agent to fall back to method-chaining when such conflicts are detected. Below is a complete explanation of our changes to the configuration section for auto-instrumentation using sidekiq as an example. instrumentation: sidekiq: chain Copy Tip The use case for this is when an unknown gem is found to be conflicting. The user is able to revert to method-chaining to deal with the conflict until the agent can be updated to auto-detect and handle the conflict. To disable instrumentation altogether: instrumentation: sidekiq: disable Copy In some cases, we may know specific gems conflict with prepend. To facilitate, we offer by default an auto config option, which automatically degrades to chain in such cases. The default setting in most cases is thus: instrumentation: sidekiq: auto Copy It's possible to force using prepend strategy by specifying it in the config file: instrumentation: sidekiq: prepend Copy Tip The use case for this is when a newer version of the conflicting gem is released and it's known to no longer conflict with prepend strategy. If you encounter stack level too deep errors, see our troubleshooting guide on how to resolve these issues. After working through this troubleshooting guide, you can let us know about the prepend conflict you find by commenting on this GitHub issue. We appreciate your feedback so we may detect and automatically fall back to method-chaining in such scenarios. Modernized auto-instrumentation strategy Ruby introduced prepend as a way to insert method definitions earlier into the method resolution stack in Ruby 2.0 (released in 2013) with the intent that prepend eliminates the need to do method-chaining as a means of patching original gem libraries' implementations with trace/observability logic. Mixing prepend with method-chaining (a.k.a. method _ alias monkey patching) can lead to a known stack level too deep scenario as described in our blog post on the topic. New Relic has previously updated many auto-instrumented libraries over the years to use prepend strategy. The 7.0 release makes prepend the default strategy of choice to auto-instrument over method-chaining, except when known scenarios exist that would lead to triggering stack level too deep errors. A best effort to identify conflicting external gems that would lead to this scenario was made, but there are bound to be others out in the wild that we have not identified. In the past, we had only one way to auto-instrument for most gems and that was method-chaining. With 7.0 release, we can instrument most gems using either method-chaining or prepend and our configuration of all auto-instrumented gems has been updated to reflect this. With the modernization of our auto-instrumentation, we have also introduced new functionality in our dependency detection mechanism to identify conflicting external gems and automatically switch from prepend strategy to method-chaining. This means you no longer have to depend on the maintainers of other gems to make changes to their gem libraries in order to facilitate using the Ruby agent in conjunction with those gems. However, we are not aware of such conflicts until our users report them to us, so only a few of our auto-instrumented libraries can auto-detect these conflicts and auto-switch to method-chaining strategies. We need your help to hear about these scenarios and to add auto-detection to future Ruby agent releases. The SSL Certificate bundle is removed In the early days of Ruby (1.8, 1.9, etc.), integration with OpenSSL and making HTTPS connections was not well-handled. To ensure customers would be able to consistently make HTTPS connections to New Relic's Collector servers, a selection of SSL CA Certificates were bundled and distributed with the Ruby Agent. Over time, the Ruby ecosystem has stabilized and now supports system installed CA Certificates in a standard manner that largely obsoletes the need to bundle and distribute the certificate bundle. The vast majority of certificates bundled have expired or are nearing expiration, so we have decided to remove this dependency from the agent. If you're deploying a Ruby application and agent to a container or server that does not have CA certificates installed, you will need to ensure they're now installed for 7.0+ releases of the agent to make successful HTTPS connections to New Relic servers. For more information, see Remove cert bundle #478. Potential issue: If you're deploying to a host that does not have OpenSSL and system CA certificates installed, you may experience issues connecting to New Relic servers and experience loss of APM data. Solution: New Relic servers require HTTPS, which uses CA certificates to initiate successful connections. These may be installed, and depending on your host, in various ways. The following are helpful links for testing the readiness of your host and installing CA certificates: Troubleshooting SSL Certificate Errors Automated SSL Check Installing CA Certificates How to handle Certificates in Docker If needed, the agent can be configured to use any CA bundle by giving the path to the CA bundle file via configuration: :ca\\_bundle\\_path. Please see Custom SSL certificate for Ruby for more info. Deprecated API's and configuration attributes All deprecated API's have replacement API's that either expand scope and/or improve robustness of the deprecated API. Relevant pull requests are: Remove references to whitelist and blacklist in codebase #479 Remove deprecated ActiveRecord config options #480 Remove httpResponseCode attribute #481 Remove deprecated option from notice _ error API #597 Remove deprecated distributed trace API methods #598 Denied and allowed lists enabled Potential issue: Black/White listed attributes no longer work.

Solution: Change the following configuration settings: :disable _ active _ record _ 4 => :disable _ active _ record _ notifications :disable _ active _ record _ 5 => :disable _ active _ record _ notifications httpResponseCode Potential issue: The attribute httpResponseCode no longer appears in UI in the traces reported. Solution: httpResponseCode was replaced with http.statusCode. Notice Error (trace _ only) Potential issue: Passing the :trace\\_only option to NewRelic::Agent.notice\\_error no longer works. Solution: Replace :trace\\_only with the :expected attribute. Distributed Tracing APIs Potential issue: Errors are raised in application code while calling the api methods create_distributed_trace_payload and accept_distributed_trace_payload. Solution: Instead, please see insert _ distributed _ trace _ headers and accept _ distributed _ trace _ headers, respectively.",

      "body": "Summary This guide covers the major changes between the 6.x and 7.x series of the Ruby agent, issues that may be encountered while upgrading, and how to migrate successfully to version 7.x. Main changes include: Support for Ruby 2.0 and 2.1 is dropped SSL Certificate Bundle is removed Several APIs that were deprecated in various 6.x releases are now removed Auto-instrumentation defaults to prepend over method chaining Auto-instrumentation gets consistent configuration attributes See the milestone for 7.0 target release for more information. Support for Ruby 2.0 and 2.1 is dropped Ruby 2.0 and 2.1 reached EOL in February 2016, and New Relic is following suit with dropping support for these versions in the 7.0 release. There are no known changes that would inherently prevent these versions from continuing to work, but we are no longer guaranteeing the Ruby agent continues to function without issues going forward. If you need Ruby 2.0 or 2.1, then continue to use 6.15.0, which is the last release published to support these Ruby versions. Prepend instrumentation configuration Relevant pull request: Prepend instrumentation #565. Potential issue: The agent fails to initialize and start reporting data. A stack level too deep error message is reported in the logs. Solution: Our configuration and dependency detection mechanism can now be controlled through configuration. By default all auto-instrumented gems/libraries are activated with the prepend strategy. The default configuration setting for these libraries in the absence of any settings appearing in the configuration file is auto, which will pick the best strategy. In the case of a known conflict with prepend strategies, auto instructs the agent to fall back to method-chaining when such conflicts are detected. Below is a complete explanation of our changes to the configuration section for auto-instrumentation using sidekiq as an example. instrumentation: sidekiq: chain Copy Tip The use case for this is when an unknown gem is found to be conflicting. The user is able to revert to method-chaining to deal with the conflict until the agent can be updated to auto-detect and handle the conflict. To disable instrumentation altogether: instrumentation: sidekiq: disable Copy In some cases, we may know specific gems conflict with prepend. To facilitate, we offer by default an auto config option, which automatically degrades to chain in such cases. The default setting in most cases is thus: instrumentation: sidekiq: auto Copy It's possible to force using prepend strategy by specifying it in the config file: instrumentation: sidekiq: prepend Copy Tip The use case for this is when a newer version of the conflicting gem is released and it's known to no longer conflict with prepend strategy. If you encounter stack level too deep errors, see our troubleshooting guide on how to resolve these issues. After working through this troubleshooting guide, you can let us know about the prepend conflict you find by commenting on this GitHub issue. We appreciate your feedback so we may detect and automatically fall back to method-chaining in such scenarios. Modernized auto-instrumentation strategy Ruby introduced prepend as a way to insert method definitions earlier into the method resolution stack in Ruby 2.0 (released in 2013) with the intent that prepend eliminates the need to do method-chaining as a means of patching original gem libraries' implementations with trace/observability logic. Mixing prepend with method-chaining (a.k.a. method _ alias monkey patching) can lead to a known stack level too deep scenario as described in our blog post on the topic. New Relic has previously updated many auto-instrumented libraries over the years to use prepend strategy. The 7.0 release makes prepend the default strategy of choice to auto-instrument over method-chaining, except when known scenarios exist that would lead to triggering stack level too deep errors. A best effort to identify conflicting external gems that would lead to this scenario was made, but there are bound to be others out in the wild that we have not identified. In the past, we had only one way to auto-instrument for most gems and that was method-chaining. With 7.0 release, we can instrument most gems using either method-chaining or prepend and our configuration of all auto-instrumented gems has been updated to reflect this. With the modernization of our auto-instrumentation, we have also introduced new functionality in our dependency detection mechanism to identify conflicting external gems and automatically switch from prepend strategy to method-chaining. This means you no longer have to depend on the maintainers of other gems to make changes to their gem libraries in order to facilitate using the Ruby agent in conjunction with those gems. However, we are not aware of such conflicts until our users report them to us, so only a few of our auto-instrumented libraries can auto-detect these conflicts and auto-switch to method-chaining strategies. We need your help to hear about these scenarios and to add auto-detection to future Ruby agent releases. The SSL Certificate bundle is removed In the early days of Ruby (1.8, 1.9, etc.), integration with OpenSSL and making HTTPS connections was not well-handled. To ensure customers would be able to consistently make HTTPS connections to New Relic's Collector servers, a selection of SSL CA Certificates were bundled and distributed with the Ruby Agent. Over time, the Ruby ecosystem has stabilized and now supports system installed CA Certificates in a standard manner that largely obsoletes the need to bundle and distribute the certificate bundle. The vast majority of certificates bundled have expired or are nearing expiration, so we have decided to remove this dependency from the agent. If you're deploying a Ruby application and agent to a container or server that does not have CA certificates installed, you will need to ensure they're now installed for 7.0+ releases of the agent to make successful HTTPS connections to New Relic servers. For more information, see Remove cert bundle #478. Potential issue: If you're deploying to a host that does not have OpenSSL and system CA certificates installed, you may experience issues connecting to New Relic servers and experience loss of APM data. Solution: New Relic servers require HTTPS, which uses CA certificates to initiate successful connections. These may be installed, and depending on your host, in various ways. The following are helpful links for testing the readiness of your host and installing CA certificates: Troubleshooting SSL Certificate Errors Automated SSL Check Installing CA Certificates How to handle Certificates in Docker If needed, the agent can be configured to use any CA bundle by giving the path to the CA bundle file via configuration: :ca\\_bundle\\_path. Please see Custom SSL certificate for Ruby for more info. Deprecated API's and configuration attributes All deprecated API's have replacement API's that either expand scope and/or improve robustness of the deprecated API. Relevant pull requests are: Remove references to whitelist and blacklist in codebase #479 Remove deprecated ActiveRecord config options #480 Remove httpResponseCode attribute #481 Remove deprecated option from notice _ error API #597 Remove deprecated distributed trace API methods #598 Denied and allowed lists enabled Potential issue: Black/White listed attributes no longer work. Solution : Change black to denied and white to allowed in your configuration or environment variable settings. :autostart.blacklisted _ constants => :autostart.denylisted _ constants :autostart.blacklisted _ executables => :autostart.denylisted _ executables :autostart.blacklisted _ rake _ tasks => :autostart.denylisted _ rake _ tasks :strip _ exception _ messages.whitelist => :strip _ exception _ messages.allowed _ classes Active Record Potential issue: Disabling older Active Record versions no longer works. Solution: Change the following configuration settings: :disable _ active _ record _ 4 => :disable _ active _ record _ notifications :disable _ active _ record _ 5 => :disable _ active _ record _ notifications httpResponseCode Potential issue: The attribute httpResponseCode no longer appears in UI in the traces reported. Solution: httpResponseCode was replaced with http.statusCode. Notice Error (trace _ only) Potential issue: Passing the :trace\\_only option to NewRelic::Agent.notice\\_error no longer works. Solution: Replace :trace\\_only with the :expected attribute. Distributed Tracing APIs Potential issue: Errors are raised in application code while calling the api methods create_distributed_trace_payload and accept_distributed_trace_payload. Solution: Instead, please see insert _ distributed _ trace _ headers and accept _ distributed _ trace _ headers, respectively.",

A best effort to identify conflicting external gems that would lead to this scenario was made, but there are bound to be others out in the wild that we have not identified. In the past, we had only one way to auto-instrument for most gems and that was method-chaining. With 7.0 release, we can instrument most gems using either method-chaining or prepend and our configuration of all auto-instrumented gems has been updated to reflect this. With the modernization of our auto-instrumentation, we have also introduced new functionality in our dependency detection mechanism to identify conflicting external gems and automatically switch from prepend strategy to method-chaining. This means you no longer have to depend on the maintainers of other gems to make changes to their gem libraries in order to facilitate using the Ruby agent in conjunction with those gems. However, we are not aware of such conflicts until our users report them to us, so only a few of our auto-instrumented libraries can auto-detect these conflicts and auto-switch to method-chaining strategies. We need your help to hear about these scenarios and to add auto-detection to future Ruby agent releases. The SSL Certificate bundle is removed In the early days of Ruby (1.8, 1.9, etc.), integration with OpenSSL and making HTTPS connections was not well-handled. To ensure customers would be able to consistently make HTTPS connections to New Relic's Collector servers, a selection of SSL CA Certificates were bundled and distributed with the Ruby Agent. Over time, the Ruby ecosystem has stabilized and now supports system installed CA Certificates in a standard manner that largely obsoletes the need to bundle and distribute the certificate bundle. The vast majority of certificates bundled have expired or are nearing expiration, so we have decided to remove this dependency from the agent. If you're deploying a Ruby application and agent to a container or server that does not have CA certificates installed, you will need to ensure they're now installed for 7.0+ releases of the agent to make successful HTTPS connections to New Relic servers. For more information, see Remove cert bundle #478. Potential issue: If you're deploying to a host that does not have OpenSSL and system CA certificates installed, you may experience issues connecting to New Relic servers and experience loss of APM data. Solution: New Relic servers require HTTPS, which uses CA certificates to initiate successful connections. These may be installed, and depending on your host, in various ways. The following are helpful links for testing the readiness of your host and installing CA certificates: Troubleshooting SSL Certificate Errors Automated SSL Check Installing CA Certificates How to handle Certificates in Docker If needed, the agent can be configured to use any CA bundle by giving the path to the CA bundle file via configuration: :ca\\_bundle\\_path.

      "body": "Summary This guide covers the major changes between the 6.x and 7.x series of the Ruby agent, issues that may be encountered while upgrading, and how to migrate successfully to version 7.x. Main changes include: Support for Ruby 2.0 and 2.1 is dropped SSL Certificate Bundle is removed Several APIs that were deprecated in various 6.x releases are now removed Auto-instrumentation defaults to prepend over method chaining Auto-instrumentation gets consistent configuration attributes See the milestone for 7.0 target release for more information. Support for Ruby 2.0 and 2.1 is dropped Ruby 2.0 and 2.1 reached EOL in February 2016, and New Relic is following suit with dropping support for these versions in the 7.0 release. There are no known changes that would inherently prevent these versions from continuing to work, but we are no longer guaranteeing the Ruby agent continues to function without issues going forward. If you need Ruby 2.0 or 2.1, then continue to use 6.15.0, which is the last release published to support these Ruby versions. Prepend instrumentation configuration Relevant pull request: Prepend instrumentation #565. Potential issue: The agent fails to initialize and start reporting data. A stack level too deep error message is reported in the logs. Solution: Our configuration and dependency detection mechanism can now be controlled through configuration. By default all auto-instrumented gems/libraries are activated with the prepend strategy. The default configuration setting for these libraries in the absence of any settings appearing in the configuration file is auto, which will pick the best strategy. In the case of a known conflict with prepend strategies, auto instructs the agent to fall back to method-chaining when such conflicts are detected. Below is a complete explanation of our changes to the configuration section for auto-instrumentation using sidekiq as an example. instrumentation: sidekiq: chain Copy Tip The use case for this is when an unknown gem is found to be conflicting. The user is able to revert to method-chaining to deal with the conflict until the agent can be updated to auto-detect and handle the conflict. To disable instrumentation altogether: instrumentation: sidekiq: disable Copy In some cases, we may know specific gems conflict with prepend. To facilitate, we offer by default an auto config option, which automatically degrades to chain in such cases. The default setting in most cases is thus: instrumentation: sidekiq: auto Copy It's possible to force using prepend strategy by specifying it in the config file: instrumentation: sidekiq: prepend Copy Tip The use case for this is when a newer version of the conflicting gem is released and it's known to no longer conflict with prepend strategy. If you encounter stack level too deep errors, see our troubleshooting guide on how to resolve these issues. After working through this troubleshooting guide, you can let us know about the prepend conflict you find by commenting on this GitHub issue. We appreciate your feedback so we may detect and automatically fall back to method-chaining in such scenarios. Modernized auto-instrumentation strategy Ruby introduced prepend as a way to insert method definitions earlier into the method resolution stack in Ruby 2.0 (released in 2013) with the intent that prepend eliminates the need to do method-chaining as a means of patching original gem libraries' implementations with trace/observability logic. Mixing prepend with method-chaining (a.k.a. method _ alias monkey patching) can lead to a known stack level too deep scenario as described in our blog post on the topic. New Relic has previously updated many auto-instrumented libraries over the years to use prepend strategy. The 7.0 release makes prepend the default strategy of choice to auto-instrument over method-chaining, except when known scenarios exist that would lead to triggering stack level too deep errors. A best effort to identify conflicting external gems that would lead to this scenario was made, but there are bound to be others out in the wild that we have not identified. In the past, we had only one way to auto-instrument for most gems and that was method-chaining. With 7.0 release, we can instrument most gems using either method-chaining or prepend and our configuration of all auto-instrumented gems has been updated to reflect this. With the modernization of our auto-instrumentation, we have also introduced new functionality in our dependency detection mechanism to identify conflicting external gems and automatically switch from prepend strategy to method-chaining. This means you no longer have to depend on the maintainers of other gems to make changes to their gem libraries in order to facilitate using the Ruby agent in conjunction with those gems. However, we are not aware of such conflicts until our users report them to us, so only a few of our auto-instrumented libraries can auto-detect these conflicts and auto-switch to method-chaining strategies. We need your help to hear about these scenarios and to add auto-detection to future Ruby agent releases. The SSL Certificate bundle is removed In the early days of Ruby (1.8, 1.9, etc.), integration with OpenSSL and making HTTPS connections was not well-handled. To ensure customers would be able to consistently make HTTPS connections to New Relic's Collector servers, a selection of SSL CA Certificates were bundled and distributed with the Ruby Agent. Over time, the Ruby ecosystem has stabilized and now supports system installed CA Certificates in a standard manner that largely obsoletes the need to bundle and distribute the certificate bundle. The vast majority of certificates bundled have expired or are nearing expiration, so we have decided to remove this dependency from the agent. If you're deploying a Ruby application and agent to a container or server that does not have CA certificates installed, you will need to ensure they're now installed for 7.0+ releases of the agent to make successful HTTPS connections to New Relic servers. For more information, see Remove cert bundle #478. Potential issue: If you're deploying to a host that does not have OpenSSL and system CA certificates installed, you may experience issues connecting to New Relic servers and experience loss of APM data. Solution: New Relic servers require HTTPS, which uses CA certificates to initiate successful connections. These may be installed, and depending on your host, in various ways. The following are helpful links for testing the readiness of your host and installing CA certificates: Troubleshooting SSL Certificate Errors Automated SSL Check Installing CA Certificates How to handle Certificates in Docker If needed, the agent can be configured to use any CA bundle by giving the path to the CA bundle file via configuration: :ca\\_bundle\\_path.

      "body": "Summary This guide covers the major changes between the 6.x and 7.x series of the Ruby agent, issues that may be encountered while upgrading, and how to migrate successfully to version 7.x. Main changes include: Support for Ruby 2.0 and 2.1 is dropped SSL Certificate Bundle is removed Several APIs that were deprecated in various 6.x releases are now removed Auto-instrumentation defaults to prepend over method chaining Auto-instrumentation gets consistent configuration attributes See the milestone for 7.0 target release for more information. Support for Ruby 2.0 and 2.1 is dropped Ruby 2.0 and 2.1 reached EOL in February 2016, and New Relic is following suit with dropping support for these versions in the 7.0 release. There are no known changes that would inherently prevent these versions from continuing to work, but we are no longer guaranteeing the Ruby agent continues to function without issues going forward. If you need Ruby 2.0 or 2.1, then continue to use 6.15.0, which is the last release published to support these Ruby versions. Prepend instrumentation configuration Relevant pull request: Prepend instrumentation #565. Potential issue: The agent fails to initialize and start reporting data. A stack level too deep error message is reported in the logs. Solution: Our configuration and dependency detection mechanism can now be controlled through configuration. By default all auto-instrumented gems/libraries are activated with the prepend strategy. The default configuration setting for these libraries in the absence of any settings appearing in the configuration file is auto, which will pick the best strategy. In the case of a known conflict with prepend strategies, auto instructs the agent to fall back to method-chaining when such conflicts are detected. Below is a complete explanation of our changes to the configuration section for auto-instrumentation using sidekiq as an example. instrumentation: sidekiq: chain Copy Tip The use case for this is when an unknown gem is found to be conflicting. The user is able to revert to method-chaining to deal with the conflict until the agent can be updated to auto-detect and handle the conflict. To disable instrumentation altogether: instrumentation: sidekiq: disable Copy In some cases, we may know specific gems conflict with prepend. To facilitate, we offer by default an auto config option, which automatically degrades to chain in such cases. The default setting in most cases is thus: instrumentation: sidekiq: auto Copy It's possible to force using prepend strategy by specifying it in the config file: instrumentation: sidekiq: prepend Copy Tip The use case for this is when a newer version of the conflicting gem is released and it's known to no longer conflict with prepend strategy. If you encounter stack level too deep errors, see our troubleshooting guide on how to resolve these issues. After working through this troubleshooting guide, you can let us know about the prepend conflict you find by commenting on this GitHub issue. We appreciate your feedback so we may detect and automatically fall back to method-chaining in such scenarios. Modernized auto-instrumentation strategy Ruby introduced prepend as a way to insert method definitions earlier into the method resolution stack in Ruby 2.0 (released in 2013) with the intent that prepend eliminates the need to do method-chaining as a means of patching original gem libraries' implementations with trace/observability logic. Mixing prepend with method-chaining (a.k.a. method _ alias monkey patching) can lead to a known stack level too deep scenario as described in our blog post on the topic. New Relic has previously updated many auto-instrumented libraries over the years to use prepend strategy. The 7.0 release makes prepend the default strategy of choice to auto-instrument over method-chaining, except when known scenarios exist that would lead to triggering stack level too deep errors. A best effort to identify conflicting external gems that would lead to this scenario was made, but there are bound to be others out in the wild that we have not identified. In the past, we had only one way to auto-instrument for most gems and that was method-chaining. With 7.0 release, we can instrument most gems using either method-chaining or prepend and our configuration of all auto-instrumented gems has been updated to reflect this. With the modernization of our auto-instrumentation, we have also introduced new functionality in our dependency detection mechanism to identify conflicting external gems and automatically switch from prepend strategy to method-chaining. This means you no longer have to depend on the maintainers of other gems to make changes to their gem libraries in order to facilitate using the Ruby agent in conjunction with those gems. However, we are not aware of such conflicts until our users report them to us, so only a few of our auto-instrumented libraries can auto-detect these conflicts and auto-switch to method-chaining strategies. We need your help to hear about these scenarios and to add auto-detection to future Ruby agent releases. The SSL Certificate bundle is removed In the early days of Ruby (1.8, 1.9, etc.), integration with OpenSSL and making HTTPS connections was not well-handled. To ensure customers would be able to consistently make HTTPS connections to New Relic's Collector servers, a selection of SSL CA Certificates were bundled and distributed with the Ruby Agent. Over time, the Ruby ecosystem has stabilized and now supports system installed CA Certificates in a standard manner that largely obsoletes the need to bundle and distribute the certificate bundle. The vast majority of certificates bundled have expired or are nearing expiration, so we have decided to remove this dependency from the agent. If you're deploying a Ruby application and agent to a container or server that does not have CA certificates installed, you will need to ensure they're now installed for 7.0+ releases of the agent to make successful HTTPS connections to New Relic servers. For more information, see Remove cert bundle #478. Potential issue: If you're deploying to a host that does not have OpenSSL and system CA certificates installed, you may experience issues connecting to New Relic servers and experience loss of APM data. Solution: New Relic servers require HTTPS, which uses CA certificates to initiate successful connections. These may be installed, and depending on your host, in various ways. The following are helpful links for testing the readiness of your host and installing CA certificates: Troubleshooting SSL Certificate Errors Automated SSL Check Installing CA Certificates How to handle Certificates in Docker If needed, the agent can be configured to use any CA bundle by giving the path to the CA bundle file via configuration: :ca\\_bundle\\_path. Please see Custom SSL certificate for Ruby for more info. Deprecated API's and configuration attributes All deprecated API's have replacement API's that either expand scope and/or improve robustness of the deprecated API.

      "body": "For some types of conditions, you can define a custom violation description that passes useful information downstream for better violation responses or for use by other systems. You can create a custom violation description in the UI or with NRQL. Requirements The custom violation description feature is available for: NRQL alert conditions Infrastructure monitoring alert conditions The custom violation description field has a maximum character size of 4000. What is a custom violation description? For some types of conditions, you can create a custom violation description that passes information about a condition and its violations downstream. Using a description, you can: Capture the reason for the condition Define the signal being monitored Define next steps Add metadata to downstream systems The Custom violation description field allows you to use a general template structure that, when a violation is generated, substitutes the generic sections with specific values. For example, let's say you used this in a description: This is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tag.fullHostname}} Copy A violation resulting from this condition would fill in the details and you'd receive a notification like this: This is my condition name : My Great Alert Condition The hostname is : ip-123-45-67-89.us-west-1.compute.internal Copy Create a custom violation description In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, (select a policy), then (select a condition): Click + Add custom violation description to open the field. For a condition, you can create a custom violation description using this field. Custom violation description template example Here's a custom violation description template example: this is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tag.fullHostname}} Owning Team: {{tag.label.owning_team}} Product: {{tag.label.product}} ec2VpcId: {{tag.aws.ec2VpcId}} Service name : {{tag.label.Name}} AWS Region : {{tag.aws.awsRegion}} AWS Availability Zone: {{tag.aws.awsAvailabilityZone}} Department : {{tag.label.department}} Environment: {{tag.label.environment}} Cluster: {{tag.clusterName}} Cluster Role: {{tag.clusterRole}} EC2 Instance Type: {{tag.instanceType}} EC2 InstanceID: {{tag.aws.ec2InstanceId}} EC2 AmiId: {{tag.aws.ec2AmiId}} EC2 Root Device Type: {{tag.aws.ec2RootDeviceType}} Copy Here's how that data might appear in a notification: How to use attributes The attributes you can use in a custom violation description are a subset of attributes attached to the violation event. Here are some details about the available attributes and how to use them: Violation event attributes: For any of the standard attributes available for use in a custom violation description, use the format {{AN_ATTRIBUTE}}. For example: The target name is : {{targetName}} Copy Tag attributes: For tags, you would use the format {{tag.TAG_NAME}}. There are two types of tags: Entity-related tags: For Infrastructure conditions only. You can find available entity-related tags by going to the New Relic Explorer and looking under a service's Metadata and tags, or by viewing violation details. Here's an example of using tags in a custom violation description: The AWS region is : {{tag.aws.awsRegion}} Responsible team : {{tag.label.owning_team}} Copy Facet clause tags: For NRQL conditions only. If a NRQL condition uses a FACET clause, you can use tag formatting to use those values in your custom violation description. For example, if the NRQL query included FACET hostName, cluster, you could then use this: The host is : {{tag.hostName}} The cluster is : {{tag.cluster}} Copy Please note that tag names cannot include a whitespace. The expanded values can include a whitespace, but not the names of the tags themselves. Create a custom violation description with NRQL You can create a custom violation description using a NRQL alert condition by creating a mutation with a description. Here's an empty mutation template: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: \"YOUR_CONDITION_ID\", condition: {description: \"\"}) { YOUR_CUSTOM_VIOLATION_DESCRIPTION } } Copy Here's an example mutation with a custom violation description: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: 123456, id: \"123456\", condition: {description: \"timestamp : {{timestamp}} \\n accountId : {{accountId}} \\n type : {{type}} \\n event : {{event}} \\n description : {{description}} \\n policyId : {{policyId}} \\n policyName: {{policyName}} \\n conditionName : {{conditionName}} \\n conditionId : {{conditionId}} \\n product : {{product}} \\n conditionType : {{conditionType}} \\n RunbookUrl : {{runbookUrl}} \\n nrqlQuery : {{nrqlQuery}} \\n nrqlEventType : {{nrqlEventType}} \\n targetID : {{targetId}} \\n targetName : {{targetName}} \\n commandLine : {{tag.commandLine}} \\n entityGuid : {{tag.entityGuid}} \\n entityName : {{tag.entityName}} \\n fullHostname : {{tag.fullHostname}} \\n instanceType : {{tag.instanceType}} \\n processDisplayName : {{tag.processDisplayName}}\"}) { description } } Copy For more information on NRQL conditions and using the NerdGraph API, go to NerdGraph API: NRQL condition alerts. For Infrastructure monitoring conditions, you can create the custom violation description when creating an Infrastructure monitoring alert condition. To learn about how to structure a custom violation description, see the example template and the attribute/tag instructions. Mentioning users or notifying channel in Slack When creating a description that you know will be sent to Slack, you may wish to @mention a user or generate a channel-wide notification (e.g. @here or @channel). To achieve this, simply include the User ID or a channel-wide notification in the description surrounded by < and > characters. Here's an example for mentioning a user: Attention <@LewCirne> Copy Here's an example for generating a channel-wide notification: Attention <!channel> Copy Important Note that the Slack convention for channel-wide notifications in Incoming Webhooks is to use a ! prefix instead of @ e.g. !here or !channel For more help Recommendations for learning more: To learn more about NerdGraph, see Introduction to NerdGraph. See the alerts landing page. Browse New Relic's Explorers Hub for community discussions about Alerts. Find additional help or file a support ticket.

      "body": "A policy is a group of one or more conditions. This document explains how to create a policy and how to view existing policies. You can also use the REST API. For an explanation of how policies interact with conditions and other components, see Concepts and workflow. Tip The basic setup process is the same, regardless of which product (APM, browser, etc.) uses the policy. The types of metrics and thresholds for conditions vary depending on the monitored data source. Best practices for naming policies We recommend three common patterns and practices for structuring and naming policies: Targets or resources in your architecture that have people responsible for their well being Teams that are responsible for part of the architecture Individual policies for specific users Policies organized by... Comments Architecture Targets or resources in your organization may have different people responsible for their well-being. Common segments may include the environment type (production, staging, integration, development) or the target or resource type (app server code, client-side code, databases, hosts, etc.). To make these types of policies easier to identify, you can give them names based on your architecture. For example: Product A website (production) Product B website (staging) Mobile product app (iOS) Hosts (production) Databases (production) Teams Specific teams may be responsible for parts of your architecture. For example, you may want to name their policy Team: Site engineering, Team: Website development, etc. Individuals Policies set up for specific individuals may be useful when they want to personally keep an eye on a particular resource or metric. This provides them the freedom to add and remove conditions as well as adjust thresholds whenever they want, without having to communicate those changes to others. To make these policies easier to identify, you can include the person's name; for example, User: John Doe's metrics, User: Jane Doe (production), etc. Create an alert policy As part of the policy workflow, start by giving the policy a meaningful name: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Policies. On the policy index page, click New alert policy. Type a meaningful name for the policy (maximum 64 characters). Select the incident preference. Select Create alert policy. You can continue from here to define the conditions and assign one or more notification channels. If you decide to continue later, select the policy name from the Alert policies index. Change a policy name For your convenience, we allow you to use the same name for different policies, conditions, and notification channels. If you want to use unique names, review or search the index before adding or changing a name. To rename an existing policy: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Policies, and then (select a policy). Click the policy name to edit it, then type a meaningful name for the policy (maximum 64 characters). Alerts automatically updates any of the policy's conditions and notification channels. View existing policies The policies index lists policies in alphabetical order. To view or search for existing policies: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Policies. Use the search box, sort any column, or scroll the list. To view detailed information, click a policy name. Tip To view policy and condition information for a specific entity, select the Settings > Alert conditions page from the entity's product UI. Policy maintenance quick reference After you create a policy, you can: Add more conditions to the policy. Edit the conditions' names, targets, or thresholds. Disable conditions. Add one or more notification channels to a policy. Rename or delete the policy. The user interface shows a Last modified timestamp for any changes to policies, including their conditions and notification channels. Here is a quick reference which also includes links to more detailed information and procedures for maintaining your policies. Add or remove policies assigned to a channel To add or remove policies assigned to a channel: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Notification channels, then (select a channel). Click Alert policies, then (select a policy). From the selected policy, use the windows to select, remove, or clear all. Change a policy name To rename a policy: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, then (select a policy). Click the policy name to edit it, then type a meaningful name for the policy (maximum 64 characters). Check policy user assignment To check whether an account user has been assigned any policies: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Policies, (select a policy), then click Notification channels. Select a user, and then click Alert policies. Check policy channel assignment To check whether a notification channel has any policies assigned to it: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Notification channels. The Policy subscriptions column lists how many policies are assigned to the channel. Create a new policy To create a new alert policy: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Policies. Click New alert policy. Follow standard procedures to complete the basic setup process. Disable a policy You can't disable a policy directly. However, you can disable all of the policy's conditions. When you disable all of the conditions, the policy remains the Alert policies index. The policy itself isn't disabled, and you can re-enable any or all of its conditions at any time. Delete a policy If you delete a policy, we'll continue to apply any other policies assigned to the product entity (target). If you remove all policies for the entity, its color-coded health status indicator will appear light green with an icon. If you delete any of your account's policies, you can't restore them. Instead, you must re-create them if necessary. To delete a policy completely: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Alert policies. From the policy row, click the delete icon. Any notification channels associated with a deleted or disabled policy will remain. You must delete notification channels or remove them individually as necessary. In a deleted policy, incidents and event violations are provided as a read only resource. Check for entities (targets) assigned to a policy To check whether an entity (target) has any policies assigned: Go to the product (APM, browser, etc.). From the selected product's index, check whether the entity's color-coded health status is light green with an icon. Tip Exception: Infrastructure does not use this feature. Change how threshold violations roll up into incidents To select how violations to your thresholds are grouped into incident records (by policy, by condition, or by target and condition): In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, then (select a policy). Click Incident preference. Get context for alert violations with Incident Intelligence If you use Applied Intelligence, you can connect your conditions to Incident Intelligence. From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources and then click Alerts. Select the policies you want to connect to Applied Intelligence, and click Connect. You can add additional alerts policies or remove policies you've already connected in Sources > New Relic Alerts.",

      "body": "For some types of conditions, you can define a custom violation description that passes useful information downstream for better violation responses or for use by other systems. You can create a custom violation description in the UI or with NRQL. Requirements The custom violation description feature is available for: NRQL alert conditions Infrastructure monitoring alert conditions The custom violation description field has a maximum character size of 4000. What is a custom violation description? For some types of conditions, you can create a custom violation description that passes information about a condition and its violations downstream. Using a description, you can: Capture the reason for the condition Define the signal being monitored Define next steps Add metadata to downstream systems The Custom violation description field allows you to use a general template structure that, when a violation is generated, substitutes the generic sections with specific values. For example, let's say you used this in a description: This is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tag.fullHostname}} Copy A violation resulting from this condition would fill in the details and you'd receive a notification like this: This is my condition name : My Great Alert Condition The hostname is : ip-123-45-67-89.us-west-1.compute.internal Copy Create a custom violation description In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, (select a policy), then (select a condition): Click + Add custom violation description to open the field. For a condition, you can create a custom violation description using this field. Custom violation description template example Here's a custom violation description template example: this is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tag.fullHostname}} Owning Team: {{tag.label.owning_team}} Product: {{tag.label.product}} ec2VpcId: {{tag.aws.ec2VpcId}} Service name : {{tag.label.Name}} AWS Region : {{tag.aws.awsRegion}} AWS Availability Zone: {{tag.aws.awsAvailabilityZone}} Department : {{tag.label.department}} Environment: {{tag.label.environment}} Cluster: {{tag.clusterName}} Cluster Role: {{tag.clusterRole}} EC2 Instance Type: {{tag.instanceType}} EC2 InstanceID: {{tag.aws.ec2InstanceId}} EC2 AmiId: {{tag.aws.ec2AmiId}} EC2 Root Device Type: {{tag.aws.ec2RootDeviceType}} Copy Here's how that data might appear in a notification: How to use attributes The attributes you can use in a custom violation description are a subset of attributes attached to the violation event. Here are some details about the available attributes and how to use them: Violation event attributes: For any of the standard attributes available for use in a custom violation description, use the format {{AN_ATTRIBUTE}}. For example: The target name is : {{targetName}} Copy Tag attributes: For tags, you would use the format {{tag.TAG_NAME}}. There are two types of tags: Entity-related tags: For Infrastructure conditions only. You can find available entity-related tags by going to the New Relic Explorer and looking under a service's Metadata and tags, or by viewing violation details. Here's an example of using tags in a custom violation description: The AWS region is : {{tag.aws.awsRegion}} Responsible team : {{tag.label.owning_team}} Copy Facet clause tags: For NRQL conditions only. If a NRQL condition uses a FACET clause, you can use tag formatting to use those values in your custom violation description. For example, if the NRQL query included FACET hostName, cluster, you could then use this: The host is : {{tag.hostName}} The cluster is : {{tag.cluster}} Copy Please note that tag names cannot include a whitespace. The expanded values can include a whitespace, but not the names of the tags themselves. Create a custom violation description with NRQL You can create a custom violation description using a NRQL alert condition by creating a mutation with a description. Here's an empty mutation template: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: \"YOUR_CONDITION_ID\", condition: {description: \"\"}) { YOUR_CUSTOM_VIOLATION_DESCRIPTION } } Copy Here's an example mutation with a custom violation description: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: 123456, id: \"123456\", condition: {description: \"timestamp : {{timestamp}} \\n accountId : {{accountId}} \\n type : {{type}} \\n event : {{event}} \\n description : {{description}} \\n policyId : {{policyId}} \\n policyName: {{policyName}} \\n conditionName : {{conditionName}} \\n conditionId : {{conditionId}} \\n product : {{product}} \\n conditionType : {{conditionType}} \\n RunbookUrl : {{runbookUrl}} \\n nrqlQuery : {{nrqlQuery}} \\n nrqlEventType : {{nrqlEventType}} \\n targetID : {{targetId}} \\n targetName : {{targetName}} \\n commandLine : {{tag.commandLine}} \\n entityGuid : {{tag.entityGuid}} \\n entityName : {{tag.entityName}} \\n fullHostname : {{tag.fullHostname}} \\n instanceType : {{tag.instanceType}} \\n processDisplayName : {{tag.processDisplayName}}\"}) { description } } Copy For more information on NRQL conditions and using the NerdGraph API, go to NerdGraph API: NRQL condition alerts. For Infrastructure monitoring conditions, you can create the custom violation description when creating an Infrastructure monitoring alert condition. To learn about how to structure a custom violation description, see the example template and the attribute/tag instructions. Mentioning users or notifying channel in Slack When creating a description that you know will be sent to Slack, you may wish to @mention a user or generate a channel-wide notification (e.g. @here or @channel). To achieve this, simply include the User ID or a channel-wide notification in the description surrounded by < and > characters. Here's an example for mentioning a user: Attention <@LewCirne> Copy Here's an example for generating a channel-wide notification: Attention <!channel> Copy Important Note that the Slack convention for channel-wide notifications in Incoming Webhooks is to use a ! prefix instead of @ e.g. !here or !channel For more help Recommendations for learning more: To learn more about NerdGraph, see Introduction to NerdGraph. See the alerts landing page. Browse New Relic's Explorers Hub for community discussions about Alerts. Find additional help or file a support ticket.

      "body": "A policy is a group of one or more conditions. This document explains how to create a policy and how to view existing policies. You can also use the REST API. For an explanation of how policies interact with conditions and other components, see Concepts and workflow. Tip The basic setup process is the same, regardless of which product (APM, browser, etc.) uses the policy. The types of metrics and thresholds for conditions vary depending on the monitored data source. Best practices for naming policies We recommend three common patterns and practices for structuring and naming policies: Targets or resources in your architecture that have people responsible for their well being Teams that are responsible for part of the architecture Individual policies for specific users Policies organized by... Comments Architecture Targets or resources in your organization may have different people responsible for their well-being. Common segments may include the environment type (production, staging, integration, development) or the target or resource type (app server code, client-side code, databases, hosts, etc.). To make these types of policies easier to identify, you can give them names based on your architecture. For example: Product A website (production) Product B website (staging) Mobile product app (iOS) Hosts (production) Databases (production) Teams Specific teams may be responsible for parts of your architecture. For example, you may want to name their policy Team: Site engineering, Team: Website development, etc. Individuals Policies set up for specific individuals may be useful when they want to personally keep an eye on a particular resource or metric. This provides them the freedom to add and remove conditions as well as adjust thresholds whenever they want, without having to communicate those changes to others. To make these policies easier to identify, you can include the person's name; for example, User: John Doe's metrics, User: Jane Doe (production), etc. Create an alert policy As part of the policy workflow, start by giving the policy a meaningful name: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Policies. On the policy index page, click New alert policy. Type a meaningful name for the policy (maximum 64 characters). Select the incident preference. Select Create alert policy. You can continue from here to define the conditions and assign one or more notification channels. If you decide to continue later, select the policy name from the Alert policies index. Change a policy name For your convenience, we allow you to use the same name for different policies, conditions, and notification channels. If you want to use unique names, review or search the index before adding or changing a name. To rename an existing policy: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Policies, and then (select a policy). Click the policy name to edit it, then type a meaningful name for the policy (maximum 64 characters). Alerts automatically updates any of the policy's conditions and notification channels. View existing policies The policies index lists policies in alphabetical order. To view or search for existing policies: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Policies. Use the search box, sort any column, or scroll the list. To view detailed information, click a policy name. Tip To view policy and condition information for a specific entity, select the Settings > Alert conditions page from the entity's product UI. Policy maintenance quick reference After you create a policy, you can: Add more conditions to the policy. Edit the conditions' names, targets, or thresholds. Disable conditions. Add one or more notification channels to a policy. Rename or delete the policy. The user interface shows a Last modified timestamp for any changes to policies, including their conditions and notification channels. Here is a quick reference which also includes links to more detailed information and procedures for maintaining your policies. Add or remove policies assigned to a channel To add or remove policies assigned to a channel: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Notification channels, then (select a channel). Click Alert policies, then (select a policy). From the selected policy, use the windows to select, remove, or clear all. Change a policy name To rename a policy: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, then (select a policy). Click the policy name to edit it, then type a meaningful name for the policy (maximum 64 characters). Check policy user assignment To check whether an account user has been assigned any policies: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Policies, (select a policy), then click Notification channels. Select a user, and then click Alert policies. Check policy channel assignment To check whether a notification channel has any policies assigned to it: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Notification channels. The Policy subscriptions column lists how many policies are assigned to the channel. Create a new policy To create a new alert policy: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Policies. Click New alert policy. Follow standard procedures to complete the basic setup process. Disable a policy You can't disable a policy directly. However, you can disable all of the policy's conditions. When you disable all of the conditions, the policy remains the Alert policies index. The policy itself isn't disabled, and you can re-enable any or all of its conditions at any time. Delete a policy If you delete a policy, we'll continue to apply any other policies assigned to the product entity (target). If you remove all policies for the entity, its color-coded health status indicator will appear light green with an icon. If you delete any of your account's policies, you can't restore them. Instead, you must re-create them if necessary. To delete a policy completely: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Alert policies. From the policy row, click the delete icon. Any notification channels associated with a deleted or disabled policy will remain. You must delete notification channels or remove them individually as necessary. In a deleted policy, incidents and event violations are provided as a read only resource. Check for entities (targets) assigned to a policy To check whether an entity (target) has any policies assigned: Go to the product (APM, browser, etc.). From the selected product's index, check whether the entity's color-coded health status is light green with an icon. Tip Exception: Infrastructure does not use this feature. Change how threshold violations roll up into incidents To select how violations to your thresholds are grouped into incident records (by policy, by condition, or by target and condition): In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, then (select a policy). Click Incident preference. Get context for alert violations with Incident Intelligence If you use Applied Intelligence, you can connect your conditions to Incident Intelligence. From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources and then click Alerts. Select the policies you want to connect to Applied Intelligence, and click Connect. You can add additional alerts policies or remove policies you've already connected in Sources > New Relic Alerts.",

      "body": "For some types of conditions, you can define a custom violation description that passes useful information downstream for better violation responses or for use by other systems. You can create a custom violation description in the UI or with NRQL. Requirements The custom violation description feature is available for: NRQL alert conditions Infrastructure monitoring alert conditions The custom violation description field has a maximum character size of 4000. What is a custom violation description? For some types of conditions, you can create a custom violation description that passes information about a condition and its violations downstream. Using a description, you can: Capture the reason for the condition Define the signal being monitored Define next steps Add metadata to downstream systems The Custom violation description field allows you to use a general template structure that, when a violation is generated, substitutes the generic sections with specific values. For example, let's say you used this in a description: This is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tag.fullHostname}} Copy A violation resulting from this condition would fill in the details and you'd receive a notification like this: This is my condition name : My Great Alert Condition The hostname is : ip-123-45-67-89.us-west-1.compute.internal Copy Create a custom violation description In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, (select a policy), then (select a condition): Click + Add custom violation description to open the field. For a condition, you can create a custom violation description using this field. Custom violation description template example Here's a custom violation description template example: this is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tag.fullHostname}} Owning Team: {{tag.label.owning_team}} Product: {{tag.label.product}} ec2VpcId: {{tag.aws.ec2VpcId}} Service name : {{tag.label.Name}} AWS Region : {{tag.aws.awsRegion}} AWS Availability Zone: {{tag.aws.awsAvailabilityZone}} Department : {{tag.label.department}} Environment: {{tag.label.environment}} Cluster: {{tag.clusterName}} Cluster Role: {{tag.clusterRole}} EC2 Instance Type: {{tag.instanceType}} EC2 InstanceID: {{tag.aws.ec2InstanceId}} EC2 AmiId: {{tag.aws.ec2AmiId}} EC2 Root Device Type: {{tag.aws.ec2RootDeviceType}} Copy Here's how that data might appear in a notification: How to use attributes The attributes you can use in a custom violation description are a subset of attributes attached to the violation event. Here are some details about the available attributes and how to use them: Violation event attributes: For any of the standard attributes available for use in a custom violation description, use the format {{AN_ATTRIBUTE}}. For example: The target name is : {{targetName}} Copy Tag attributes: For tags, you would use the format {{tag.TAG_NAME}}. There are two types of tags: Entity-related tags: For Infrastructure conditions only. You can find available entity-related tags by going to the New Relic Explorer and looking under a service's Metadata and tags, or by viewing violation details. Here's an example of using tags in a custom violation description: The AWS region is : {{tag.aws.awsRegion}} Responsible team : {{tag.label.owning_team}} Copy Facet clause tags: For NRQL conditions only. If a NRQL condition uses a FACET clause, you can use tag formatting to use those values in your custom violation description. For example, if the NRQL query included FACET hostName, cluster, you could then use this: The host is : {{tag.hostName}} The cluster is : {{tag.cluster}} Copy Please note that tag names cannot include a whitespace. The expanded values can include a whitespace, but not the names of the tags themselves. Create a custom violation description with NRQL You can create a custom violation description using a NRQL alert condition by creating a mutation with a description. Here's an empty mutation template: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: \"YOUR_CONDITION_ID\", condition: {description: \"\"}) { YOUR_CUSTOM_VIOLATION_DESCRIPTION } } Copy Here's an example mutation with a custom violation description: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: 123456, id: \"123456\", condition: {description: \"timestamp : {{timestamp}} \\n accountId : {{accountId}} \\n type : {{type}} \\n event : {{event}} \\n description : {{description}} \\n policyId : {{policyId}} \\n policyName: {{policyName}} \\n conditionName : {{conditionName}} \\n conditionId : {{conditionId}} \\n product : {{product}} \\n conditionType : {{conditionType}} \\n RunbookUrl : {{runbookUrl}} \\n nrqlQuery : {{nrqlQuery}} \\n nrqlEventType : {{nrqlEventType}} \\n targetID : {{targetId}} \\n targetName : {{targetName}} \\n commandLine : {{tag.commandLine}} \\n entityGuid : {{tag.entityGuid}} \\n entityName : {{tag.entityName}} \\n fullHostname : {{tag.fullHostname}} \\n instanceType : {{tag.instanceType}} \\n processDisplayName : {{tag.processDisplayName}}\"}) { description } } Copy For more information on NRQL conditions and using the NerdGraph API, go to NerdGraph API: NRQL condition alerts. For Infrastructure monitoring conditions, you can create the custom violation description when creating an Infrastructure monitoring alert condition. To learn about how to structure a custom violation description, see the example template and the attribute/tag instructions. Mentioning users or notifying channel in Slack When creating a description that you know will be sent to Slack, you may wish to @mention a user or generate a channel-wide notification (e.g. @here or @channel). To achieve this, simply include the User ID or a channel-wide notification in the description surrounded by < and > characters. Here's an example for mentioning a user: Attention <@LewCirne> Copy Here's an example for generating a channel-wide notification: Attention <!channel> Copy Important Note that the Slack convention for channel-wide notifications in Incoming Webhooks is to use a ! prefix instead of @ e.g. !here or !channel For more help Recommendations for learning more: To learn more about NerdGraph, see Introduction to NerdGraph. See the alerts landing page. Browse New Relic's Explorers Hub for community discussions about Alerts. Find additional help or file a support ticket.

      "body": "A policy is a group of one or more conditions. This document explains how to create a policy and how to view existing policies. You can also use the REST API. For an explanation of how policies interact with conditions and other components, see Concepts and workflow. Tip The basic setup process is the same, regardless of which product (APM, browser, etc.) uses the policy. The types of metrics and thresholds for conditions vary depending on the monitored data source. Best practices for naming policies We recommend three common patterns and practices for structuring and naming policies: Targets or resources in your architecture that have people responsible for their well being Teams that are responsible for part of the architecture Individual policies for specific users Policies organized by... Comments Architecture Targets or resources in your organization may have different people responsible for their well-being. Common segments may include the environment type (production, staging, integration, development) or the target or resource type (app server code, client-side code, databases, hosts, etc.). To make these types of policies easier to identify, you can give them names based on your architecture. For example: Product A website (production) Product B website (staging) Mobile product app (iOS) Hosts (production) Databases (production) Teams Specific teams may be responsible for parts of your architecture. For example, you may want to name their policy Team: Site engineering, Team: Website development, etc. Individuals Policies set up for specific individuals may be useful when they want to personally keep an eye on a particular resource or metric. This provides them the freedom to add and remove conditions as well as adjust thresholds whenever they want, without having to communicate those changes to others. To make these policies easier to identify, you can include the person's name; for example, User: John Doe's metrics, User: Jane Doe (production), etc. Create an alert policy As part of the policy workflow, start by giving the policy a meaningful name: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Policies. On the policy index page, click New alert policy. Type a meaningful name for the policy (maximum 64 characters). Select the incident preference. Select Create alert policy. You can continue from here to define the conditions and assign one or more notification channels. If you decide to continue later, select the policy name from the Alert policies index. Change a policy name For your convenience, we allow you to use the same name for different policies, conditions, and notification channels. If you want to use unique names, review or search the index before adding or changing a name. To rename an existing policy: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Policies, and then (select a policy). Click the policy name to edit it, then type a meaningful name for the policy (maximum 64 characters). Alerts automatically updates any of the policy's conditions and notification channels. View existing policies The policies index lists policies in alphabetical order. To view or search for existing policies: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Policies. Use the search box, sort any column, or scroll the list. To view detailed information, click a policy name. Tip To view policy and condition information for a specific entity, select the Settings > Alert conditions page from the entity's product UI. Policy maintenance quick reference After you create a policy, you can: Add more conditions to the policy. Edit the conditions' names, targets, or thresholds. Disable conditions. Add one or more notification channels to a policy. Rename or delete the policy. The user interface shows a Last modified timestamp for any changes to policies, including their conditions and notification channels. Here is a quick reference which also includes links to more detailed information and procedures for maintaining your policies. Add or remove policies assigned to a channel To add or remove policies assigned to a channel: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Notification channels, then (select a channel). Click Alert policies, then (select a policy). From the selected policy, use the windows to select, remove, or clear all. Change a policy name To rename a policy: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, then (select a policy). Click the policy name to edit it, then type a meaningful name for the policy (maximum 64 characters). Check policy user assignment To check whether an account user has been assigned any policies: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Policies, (select a policy), then click Notification channels. Select a user, and then click Alert policies. Check policy channel assignment To check whether a notification channel has any policies assigned to it: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Notification channels. The Policy subscriptions column lists how many policies are assigned to the channel. Create a new policy To create a new alert policy: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Policies. Click New alert policy. Follow standard procedures to complete the basic setup process. Disable a policy You can't disable a policy directly. However, you can disable all of the policy's conditions. When you disable all of the conditions, the policy remains the Alert policies index. The policy itself isn't disabled, and you can re-enable any or all of its conditions at any time. Delete a policy If you delete a policy, we'll continue to apply any other policies assigned to the product entity (target). If you remove all policies for the entity, its color-coded health status indicator will appear light green with an icon. If you delete any of your account's policies, you can't restore them. Instead, you must re-create them if necessary. To delete a policy completely: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Alert policies. From the policy row, click the delete icon. Any notification channels associated with a deleted or disabled policy will remain. You must delete notification channels or remove them individually as necessary. In a deleted policy, incidents and event violations are provided as a read only resource. Check for entities (targets) assigned to a policy To check whether an entity (target) has any policies assigned: Go to the product (APM, browser, etc.). From the selected product's index, check whether the entity's color-coded health status is light green with an icon. Tip Exception: Infrastructure does not use this feature. Change how threshold violations roll up into incidents To select how violations to your thresholds are grouped into incident records (by policy, by condition, or by target and condition): In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, then (select a policy). Click Incident preference. Get context for alert violations with Incident Intelligence If you use Applied Intelligence, you can connect your conditions to Incident Intelligence. From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources and then click Alerts. Select the policies you want to connect to Applied Intelligence, and click Connect. You can add additional alerts policies or remove policies you've already connected in Sources > New Relic Alerts.",

Custom violation description template example Here's a custom violation description template example: this is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tag.fullHostname}} Owning Team: {{tag.label.owning_team}} Product: {{tag.label.product}} ec2VpcId: {{tag.aws.ec2VpcId}} Service name : {{tag.label.Name}} AWS Region : {{tag.aws.awsRegion}} AWS Availability Zone: {{tag.aws.awsAvailabilityZone}} Department : {{tag.label.department}} Environment: {{tag.label.environment}} Cluster: {{tag.clusterName}} Cluster Role: {{tag.clusterRole}} EC2 Instance Type: {{tag.instanceType}} EC2 InstanceID: {{tag.aws.ec2InstanceId}} EC2 AmiId: {{tag.aws.ec2AmiId}} EC2 Root Device Type: {{tag.aws.ec2RootDeviceType}} Copy Here's how that data might appear in a notification: How to use attributes The attributes you can use in a custom violation description are a subset of attributes attached to the violation event. Here are some details about the available attributes and how to use them: Violation event attributes: For any of the standard attributes available for use in a custom violation description, use the format {{AN_ATTRIBUTE}}. For example: The target name is : {{targetName}} Copy Tag attributes: For tags, you would use the format {{tag.TAG_NAME}}. There are two types of tags: Entity-related tags: For Infrastructure conditions only. You can find available entity-related tags by going to the New Relic Explorer and looking under a service's Metadata and tags, or by viewing violation details. Here's an example of using tags in a custom violation description: The AWS region is : {{tag.aws.awsRegion}} Responsible team : {{tag.label.owning_team}} Copy Facet clause tags: For NRQL conditions only. If a NRQL condition uses a FACET clause, you can use tag formatting to use those values in your custom violation description. For example, if the NRQL query included FACET hostName, cluster, you could then use this: The host is : {{tag.hostName}} The cluster is : {{tag.cluster}} Copy Please note that tag names cannot include a whitespace. The expanded values can include a whitespace, but not the names of the tags themselves. Create a custom violation description with NRQL You can create a custom violation description using a NRQL alert condition by creating a mutation with a description. Here's an empty mutation template: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: \"YOUR_CONDITION_ID\", condition: {description: \"\"}) { YOUR_CUSTOM_VIOLATION_DESCRIPTION } } Copy Here's an example mutation with a custom violation description: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: 123456, id: \"123456\", condition: {description: \"timestamp : {{timestamp}} \\n accountId : {{accountId}} \\n type : {{type}} \\n event : {{event}} \\n description : {{description}} \\n policyId : {{policyId}} \\n policyName: {{policyName}} \\n conditionName : {{conditionName}} \\n conditionId : {{conditionId}} \\n product : {{product}} \\n conditionType : {{conditionType}} \\n RunbookUrl : {{runbookUrl}} \\n nrqlQuery : {{nrqlQuery}} \\n nrqlEventType : {{nrqlEventType}} \\n targetID : {{targetId}} \\n targetName : {{targetName}} \\n commandLine : {{tag.commandLine}} \\n entityGuid : {{tag.entityGuid}} \\n entityName : {{tag.entityName}} \\n fullHostname : {{tag.fullHostname}} \\n instanceType : {{tag.instanceType}} \\n processDisplayName : {{tag.processDisplayName}}\"}) { description } } Copy For more information on NRQL conditions and using the NerdGraph API, go to NerdGraph API: NRQL condition alerts. For Infrastructure monitoring conditions, you can create the custom violation description when creating an Infrastructure monitoring alert condition. To learn about how to structure a custom violation description, see the example template and the attribute/tag instructions. Mentioning users or notifying channel in Slack When creating a description that you know will be sent to Slack, you may wish to @mention a user or generate a channel-wide notification (e.g. @here or @channel). To achieve this, simply include the User ID or a channel-wide notification in the description surrounded by < and > characters. Here's an example for mentioning a user: Attention <@LewCirne> Copy Here's an example for generating a channel-wide notification: Attention <!channel> Copy Important Note that the Slack convention for channel-wide notifications in Incoming Webhooks is to use a ! prefix instead of @ e.g. !here or !channel For more help Recommendations for learning more: To learn more about NerdGraph, see Introduction to NerdGraph.

      "body": "A policy is a group of one or more conditions. This document explains how to create a policy and how to view existing policies. You can also use the REST API. For an explanation of how policies interact with conditions and other components, see Concepts and workflow. Tip The basic setup process is the same, regardless of which product (APM, browser, etc.) uses the policy. The types of metrics and thresholds for conditions vary depending on the monitored data source. Best practices for naming policies We recommend three common patterns and practices for structuring and naming policies: Targets or resources in your architecture that have people responsible for their well being Teams that are responsible for part of the architecture Individual policies for specific users Policies organized by... Comments Architecture Targets or resources in your organization may have different people responsible for their well-being. Common segments may include the environment type (production, staging, integration, development) or the target or resource type (app server code, client-side code, databases, hosts, etc.). To make these types of policies easier to identify, you can give them names based on your architecture. For example: Product A website (production) Product B website (staging) Mobile product app (iOS) Hosts (production) Databases (production) Teams Specific teams may be responsible for parts of your architecture. For example, you may want to name their policy Team: Site engineering, Team: Website development, etc. Individuals Policies set up for specific individuals may be useful when they want to personally keep an eye on a particular resource or metric. This provides them the freedom to add and remove conditions as well as adjust thresholds whenever they want, without having to communicate those changes to others. To make these policies easier to identify, you can include the person's name; for example, User: John Doe's metrics, User: Jane Doe (production), etc. Create an alert policy As part of the policy workflow, start by giving the policy a meaningful name: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Policies. On the policy index page, click New alert policy. Type a meaningful name for the policy (maximum 64 characters). Select the incident preference. Select Create alert policy. You can continue from here to define the conditions and assign one or more notification channels. If you decide to continue later, select the policy name from the Alert policies index. Change a policy name For your convenience, we allow you to use the same name for different policies, conditions, and notification channels. If you want to use unique names, review or search the index before adding or changing a name. To rename an existing policy: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Policies, and then (select a policy). Click the policy name to edit it, then type a meaningful name for the policy (maximum 64 characters). Alerts automatically updates any of the policy's conditions and notification channels. View existing policies The policies index lists policies in alphabetical order. To view or search for existing policies: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Policies. Use the search box, sort any column, or scroll the list. To view detailed information, click a policy name. Tip To view policy and condition information for a specific entity, select the Settings > Alert conditions page from the entity's product UI. Policy maintenance quick reference After you create a policy, you can: Add more conditions to the policy. Edit the conditions' names, targets, or thresholds. Disable conditions. Add one or more notification channels to a policy. Rename or delete the policy. The user interface shows a Last modified timestamp for any changes to policies, including their conditions and notification channels. Here is a quick reference which also includes links to more detailed information and procedures for maintaining your policies. Add or remove policies assigned to a channel To add or remove policies assigned to a channel: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Notification channels, then (select a channel). Click Alert policies, then (select a policy). From the selected policy, use the windows to select, remove, or clear all. Change a policy name To rename a policy: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, then (select a policy). Click the policy name to edit it, then type a meaningful name for the policy (maximum 64 characters). Check policy user assignment To check whether an account user has been assigned any policies: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Policies, (select a policy), then click Notification channels. Select a user, and then click Alert policies. Check policy channel assignment To check whether a notification channel has any policies assigned to it: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Notification channels. The Policy subscriptions column lists how many policies are assigned to the channel. Create a new policy To create a new alert policy: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Policies. Click New alert policy. Follow standard procedures to complete the basic setup process. Disable a policy You can't disable a policy directly. However, you can disable all of the policy's conditions. When you disable all of the conditions, the policy remains the Alert policies index. The policy itself isn't disabled, and you can re-enable any or all of its conditions at any time. Delete a policy If you delete a policy, we'll continue to apply any other policies assigned to the product entity (target). If you remove all policies for the entity, its color-coded health status indicator will appear light green with an icon. If you delete any of your account's policies, you can't restore them. Instead, you must re-create them if necessary. To delete a policy completely: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Alert policies. From the policy row, click the delete icon. Any notification channels associated with a deleted or disabled policy will remain. You must delete notification channels or remove them individually as necessary. In a deleted policy, incidents and event violations are provided as a read only resource. Check for entities (targets) assigned to a policy To check whether an entity (target) has any policies assigned: Go to the product (APM, browser, etc.). From the selected product's index, check whether the entity's color-coded health status is light green with an icon. Tip Exception: Infrastructure does not use this feature. Change how threshold violations roll up into incidents To select how violations to your thresholds are grouped into incident records (by policy, by condition, or by target and condition): In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, then (select a policy). Click Incident preference. Get context for alert violations with Incident Intelligence If you use Applied Intelligence, you can connect your conditions to Incident Intelligence. From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources and then click Alerts. Select the policies you want to connect to Applied Intelligence, and click Connect. You can add additional alerts policies or remove policies you've already connected in Sources > New Relic Alerts.",

      "body": "For some types of conditions, you can define a custom violation description that passes useful information downstream for better violation responses or for use by other systems. You can create a custom violation description in the UI or with NRQL. Requirements The custom violation description feature is available for: NRQL alert conditions Infrastructure monitoring alert conditions The custom violation description field has a maximum character size of 4000. What is a custom violation description? For some types of conditions, you can create a custom violation description that passes information about a condition and its violations downstream. Using a description, you can: Capture the reason for the condition Define the signal being monitored Define next steps Add metadata to downstream systems The Custom violation description field allows you to use a general template structure that, when a violation is generated, substitutes the generic sections with specific values. For example, let's say you used this in a description: This is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tag.fullHostname}} Copy A violation resulting from this condition would fill in the details and you'd receive a notification like this: This is my condition name : My Great Alert Condition The hostname is : ip-123-45-67-89.us-west-1.compute.internal Copy Create a custom violation description In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, (select a policy), then (select a condition): Click + Add custom violation description to open the field.

Here are some details about the available attributes and how to use them: Violation event attributes: For any of the standard attributes available for use in a custom violation description, use the format {{AN_ATTRIBUTE}}. For example: The target name is : {{targetName}} Copy Tag attributes: For tags, you would use the format {{tag.TAG_NAME}}. There are two types of tags: Entity-related tags: For Infrastructure conditions only. You can find available entity-related tags by going to the New Relic Explorer and looking under a service's Metadata and tags, or by viewing violation details. Here's an example of using tags in a custom violation description: The AWS region is : {{tag.aws.awsRegion}} Responsible team : {{tag.label.owning_team}} Copy Facet clause tags: For NRQL conditions only. If a NRQL condition uses a FACET clause, you can use tag formatting to use those values in your custom violation description. For example, if the NRQL query included FACET hostName, cluster, you could then use this: The host is : {{tag.hostName}} The cluster is : {{tag.cluster}} Copy Please note that tag names cannot include a whitespace. The expanded values can include a whitespace, but not the names of the tags themselves. Create a custom violation description with NRQL You can create a custom violation description using a NRQL alert condition by creating a mutation with a description.

      "body": "A policy is a group of one or more conditions. This document explains how to create a policy and how to view existing policies. You can also use the REST API. For an explanation of how policies interact with conditions and other components, see Concepts and workflow. Tip The basic setup process is the same, regardless of which product (APM, browser, etc.) uses the policy. The types of metrics and thresholds for conditions vary depending on the monitored data source. Best practices for naming policies We recommend three common patterns and practices for structuring and naming policies: Targets or resources in your architecture that have people responsible for their well being Teams that are responsible for part of the architecture Individual policies for specific users Policies organized by... Comments Architecture Targets or resources in your organization may have different people responsible for their well-being. Common segments may include the environment type (production, staging, integration, development) or the target or resource type (app server code, client-side code, databases, hosts, etc.). To make these types of policies easier to identify, you can give them names based on your architecture. For example: Product A website (production) Product B website (staging) Mobile product app (iOS) Hosts (production) Databases (production) Teams Specific teams may be responsible for parts of your architecture. For example, you may want to name their policy Team: Site engineering, Team: Website development, etc. Individuals Policies set up for specific individuals may be useful when they want to personally keep an eye on a particular resource or metric. This provides them the freedom to add and remove conditions as well as adjust thresholds whenever they want, without having to communicate those changes to others. To make these policies easier to identify, you can include the person's name; for example, User: John Doe's metrics, User: Jane Doe (production), etc. Create an alert policy As part of the policy workflow, start by giving the policy a meaningful name: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Policies. On the policy index page, click New alert policy. Type a meaningful name for the policy (maximum 64 characters). Select the incident preference. Select Create alert policy. You can continue from here to define the conditions and assign one or more notification channels. If you decide to continue later, select the policy name from the Alert policies index. Change a policy name For your convenience, we allow you to use the same name for different policies, conditions, and notification channels. If you want to use unique names, review or search the index before adding or changing a name. To rename an existing policy: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Policies, and then (select a policy). Click the policy name to edit it, then type a meaningful name for the policy (maximum 64 characters). Alerts automatically updates any of the policy's conditions and notification channels. View existing policies The policies index lists policies in alphabetical order. To view or search for existing policies: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Policies. Use the search box, sort any column, or scroll the list. To view detailed information, click a policy name. Tip To view policy and condition information for a specific entity, select the Settings > Alert conditions page from the entity's product UI. Policy maintenance quick reference After you create a policy, you can: Add more conditions to the policy. Edit the conditions' names, targets, or thresholds. Disable conditions. Add one or more notification channels to a policy. Rename or delete the policy. The user interface shows a Last modified timestamp for any changes to policies, including their conditions and notification channels. Here is a quick reference which also includes links to more detailed information and procedures for maintaining your policies. Add or remove policies assigned to a channel To add or remove policies assigned to a channel: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Notification channels, then (select a channel). Click Alert policies, then (select a policy). From the selected policy, use the windows to select, remove, or clear all. Change a policy name To rename a policy: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, then (select a policy). Click the policy name to edit it, then type a meaningful name for the policy (maximum 64 characters). Check policy user assignment To check whether an account user has been assigned any policies: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Policies, (select a policy), then click Notification channels. Select a user, and then click Alert policies. Check policy channel assignment To check whether a notification channel has any policies assigned to it: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Notification channels. The Policy subscriptions column lists how many policies are assigned to the channel. Create a new policy To create a new alert policy: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Policies. Click New alert policy. Follow standard procedures to complete the basic setup process. Disable a policy You can't disable a policy directly. However, you can disable all of the policy's conditions. When you disable all of the conditions, the policy remains the Alert policies index. The policy itself isn't disabled, and you can re-enable any or all of its conditions at any time. Delete a policy If you delete a policy, we'll continue to apply any other policies assigned to the product entity (target). If you remove all policies for the entity, its color-coded health status indicator will appear light green with an icon. If you delete any of your account's policies, you can't restore them. Instead, you must re-create them if necessary. To delete a policy completely: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Alert policies. From the policy row, click the delete icon. Any notification channels associated with a deleted or disabled policy will remain. You must delete notification channels or remove them individually as necessary. In a deleted policy, incidents and event violations are provided as a read only resource. Check for entities (targets) assigned to a policy To check whether an entity (target) has any policies assigned: Go to the product (APM, browser, etc.). From the selected product's index, check whether the entity's color-coded health status is light green with an icon. Tip Exception: Infrastructure does not use this feature. Change how threshold violations roll up into incidents To select how violations to your thresholds are grouped into incident records (by policy, by condition, or by target and condition): In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, then (select a policy). Click Incident preference. Get context for alert violations with Incident Intelligence If you use Applied Intelligence, you can connect your conditions to Incident Intelligence. From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources and then click Alerts. Select the policies you want to connect to Applied Intelligence, and click Connect. You can add additional alerts policies or remove policies you've already connected in Sources > New Relic Alerts.",

      "body": "For some types of conditions, you can define a custom violation description that passes useful information downstream for better violation responses or for use by other systems. You can create a custom violation description in the UI or with NRQL. Requirements The custom violation description feature is available for: NRQL alert conditions Infrastructure monitoring alert conditions The custom violation description field has a maximum character size of 4000. What is a custom violation description? For some types of conditions, you can create a custom violation description that passes information about a condition and its violations downstream. Using a description, you can: Capture the reason for the condition Define the signal being monitored Define next steps Add metadata to downstream systems The Custom violation description field allows you to use a general template structure that, when a violation is generated, substitutes the generic sections with specific values. For example, let's say you used this in a description: This is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tag.fullHostname}} Copy A violation resulting from this condition would fill in the details and you'd receive a notification like this: This is my condition name : My Great Alert Condition The hostname is : ip-123-45-67-89.us-west-1.compute.internal Copy Create a custom violation description In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, (select a policy), then (select a condition): Click + Add custom violation description to open the field. For a condition, you can create a custom violation description using this field. Custom violation description template example Here's a custom violation description template example: this is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tag.fullHostname}} Owning Team: {{tag.label.owning_team}} Product: {{tag.label.product}} ec2VpcId: {{tag.aws.ec2VpcId}} Service name : {{tag.label.Name}} AWS Region : {{tag.aws.awsRegion}} AWS Availability Zone: {{tag.aws.awsAvailabilityZone}} Department : {{tag.label.department}} Environment: {{tag.label.environment}} Cluster: {{tag.clusterName}} Cluster Role: {{tag.clusterRole}} EC2 Instance Type: {{tag.instanceType}} EC2 InstanceID: {{tag.aws.ec2InstanceId}} EC2 AmiId: {{tag.aws.ec2AmiId}} EC2 Root Device Type: {{tag.aws.ec2RootDeviceType}} Copy Here's how that data might appear in a notification: How to use attributes The attributes you can use in a custom violation description are a subset of attributes attached to the violation event. Here are some details about the available attributes and how to use them: Violation event attributes: For any of the standard attributes available for use in a custom violation description, use the format {{AN_ATTRIBUTE}}. For example: The target name is : {{targetName}} Copy Tag attributes: For tags, you would use the format {{tag.TAG_NAME}}. There are two types of tags: Entity-related tags: For Infrastructure conditions only. You can find available entity-related tags by going to the New Relic Explorer and looking under a service's Metadata and tags, or by viewing violation details. Here's an example of using tags in a custom violation description: The AWS region is : {{tag.aws.awsRegion}} Responsible team : {{tag.label.owning_team}} Copy Facet clause tags: For NRQL conditions only. If a NRQL condition uses a FACET clause, you can use tag formatting to use those values in your custom violation description. For example, if the NRQL query included FACET hostName, cluster, you could then use this: The host is : {{tag.hostName}} The cluster is : {{tag.cluster}} Copy Please note that tag names cannot include a whitespace. The expanded values can include a whitespace, but not the names of the tags themselves. Create a custom violation description with NRQL You can create a custom violation description using a NRQL alert condition by creating a mutation with a description. Here's an empty mutation template: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: \"YOUR_CONDITION_ID\", condition: {description: \"\"}) { YOUR_CUSTOM_VIOLATION_DESCRIPTION } } Copy Here's an example mutation with a custom violation description: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: 123456, id: \"123456\", condition: {description: \"timestamp : {{timestamp}} \\n accountId : {{accountId}} \\n type : {{type}} \\n event : {{event}} \\n description : {{description}} \\n policyId : {{policyId}} \\n policyName: {{policyName}} \\n conditionName : {{conditionName}} \\n conditionId : {{conditionId}} \\n product : {{product}} \\n conditionType : {{conditionType}} \\n RunbookUrl : {{runbookUrl}} \\n nrqlQuery : {{nrqlQuery}} \\n nrqlEventType : {{nrqlEventType}} \\n targetID : {{targetId}} \\n targetName : {{targetName}} \\n commandLine : {{tag.commandLine}} \\n entityGuid : {{tag.entityGuid}} \\n entityName : {{tag.entityName}} \\n fullHostname : {{tag.fullHostname}} \\n instanceType : {{tag.instanceType}} \\n processDisplayName : {{tag.processDisplayName}}\"}) { description } } Copy For more information on NRQL conditions and using the NerdGraph API, go to NerdGraph API: NRQL condition alerts. For Infrastructure monitoring conditions, you can create the custom violation description when creating an Infrastructure monitoring alert condition. To learn about how to structure a custom violation description, see the example template and the attribute/tag instructions. Mentioning users or notifying channel in Slack When creating a description that you know will be sent to Slack, you may wish to @mention a user or generate a channel-wide notification (e.g. @here or @channel). To achieve this, simply include the User ID or a channel-wide notification in the description surrounded by < and > characters. Here's an example for mentioning a user: Attention <@LewCirne> Copy Here's an example for generating a channel-wide notification: Attention <!channel> Copy Important Note that the Slack convention for channel-wide notifications in Incoming Webhooks is to use a ! prefix instead of @ e.g. !here or !channel For more help Recommendations for learning more: To learn more about NerdGraph, see Introduction to NerdGraph.

You can send all issues by selecting Send all issues or you can build a query to filter the right issues. Build a query by selecting an attribute, operator and value/s to narrow down the right issues you want to be passed on. Optional: Enrichments Enrichments can give additional context on alert notifications by adding NRQL query results to them The workflows enrich tool is similar to the query builder. The NRQL query's results are included in the notification message. If you create queries for your workflows, they run in real time and the query results are the value of the enricher. You can save any valid query into your workflow, even if they return an empty result, but you must run the query before saving the enrichment. You can also query with issue-specific variables; for example {{entities.ids}} Note: the query name needs to be unique because you will use the name to decide how to include the result in the payload of the notification that will be sent by the workflow. Important The maximum number of enrichments per workflow is 10. The maximum number of variables an enrichment can contain is 1. Notifier In order to save and activate a Workflow you need to include a notifier. Setting up a notifier requires having a notification destination configured. You can either set it up through the Destination menu item, or through the Create new destination item in the destination selection drop down in each destination channel screen. A notification destination includes the credentials required to send a notification to a third party platform and an option to customize the message sent by mapping fields from our issues to fields in the destination platform. Note: each notifier allows for extensive customization tailored to your needs. Examples can be found below Click “update message” once completing the notifier requirements, then complete the workflow by clicking activate. Tip In any destination channel, start typing and a variable menu will open up. You will see the names of the variables, that at runtime will be replaced with the variable’s value/s. In order to use the enrichers’ results use their name. Variables To get information about the entity that violated a condition, you can use variables as part of the where statement of the query. For example, to get a list of error logs for a specific issue use: FROM log SELECT * where service.name = {{ entities.names }} AND level = ‘error’ LIMIT 10 Copy This query returns the last 10 error logs for each notification sent for the entities that are associated with the issue. This would give you additional context as to what may have gone wrong and likely help you solve the issue faster. You can use any other entity properties in the same way. An example of how to populate the field Important Note: In order to attain the value in the JSON format, you must specify the word JSON. Otherwise, you will get a comma delimited list (e.g. {{ json entities.Ids}} ). For more variable options to find additional context, a comprehensive list of variables can be found here: Key Display Name (First word will be used for grouping) accumulations.origin Issue Origin accumulations.source Issue Source activatedAt Issue Activated At dataMLModules.components Machine Learning Components dataMLModules.suggestedResponders Machine Learning Suggested Responder dataMLModules.goldenSignals Machine Learning Golden Signals annotations.description Issue Description annotations.title Issue Title closedAt Issue ClosedAt createdAt Issue CreatedAt entities.ids Impacted Entities IDs entities.types Impacted Entities Types entities.names Impacted Entities Names entities.kinds Impacted Entities Kinds incidentIds Incident IDs isCorrelated Issue Is Correlated issueId Issue ID labels.accountIds Issue Environment Associated Account ID labels.aggregationKeys Labels Alerts Aggregation Key labels.conditionNames Labels Alert Condition Names labels.originalAccountIds Labels Account IDs labels.policyIds Labels Alert Policy IDs labels.policyNames Labels Alert Policy Names priority Issue Priority state Issue State status Issue Status totalIncidents Incident Count triggerEvent Issue Notification Trigger Event triggeredAt Issue Triggered At updatedAt Issue Updated At workflowName Workflow Name Destinations Destinations are unique identifiers and credentials for third-party systems. The destination you choose is the location where we send notifications. Destinations are located under the Alerts and AI menu. Add a Destination Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left navigation under Enrich and Respond , then click Destinations. Select one of the destination types at the top of the destinations management screen. Webhook destination Use the webhook notifier to send notification messages to any endpoint. The webhook configuration requires: A unique destination name The endpoint url of the target application Authorization which can be ‘basic authentication or a ‘bearer token’ Basic authentication allows users to provide the username and password associated with your HTTP endpoint, which will populate in the header. Bearer token involves security tokens, where the token is a cryptic string. The user must send this token in the authorization header when requesting protected resources To test your webhook, click ‘test connection’ on the bottom right. There’s a retry mechanism that is triggered a few times with exponential backoff for a couple of minutes once an error occurs. If we reach the retry limit, the Webhook will get auto-disabled. ServiceNow incidents destination Using ServiceNow as a notifier enables you to push valuable issues into new ServiceNow incidents. With two-way integrations, you can also make sure that status updates of ServiceNow incidents are mirrored back to New Relic. The ServiceNow notifier requires: Unique notifier name ServiceNow domain endpoint A username and password Optional: enable two-way integration Important The Servicenow user details should have read permissions for the tables: sys_dictionary, sys_choice, sys_user, change_request Optional: enable two-way integration You can configure a two-way integration with ServiceNow incidents so that when state updates for the incident (resolved or closed), it triggers an update in the corresponding New Relic Issue state. Here are some important things to remember when configuring the two-way integration: The following steps are required to enable two-way integration: Check Allow two-way integration when you create the Notifier. Open and download this XML file(which includes the business rule for Incident Workflows). In the ServiceNow sidebar menu, go to System Definition > Business Rule. Click the menu icon in one of the column headers, select Import XML, and upload the XML file you downloaded. We create a New Relic API-key in the SNOW ‘api_key_credentials’ table. If you want two-way integration, the user used for setting the destination also needs write permissions to the table: api_key_credentials After you enable two-way integration, an incident state in ServiceNow changes to Resolved or Closed, and the corresponding workflow incident changes to Closed. Test your notifier to make sure everything is running smoothly and you are receiving your Alerts and Issues. Jira destination Using Jira as a notifier enables you to push valuable issues into a new Jira Cloud ticket. With two-way integration you can also make sure that state-updates are mirrored back to New Relic. Atlassian Jira notifiers need: Notifier name Jira url endpoint A username Jira API key After you enable two-way integration, an incident on Jira changes to Resolved or Closed, and the corresponding workflow incident changes to Closed. Finally, test your notifier to make sure everything is running smoothly and you are receiving your Alerts and Issues. If everything is connecting correctly, you will receive a ‘connection successful’ message.",

      "body": "For some types of conditions, you can define a custom violation description that passes useful information downstream for better violation responses or for use by other systems. You can create a custom violation description in the UI or with NRQL. Requirements The custom violation description feature is available for: NRQL alert conditions Infrastructure monitoring alert conditions The custom violation description field has a maximum character size of 4000. What is a custom violation description? For some types of conditions, you can create a custom violation description that passes information about a condition and its violations downstream. Using a description, you can: Capture the reason for the condition Define the signal being monitored Define next steps Add metadata to downstream systems The Custom violation description field allows you to use a general template structure that, when a violation is generated, substitutes the generic sections with specific values. For example, let's say you used this in a description: This is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tag.fullHostname}} Copy A violation resulting from this condition would fill in the details and you'd receive a notification like this: This is my condition name : My Great Alert Condition The hostname is : ip-123-45-67-89.us-west-1.compute.internal Copy Create a custom violation description In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, (select a policy), then (select a condition): Click + Add custom violation description to open the field. For a condition, you can create a custom violation description using this field. Custom violation description template example Here's a custom violation description template example: this is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tag.fullHostname}} Owning Team: {{tag.label.owning_team}} Product: {{tag.label.product}} ec2VpcId: {{tag.aws.ec2VpcId}} Service name : {{tag.label.Name}} AWS Region : {{tag.aws.awsRegion}} AWS Availability Zone: {{tag.aws.awsAvailabilityZone}} Department : {{tag.label.department}} Environment: {{tag.label.environment}} Cluster: {{tag.clusterName}} Cluster Role: {{tag.clusterRole}} EC2 Instance Type: {{tag.instanceType}} EC2 InstanceID: {{tag.aws.ec2InstanceId}} EC2 AmiId: {{tag.aws.ec2AmiId}} EC2 Root Device Type: {{tag.aws.ec2RootDeviceType}} Copy Here's how that data might appear in a notification: How to use attributes The attributes you can use in a custom violation description are a subset of attributes attached to the violation event. Here are some details about the available attributes and how to use them: Violation event attributes: For any of the standard attributes available for use in a custom violation description, use the format {{AN_ATTRIBUTE}}. For example: The target name is : {{targetName}} Copy Tag attributes: For tags, you would use the format {{tag.TAG_NAME}}. There are two types of tags: Entity-related tags: For Infrastructure conditions only. You can find available entity-related tags by going to the New Relic Explorer and looking under a service's Metadata and tags, or by viewing violation details. Here's an example of using tags in a custom violation description: The AWS region is : {{tag.aws.awsRegion}} Responsible team : {{tag.label.owning_team}} Copy Facet clause tags: For NRQL conditions only. If a NRQL condition uses a FACET clause, you can use tag formatting to use those values in your custom violation description. For example, if the NRQL query included FACET hostName, cluster, you could then use this: The host is : {{tag.hostName}} The cluster is : {{tag.cluster}} Copy Please note that tag names cannot include a whitespace. The expanded values can include a whitespace, but not the names of the tags themselves. Create a custom violation description with NRQL You can create a custom violation description using a NRQL alert condition by creating a mutation with a description. Here's an empty mutation template: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: \"YOUR_CONDITION_ID\", condition: {description: \"\"}) { YOUR_CUSTOM_VIOLATION_DESCRIPTION } } Copy Here's an example mutation with a custom violation description: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: 123456, id: \"123456\", condition: {description: \"timestamp : {{timestamp}} \\n accountId : {{accountId}} \\n type : {{type}} \\n event : {{event}} \\n description : {{description}} \\n policyId : {{policyId}} \\n policyName: {{policyName}} \\n conditionName : {{conditionName}} \\n conditionId : {{conditionId}} \\n product : {{product}} \\n conditionType : {{conditionType}} \\n RunbookUrl : {{runbookUrl}} \\n nrqlQuery : {{nrqlQuery}} \\n nrqlEventType : {{nrqlEventType}} \\n targetID : {{targetId}} \\n targetName : {{targetName}} \\n commandLine : {{tag.commandLine}} \\n entityGuid : {{tag.entityGuid}} \\n entityName : {{tag.entityName}} \\n fullHostname : {{tag.fullHostname}} \\n instanceType : {{tag.instanceType}} \\n processDisplayName : {{tag.processDisplayName}}\"}) { description } } Copy For more information on NRQL conditions and using the NerdGraph API, go to NerdGraph API: NRQL condition alerts. For Infrastructure monitoring conditions, you can create the custom violation description when creating an Infrastructure monitoring alert condition. To learn about how to structure a custom violation description, see the example template and the attribute/tag instructions. Mentioning users or notifying channel in Slack When creating a description that you know will be sent to Slack, you may wish to @mention a user or generate a channel-wide notification (e.g. @here or @channel). To achieve this, simply include the User ID or a channel-wide notification in the description surrounded by < and > characters. Here's an example for mentioning a user: Attention <@LewCirne> Copy Here's an example for generating a channel-wide notification: Attention <!channel> Copy Important Note that the Slack convention for channel-wide notifications in Incoming Webhooks is to use a ! prefix instead of @ e.g. !here or !channel For more help Recommendations for learning more: To learn more about NerdGraph, see Introduction to NerdGraph.

      "body": "For some types of conditions, you can define a custom violation description that passes useful information downstream for better violation responses or for use by other systems. You can create a custom violation description in the UI or with NRQL. Requirements The custom violation description feature is available for: NRQL alert conditions Infrastructure monitoring alert conditions The custom violation description field has a maximum character size of 4000. What is a custom violation description? For some types of conditions, you can create a custom violation description that passes information about a condition and its violations downstream. Using a description, you can: Capture the reason for the condition Define the signal being monitored Define next steps Add metadata to downstream systems The Custom violation description field allows you to use a general template structure that, when a violation is generated, substitutes the generic sections with specific values. For example, let's say you used this in a description: This is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tag.fullHostname}} Copy A violation resulting from this condition would fill in the details and you'd receive a notification like this: This is my condition name : My Great Alert Condition The hostname is : ip-123-45-67-89.us-west-1.compute.internal Copy Create a custom violation description In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, (select a policy), then (select a condition): Click + Add custom violation description to open the field. For a condition, you can create a custom violation description using this field. Custom violation description template example Here's a custom violation description template example: this is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tag.fullHostname}} Owning Team: {{tag.label.owning_team}} Product: {{tag.label.product}} ec2VpcId: {{tag.aws.ec2VpcId}} Service name : {{tag.label.Name}} AWS Region : {{tag.aws.awsRegion}} AWS Availability Zone: {{tag.aws.awsAvailabilityZone}} Department : {{tag.label.department}} Environment: {{tag.label.environment}} Cluster: {{tag.clusterName}} Cluster Role: {{tag.clusterRole}} EC2 Instance Type: {{tag.instanceType}} EC2 InstanceID: {{tag.aws.ec2InstanceId}} EC2 AmiId: {{tag.aws.ec2AmiId}} EC2 Root Device Type: {{tag.aws.ec2RootDeviceType}} Copy Here's how that data might appear in a notification: How to use attributes The attributes you can use in a custom violation description are a subset of attributes attached to the violation event. Here are some details about the available attributes and how to use them: Violation event attributes: For any of the standard attributes available for use in a custom violation description, use the format {{AN_ATTRIBUTE}}. For example: The target name is : {{targetName}} Copy Tag attributes: For tags, you would use the format {{tag.TAG_NAME}}. There are two types of tags: Entity-related tags: For Infrastructure conditions only. You can find available entity-related tags by going to the New Relic Explorer and looking under a service's Metadata and tags, or by viewing violation details. Here's an example of using tags in a custom violation description: The AWS region is : {{tag.aws.awsRegion}} Responsible team : {{tag.label.owning_team}} Copy Facet clause tags: For NRQL conditions only. If a NRQL condition uses a FACET clause, you can use tag formatting to use those values in your custom violation description. For example, if the NRQL query included FACET hostName, cluster, you could then use this: The host is : {{tag.hostName}} The cluster is : {{tag.cluster}} Copy Please note that tag names cannot include a whitespace. The expanded values can include a whitespace, but not the names of the tags themselves. Create a custom violation description with NRQL You can create a custom violation description using a NRQL alert condition by creating a mutation with a description. Here's an empty mutation template: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: \"YOUR_CONDITION_ID\", condition: {description: \"\"}) { YOUR_CUSTOM_VIOLATION_DESCRIPTION } } Copy Here's an example mutation with a custom violation description: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: 123456, id: \"123456\", condition: {description: \"timestamp : {{timestamp}} \\n accountId : {{accountId}} \\n type : {{type}} \\n event : {{event}} \\n description : {{description}} \\n policyId : {{policyId}} \\n policyName: {{policyName}} \\n conditionName : {{conditionName}} \\n conditionId : {{conditionId}} \\n product : {{product}} \\n conditionType : {{conditionType}} \\n RunbookUrl : {{runbookUrl}} \\n nrqlQuery : {{nrqlQuery}} \\n nrqlEventType : {{nrqlEventType}} \\n targetID : {{targetId}} \\n targetName : {{targetName}} \\n commandLine : {{tag.commandLine}} \\n entityGuid : {{tag.entityGuid}} \\n entityName : {{tag.entityName}} \\n fullHostname : {{tag.fullHostname}} \\n instanceType : {{tag.instanceType}} \\n processDisplayName : {{tag.processDisplayName}}\"}) { description } } Copy For more information on NRQL conditions and using the NerdGraph API, go to NerdGraph API: NRQL condition alerts. For Infrastructure monitoring conditions, you can create the custom violation description when creating an Infrastructure monitoring alert condition. To learn about how to structure a custom violation description, see the example template and the attribute/tag instructions. Mentioning users or notifying channel in Slack When creating a description that you know will be sent to Slack, you may wish to @mention a user or generate a channel-wide notification (e.g. @here or @channel). To achieve this, simply include the User ID or a channel-wide notification in the description surrounded by < and > characters. Here's an example for mentioning a user: Attention <@LewCirne> Copy Here's an example for generating a channel-wide notification: Attention <!channel> Copy Important Note that the Slack convention for channel-wide notifications in Incoming Webhooks is to use a ! prefix instead of @ e.g. !here or !channel For more help Recommendations for learning more: To learn more about NerdGraph, see Introduction to NerdGraph.

      "body": "With Incident Workflows, you identify the Policy you want to be alerted on. When the policy gets violated, the violation triggers the workflow, and violation attributes are transferred into the notification creation. Custom variables are violation-related properties you can use as part of the configuration of a workflow action. You can retrieve Information about the alert, condition, violation, and entity by using double curly brackets:: {{variable_name}}. Use custom variables in a filter statement To get information about the entity that violated a condition, you can use custom variables as part of the where statement of the query. For example, to get the state of the EC2 instance use: SELECT latest(ec2State) FROM ComputeSample where provider = 'Ec2Instance' where entityName = `{{entity.name}}' Copy This query returns a single value (for example, stopped), as the query only uses a single field. The variable entity.name is the identifier of the entity. You can use any other entity properties in the same way. Workflow data enrichment examples You can use custom variables to enrich your workflow data queries in different ways: Query for when application traffic drops There are times when you want to know when traffic to your application drops. You can use the { { entity.name}} variable in place of your application's name. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction WHERE appName = '{{entity.name}}' since 10 minutes ago Copy Query for transaction failures There are times when you want to know when your application transactions have failed. This query shows the latest HTTP status code responses filtered by the { { entity.name}} variable that violated your alert policy threshold. From Transaction select latest(httpResponseCode), average(duration) where appName = '{{entity.name}}' Copy Query for Kubernetes consumption overview Use a query like this to get the number of entities and their ingest times within a Kubernetes pod. By identifying what entities have large ingest times, you can begin to address that issue and find a potential remedy.

      "body": "With Applied Intelligence's Proactive Detection, anomalies from your New Relic APM-monitored applications are automatically surfaced in our activity streams and anomalies feed. Each anomaly can be clicked on to bring up an automatic analysis. You can have notifications for anomalies delivered in Slack, or you can set up a webhook to deliver messages when you need them. These events are available for querying, creating custom dashboards, and alerting. By creating a Proactive Detection configuration (a group of apps you’re interested in), you can then add this configuration as a source, and have anomalies automatically correlated with other data sources via Incident Intelligence. Requirements To use Proactive Detection, ensure you have: An APM agent installed for at least one applications. To receive notifications in Slack, you'll need to ask your IT administrator to install the Applied Intelligence application in your Slack workspace. For more on data limits, see Data limits. Why it matters With Proactive Detection, Applied Intelligence delivers insights about anomalies in your production system, along with an automatic analysis of the anomaly. It’s enabled automatically, at no additional cost. When an anomaly is detected, you can view it in the Applied Intelligence anomalies feed, or we'll send notifications directly to your Slack channel or a webhook. How it works Proactive Detection uses the following methods to detect anomalies in your app data: Proactive Detection monitors metric data reported by an APM agent, building a model of your typical application dynamics, and focuses on key golden signals: throughput, response time, and errors. If one of these golden signals shows anomalous behavior, the system flags it and tracks recovery to normal behavior. The system adapts to changes in your data, and continuously updates models based on new data. Automatically on: By default, Proactive Detection monitors all your APM applications, with no action required by you. When an anomaly is detected, it's automatically surfaced in various activity streams, the Applied Intelligence anomalies feed and is available for querying via NRQL. Receiving notifications: We send notifications when we detect anomalous changes in throughput, error rate, or response time. The notifications are sent to selected Slack channels, or sent via webhook. When the anomaly goes back to normal, a recovery message is sent. If you don't want to receive notifications, you still have access to the data via NRQL query. Anomaly analysis: For each anomaly, we provide a link in Slack to an analyze anomaly page. This page generates automatic insights into the anomaly. The page is also available from the anomalies tab, which lists recent anomalies. This page uses your existing APM and Proactive Detection data to provide explanations as to the cause of the anomaly. Activity stream: Inside various activity streams such as the New Relic One homepage, APM Summary page, Lookout and Explorer, you'll see relevant anomalies from your APM-monitored applications. Clicking on any of the anomaly events in the activity stream brings up the analysis page for that anomaly. Applications will not always generate anomalies, so it can be normal to not receive any detections. Set up notifications for Proactive Detection Proactive Detection is enabled automatically, at no additional cost. To receive notifications or to have a configuration (group of apps) that you can add as a source for Incident Intelligence, you will need to create a Proactive Detection configuration. You can create a configuration in the Proactive Detection UI: From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI. Under Proactive Detection, click Settings. Click Add a configuration. Input the following information into the form: Choose a name for your configuration that helps you easily identify it from others in your account. Select an account. Select up to 1,000 applications. Note that certain applications with low throughput might not be good candidates for Proactive Detection, as they can be more sensitive to smaller amounts of data fluctuation. Optional: select the golden signals you'd like to monitor for anomalies. Optional: connect to Incident Intelligence. Set up for Slack To use Proactive Detection with Slack: Select Slack. Choose which Slack channel receives notifications. You can select any existing public or private channel. This prompts the workflow to add the Applied Intelligence Slack application to your selected channel. To create a new channel, do that directly in Slack first. Tip If you experience an error when assigning Slack channels, make sure that the New Relic AI Slack application has been added to your Slack workspace. Save the configuration. You can modify the applications for each configuration at any time by selecting the configuration in the configuration table. Set up for webhooks To use Proactive Detection with webhooks: Select Webhook. Input the following information into the form: Provide the webhook URL. Provide optional custom headers. Choose to edit the custom payload, or enable using the default payload. Save the configuration. You can modify the applications for each configuration at any time by selecting the configuration in the configuration table. Set up without notifications To use Proactive Detection when you don't need to receive notifications: Select No notifications. Save the configuration. You can modify the applications for each configuration at any time by selecting the configuration in the configuration table. Mute notifications (Slack only) In Slack, detections coming from specific applications can be muted temporarily or permanently. The entire channel can also be muted temporarily. This is useful in the case of an incident or when the channel should otherwise not be interrupted. To mute in Slack, select Mute this app’s warnings or Mute all warnings, then select the duration. We will resume sending notifications for any detections once the muting duration has completed. Muting an application permanently removes it from the configuration. To add it back in, go to one.newrelic.com, in the top nav click Alerts & AI, then click Proactive Detection, and select the configuration to edit. Muting Proactive Detection notifications does not affect alerts. Use Proactive Detection Slack messages Each anomaly message has several key pieces of information you can use to learn more about and start troubleshooting the potential issue: The application name and a link to more information about it in New Relic One. The metric experiencing an anomaly and a link to its details in New Relic One. A graph of the metric over time to provide a visual understanding of the anomaly’s behavior and degree. An Analyze button that navigates to an analysis page in Applied Intelligence that identifies key attributes that are unique to the anomaly, anomalies found upstream or downstream, and any other relevant signals. Once an anomaly has returned to normal, we send a recovery notification with the option to provide feedback. Your feedback provides our development team with input to help us improve detection quality. In the case of feedback provided on throughput anomalies, an evaluation is run each hour based on feedback to fit a more suitable model. If we helped you, you can select Yes or No. View overview of anomalies In addition to notifications for anomalies that give you information via Slack or webhook, you can view more information about the anomalies in your environment via the Anomalies tab on the Alerts & AI Overview page. That tab provides a list of all the recent anomalies from every configuration in the selected account, and you can select an anomaly for a detailed analysis. Anomaly visibility settings Anomalies are displayed in various New Relic activity streams and in the Applied Intelligence anomalies feed. You can customize what is displayed using the anomaly visibility settings (for example, hiding throughput anomalies on an activity stream but keeping them in the anomalies feed). To find these settings: from Alerts & AI, under Proactive Detection, click Settings. Notes on using these settings: These settings are applied at the user level. Changes you make won’t affect others users in your organization. Regardless of these settings, the anomalies are still reported and available for NRQL querying. Details on these UI sections: AI overview and anomalies tab: Use the AI overview and anomalies tab setting to hide anomalies from the AI overview and anomalies tab setting. Please note you also can use filters specific to these views as well. Global activity stream: Use the global activity stream section to customize what anomalies are shown in the various New Relic activity streams, including the New Relic One homepage, APM Summary, and Lookout. Anomaly types: Use the check boxes here to hide specific types of anomalies. For example uncheck Web throughput and Non-web throughput anomalies to hide these types of anomalies from both the activity streams and the AI overview and anomalies tab. (Note they are still reported and available for querying.) Query anomaly data You can use NRQL to query and chart your Proactive Detection data using the NrAiAnomaly event. For example: FROM NrAiAnomaly SELECT * Important This data has previously been attached to the ProactiveDetection event. That event will be deprecated on April 7, 2021. If you use ProactiveDetection in your custom charts, you should convert those queries to using NrAiAnomaly. Here are important attributes attached to this event: Attribute Description closeTime timestamp The time when the anomaly ended. Example: 1615304100000. configurationType string The type of configuration monitoring the event. If at least one configuration is monitoring the entity, this is set to configuration. Otherwise, it's set to automatic. entity.accountId number The New Relic account ID to which the entity belongs. entity.domain number The domain of the entity (currently only APM but will change with future functionality). entity.guid string The GUID of the entity. This is used to identify and retrieve data about the entity via NerdGraph. Identical to entityGuid. entityGuid string The GUID of the entity. This is used to identify and retrieve data about the entity via NerdGraph. Identical to entity.guid. entity.name string The name of the entity whose data was determined to be anomalous. Identical to entityName. Example: Laura's coffee service. entityName string The name of the entity whose data was determined to be anomalous. Identical to entity.name. entity.type string The type of entity (currently only APPLICATION but will change with future functionality). evaluationType string This is always anomaly. event string Indicates whether it's the beginning (open) or end (close) of the anomalous data. openTime timestamp The time when the anomaly opened. Example: 1615303740000. signalType string The type of data that was analyzed. For example, error_rate or response_time.non_web. timestamp timestamp The time at which the event was written. title string Description of the anomaly. Example: Error rate was much higher than normal. Add anomalies as source in Incident Intelligence By integrating Incident Intelligence with your Proactive Detection anomalies, you can get context and correlations. To learn about doing this in Incident Intelligence, see Configure sources. You can also select Connect to Incident Intelligence from inside of a configuration. Webhook payload and examples Proactive Detection sends the event body in JSON format via HTTPS POST. The system expects the endpoint to return a successful HTTP code (2xx). If you use webhooks to configure Proactive Detection, use these examples of the webhook body format and JSON schema. Attribute Description category enum The category of data that was analyzed. Categories include web throughput, non-web throughput, web transactions, non-web transactions, and error class. data list The time series data leading up to the detection. data[].timestamp number The timestamp of the data point in milliseconds since the Unix epoch. Example: 1584366819000 data[].unit string The unit describing the value of the data point. Data units include count, milliseconds, and error_rate. data[].value number The value of the data point. Example: 1.52 detectionType enum The type of data that was analyzed.

      "body": "For some types of conditions, you can define a custom violation description that passes useful information downstream for better violation responses or for use by other systems. You can create a custom violation description in the UI or with NRQL. Requirements The custom violation description feature is available for: NRQL alert conditions Infrastructure monitoring alert conditions The custom violation description field has a maximum character size of 4000. What is a custom violation description? For some types of conditions, you can create a custom violation description that passes information about a condition and its violations downstream. Using a description, you can: Capture the reason for the condition Define the signal being monitored Define next steps Add metadata to downstream systems The Custom violation description field allows you to use a general template structure that, when a violation is generated, substitutes the generic sections with specific values. For example, let's say you used this in a description: This is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tag.fullHostname}} Copy A violation resulting from this condition would fill in the details and you'd receive a notification like this: This is my condition name : My Great Alert Condition The hostname is : ip-123-45-67-89.us-west-1.compute.internal Copy Create a custom violation description In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, (select a policy), then (select a condition): Click + Add custom violation description to open the field. For a condition, you can create a custom violation description using this field. Custom violation description template example Here's a custom violation description template example: this is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tag.fullHostname}} Owning Team: {{tag.label.owning_team}} Product: {{tag.label.product}} ec2VpcId: {{tag.aws.ec2VpcId}} Service name : {{tag.label.Name}} AWS Region : {{tag.aws.awsRegion}} AWS Availability Zone: {{tag.aws.awsAvailabilityZone}} Department : {{tag.label.department}} Environment: {{tag.label.environment}} Cluster: {{tag.clusterName}} Cluster Role: {{tag.clusterRole}} EC2 Instance Type: {{tag.instanceType}} EC2 InstanceID: {{tag.aws.ec2InstanceId}} EC2 AmiId: {{tag.aws.ec2AmiId}} EC2 Root Device Type: {{tag.aws.ec2RootDeviceType}} Copy Here's how that data might appear in a notification: How to use attributes The attributes you can use in a custom violation description are a subset of attributes attached to the violation event. Here are some details about the available attributes and how to use them: Violation event attributes: For any of the standard attributes available for use in a custom violation description, use the format {{AN_ATTRIBUTE}}. For example: The target name is : {{targetName}} Copy Tag attributes: For tags, you would use the format {{tag.TAG_NAME}}. There are two types of tags: Entity-related tags: For Infrastructure conditions only. You can find available entity-related tags by going to the New Relic Explorer and looking under a service's Metadata and tags, or by viewing violation details. Here's an example of using tags in a custom violation description: The AWS region is : {{tag.aws.awsRegion}} Responsible team : {{tag.label.owning_team}} Copy Facet clause tags: For NRQL conditions only. If a NRQL condition uses a FACET clause, you can use tag formatting to use those values in your custom violation description. For example, if the NRQL query included FACET hostName, cluster, you could then use this: The host is : {{tag.hostName}} The cluster is : {{tag.cluster}} Copy Please note that tag names cannot include a whitespace. The expanded values can include a whitespace, but not the names of the tags themselves. Create a custom violation description with NRQL You can create a custom violation description using a NRQL alert condition by creating a mutation with a description. Here's an empty mutation template: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: \"YOUR_CONDITION_ID\", condition: {description: \"\"}) { YOUR_CUSTOM_VIOLATION_DESCRIPTION } } Copy Here's an example mutation with a custom violation description: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: 123456, id: \"123456\", condition: {description: \"timestamp : {{timestamp}} \\n accountId : {{accountId}} \\n type : {{type}} \\n event : {{event}} \\n description : {{description}} \\n policyId : {{policyId}} \\n policyName: {{policyName}} \\n conditionName : {{conditionName}} \\n conditionId : {{conditionId}} \\n product : {{product}} \\n conditionType : {{conditionType}} \\n RunbookUrl : {{runbookUrl}} \\n nrqlQuery : {{nrqlQuery}} \\n nrqlEventType : {{nrqlEventType}} \\n targetID : {{targetId}} \\n targetName : {{targetName}} \\n commandLine : {{tag.commandLine}} \\n entityGuid : {{tag.entityGuid}} \\n entityName : {{tag.entityName}} \\n fullHostname : {{tag.fullHostname}} \\n instanceType : {{tag.instanceType}} \\n processDisplayName : {{tag.processDisplayName}}\"}) { description } } Copy For more information on NRQL conditions and using the NerdGraph API, go to NerdGraph API: NRQL condition alerts. For Infrastructure monitoring conditions, you can create the custom violation description when creating an Infrastructure monitoring alert condition. To learn about how to structure a custom violation description, see the example template and the attribute/tag instructions. Mentioning users or notifying channel in Slack When creating a description that you know will be sent to Slack, you may wish to @mention a user or generate a channel-wide notification (e.g. @here or @channel). To achieve this, simply include the User ID or a channel-wide notification in the description surrounded by < and > characters. Here's an example for mentioning a user: Attention <@LewCirne> Copy Here's an example for generating a channel-wide notification: Attention <!channel> Copy Important Note that the Slack convention for channel-wide notifications in Incoming Webhooks is to use a ! prefix instead of @ e.g. !here or !channel For more help Recommendations for learning more: To learn more about NerdGraph, see Introduction to NerdGraph. See the alerts landing page. Browse New Relic's Explorers Hub for community discussions about Alerts. Find additional help or file a support ticket.

      "body": "We’ve expanded anomaly detection coverage beyond your APM applications. Configure anomaly detection for your browser applications, mobile applications, infrastructure hosts, and nearly anything you want to monitor. Requirements Expanded anomaly detection is available as a limited beta. You can request access here. Why it matters When starting to configure alert conditions for a variety of applications and hosts, it can be difficult to know what you’ll want to be notified about ahead of time. Anomaly detection helps you distinguish between what’s typical performance in your system and where you’re starting to have trouble. Instead of creating your alert conditions manually, you can simply tell us what you want to monitor. Anomaly detection will help you identify baseline performance in your system and flags anomalous activity in your system. Get started with anomaly detection To get started with expanded anomaly detection: From one.newrelic.com, go to Alerts & AI > Proactive Detection > Settings. Click the Custom tab, and then click + Add a configuration. Select the account you want to use to record anomaly data, then select the workload or entities you’d like to monitor. Select the detection sensitivity. We recommend Low sensitivity so that you don’t see too many anomalies. Finally, name your configuration and save. Detect anomalies with a faceted NRQL query To detect anomalies with a faceted NRQL query: From one.newrelic.com, go to Alerts & AI > Proactive Detection > Settings. Click the Custom tab, and then click + Add a configuration. Click Use a query instead. You may need to select an account, if you have more than one. Add one or more queries with a FACET clause. Name the query and confirm the facets you want to monitor for anomalies. Select the detection sensitivity. We recommend Low sensitivity so that you don’t see too many anomalies. Finally, name the configuration and save. See your anomalies in one place When you set up anomaly detection, New Relic starts analyzing the golden signals of your entities and workloads. Anomalies appear in your activity feeds throughout New Relic One and the Anomalies tab as soon as they’re detected. Click any anomaly to get more detail about it, including analysis and context for the anomaly. Tip For this limited release, anomaly detection won’t generate notifications. However, you can configure a NRQL alert condition for the NrAiAnomaly event. To view anomalies, from one.newrelic.com, go to Alerts & AI > Issues & activity > Anomalies. Query anomaly data Detected anomalies are written to the NrAiAnomaly event in your NRDB account. You can learn more about this event and how to query it here. Reduce the number of detected anomalies If you’re seeing too many anomalies, the first step is to make sure your sensitivity level is set to Low. If it’s already set to Low, you can define specific thresholds to distinguish between normal and anomalous behavior. To define custom thresholds: From one.newrelic.com, go to Alerts & AI > Proactive Detection > Settings. Click the Custom tab and the configuration you want to modify. Select an entity or workload, and then change the sensitivity level. You can use custom sensitivity to define specific thresholds for different entity types.",

Using a description, you can: Capture the reason for the condition Define the signal being monitored Define next steps Add metadata to downstream systems The Custom violation description field allows you to use a general template structure that, when a violation is generated, substitutes the generic sections with specific values. For example, let's say you used this in a description: This is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tag.fullHostname}} Copy A violation resulting from this condition would fill in the details and you'd receive a notification like this: This is my condition name : My Great Alert Condition The hostname is : ip-123-45-67-89.us-west-1.compute.internal Copy Create a custom violation description In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, (select a policy), then (select a condition): Click + Add custom violation description to open the field.

Custom violation description template example Here's a custom violation description template example: this is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tag.fullHostname}} Owning Team: {{tag.label.owning_team}} Product: {{tag.label.product}} ec2VpcId: {{tag.aws.ec2VpcId}} Service name : {{tag.label.Name}} AWS Region : {{tag.aws.awsRegion}} AWS Availability Zone: {{tag.aws.awsAvailabilityZone}} Department : {{tag.label.department}} Environment: {{tag.label.environment}} Cluster: {{tag.clusterName}} Cluster Role: {{tag.clusterRole}} EC2 Instance Type: {{tag.instanceType}} EC2 InstanceID: {{tag.aws.ec2InstanceId}} EC2 AmiId: {{tag.aws.ec2AmiId}} EC2 Root Device Type: {{tag.aws.ec2RootDeviceType}} Copy Here's how that data might appear in a notification: How to use attributes The attributes you can use in a custom violation description are a subset of attributes attached to the violation event. Here are some details about the available attributes and how to use them: Violation event attributes: For any of the standard attributes available for use in a custom violation description, use the format {{AN_ATTRIBUTE}}. For example: The target name is : {{targetName}} Copy Tag attributes: For tags, you would use the format {{tag.TAG_NAME}}. There are two types of tags: Entity-related tags: For Infrastructure conditions only. You can find available entity-related tags by going to the New Relic Explorer and looking under a service's Metadata and tags, or by viewing violation details. Here's an example of using tags in a custom violation description: The AWS region is : {{tag.aws.awsRegion}} Responsible team : {{tag.label.owning_team}} Copy Facet clause tags: For NRQL conditions only. If a NRQL condition uses a FACET clause, you can use tag formatting to use those values in your custom violation description. For example, if the NRQL query included FACET hostName, cluster, you could then use this: The host is : {{tag.hostName}} The cluster is : {{tag.cluster}} Copy Please note that tag names cannot include a whitespace. The expanded values can include a whitespace, but not the names of the tags themselves. Create a custom violation description with NRQL You can create a custom violation description using a NRQL alert condition by creating a mutation with a description. Here's an empty mutation template: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: \"YOUR_CONDITION_ID\", condition: {description: \"\"}) { YOUR_CUSTOM_VIOLATION_DESCRIPTION } } Copy Here's an example mutation with a custom violation description: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: 123456, id: \"123456\", condition: {description: \"timestamp : {{timestamp}} \\n accountId : {{accountId}} \\n type : {{type}} \\n event : {{event}} \\n description : {{description}} \\n policyId : {{policyId}} \\n policyName: {{policyName}} \\n conditionName : {{conditionName}} \\n conditionId : {{conditionId}} \\n product : {{product}} \\n conditionType : {{conditionType}} \\n RunbookUrl : {{runbookUrl}} \\n nrqlQuery : {{nrqlQuery}} \\n nrqlEventType : {{nrqlEventType}} \\n targetID : {{targetId}} \\n targetName : {{targetName}} \\n commandLine : {{tag.commandLine}} \\n entityGuid : {{tag.entityGuid}} \\n entityName : {{tag.entityName}} \\n fullHostname : {{tag.fullHostname}} \\n instanceType : {{tag.instanceType}} \\n processDisplayName : {{tag.processDisplayName}}\"}) { description } } Copy For more information on NRQL conditions and using the NerdGraph API, go to NerdGraph API: NRQL condition alerts.

      "body": "A policy is a group of one or more conditions. This document explains how to create a policy and how to view existing policies. You can also use the REST API. For an explanation of how policies interact with conditions and other components, see Concepts and workflow. Tip The basic setup process is the same, regardless of which product (APM, browser, etc.) uses the policy. The types of metrics and thresholds for conditions vary depending on the monitored data source. Best practices for naming policies We recommend three common patterns and practices for structuring and naming policies: Targets or resources in your architecture that have people responsible for their well being Teams that are responsible for part of the architecture Individual policies for specific users Policies organized by... Comments Architecture Targets or resources in your organization may have different people responsible for their well-being. Common segments may include the environment type (production, staging, integration, development) or the target or resource type (app server code, client-side code, databases, hosts, etc.). To make these types of policies easier to identify, you can give them names based on your architecture. For example: Product A website (production) Product B website (staging) Mobile product app (iOS) Hosts (production) Databases (production) Teams Specific teams may be responsible for parts of your architecture. For example, you may want to name their policy Team: Site engineering, Team: Website development, etc. Individuals Policies set up for specific individuals may be useful when they want to personally keep an eye on a particular resource or metric. This provides them the freedom to add and remove conditions as well as adjust thresholds whenever they want, without having to communicate those changes to others. To make these policies easier to identify, you can include the person's name; for example, User: John Doe's metrics, User: Jane Doe (production), etc. Create an alert policy As part of the policy workflow, start by giving the policy a meaningful name: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Policies. On the policy index page, click New alert policy. Type a meaningful name for the policy (maximum 64 characters). Select the incident preference. Select Create alert policy. You can continue from here to define the conditions and assign one or more notification channels. If you decide to continue later, select the policy name from the Alert policies index. Change a policy name For your convenience, we allow you to use the same name for different policies, conditions, and notification channels. If you want to use unique names, review or search the index before adding or changing a name. To rename an existing policy: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Policies, and then (select a policy). Click the policy name to edit it, then type a meaningful name for the policy (maximum 64 characters). Alerts automatically updates any of the policy's conditions and notification channels. View existing policies The policies index lists policies in alphabetical order. To view or search for existing policies: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Policies. Use the search box, sort any column, or scroll the list. To view detailed information, click a policy name. Tip To view policy and condition information for a specific entity, select the Settings > Alert conditions page from the entity's product UI. Policy maintenance quick reference After you create a policy, you can: Add more conditions to the policy. Edit the conditions' names, targets, or thresholds. Disable conditions. Add one or more notification channels to a policy. Rename or delete the policy. The user interface shows a Last modified timestamp for any changes to policies, including their conditions and notification channels. Here is a quick reference which also includes links to more detailed information and procedures for maintaining your policies. Add or remove policies assigned to a channel To add or remove policies assigned to a channel: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Notification channels, then (select a channel). Click Alert policies, then (select a policy). From the selected policy, use the windows to select, remove, or clear all. Change a policy name To rename a policy: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, then (select a policy). Click the policy name to edit it, then type a meaningful name for the policy (maximum 64 characters). Check policy user assignment To check whether an account user has been assigned any policies: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Policies, (select a policy), then click Notification channels. Select a user, and then click Alert policies. Check policy channel assignment To check whether a notification channel has any policies assigned to it: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Notification channels. The Policy subscriptions column lists how many policies are assigned to the channel. Create a new policy To create a new alert policy: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Policies. Click New alert policy. Follow standard procedures to complete the basic setup process. Disable a policy You can't disable a policy directly. However, you can disable all of the policy's conditions. When you disable all of the conditions, the policy remains the Alert policies index. The policy itself isn't disabled, and you can re-enable any or all of its conditions at any time. Delete a policy If you delete a policy, we'll continue to apply any other policies assigned to the product entity (target). If you remove all policies for the entity, its color-coded health status indicator will appear light green with an icon. If you delete any of your account's policies, you can't restore them. Instead, you must re-create them if necessary. To delete a policy completely: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Alert policies.

      "body": "A policy is a group of one or more conditions. This document explains how to create a policy and how to view existing policies. You can also use the REST API. For an explanation of how policies interact with conditions and other components, see Concepts and workflow. Tip The basic setup process is the same, regardless of which product (APM, browser, etc.) uses the policy. The types of metrics and thresholds for conditions vary depending on the monitored data source. Best practices for naming policies We recommend three common patterns and practices for structuring and naming policies: Targets or resources in your architecture that have people responsible for their well being Teams that are responsible for part of the architecture Individual policies for specific users Policies organized by... Comments Architecture Targets or resources in your organization may have different people responsible for their well-being. Common segments may include the environment type (production, staging, integration, development) or the target or resource type (app server code, client-side code, databases, hosts, etc.). To make these types of policies easier to identify, you can give them names based on your architecture. For example: Product A website (production) Product B website (staging) Mobile product app (iOS) Hosts (production) Databases (production) Teams Specific teams may be responsible for parts of your architecture. For example, you may want to name their policy Team: Site engineering, Team: Website development, etc. Individuals Policies set up for specific individuals may be useful when they want to personally keep an eye on a particular resource or metric. This provides them the freedom to add and remove conditions as well as adjust thresholds whenever they want, without having to communicate those changes to others. To make these policies easier to identify, you can include the person's name; for example, User: John Doe's metrics, User: Jane Doe (production), etc. Create an alert policy As part of the policy workflow, start by giving the policy a meaningful name: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Policies. On the policy index page, click New alert policy. Type a meaningful name for the policy (maximum 64 characters). Select the incident preference. Select Create alert policy. You can continue from here to define the conditions and assign one or more notification channels. If you decide to continue later, select the policy name from the Alert policies index. Change a policy name For your convenience, we allow you to use the same name for different policies, conditions, and notification channels. If you want to use unique names, review or search the index before adding or changing a name. To rename an existing policy: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Policies, and then (select a policy). Click the policy name to edit it, then type a meaningful name for the policy (maximum 64 characters). Alerts automatically updates any of the policy's conditions and notification channels. View existing policies The policies index lists policies in alphabetical order. To view or search for existing policies: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Policies. Use the search box, sort any column, or scroll the list. To view detailed information, click a policy name. Tip To view policy and condition information for a specific entity, select the Settings > Alert conditions page from the entity's product UI. Policy maintenance quick reference After you create a policy, you can: Add more conditions to the policy. Edit the conditions' names, targets, or thresholds. Disable conditions. Add one or more notification channels to a policy. Rename or delete the policy. The user interface shows a Last modified timestamp for any changes to policies, including their conditions and notification channels. Here is a quick reference which also includes links to more detailed information and procedures for maintaining your policies. Add or remove policies assigned to a channel To add or remove policies assigned to a channel: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Notification channels, then (select a channel). Click Alert policies, then (select a policy). From the selected policy, use the windows to select, remove, or clear all. Change a policy name To rename a policy: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, then (select a policy). Click the policy name to edit it, then type a meaningful name for the policy (maximum 64 characters). Check policy user assignment To check whether an account user has been assigned any policies: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Policies, (select a policy), then click Notification channels. Select a user, and then click Alert policies. Check policy channel assignment To check whether a notification channel has any policies assigned to it: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Notification channels. The Policy subscriptions column lists how many policies are assigned to the channel. Create a new policy To create a new alert policy: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Policies. Click New alert policy. Follow standard procedures to complete the basic setup process. Disable a policy You can't disable a policy directly. However, you can disable all of the policy's conditions. When you disable all of the conditions, the policy remains the Alert policies index. The policy itself isn't disabled, and you can re-enable any or all of its conditions at any time. Delete a policy If you delete a policy, we'll continue to apply any other policies assigned to the product entity (target). If you remove all policies for the entity, its color-coded health status indicator will appear light green with an icon. If you delete any of your account's policies, you can't restore them. Instead, you must re-create them if necessary. To delete a policy completely: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Alert policies. From the policy row, click the delete icon. Any notification channels associated with a deleted or disabled policy will remain. You must delete notification channels or remove them individually as necessary. In a deleted policy, incidents and event violations are provided as a read only resource. Check for entities (targets) assigned to a policy To check whether an entity (target) has any policies assigned: Go to the product (APM, browser, etc.).

      "body": "Use our New Relic query language (NRQL) to create alerts conditions with ease. Your condition describes what you want to be notified about, and only requires two attributes: a query and a threshold. The query defines the data that's important to you, and determines what you want to be notified about. The threshold determines when you’ll be notified. Follow these steps to write your first alerts condition using a NRQL query and a threshold. Once you're done, you'll have a working alert condition. Step 1: Write your query You can use a NRQL query to return data about how your environment is performing. Then, you can create a condition from that query. In this example, a condition is created for each host's CPU utilization (query), which will trigger a notification when the CPU utilization is above the 0.7% (threshold). Generally, you won't use thresholds below 1%, but this example simply shows you how to set up a threshold. Find the NRQL query builder at the top of the UI. Click the Query your data button to open the query builder and start writing a NRQL query. Once you've written a valid query, you can create a condition from it. The condition shows each host’s CPU utilization. Use this NRQL query, or something similar that's relevant to what you're monitoring, to create a condition. This query finds the average CPU utilization in an environment and then breaks it down (facets) by individual host names. Once you've created a valid NRQL query, click Create alert. Learn more about the NRQL syntax to create other useful queries. Step 2: Name your NRQL condition Give your NRQL condition a name that's meaningful to you. Step 3: Set your condition thresholds Set critical and warning thresholds to determine when you’re notified about your environment's performance. A critical threshold is required for your alerts condition. A warning threshold is optional. These thresholds don't create an incident or notify you like the critical threshold does. If a critical threshold opens an incident and notifies you, warning threshold violations created afterwards will be included in the report. In this example from the Set your condition thresholds section, our critical threshold (red) checks for any hosts with CPU utilization over 0.7% for at least 5 minutes. A warning threshold (yellow) is also added showing when any host's CPU utilization goes over 0.67% for at least 5 minutes. After you enter threshold values, you can see the threshold lines on the graph: Step 4: Create a policy Finally, add your condition to an existing policy or create a new one. When you create a new policy, you can group your violations by policy, condition, or by violation (this creates an incident for each violation). These incident preferences settings determine how frequently you're notified when there's a violation. What's next? Now that you've created your first condition, set up your incident preferences and notification channels. For a detailed, comprehensive overview of NRQL conditions, see Create NRQL alert conditions",

      "body": "For some types of conditions, you can define a custom violation description that passes useful information downstream for better violation responses or for use by other systems. You can create a custom violation description in the UI or with NRQL. Requirements The custom violation description feature is available for: NRQL alert conditions Infrastructure monitoring alert conditions The custom violation description field has a maximum character size of 4000. What is a custom violation description? For some types of conditions, you can create a custom violation description that passes information about a condition and its violations downstream. Using a description, you can: Capture the reason for the condition Define the signal being monitored Define next steps Add metadata to downstream systems The Custom violation description field allows you to use a general template structure that, when a violation is generated, substitutes the generic sections with specific values. For example, let's say you used this in a description: This is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tag.fullHostname}} Copy A violation resulting from this condition would fill in the details and you'd receive a notification like this: This is my condition name : My Great Alert Condition The hostname is : ip-123-45-67-89.us-west-1.compute.internal Copy Create a custom violation description In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, (select a policy), then (select a condition): Click + Add custom violation description to open the field. For a condition, you can create a custom violation description using this field. Custom violation description template example Here's a custom violation description template example: this is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tag.fullHostname}} Owning Team: {{tag.label.owning_team}} Product: {{tag.label.product}} ec2VpcId: {{tag.aws.ec2VpcId}} Service name : {{tag.label.Name}} AWS Region : {{tag.aws.awsRegion}} AWS Availability Zone: {{tag.aws.awsAvailabilityZone}} Department : {{tag.label.department}} Environment: {{tag.label.environment}} Cluster: {{tag.clusterName}} Cluster Role: {{tag.clusterRole}} EC2 Instance Type: {{tag.instanceType}} EC2 InstanceID: {{tag.aws.ec2InstanceId}} EC2 AmiId: {{tag.aws.ec2AmiId}} EC2 Root Device Type: {{tag.aws.ec2RootDeviceType}} Copy Here's how that data might appear in a notification: How to use attributes The attributes you can use in a custom violation description are a subset of attributes attached to the violation event. Here are some details about the available attributes and how to use them: Violation event attributes: For any of the standard attributes available for use in a custom violation description, use the format {{AN_ATTRIBUTE}}. For example: The target name is : {{targetName}} Copy Tag attributes: For tags, you would use the format {{tag.TAG_NAME}}. There are two types of tags: Entity-related tags: For Infrastructure conditions only. You can find available entity-related tags by going to the New Relic Explorer and looking under a service's Metadata and tags, or by viewing violation details. Here's an example of using tags in a custom violation description: The AWS region is : {{tag.aws.awsRegion}} Responsible team : {{tag.label.owning_team}} Copy Facet clause tags: For NRQL conditions only. If a NRQL condition uses a FACET clause, you can use tag formatting to use those values in your custom violation description. For example, if the NRQL query included FACET hostName, cluster, you could then use this: The host is : {{tag.hostName}} The cluster is : {{tag.cluster}} Copy Please note that tag names cannot include a whitespace. The expanded values can include a whitespace, but not the names of the tags themselves. Create a custom violation description with NRQL You can create a custom violation description using a NRQL alert condition by creating a mutation with a description. Here's an empty mutation template: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: \"YOUR_CONDITION_ID\", condition: {description: \"\"}) { YOUR_CUSTOM_VIOLATION_DESCRIPTION } } Copy Here's an example mutation with a custom violation description: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: 123456, id: \"123456\", condition: {description: \"timestamp : {{timestamp}} \\n accountId : {{accountId}} \\n type : {{type}} \\n event : {{event}} \\n description : {{description}} \\n policyId : {{policyId}} \\n policyName: {{policyName}} \\n conditionName : {{conditionName}} \\n conditionId : {{conditionId}} \\n product : {{product}} \\n conditionType : {{conditionType}} \\n RunbookUrl : {{runbookUrl}} \\n nrqlQuery : {{nrqlQuery}} \\n nrqlEventType : {{nrqlEventType}} \\n targetID : {{targetId}} \\n targetName : {{targetName}} \\n commandLine : {{tag.commandLine}} \\n entityGuid : {{tag.entityGuid}} \\n entityName : {{tag.entityName}} \\n fullHostname : {{tag.fullHostname}} \\n instanceType : {{tag.instanceType}} \\n processDisplayName : {{tag.processDisplayName}}\"}) { description } } Copy For more information on NRQL conditions and using the NerdGraph API, go to NerdGraph API: NRQL condition alerts. For Infrastructure monitoring conditions, you can create the custom violation description when creating an Infrastructure monitoring alert condition. To learn about how to structure a custom violation description, see the example template and the attribute/tag instructions. Mentioning users or notifying channel in Slack When creating a description that you know will be sent to Slack, you may wish to @mention a user or generate a channel-wide notification (e.g. @here or @channel). To achieve this, simply include the User ID or a channel-wide notification in the description surrounded by < and > characters. Here's an example for mentioning a user: Attention <@LewCirne> Copy Here's an example for generating a channel-wide notification: Attention <!channel> Copy Important Note that the Slack convention for channel-wide notifications in Incoming Webhooks is to use a ! prefix instead of @ e.g. !here or !channel For more help Recommendations for learning more: To learn more about NerdGraph, see Introduction to NerdGraph. See the alerts landing page. Browse New Relic's Explorers Hub for community discussions about Alerts. Find additional help or file a support ticket.

      "body": "A policy is a group of one or more conditions. This document explains how to create a policy and how to view existing policies. You can also use the REST API. For an explanation of how policies interact with conditions and other components, see Concepts and workflow. Tip The basic setup process is the same, regardless of which product (APM, browser, etc.) uses the policy. The types of metrics and thresholds for conditions vary depending on the monitored data source. Best practices for naming policies We recommend three common patterns and practices for structuring and naming policies: Targets or resources in your architecture that have people responsible for their well being Teams that are responsible for part of the architecture Individual policies for specific users Policies organized by... Comments Architecture Targets or resources in your organization may have different people responsible for their well-being. Common segments may include the environment type (production, staging, integration, development) or the target or resource type (app server code, client-side code, databases, hosts, etc.). To make these types of policies easier to identify, you can give them names based on your architecture. For example: Product A website (production) Product B website (staging) Mobile product app (iOS) Hosts (production) Databases (production) Teams Specific teams may be responsible for parts of your architecture. For example, you may want to name their policy Team: Site engineering, Team: Website development, etc. Individuals Policies set up for specific individuals may be useful when they want to personally keep an eye on a particular resource or metric. This provides them the freedom to add and remove conditions as well as adjust thresholds whenever they want, without having to communicate those changes to others. To make these policies easier to identify, you can include the person's name; for example, User: John Doe's metrics, User: Jane Doe (production), etc. Create an alert policy As part of the policy workflow, start by giving the policy a meaningful name: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Policies. On the policy index page, click New alert policy. Type a meaningful name for the policy (maximum 64 characters). Select the incident preference. Select Create alert policy. You can continue from here to define the conditions and assign one or more notification channels. If you decide to continue later, select the policy name from the Alert policies index. Change a policy name For your convenience, we allow you to use the same name for different policies, conditions, and notification channels. If you want to use unique names, review or search the index before adding or changing a name. To rename an existing policy: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Policies, and then (select a policy). Click the policy name to edit it, then type a meaningful name for the policy (maximum 64 characters). Alerts automatically updates any of the policy's conditions and notification channels. View existing policies The policies index lists policies in alphabetical order. To view or search for existing policies: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Policies. Use the search box, sort any column, or scroll the list. To view detailed information, click a policy name. Tip To view policy and condition information for a specific entity, select the Settings > Alert conditions page from the entity's product UI. Policy maintenance quick reference After you create a policy, you can: Add more conditions to the policy. Edit the conditions' names, targets, or thresholds. Disable conditions. Add one or more notification channels to a policy. Rename or delete the policy. The user interface shows a Last modified timestamp for any changes to policies, including their conditions and notification channels. Here is a quick reference which also includes links to more detailed information and procedures for maintaining your policies. Add or remove policies assigned to a channel To add or remove policies assigned to a channel: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Notification channels, then (select a channel). Click Alert policies, then (select a policy). From the selected policy, use the windows to select, remove, or clear all. Change a policy name To rename a policy: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, then (select a policy). Click the policy name to edit it, then type a meaningful name for the policy (maximum 64 characters). Check policy user assignment To check whether an account user has been assigned any policies: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Policies, (select a policy), then click Notification channels. Select a user, and then click Alert policies. Check policy channel assignment To check whether a notification channel has any policies assigned to it: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Notification channels. The Policy subscriptions column lists how many policies are assigned to the channel. Create a new policy To create a new alert policy: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Policies. Click New alert policy. Follow standard procedures to complete the basic setup process. Disable a policy You can't disable a policy directly. However, you can disable all of the policy's conditions. When you disable all of the conditions, the policy remains the Alert policies index. The policy itself isn't disabled, and you can re-enable any or all of its conditions at any time. Delete a policy If you delete a policy, we'll continue to apply any other policies assigned to the product entity (target). If you remove all policies for the entity, its color-coded health status indicator will appear light green with an icon. If you delete any of your account's policies, you can't restore them. Instead, you must re-create them if necessary. To delete a policy completely: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Alert policies. From the policy row, click the delete icon. Any notification channels associated with a deleted or disabled policy will remain. You must delete notification channels or remove them individually as necessary. In a deleted policy, incidents and event violations are provided as a read only resource. Check for entities (targets) assigned to a policy To check whether an entity (target) has any policies assigned: Go to the product (APM, browser, etc.). From the selected product's index, check whether the entity's color-coded health status is light green with an icon. Tip Exception: Infrastructure does not use this feature. Change how threshold violations roll up into incidents To select how violations to your thresholds are grouped into incident records (by policy, by condition, or by target and condition): In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, then (select a policy). Click Incident preference. Get context for alert violations with Incident Intelligence If you use Applied Intelligence, you can connect your conditions to Incident Intelligence. From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources and then click Alerts. Select the policies you want to connect to Applied Intelligence, and click Connect. You can add additional alerts policies or remove policies you've already connected in Sources > New Relic Alerts.",

Here's an empty mutation template: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: \"YOUR_CONDITION_ID\", condition: {description: \"\"}) { YOUR_CUSTOM_VIOLATION_DESCRIPTION } } Copy Here's an example mutation with a custom violation description: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: 123456, id: \"123456\", condition: {description: \"timestamp : {{timestamp}} \\n accountId : {{accountId}} \\n type : {{type}} \\n event : {{event}} \\n description : {{description}} \\n policyId : {{policyId}} \\n policyName: {{policyName}} \\n conditionName : {{conditionName}} \\n conditionId : {{conditionId}} \\n product : {{product}} \\n conditionType : {{conditionType}} \\n RunbookUrl : {{runbookUrl}} \\n nrqlQuery : {{nrqlQuery}} \\n nrqlEventType : {{nrqlEventType}} \\n targetID : {{targetId}} \\n targetName : {{targetName}} \\n commandLine : {{tag.commandLine}} \\n entityGuid : {{tag.entityGuid}} \\n entityName : {{tag.entityName}} \\n fullHostname : {{tag.fullHostname}} \\n instanceType : {{tag.instanceType}} \\n processDisplayName : {{tag.processDisplayName}}\"}) { description } } Copy For more information on NRQL conditions and using the NerdGraph API, go to NerdGraph API: NRQL condition alerts. For Infrastructure monitoring conditions, you can create the custom violation description when creating an Infrastructure monitoring alert condition. To learn about how to structure a custom violation description, see the example template and the attribute/tag instructions. Mentioning users or notifying channel in Slack When creating a description that you know will be sent to Slack, you may wish to @mention a user or generate a channel-wide notification (e.g. @here or @channel). To achieve this, simply include the User ID or a channel-wide notification in the description surrounded by < and > characters. Here's an example for mentioning a user: Attention <@LewCirne> Copy Here's an example for generating a channel-wide notification: Attention <!channel> Copy Important Note that the Slack convention for channel-wide notifications in Incoming Webhooks is to use a ! prefix instead of @ e.g. !here or !channel For more help Recommendations for learning more: To learn more about NerdGraph, see Introduction to NerdGraph.

      "body": "A policy is a group of one or more conditions. This document explains how to create a policy and how to view existing policies. You can also use the REST API. For an explanation of how policies interact with conditions and other components, see Concepts and workflow. Tip The basic setup process is the same, regardless of which product (APM, browser, etc.) uses the policy. The types of metrics and thresholds for conditions vary depending on the monitored data source. Best practices for naming policies We recommend three common patterns and practices for structuring and naming policies: Targets or resources in your architecture that have people responsible for their well being Teams that are responsible for part of the architecture Individual policies for specific users Policies organized by... Comments Architecture Targets or resources in your organization may have different people responsible for their well-being. Common segments may include the environment type (production, staging, integration, development) or the target or resource type (app server code, client-side code, databases, hosts, etc.). To make these types of policies easier to identify, you can give them names based on your architecture. For example: Product A website (production) Product B website (staging) Mobile product app (iOS) Hosts (production) Databases (production) Teams Specific teams may be responsible for parts of your architecture. For example, you may want to name their policy Team: Site engineering, Team: Website development, etc. Individuals Policies set up for specific individuals may be useful when they want to personally keep an eye on a particular resource or metric. This provides them the freedom to add and remove conditions as well as adjust thresholds whenever they want, without having to communicate those changes to others. To make these policies easier to identify, you can include the person's name; for example, User: John Doe's metrics, User: Jane Doe (production), etc. Create an alert policy As part of the policy workflow, start by giving the policy a meaningful name: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Policies. On the policy index page, click New alert policy. Type a meaningful name for the policy (maximum 64 characters). Select the incident preference. Select Create alert policy. You can continue from here to define the conditions and assign one or more notification channels. If you decide to continue later, select the policy name from the Alert policies index. Change a policy name For your convenience, we allow you to use the same name for different policies, conditions, and notification channels. If you want to use unique names, review or search the index before adding or changing a name. To rename an existing policy: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Policies, and then (select a policy). Click the policy name to edit it, then type a meaningful name for the policy (maximum 64 characters). Alerts automatically updates any of the policy's conditions and notification channels. View existing policies The policies index lists policies in alphabetical order. To view or search for existing policies: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Policies. Use the search box, sort any column, or scroll the list. To view detailed information, click a policy name. Tip To view policy and condition information for a specific entity, select the Settings > Alert conditions page from the entity's product UI. Policy maintenance quick reference After you create a policy, you can: Add more conditions to the policy. Edit the conditions' names, targets, or thresholds. Disable conditions. Add one or more notification channels to a policy. Rename or delete the policy. The user interface shows a Last modified timestamp for any changes to policies, including their conditions and notification channels. Here is a quick reference which also includes links to more detailed information and procedures for maintaining your policies. Add or remove policies assigned to a channel To add or remove policies assigned to a channel: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Notification channels, then (select a channel). Click Alert policies, then (select a policy). From the selected policy, use the windows to select, remove, or clear all. Change a policy name To rename a policy: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, then (select a policy). Click the policy name to edit it, then type a meaningful name for the policy (maximum 64 characters). Check policy user assignment To check whether an account user has been assigned any policies: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Policies, (select a policy), then click Notification channels. Select a user, and then click Alert policies. Check policy channel assignment To check whether a notification channel has any policies assigned to it: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Notification channels. The Policy subscriptions column lists how many policies are assigned to the channel. Create a new policy To create a new alert policy: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Policies. Click New alert policy. Follow standard procedures to complete the basic setup process. Disable a policy You can't disable a policy directly. However, you can disable all of the policy's conditions. When you disable all of the conditions, the policy remains the Alert policies index. The policy itself isn't disabled, and you can re-enable any or all of its conditions at any time. Delete a policy If you delete a policy, we'll continue to apply any other policies assigned to the product entity (target). If you remove all policies for the entity, its color-coded health status indicator will appear light green with an icon. If you delete any of your account's policies, you can't restore them. Instead, you must re-create them if necessary. To delete a policy completely: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Alert policies. From the policy row, click the delete icon. Any notification channels associated with a deleted or disabled policy will remain. You must delete notification channels or remove them individually as necessary. In a deleted policy, incidents and event violations are provided as a read only resource. Check for entities (targets) assigned to a policy To check whether an entity (target) has any policies assigned: Go to the product (APM, browser, etc.). From the selected product's index, check whether the entity's color-coded health status is light green with an icon. Tip Exception: Infrastructure does not use this feature. Change how threshold violations roll up into incidents To select how violations to your thresholds are grouped into incident records (by policy, by condition, or by target and condition): In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, then (select a policy). Click Incident preference. Get context for alert violations with Incident Intelligence If you use Applied Intelligence, you can connect your conditions to Incident Intelligence. From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources and then click Alerts. Select the policies you want to connect to Applied Intelligence, and click Connect. You can add additional alerts policies or remove policies you've already connected in Sources > New Relic Alerts.",

      "body": "For some types of conditions, you can define a custom violation description that passes useful information downstream for better violation responses or for use by other systems. You can create a custom violation description in the UI or with NRQL. Requirements The custom violation description feature is available for: NRQL alert conditions Infrastructure monitoring alert conditions The custom violation description field has a maximum character size of 4000. What is a custom violation description? For some types of conditions, you can create a custom violation description that passes information about a condition and its violations downstream. Using a description, you can: Capture the reason for the condition Define the signal being monitored Define next steps Add metadata to downstream systems The Custom violation description field allows you to use a general template structure that, when a violation is generated, substitutes the generic sections with specific values. For example, let's say you used this in a description: This is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tag.fullHostname}} Copy A violation resulting from this condition would fill in the details and you'd receive a notification like this: This is my condition name : My Great Alert Condition The hostname is : ip-123-45-67-89.us-west-1.compute.internal Copy Create a custom violation description In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, (select a policy), then (select a condition): Click + Add custom violation description to open the field. For a condition, you can create a custom violation description using this field. Custom violation description template example Here's a custom violation description template example: this is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tag.fullHostname}} Owning Team: {{tag.label.owning_team}} Product: {{tag.label.product}} ec2VpcId: {{tag.aws.ec2VpcId}} Service name : {{tag.label.Name}} AWS Region : {{tag.aws.awsRegion}} AWS Availability Zone: {{tag.aws.awsAvailabilityZone}} Department : {{tag.label.department}} Environment: {{tag.label.environment}} Cluster: {{tag.clusterName}} Cluster Role: {{tag.clusterRole}} EC2 Instance Type: {{tag.instanceType}} EC2 InstanceID: {{tag.aws.ec2InstanceId}} EC2 AmiId: {{tag.aws.ec2AmiId}} EC2 Root Device Type: {{tag.aws.ec2RootDeviceType}} Copy Here's how that data might appear in a notification: How to use attributes The attributes you can use in a custom violation description are a subset of attributes attached to the violation event. Here are some details about the available attributes and how to use them: Violation event attributes: For any of the standard attributes available for use in a custom violation description, use the format {{AN_ATTRIBUTE}}. For example: The target name is : {{targetName}} Copy Tag attributes: For tags, you would use the format {{tag.TAG_NAME}}. There are two types of tags: Entity-related tags: For Infrastructure conditions only. You can find available entity-related tags by going to the New Relic Explorer and looking under a service's Metadata and tags, or by viewing violation details. Here's an example of using tags in a custom violation description: The AWS region is : {{tag.aws.awsRegion}} Responsible team : {{tag.label.owning_team}} Copy Facet clause tags: For NRQL conditions only. If a NRQL condition uses a FACET clause, you can use tag formatting to use those values in your custom violation description. For example, if the NRQL query included FACET hostName, cluster, you could then use this: The host is : {{tag.hostName}} The cluster is : {{tag.cluster}} Copy Please note that tag names cannot include a whitespace. The expanded values can include a whitespace, but not the names of the tags themselves. Create a custom violation description with NRQL You can create a custom violation description using a NRQL alert condition by creating a mutation with a description.

Tip The basic setup process is the same, regardless of which product (APM, browser, etc.) uses the policy. The types of metrics and thresholds for conditions vary depending on the monitored data source. Best practices for naming policies We recommend three common patterns and practices for structuring and naming policies: Targets or resources in your architecture that have people responsible for their well being Teams that are responsible for part of the architecture Individual policies for specific users Policies organized by... Comments Architecture Targets or resources in your organization may have different people responsible for their well-being. Common segments may include the environment type (production, staging, integration, development) or the target or resource type (app server code, client-side code, databases, hosts, etc.). To make these types of policies easier to identify, you can give them names based on your architecture. For example: Product A website (production) Product B website (staging) Mobile product app (iOS) Hosts (production) Databases (production) Teams Specific teams may be responsible for parts of your architecture. For example, you may want to name their policy Team: Site engineering, Team: Website development, etc. Individuals Policies set up for specific individuals may be useful when they want to personally keep an eye on a particular resource or metric. This provides them the freedom to add and remove conditions as well as adjust thresholds whenever they want, without having to communicate those changes to others. To make these policies easier to identify, you can include the person's name; for example, User: John Doe's metrics, User: Jane Doe (production), etc. Create an alert policy As part of the policy workflow, start by giving the policy a meaningful name: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Policies. On the policy index page, click New alert policy. Type a meaningful name for the policy (maximum 64 characters). Select the incident preference. Select Create alert policy. You can continue from here to define the conditions and assign one or more notification channels. If you decide to continue later, select the policy name from the Alert policies index. Change a policy name For your convenience, we allow you to use the same name for different policies, conditions, and notification channels. If you want to use unique names, review or search the index before adding or changing a name. To rename an existing policy: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Policies, and then (select a policy). Click the policy name to edit it, then type a meaningful name for the policy (maximum 64 characters). Alerts automatically updates any of the policy's conditions and notification channels. View existing policies The policies index lists policies in alphabetical order. To view or search for existing policies: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Policies. Use the search box, sort any column, or scroll the list. To view detailed information, click a policy name. Tip To view policy and condition information for a specific entity, select the Settings > Alert conditions page from the entity's product UI. Policy maintenance quick reference After you create a policy, you can: Add more conditions to the policy. Edit the conditions' names, targets, or thresholds. Disable conditions. Add one or more notification channels to a policy. Rename or delete the policy. The user interface shows a Last modified timestamp for any changes to policies, including their conditions and notification channels. Here is a quick reference which also includes links to more detailed information and procedures for maintaining your policies. Add or remove policies assigned to a channel To add or remove policies assigned to a channel: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Notification channels, then (select a channel). Click Alert policies, then (select a policy). From the selected policy, use the windows to select, remove, or clear all. Change a policy name To rename a policy: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, then (select a policy). Click the policy name to edit it, then type a meaningful name for the policy (maximum 64 characters). Check policy user assignment To check whether an account user has been assigned any policies: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Policies, (select a policy), then click Notification channels. Select a user, and then click Alert policies. Check policy channel assignment To check whether a notification channel has any policies assigned to it: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Notification channels. The Policy subscriptions column lists how many policies are assigned to the channel. Create a new policy To create a new alert policy: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Policies. Click New alert policy. Follow standard procedures to complete the basic setup process. Disable a policy You can't disable a policy directly. However, you can disable all of the policy's conditions. When you disable all of the conditions, the policy remains the Alert policies index. The policy itself isn't disabled, and you can re-enable any or all of its conditions at any time. Delete a policy If you delete a policy, we'll continue to apply any other policies assigned to the product entity (target). If you remove all policies for the entity, its color-coded health status indicator will appear light green with an icon. If you delete any of your account's policies, you can't restore them. Instead, you must re-create them if necessary. To delete a policy completely: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Alert policies. From the policy row, click the delete icon. Any notification channels associated with a deleted or disabled policy will remain. You must delete notification channels or remove them individually as necessary. In a deleted policy, incidents and event violations are provided as a read only resource. Check for entities (targets) assigned to a policy To check whether an entity (target) has any policies assigned: Go to the product (APM, browser, etc.). From the selected product's index, check whether the entity's color-coded health status is light green with an icon. Tip Exception: Infrastructure does not use this feature. Change how threshold violations roll up into incidents To select how violations to your thresholds are grouped into incident records (by policy, by condition, or by target and condition): In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, then (select a policy). Click Incident preference. Get context for alert violations with Incident Intelligence If you use Applied Intelligence, you can connect your conditions to Incident Intelligence. From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources and then click Alerts. Select the policies you want to connect to Applied Intelligence, and click Connect. You can add additional alerts policies or remove policies you've already connected in Sources > New Relic Alerts.",

      "body": "For some types of conditions, you can define a custom violation description that passes useful information downstream for better violation responses or for use by other systems. You can create a custom violation description in the UI or with NRQL. Requirements The custom violation description feature is available for: NRQL alert conditions Infrastructure monitoring alert conditions The custom violation description field has a maximum character size of 4000. What is a custom violation description? For some types of conditions, you can create a custom violation description that passes information about a condition and its violations downstream. Using a description, you can: Capture the reason for the condition Define the signal being monitored Define next steps Add metadata to downstream systems The Custom violation description field allows you to use a general template structure that, when a violation is generated, substitutes the generic sections with specific values. For example, let's say you used this in a description: This is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tag.fullHostname}} Copy A violation resulting from this condition would fill in the details and you'd receive a notification like this: This is my condition name : My Great Alert Condition The hostname is : ip-123-45-67-89.us-west-1.compute.internal Copy Create a custom violation description In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, (select a policy), then (select a condition): Click + Add custom violation description to open the field. For a condition, you can create a custom violation description using this field. Custom violation description template example Here's a custom violation description template example: this is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tag.fullHostname}} Owning Team: {{tag.label.owning_team}} Product: {{tag.label.product}} ec2VpcId: {{tag.aws.ec2VpcId}} Service name : {{tag.label.Name}} AWS Region : {{tag.aws.awsRegion}} AWS Availability Zone: {{tag.aws.awsAvailabilityZone}} Department : {{tag.label.department}} Environment: {{tag.label.environment}} Cluster: {{tag.clusterName}} Cluster Role: {{tag.clusterRole}} EC2 Instance Type: {{tag.instanceType}} EC2 InstanceID: {{tag.aws.ec2InstanceId}} EC2 AmiId: {{tag.aws.ec2AmiId}} EC2 Root Device Type: {{tag.aws.ec2RootDeviceType}} Copy Here's how that data might appear in a notification: How to use attributes The attributes you can use in a custom violation description are a subset of attributes attached to the violation event. Here are some details about the available attributes and how to use them: Violation event attributes: For any of the standard attributes available for use in a custom violation description, use the format {{AN_ATTRIBUTE}}. For example: The target name is : {{targetName}} Copy Tag attributes: For tags, you would use the format {{tag.TAG_NAME}}. There are two types of tags: Entity-related tags: For Infrastructure conditions only. You can find available entity-related tags by going to the New Relic Explorer and looking under a service's Metadata and tags, or by viewing violation details. Here's an example of using tags in a custom violation description: The AWS region is : {{tag.aws.awsRegion}} Responsible team : {{tag.label.owning_team}} Copy Facet clause tags: For NRQL conditions only. If a NRQL condition uses a FACET clause, you can use tag formatting to use those values in your custom violation description. For example, if the NRQL query included FACET hostName, cluster, you could then use this: The host is : {{tag.hostName}} The cluster is : {{tag.cluster}} Copy Please note that tag names cannot include a whitespace. The expanded values can include a whitespace, but not the names of the tags themselves. Create a custom violation description with NRQL You can create a custom violation description using a NRQL alert condition by creating a mutation with a description. Here's an empty mutation template: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: \"YOUR_CONDITION_ID\", condition: {description: \"\"}) { YOUR_CUSTOM_VIOLATION_DESCRIPTION } } Copy Here's an example mutation with a custom violation description: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: 123456, id: \"123456\", condition: {description: \"timestamp : {{timestamp}} \\n accountId : {{accountId}} \\n type : {{type}} \\n event : {{event}} \\n description : {{description}} \\n policyId : {{policyId}} \\n policyName: {{policyName}} \\n conditionName : {{conditionName}} \\n conditionId : {{conditionId}} \\n product : {{product}} \\n conditionType : {{conditionType}} \\n RunbookUrl : {{runbookUrl}} \\n nrqlQuery : {{nrqlQuery}} \\n nrqlEventType : {{nrqlEventType}} \\n targetID : {{targetId}} \\n targetName : {{targetName}} \\n commandLine : {{tag.commandLine}} \\n entityGuid : {{tag.entityGuid}} \\n entityName : {{tag.entityName}} \\n fullHostname : {{tag.fullHostname}} \\n instanceType : {{tag.instanceType}} \\n processDisplayName : {{tag.processDisplayName}}\"}) { description } } Copy For more information on NRQL conditions and using the NerdGraph API, go to NerdGraph API: NRQL condition alerts. For Infrastructure monitoring conditions, you can create the custom violation description when creating an Infrastructure monitoring alert condition. To learn about how to structure a custom violation description, see the example template and the attribute/tag instructions. Mentioning users or notifying channel in Slack When creating a description that you know will be sent to Slack, you may wish to @mention a user or generate a channel-wide notification (e.g. @here or @channel). To achieve this, simply include the User ID or a channel-wide notification in the description surrounded by < and > characters. Here's an example for mentioning a user: Attention <@LewCirne> Copy Here's an example for generating a channel-wide notification: Attention <!channel> Copy Important Note that the Slack convention for channel-wide notifications in Incoming Webhooks is to use a ! prefix instead of @ e.g. !here or !channel For more help Recommendations for learning more: To learn more about NerdGraph, see Introduction to NerdGraph.

      "body": "For some types of conditions, you can define a custom violation description that passes useful information downstream for better violation responses or for use by other systems. You can create a custom violation description in the UI or with NRQL. Requirements The custom violation description feature is available for: NRQL alert conditions Infrastructure monitoring alert conditions The custom violation description field has a maximum character size of 4000. What is a custom violation description? For some types of conditions, you can create a custom violation description that passes information about a condition and its violations downstream. Using a description, you can: Capture the reason for the condition Define the signal being monitored Define next steps Add metadata to downstream systems The Custom violation description field allows you to use a general template structure that, when a violation is generated, substitutes the generic sections with specific values. For example, let's say you used this in a description: This is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tag.fullHostname}} Copy A violation resulting from this condition would fill in the details and you'd receive a notification like this: This is my condition name : My Great Alert Condition The hostname is : ip-123-45-67-89.us-west-1.compute.internal Copy Create a custom violation description In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, (select a policy), then (select a condition): Click + Add custom violation description to open the field. For a condition, you can create a custom violation description using this field. Custom violation description template example Here's a custom violation description template example: this is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tag.fullHostname}} Owning Team: {{tag.label.owning_team}} Product: {{tag.label.product}} ec2VpcId: {{tag.aws.ec2VpcId}} Service name : {{tag.label.Name}} AWS Region : {{tag.aws.awsRegion}} AWS Availability Zone: {{tag.aws.awsAvailabilityZone}} Department : {{tag.label.department}} Environment: {{tag.label.environment}} Cluster: {{tag.clusterName}} Cluster Role: {{tag.clusterRole}} EC2 Instance Type: {{tag.instanceType}} EC2 InstanceID: {{tag.aws.ec2InstanceId}} EC2 AmiId: {{tag.aws.ec2AmiId}} EC2 Root Device Type: {{tag.aws.ec2RootDeviceType}} Copy Here's how that data might appear in a notification: How to use attributes The attributes you can use in a custom violation description are a subset of attributes attached to the violation event. Here are some details about the available attributes and how to use them: Violation event attributes: For any of the standard attributes available for use in a custom violation description, use the format {{AN_ATTRIBUTE}}. For example: The target name is : {{targetName}} Copy Tag attributes: For tags, you would use the format {{tag.TAG_NAME}}. There are two types of tags: Entity-related tags: For Infrastructure conditions only. You can find available entity-related tags by going to the New Relic Explorer and looking under a service's Metadata and tags, or by viewing violation details. Here's an example of using tags in a custom violation description: The AWS region is : {{tag.aws.awsRegion}} Responsible team : {{tag.label.owning_team}} Copy Facet clause tags: For NRQL conditions only. If a NRQL condition uses a FACET clause, you can use tag formatting to use those values in your custom violation description. For example, if the NRQL query included FACET hostName, cluster, you could then use this: The host is : {{tag.hostName}} The cluster is : {{tag.cluster}} Copy Please note that tag names cannot include a whitespace. The expanded values can include a whitespace, but not the names of the tags themselves. Create a custom violation description with NRQL You can create a custom violation description using a NRQL alert condition by creating a mutation with a description. Here's an empty mutation template: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: \"YOUR_CONDITION_ID\", condition: {description: \"\"}) { YOUR_CUSTOM_VIOLATION_DESCRIPTION } } Copy Here's an example mutation with a custom violation description: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: 123456, id: \"123456\", condition: {description: \"timestamp : {{timestamp}} \\n accountId : {{accountId}} \\n type : {{type}} \\n event : {{event}} \\n description : {{description}} \\n policyId : {{policyId}} \\n policyName: {{policyName}} \\n conditionName : {{conditionName}} \\n conditionId : {{conditionId}} \\n product : {{product}} \\n conditionType : {{conditionType}} \\n RunbookUrl : {{runbookUrl}} \\n nrqlQuery : {{nrqlQuery}} \\n nrqlEventType : {{nrqlEventType}} \\n targetID : {{targetId}} \\n targetName : {{targetName}} \\n commandLine : {{tag.commandLine}} \\n entityGuid : {{tag.entityGuid}} \\n entityName : {{tag.entityName}} \\n fullHostname : {{tag.fullHostname}} \\n instanceType : {{tag.instanceType}} \\n processDisplayName : {{tag.processDisplayName}}\"}) { description } } Copy For more information on NRQL conditions and using the NerdGraph API, go to NerdGraph API: NRQL condition alerts. For Infrastructure monitoring conditions, you can create the custom violation description when creating an Infrastructure monitoring alert condition. To learn about how to structure a custom violation description, see the example template and the attribute/tag instructions. Mentioning users or notifying channel in Slack When creating a description that you know will be sent to Slack, you may wish to @mention a user or generate a channel-wide notification (e.g. @here or @channel). To achieve this, simply include the User ID or a channel-wide notification in the description surrounded by < and > characters. Here's an example for mentioning a user: Attention <@LewCirne> Copy Here's an example for generating a channel-wide notification: Attention <!channel> Copy Important Note that the Slack convention for channel-wide notifications in Incoming Webhooks is to use a ! prefix instead of @ e.g. !here or !channel For more help Recommendations for learning more: To learn more about NerdGraph, see Introduction to NerdGraph.

      "body": "A policy is a group of one or more conditions. This document explains how to create a policy and how to view existing policies. You can also use the REST API. For an explanation of how policies interact with conditions and other components, see Concepts and workflow. Tip The basic setup process is the same, regardless of which product (APM, browser, etc.) uses the policy. The types of metrics and thresholds for conditions vary depending on the monitored data source. Best practices for naming policies We recommend three common patterns and practices for structuring and naming policies: Targets or resources in your architecture that have people responsible for their well being Teams that are responsible for part of the architecture Individual policies for specific users Policies organized by... Comments Architecture Targets or resources in your organization may have different people responsible for their well-being. Common segments may include the environment type (production, staging, integration, development) or the target or resource type (app server code, client-side code, databases, hosts, etc.). To make these types of policies easier to identify, you can give them names based on your architecture. For example: Product A website (production) Product B website (staging) Mobile product app (iOS) Hosts (production) Databases (production) Teams Specific teams may be responsible for parts of your architecture. For example, you may want to name their policy Team: Site engineering, Team: Website development, etc. Individuals Policies set up for specific individuals may be useful when they want to personally keep an eye on a particular resource or metric. This provides them the freedom to add and remove conditions as well as adjust thresholds whenever they want, without having to communicate those changes to others. To make these policies easier to identify, you can include the person's name; for example, User: John Doe's metrics, User: Jane Doe (production), etc. Create an alert policy As part of the policy workflow, start by giving the policy a meaningful name: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Policies. On the policy index page, click New alert policy. Type a meaningful name for the policy (maximum 64 characters). Select the incident preference. Select Create alert policy. You can continue from here to define the conditions and assign one or more notification channels. If you decide to continue later, select the policy name from the Alert policies index. Change a policy name For your convenience, we allow you to use the same name for different policies, conditions, and notification channels. If you want to use unique names, review or search the index before adding or changing a name. To rename an existing policy: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Policies, and then (select a policy). Click the policy name to edit it, then type a meaningful name for the policy (maximum 64 characters). Alerts automatically updates any of the policy's conditions and notification channels. View existing policies The policies index lists policies in alphabetical order. To view or search for existing policies: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Policies. Use the search box, sort any column, or scroll the list. To view detailed information, click a policy name. Tip To view policy and condition information for a specific entity, select the Settings > Alert conditions page from the entity's product UI. Policy maintenance quick reference After you create a policy, you can: Add more conditions to the policy. Edit the conditions' names, targets, or thresholds. Disable conditions. Add one or more notification channels to a policy. Rename or delete the policy. The user interface shows a Last modified timestamp for any changes to policies, including their conditions and notification channels. Here is a quick reference which also includes links to more detailed information and procedures for maintaining your policies. Add or remove policies assigned to a channel To add or remove policies assigned to a channel: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Notification channels, then (select a channel). Click Alert policies, then (select a policy). From the selected policy, use the windows to select, remove, or clear all. Change a policy name To rename a policy: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, then (select a policy). Click the policy name to edit it, then type a meaningful name for the policy (maximum 64 characters). Check policy user assignment To check whether an account user has been assigned any policies: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Policies, (select a policy), then click Notification channels. Select a user, and then click Alert policies. Check policy channel assignment To check whether a notification channel has any policies assigned to it: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Notification channels. The Policy subscriptions column lists how many policies are assigned to the channel. Create a new policy To create a new alert policy: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Policies. Click New alert policy. Follow standard procedures to complete the basic setup process. Disable a policy You can't disable a policy directly. However, you can disable all of the policy's conditions. When you disable all of the conditions, the policy remains the Alert policies index. The policy itself isn't disabled, and you can re-enable any or all of its conditions at any time. Delete a policy If you delete a policy, we'll continue to apply any other policies assigned to the product entity (target). If you remove all policies for the entity, its color-coded health status indicator will appear light green with an icon. If you delete any of your account's policies, you can't restore them. Instead, you must re-create them if necessary. To delete a policy completely: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Alert policies. From the policy row, click the delete icon. Any notification channels associated with a deleted or disabled policy will remain. You must delete notification channels or remove them individually as necessary. In a deleted policy, incidents and event violations are provided as a read only resource. Check for entities (targets) assigned to a policy To check whether an entity (target) has any policies assigned: Go to the product (APM, browser, etc.). From the selected product's index, check whether the entity's color-coded health status is light green with an icon. Tip Exception: Infrastructure does not use this feature. Change how threshold violations roll up into incidents To select how violations to your thresholds are grouped into incident records (by policy, by condition, or by target and condition): In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, then (select a policy). Click Incident preference. Get context for alert violations with Incident Intelligence If you use Applied Intelligence, you can connect your conditions to Incident Intelligence. From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources and then click Alerts. Select the policies you want to connect to Applied Intelligence, and click Connect. You can add additional alerts policies or remove policies you've already connected in Sources > New Relic Alerts.",

      "body": "For some types of conditions, you can define a custom violation description that passes useful information downstream for better violation responses or for use by other systems. You can create a custom violation description in the UI or with NRQL. Requirements The custom violation description feature is available for: NRQL alert conditions Infrastructure monitoring alert conditions The custom violation description field has a maximum character size of 4000. What is a custom violation description? For some types of conditions, you can create a custom violation description that passes information about a condition and its violations downstream. Using a description, you can: Capture the reason for the condition Define the signal being monitored Define next steps Add metadata to downstream systems The Custom violation description field allows you to use a general template structure that, when a violation is generated, substitutes the generic sections with specific values. For example, let's say you used this in a description: This is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tag.fullHostname}} Copy A violation resulting from this condition would fill in the details and you'd receive a notification like this: This is my condition name : My Great Alert Condition The hostname is : ip-123-45-67-89.us-west-1.compute.internal Copy Create a custom violation description In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, (select a policy), then (select a condition): Click + Add custom violation description to open the field. For a condition, you can create a custom violation description using this field. Custom violation description template example Here's a custom violation description template example: this is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tag.fullHostname}} Owning Team: {{tag.label.owning_team}} Product: {{tag.label.product}} ec2VpcId: {{tag.aws.ec2VpcId}} Service name : {{tag.label.Name}} AWS Region : {{tag.aws.awsRegion}} AWS Availability Zone: {{tag.aws.awsAvailabilityZone}} Department : {{tag.label.department}} Environment: {{tag.label.environment}} Cluster: {{tag.clusterName}} Cluster Role: {{tag.clusterRole}} EC2 Instance Type: {{tag.instanceType}} EC2 InstanceID: {{tag.aws.ec2InstanceId}} EC2 AmiId: {{tag.aws.ec2AmiId}} EC2 Root Device Type: {{tag.aws.ec2RootDeviceType}} Copy Here's how that data might appear in a notification: How to use attributes The attributes you can use in a custom violation description are a subset of attributes attached to the violation event. Here are some details about the available attributes and how to use them: Violation event attributes: For any of the standard attributes available for use in a custom violation description, use the format {{AN_ATTRIBUTE}}. For example: The target name is : {{targetName}} Copy Tag attributes: For tags, you would use the format {{tag.TAG_NAME}}. There are two types of tags: Entity-related tags: For Infrastructure conditions only. You can find available entity-related tags by going to the New Relic Explorer and looking under a service's Metadata and tags, or by viewing violation details. Here's an example of using tags in a custom violation description: The AWS region is : {{tag.aws.awsRegion}} Responsible team : {{tag.label.owning_team}} Copy Facet clause tags: For NRQL conditions only. If a NRQL condition uses a FACET clause, you can use tag formatting to use those values in your custom violation description. For example, if the NRQL query included FACET hostName, cluster, you could then use this: The host is : {{tag.hostName}} The cluster is : {{tag.cluster}} Copy Please note that tag names cannot include a whitespace. The expanded values can include a whitespace, but not the names of the tags themselves. Create a custom violation description with NRQL You can create a custom violation description using a NRQL alert condition by creating a mutation with a description. Here's an empty mutation template: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: \"YOUR_CONDITION_ID\", condition: {description: \"\"}) { YOUR_CUSTOM_VIOLATION_DESCRIPTION } } Copy Here's an example mutation with a custom violation description: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: 123456, id: \"123456\", condition: {description: \"timestamp : {{timestamp}} \\n accountId : {{accountId}} \\n type : {{type}} \\n event : {{event}} \\n description : {{description}} \\n policyId : {{policyId}} \\n policyName: {{policyName}} \\n conditionName : {{conditionName}} \\n conditionId : {{conditionId}} \\n product : {{product}} \\n conditionType : {{conditionType}} \\n RunbookUrl : {{runbookUrl}} \\n nrqlQuery : {{nrqlQuery}} \\n nrqlEventType : {{nrqlEventType}} \\n targetID : {{targetId}} \\n targetName : {{targetName}} \\n commandLine : {{tag.commandLine}} \\n entityGuid : {{tag.entityGuid}} \\n entityName : {{tag.entityName}} \\n fullHostname : {{tag.fullHostname}} \\n instanceType : {{tag.instanceType}} \\n processDisplayName : {{tag.processDisplayName}}\"}) { description } } Copy For more information on NRQL conditions and using the NerdGraph API, go to NerdGraph API: NRQL condition alerts. For Infrastructure monitoring conditions, you can create the custom violation description when creating an Infrastructure monitoring alert condition. To learn about how to structure a custom violation description, see the example template and the attribute/tag instructions. Mentioning users or notifying channel in Slack When creating a description that you know will be sent to Slack, you may wish to @mention a user or generate a channel-wide notification (e.g. @here or @channel). To achieve this, simply include the User ID or a channel-wide notification in the description surrounded by < and > characters. Here's an example for mentioning a user: Attention <@LewCirne> Copy Here's an example for generating a channel-wide notification: Attention <!channel> Copy Important Note that the Slack convention for channel-wide notifications in Incoming Webhooks is to use a ! prefix instead of @ e.g. !here or !channel For more help Recommendations for learning more: To learn more about NerdGraph, see Introduction to NerdGraph.

      "body": "A policy is a group of one or more conditions. This document explains how to create a policy and how to view existing policies. You can also use the REST API. For an explanation of how policies interact with conditions and other components, see Concepts and workflow. Tip The basic setup process is the same, regardless of which product (APM, browser, etc.) uses the policy. The types of metrics and thresholds for conditions vary depending on the monitored data source. Best practices for naming policies We recommend three common patterns and practices for structuring and naming policies: Targets or resources in your architecture that have people responsible for their well being Teams that are responsible for part of the architecture Individual policies for specific users Policies organized by... Comments Architecture Targets or resources in your organization may have different people responsible for their well-being. Common segments may include the environment type (production, staging, integration, development) or the target or resource type (app server code, client-side code, databases, hosts, etc.). To make these types of policies easier to identify, you can give them names based on your architecture. For example: Product A website (production) Product B website (staging) Mobile product app (iOS) Hosts (production) Databases (production) Teams Specific teams may be responsible for parts of your architecture. For example, you may want to name their policy Team: Site engineering, Team: Website development, etc. Individuals Policies set up for specific individuals may be useful when they want to personally keep an eye on a particular resource or metric. This provides them the freedom to add and remove conditions as well as adjust thresholds whenever they want, without having to communicate those changes to others. To make these policies easier to identify, you can include the person's name; for example, User: John Doe's metrics, User: Jane Doe (production), etc. Create an alert policy As part of the policy workflow, start by giving the policy a meaningful name: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Policies. On the policy index page, click New alert policy. Type a meaningful name for the policy (maximum 64 characters). Select the incident preference. Select Create alert policy. You can continue from here to define the conditions and assign one or more notification channels. If you decide to continue later, select the policy name from the Alert policies index. Change a policy name For your convenience, we allow you to use the same name for different policies, conditions, and notification channels. If you want to use unique names, review or search the index before adding or changing a name. To rename an existing policy: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Policies, and then (select a policy). Click the policy name to edit it, then type a meaningful name for the policy (maximum 64 characters). Alerts automatically updates any of the policy's conditions and notification channels. View existing policies The policies index lists policies in alphabetical order. To view or search for existing policies: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Policies. Use the search box, sort any column, or scroll the list. To view detailed information, click a policy name. Tip To view policy and condition information for a specific entity, select the Settings > Alert conditions page from the entity's product UI. Policy maintenance quick reference After you create a policy, you can: Add more conditions to the policy. Edit the conditions' names, targets, or thresholds. Disable conditions. Add one or more notification channels to a policy. Rename or delete the policy. The user interface shows a Last modified timestamp for any changes to policies, including their conditions and notification channels. Here is a quick reference which also includes links to more detailed information and procedures for maintaining your policies. Add or remove policies assigned to a channel To add or remove policies assigned to a channel: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Notification channels, then (select a channel). Click Alert policies, then (select a policy). From the selected policy, use the windows to select, remove, or clear all. Change a policy name To rename a policy: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, then (select a policy). Click the policy name to edit it, then type a meaningful name for the policy (maximum 64 characters). Check policy user assignment To check whether an account user has been assigned any policies: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Policies, (select a policy), then click Notification channels. Select a user, and then click Alert policies. Check policy channel assignment To check whether a notification channel has any policies assigned to it: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Notification channels. The Policy subscriptions column lists how many policies are assigned to the channel. Create a new policy To create a new alert policy: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Policies. Click New alert policy. Follow standard procedures to complete the basic setup process. Disable a policy You can't disable a policy directly. However, you can disable all of the policy's conditions. When you disable all of the conditions, the policy remains the Alert policies index. The policy itself isn't disabled, and you can re-enable any or all of its conditions at any time. Delete a policy If you delete a policy, we'll continue to apply any other policies assigned to the product entity (target). If you remove all policies for the entity, its color-coded health status indicator will appear light green with an icon. If you delete any of your account's policies, you can't restore them. Instead, you must re-create them if necessary. To delete a policy completely: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Alert policies. From the policy row, click the delete icon. Any notification channels associated with a deleted or disabled policy will remain. You must delete notification channels or remove them individually as necessary. In a deleted policy, incidents and event violations are provided as a read only resource. Check for entities (targets) assigned to a policy To check whether an entity (target) has any policies assigned: Go to the product (APM, browser, etc.). From the selected product's index, check whether the entity's color-coded health status is light green with an icon. Tip Exception: Infrastructure does not use this feature. Change how threshold violations roll up into incidents To select how violations to your thresholds are grouped into incident records (by policy, by condition, or by target and condition): In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, then (select a policy). Click Incident preference. Get context for alert violations with Incident Intelligence If you use Applied Intelligence, you can connect your conditions to Incident Intelligence. From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources and then click Alerts. Select the policies you want to connect to Applied Intelligence, and click Connect. You can add additional alerts policies or remove policies you've already connected in Sources > New Relic Alerts.",

Here's an example of using tags in a custom violation description: The AWS region is : {{tag.aws.awsRegion}} Responsible team : {{tag.label.owning_team}} Copy Facet clause tags: For NRQL conditions only. If a NRQL condition uses a FACET clause, you can use tag formatting to use those values in your custom violation description. For example, if the NRQL query included FACET hostName, cluster, you could then use this: The host is : {{tag.hostName}} The cluster is : {{tag.cluster}} Copy Please note that tag names cannot include a whitespace. The expanded values can include a whitespace, but not the names of the tags themselves. Create a custom violation description with NRQL You can create a custom violation description using a NRQL alert condition by creating a mutation with a description. Here's an empty mutation template: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: \"YOUR_CONDITION_ID\", condition: {description: \"\"}) { YOUR_CUSTOM_VIOLATION_DESCRIPTION } } Copy Here's an example mutation with a custom violation description: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: 123456, id: \"123456\", condition: {description: \"timestamp : {{timestamp}} \\n accountId : {{accountId}} \\n type : {{type}} \\n event : {{event}} \\n description : {{description}} \\n policyId : {{policyId}} \\n policyName: {{policyName}} \\n conditionName : {{conditionName}} \\n conditionId : {{conditionId}} \\n product : {{product}} \\n conditionType : {{conditionType}} \\n RunbookUrl : {{runbookUrl}} \\n nrqlQuery : {{nrqlQuery}} \\n nrqlEventType : {{nrqlEventType}} \\n targetID : {{targetId}} \\n targetName : {{targetName}} \\n commandLine : {{tag.commandLine}} \\n entityGuid : {{tag.entityGuid}} \\n entityName : {{tag.entityName}} \\n fullHostname : {{tag.fullHostname}} \\n instanceType : {{tag.instanceType}} \\n processDisplayName : {{tag.processDisplayName}}\"}) { description } } Copy For more information on NRQL conditions and using the NerdGraph API, go to NerdGraph API: NRQL condition alerts. For Infrastructure monitoring conditions, you can create the custom violation description when creating an Infrastructure monitoring alert condition. To learn about how to structure a custom violation description, see the example template and the attribute/tag instructions. Mentioning users or notifying channel in Slack When creating a description that you know will be sent to Slack, you may wish to @mention a user or generate a channel-wide notification (e.g. @here or @channel). To achieve this, simply include the User ID or a channel-wide notification in the description surrounded by < and > characters. Here's an example for mentioning a user: Attention <@LewCirne> Copy Here's an example for generating a channel-wide notification: Attention <!channel> Copy Important Note that the Slack convention for channel-wide notifications in Incoming Webhooks is to use a ! prefix instead of @ e.g. !here or !channel For more help Recommendations for learning more: To learn more about NerdGraph, see Introduction to NerdGraph.

      "body": "A policy is a group of one or more conditions. This document explains how to create a policy and how to view existing policies. You can also use the REST API. For an explanation of how policies interact with conditions and other components, see Concepts and workflow. Tip The basic setup process is the same, regardless of which product (APM, browser, etc.) uses the policy. The types of metrics and thresholds for conditions vary depending on the monitored data source. Best practices for naming policies We recommend three common patterns and practices for structuring and naming policies: Targets or resources in your architecture that have people responsible for their well being Teams that are responsible for part of the architecture Individual policies for specific users Policies organized by... Comments Architecture Targets or resources in your organization may have different people responsible for their well-being. Common segments may include the environment type (production, staging, integration, development) or the target or resource type (app server code, client-side code, databases, hosts, etc.). To make these types of policies easier to identify, you can give them names based on your architecture. For example: Product A website (production) Product B website (staging) Mobile product app (iOS) Hosts (production) Databases (production) Teams Specific teams may be responsible for parts of your architecture. For example, you may want to name their policy Team: Site engineering, Team: Website development, etc. Individuals Policies set up for specific individuals may be useful when they want to personally keep an eye on a particular resource or metric. This provides them the freedom to add and remove conditions as well as adjust thresholds whenever they want, without having to communicate those changes to others. To make these policies easier to identify, you can include the person's name; for example, User: John Doe's metrics, User: Jane Doe (production), etc. Create an alert policy As part of the policy workflow, start by giving the policy a meaningful name: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Policies. On the policy index page, click New alert policy. Type a meaningful name for the policy (maximum 64 characters). Select the incident preference. Select Create alert policy. You can continue from here to define the conditions and assign one or more notification channels. If you decide to continue later, select the policy name from the Alert policies index. Change a policy name For your convenience, we allow you to use the same name for different policies, conditions, and notification channels. If you want to use unique names, review or search the index before adding or changing a name. To rename an existing policy: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Policies, and then (select a policy). Click the policy name to edit it, then type a meaningful name for the policy (maximum 64 characters). Alerts automatically updates any of the policy's conditions and notification channels. View existing policies The policies index lists policies in alphabetical order. To view or search for existing policies: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Policies. Use the search box, sort any column, or scroll the list. To view detailed information, click a policy name. Tip To view policy and condition information for a specific entity, select the Settings > Alert conditions page from the entity's product UI. Policy maintenance quick reference After you create a policy, you can: Add more conditions to the policy. Edit the conditions' names, targets, or thresholds. Disable conditions. Add one or more notification channels to a policy. Rename or delete the policy. The user interface shows a Last modified timestamp for any changes to policies, including their conditions and notification channels. Here is a quick reference which also includes links to more detailed information and procedures for maintaining your policies. Add or remove policies assigned to a channel To add or remove policies assigned to a channel: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Notification channels, then (select a channel). Click Alert policies, then (select a policy). From the selected policy, use the windows to select, remove, or clear all. Change a policy name To rename a policy: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, then (select a policy). Click the policy name to edit it, then type a meaningful name for the policy (maximum 64 characters). Check policy user assignment To check whether an account user has been assigned any policies: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Policies, (select a policy), then click Notification channels. Select a user, and then click Alert policies. Check policy channel assignment To check whether a notification channel has any policies assigned to it: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Notification channels. The Policy subscriptions column lists how many policies are assigned to the channel. Create a new policy To create a new alert policy: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Policies. Click New alert policy. Follow standard procedures to complete the basic setup process. Disable a policy You can't disable a policy directly. However, you can disable all of the policy's conditions. When you disable all of the conditions, the policy remains the Alert policies index. The policy itself isn't disabled, and you can re-enable any or all of its conditions at any time. Delete a policy If you delete a policy, we'll continue to apply any other policies assigned to the product entity (target). If you remove all policies for the entity, its color-coded health status indicator will appear light green with an icon. If you delete any of your account's policies, you can't restore them. Instead, you must re-create them if necessary. To delete a policy completely: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Alert policies. From the policy row, click the delete icon. Any notification channels associated with a deleted or disabled policy will remain. You must delete notification channels or remove them individually as necessary. In a deleted policy, incidents and event violations are provided as a read only resource. Check for entities (targets) assigned to a policy To check whether an entity (target) has any policies assigned: Go to the product (APM, browser, etc.). From the selected product's index, check whether the entity's color-coded health status is light green with an icon. Tip Exception: Infrastructure does not use this feature. Change how threshold violations roll up into incidents To select how violations to your thresholds are grouped into incident records (by policy, by condition, or by target and condition): In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, then (select a policy). Click Incident preference. Get context for alert violations with Incident Intelligence If you use Applied Intelligence, you can connect your conditions to Incident Intelligence. From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources and then click Alerts. Select the policies you want to connect to Applied Intelligence, and click Connect. You can add additional alerts policies or remove policies you've already connected in Sources > New Relic Alerts.",

      "body": "For some types of conditions, you can define a custom violation description that passes useful information downstream for better violation responses or for use by other systems. You can create a custom violation description in the UI or with NRQL. Requirements The custom violation description feature is available for: NRQL alert conditions Infrastructure monitoring alert conditions The custom violation description field has a maximum character size of 4000. What is a custom violation description? For some types of conditions, you can create a custom violation description that passes information about a condition and its violations downstream. Using a description, you can: Capture the reason for the condition Define the signal being monitored Define next steps Add metadata to downstream systems The Custom violation description field allows you to use a general template structure that, when a violation is generated, substitutes the generic sections with specific values. For example, let's say you used this in a description: This is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tag.fullHostname}} Copy A violation resulting from this condition would fill in the details and you'd receive a notification like this: This is my condition name : My Great Alert Condition The hostname is : ip-123-45-67-89.us-west-1.compute.internal Copy Create a custom violation description In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, (select a policy), then (select a condition): Click + Add custom violation description to open the field.

Here are some details about the available attributes and how to use them: Violation event attributes: For any of the standard attributes available for use in a custom violation description, use the format {{AN_ATTRIBUTE}}. For example: The target name is : {{targetName}} Copy Tag attributes: For tags, you would use the format {{tag.TAG_NAME}}. There are two types of tags: Entity-related tags: For Infrastructure conditions only. You can find available entity-related tags by going to the New Relic Explorer and looking under a service's Metadata and tags, or by viewing violation details. Here's an example of using tags in a custom violation description: The AWS region is : {{tag.aws.awsRegion}} Responsible team : {{tag.label.owning_team}} Copy Facet clause tags: For NRQL conditions only. If a NRQL condition uses a FACET clause, you can use tag formatting to use those values in your custom violation description.

      "body": "A policy is a group of one or more conditions. This document explains how to create a policy and how to view existing policies. You can also use the REST API. For an explanation of how policies interact with conditions and other components, see Concepts and workflow. Tip The basic setup process is the same, regardless of which product (APM, browser, etc.) uses the policy. The types of metrics and thresholds for conditions vary depending on the monitored data source. Best practices for naming policies We recommend three common patterns and practices for structuring and naming policies: Targets or resources in your architecture that have people responsible for their well being Teams that are responsible for part of the architecture Individual policies for specific users Policies organized by... Comments Architecture Targets or resources in your organization may have different people responsible for their well-being. Common segments may include the environment type (production, staging, integration, development) or the target or resource type (app server code, client-side code, databases, hosts, etc.). To make these types of policies easier to identify, you can give them names based on your architecture. For example: Product A website (production) Product B website (staging) Mobile product app (iOS) Hosts (production) Databases (production) Teams Specific teams may be responsible for parts of your architecture. For example, you may want to name their policy Team: Site engineering, Team: Website development, etc. Individuals Policies set up for specific individuals may be useful when they want to personally keep an eye on a particular resource or metric. This provides them the freedom to add and remove conditions as well as adjust thresholds whenever they want, without having to communicate those changes to others. To make these policies easier to identify, you can include the person's name; for example, User: John Doe's metrics, User: Jane Doe (production), etc. Create an alert policy As part of the policy workflow, start by giving the policy a meaningful name: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Policies. On the policy index page, click New alert policy. Type a meaningful name for the policy (maximum 64 characters). Select the incident preference. Select Create alert policy. You can continue from here to define the conditions and assign one or more notification channels. If you decide to continue later, select the policy name from the Alert policies index. Change a policy name For your convenience, we allow you to use the same name for different policies, conditions, and notification channels. If you want to use unique names, review or search the index before adding or changing a name. To rename an existing policy: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Policies, and then (select a policy). Click the policy name to edit it, then type a meaningful name for the policy (maximum 64 characters). Alerts automatically updates any of the policy's conditions and notification channels. View existing policies The policies index lists policies in alphabetical order. To view or search for existing policies: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Policies. Use the search box, sort any column, or scroll the list. To view detailed information, click a policy name. Tip To view policy and condition information for a specific entity, select the Settings > Alert conditions page from the entity's product UI. Policy maintenance quick reference After you create a policy, you can: Add more conditions to the policy. Edit the conditions' names, targets, or thresholds. Disable conditions. Add one or more notification channels to a policy. Rename or delete the policy. The user interface shows a Last modified timestamp for any changes to policies, including their conditions and notification channels. Here is a quick reference which also includes links to more detailed information and procedures for maintaining your policies. Add or remove policies assigned to a channel To add or remove policies assigned to a channel: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Notification channels, then (select a channel). Click Alert policies, then (select a policy). From the selected policy, use the windows to select, remove, or clear all. Change a policy name To rename a policy: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, then (select a policy). Click the policy name to edit it, then type a meaningful name for the policy (maximum 64 characters). Check policy user assignment To check whether an account user has been assigned any policies: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Policies, (select a policy), then click Notification channels. Select a user, and then click Alert policies. Check policy channel assignment To check whether a notification channel has any policies assigned to it: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Notification channels. The Policy subscriptions column lists how many policies are assigned to the channel. Create a new policy To create a new alert policy: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Policies. Click New alert policy. Follow standard procedures to complete the basic setup process. Disable a policy You can't disable a policy directly. However, you can disable all of the policy's conditions. When you disable all of the conditions, the policy remains the Alert policies index. The policy itself isn't disabled, and you can re-enable any or all of its conditions at any time. Delete a policy If you delete a policy, we'll continue to apply any other policies assigned to the product entity (target). If you remove all policies for the entity, its color-coded health status indicator will appear light green with an icon. If you delete any of your account's policies, you can't restore them. Instead, you must re-create them if necessary. To delete a policy completely: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Alert policies. From the policy row, click the delete icon. Any notification channels associated with a deleted or disabled policy will remain. You must delete notification channels or remove them individually as necessary. In a deleted policy, incidents and event violations are provided as a read only resource. Check for entities (targets) assigned to a policy To check whether an entity (target) has any policies assigned: Go to the product (APM, browser, etc.). From the selected product's index, check whether the entity's color-coded health status is light green with an icon. Tip Exception: Infrastructure does not use this feature. Change how threshold violations roll up into incidents To select how violations to your thresholds are grouped into incident records (by policy, by condition, or by target and condition): In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, then (select a policy). Click Incident preference. Get context for alert violations with Incident Intelligence If you use Applied Intelligence, you can connect your conditions to Incident Intelligence. From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources and then click Alerts. Select the policies you want to connect to Applied Intelligence, and click Connect. You can add additional alerts policies or remove policies you've already connected in Sources > New Relic Alerts.",

      "body": "For some types of conditions, you can define a custom violation description that passes useful information downstream for better violation responses or for use by other systems. You can create a custom violation description in the UI or with NRQL. Requirements The custom violation description feature is available for: NRQL alert conditions Infrastructure monitoring alert conditions The custom violation description field has a maximum character size of 4000. What is a custom violation description? For some types of conditions, you can create a custom violation description that passes information about a condition and its violations downstream. Using a description, you can: Capture the reason for the condition Define the signal being monitored Define next steps Add metadata to downstream systems The Custom violation description field allows you to use a general template structure that, when a violation is generated, substitutes the generic sections with specific values. For example, let's say you used this in a description: This is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tag.fullHostname}} Copy A violation resulting from this condition would fill in the details and you'd receive a notification like this: This is my condition name : My Great Alert Condition The hostname is : ip-123-45-67-89.us-west-1.compute.internal Copy Create a custom violation description In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, (select a policy), then (select a condition): Click + Add custom violation description to open the field. For a condition, you can create a custom violation description using this field. Custom violation description template example Here's a custom violation description template example: this is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tag.fullHostname}} Owning Team: {{tag.label.owning_team}} Product: {{tag.label.product}} ec2VpcId: {{tag.aws.ec2VpcId}} Service name : {{tag.label.Name}} AWS Region : {{tag.aws.awsRegion}} AWS Availability Zone: {{tag.aws.awsAvailabilityZone}} Department : {{tag.label.department}} Environment: {{tag.label.environment}} Cluster: {{tag.clusterName}} Cluster Role: {{tag.clusterRole}} EC2 Instance Type: {{tag.instanceType}} EC2 InstanceID: {{tag.aws.ec2InstanceId}} EC2 AmiId: {{tag.aws.ec2AmiId}} EC2 Root Device Type: {{tag.aws.ec2RootDeviceType}} Copy Here's how that data might appear in a notification: How to use attributes The attributes you can use in a custom violation description are a subset of attributes attached to the violation event. Here are some details about the available attributes and how to use them: Violation event attributes: For any of the standard attributes available for use in a custom violation description, use the format {{AN_ATTRIBUTE}}. For example: The target name is : {{targetName}} Copy Tag attributes: For tags, you would use the format {{tag.TAG_NAME}}. There are two types of tags: Entity-related tags: For Infrastructure conditions only. You can find available entity-related tags by going to the New Relic Explorer and looking under a service's Metadata and tags, or by viewing violation details. Here's an example of using tags in a custom violation description: The AWS region is : {{tag.aws.awsRegion}} Responsible team : {{tag.label.owning_team}} Copy Facet clause tags: For NRQL conditions only. If a NRQL condition uses a FACET clause, you can use tag formatting to use those values in your custom violation description. For example, if the NRQL query included FACET hostName, cluster, you could then use this: The host is : {{tag.hostName}} The cluster is : {{tag.cluster}} Copy Please note that tag names cannot include a whitespace. The expanded values can include a whitespace, but not the names of the tags themselves. Create a custom violation description with NRQL You can create a custom violation description using a NRQL alert condition by creating a mutation with a description. Here's an empty mutation template: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: \"YOUR_CONDITION_ID\", condition: {description: \"\"}) { YOUR_CUSTOM_VIOLATION_DESCRIPTION } } Copy Here's an example mutation with a custom violation description: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: 123456, id: \"123456\", condition: {description: \"timestamp : {{timestamp}} \\n accountId : {{accountId}} \\n type : {{type}} \\n event : {{event}} \\n description : {{description}} \\n policyId : {{policyId}} \\n policyName: {{policyName}} \\n conditionName : {{conditionName}} \\n conditionId : {{conditionId}} \\n product : {{product}} \\n conditionType : {{conditionType}} \\n RunbookUrl : {{runbookUrl}} \\n nrqlQuery : {{nrqlQuery}} \\n nrqlEventType : {{nrqlEventType}} \\n targetID : {{targetId}} \\n targetName : {{targetName}} \\n commandLine : {{tag.commandLine}} \\n entityGuid : {{tag.entityGuid}} \\n entityName : {{tag.entityName}} \\n fullHostname : {{tag.fullHostname}} \\n instanceType : {{tag.instanceType}} \\n processDisplayName : {{tag.processDisplayName}}\"}) { description } } Copy For more information on NRQL conditions and using the NerdGraph API, go to NerdGraph API: NRQL condition alerts. For Infrastructure monitoring conditions, you can create the custom violation description when creating an Infrastructure monitoring alert condition. To learn about how to structure a custom violation description, see the example template and the attribute/tag instructions. Mentioning users or notifying channel in Slack When creating a description that you know will be sent to Slack, you may wish to @mention a user or generate a channel-wide notification (e.g. @here or @channel). To achieve this, simply include the User ID or a channel-wide notification in the description surrounded by < and > characters. Here's an example for mentioning a user: Attention <@LewCirne> Copy Here's an example for generating a channel-wide notification: Attention <!channel> Copy Important Note that the Slack convention for channel-wide notifications in Incoming Webhooks is to use a ! prefix instead of @ e.g. !here or !channel For more help Recommendations for learning more: To learn more about NerdGraph, see Introduction to NerdGraph.

Follow standard procedures to complete the basic setup process. Disable a policy You can't disable a policy directly. However, you can disable all of the policy's conditions. When you disable all of the conditions, the policy remains the Alert policies index. The policy itself isn't disabled, and you can re-enable any or all of its conditions at any time. Delete a policy If you delete a policy, we'll continue to apply any other policies assigned to the product entity (target). If you remove all policies for the entity, its color-coded health status indicator will appear light green with an icon. If you delete any of your account's policies, you can't restore them. Instead, you must re-create them if necessary. To delete a policy completely: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Alert policies. From the policy row, click the delete icon. Any notification channels associated with a deleted or disabled policy will remain. You must delete notification channels or remove them individually as necessary. In a deleted policy, incidents and event violations are provided as a read only resource. Check for entities (targets) assigned to a policy To check whether an entity (target) has any policies assigned: Go to the product (APM, browser, etc.). From the selected product's index, check whether the entity's color-coded health status is light green with an icon. Tip Exception: Infrastructure does not use this feature. Change how threshold violations roll up into incidents To select how violations to your thresholds are grouped into incident records (by policy, by condition, or by target and condition): In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, then (select a policy). Click Incident preference. Get context for alert violations with Incident Intelligence If you use Applied Intelligence, you can connect your conditions to Incident Intelligence.

      "body": "For some types of conditions, you can define a custom violation description that passes useful information downstream for better violation responses or for use by other systems. You can create a custom violation description in the UI or with NRQL. Requirements The custom violation description feature is available for: NRQL alert conditions Infrastructure monitoring alert conditions The custom violation description field has a maximum character size of 4000. What is a custom violation description? For some types of conditions, you can create a custom violation description that passes information about a condition and its violations downstream. Using a description, you can: Capture the reason for the condition Define the signal being monitored Define next steps Add metadata to downstream systems The Custom violation description field allows you to use a general template structure that, when a violation is generated, substitutes the generic sections with specific values. For example, let's say you used this in a description: This is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tag.fullHostname}} Copy A violation resulting from this condition would fill in the details and you'd receive a notification like this: This is my condition name : My Great Alert Condition The hostname is : ip-123-45-67-89.us-west-1.compute.internal Copy Create a custom violation description In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, (select a policy), then (select a condition): Click + Add custom violation description to open the field. For a condition, you can create a custom violation description using this field. Custom violation description template example Here's a custom violation description template example: this is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tag.fullHostname}} Owning Team: {{tag.label.owning_team}} Product: {{tag.label.product}} ec2VpcId: {{tag.aws.ec2VpcId}} Service name : {{tag.label.Name}} AWS Region : {{tag.aws.awsRegion}} AWS Availability Zone: {{tag.aws.awsAvailabilityZone}} Department : {{tag.label.department}} Environment: {{tag.label.environment}} Cluster: {{tag.clusterName}} Cluster Role: {{tag.clusterRole}} EC2 Instance Type: {{tag.instanceType}} EC2 InstanceID: {{tag.aws.ec2InstanceId}} EC2 AmiId: {{tag.aws.ec2AmiId}} EC2 Root Device Type: {{tag.aws.ec2RootDeviceType}} Copy Here's how that data might appear in a notification: How to use attributes The attributes you can use in a custom violation description are a subset of attributes attached to the violation event. Here are some details about the available attributes and how to use them: Violation event attributes: For any of the standard attributes available for use in a custom violation description, use the format {{AN_ATTRIBUTE}}. For example: The target name is : {{targetName}} Copy Tag attributes: For tags, you would use the format {{tag.TAG_NAME}}. There are two types of tags: Entity-related tags: For Infrastructure conditions only. You can find available entity-related tags by going to the New Relic Explorer and looking under a service's Metadata and tags, or by viewing violation details. Here's an example of using tags in a custom violation description: The AWS region is : {{tag.aws.awsRegion}} Responsible team : {{tag.label.owning_team}} Copy Facet clause tags: For NRQL conditions only. If a NRQL condition uses a FACET clause, you can use tag formatting to use those values in your custom violation description. For example, if the NRQL query included FACET hostName, cluster, you could then use this: The host is : {{tag.hostName}} The cluster is : {{tag.cluster}} Copy Please note that tag names cannot include a whitespace. The expanded values can include a whitespace, but not the names of the tags themselves. Create a custom violation description with NRQL You can create a custom violation description using a NRQL alert condition by creating a mutation with a description. Here's an empty mutation template: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: \"YOUR_CONDITION_ID\", condition: {description: \"\"}) { YOUR_CUSTOM_VIOLATION_DESCRIPTION } } Copy Here's an example mutation with a custom violation description: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: 123456, id: \"123456\", condition: {description: \"timestamp : {{timestamp}} \\n accountId : {{accountId}} \\n type : {{type}} \\n event : {{event}} \\n description : {{description}} \\n policyId : {{policyId}} \\n policyName: {{policyName}} \\n conditionName : {{conditionName}} \\n conditionId : {{conditionId}} \\n product : {{product}} \\n conditionType : {{conditionType}} \\n RunbookUrl : {{runbookUrl}} \\n nrqlQuery : {{nrqlQuery}} \\n nrqlEventType : {{nrqlEventType}} \\n targetID : {{targetId}} \\n targetName : {{targetName}} \\n commandLine : {{tag.commandLine}} \\n entityGuid : {{tag.entityGuid}} \\n entityName : {{tag.entityName}} \\n fullHostname : {{tag.fullHostname}} \\n instanceType : {{tag.instanceType}} \\n processDisplayName : {{tag.processDisplayName}}\"}) { description } } Copy For more information on NRQL conditions and using the NerdGraph API, go to NerdGraph API: NRQL condition alerts. For Infrastructure monitoring conditions, you can create the custom violation description when creating an Infrastructure monitoring alert condition. To learn about how to structure a custom violation description, see the example template and the attribute/tag instructions. Mentioning users or notifying channel in Slack When creating a description that you know will be sent to Slack, you may wish to @mention a user or generate a channel-wide notification (e.g. @here or @channel). To achieve this, simply include the User ID or a channel-wide notification in the description surrounded by < and > characters. Here's an example for mentioning a user: Attention <@LewCirne> Copy Here's an example for generating a channel-wide notification: Attention <!channel> Copy Important Note that the Slack convention for channel-wide notifications in Incoming Webhooks is to use a ! prefix instead of @ e.g. !here or !channel For more help Recommendations for learning more: To learn more about NerdGraph, see Introduction to NerdGraph.

      "body": "Loss of signal occurs when New Relic stops receiving data for a while; technically, we detect loss of signal after a significant amount of time has elapsed since data was last received in a time series. Loss of signal can be used to trigger or resolve a violation, which you can use to set up alerts. Gap filling can help you solve issues caused by lost data points. When gaps are detected between valid data points, we automatically fill those gaps with replacement values, such as the last known values or a static value. Gap filling can prevent alerts from triggering or resolving when they shouldn't. Tip The alerts system fills gaps in actively reported signals. This signal history is dropped after 2 hours of inactivity. For gap filling, data points received after this period of inactivity are treated as new signals. To learn more about signal loss, gap filling, and how to request access to these features, see this Explorers Hub post. You can customize loss of signal detection and gap filling using NerdGraph. For example, you can configure how long to wait before considering the signal lost, or what value should be used for filling gaps in the time series. Here are some queries and examples you can use in our NerdGraph API explorer. In this guide we cover the following: Customize loss of signal detection Customize gap filling Customize your loss of signal detection Loss of signal detection opens or closes violations if no data is received after a certain amount of time. For example, if you set the duration of the expiration period to 60 seconds and an integration doesn't seem to send data for more than a minute, a loss of signal violation would be triggered. You can configure the duration of the signal loss and whether to open a violation or close it by using these three fields in NerdGraph: expiration.expirationDuration: How long to wait, in seconds, after the last data point is received by our platform before considering the signal as lost. This is based on the time when data arrives at our platform and not on data timestamps. The default is to leave this null, and therefore this wouldn't enable Loss of Signal Detection. expiration.openViolationOnExpiration: If true, a new violation is opened when a signal is lost. Default is false. To use this field, a duration must be specified. expiration.closeViolationsOnExpiration: If true, open violations related to the signal are closed on expiration. Default is false. To use this field, a duration must be specified. View loss of signal settings for an existing condition Existing NRQL conditions may have their loss of signal settings already configured. To view the existing condition settings, select the fields under nrqlCondition > expiration: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlCondition(id: NRQL_CONDITION_ID) { ... on AlertsNrqlStaticCondition { id name nrql { query } expiration { closeViolationsOnExpiration expirationDuration openViolationOnExpiration } } } } } } } Copy You should see a result like this: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"alerts\": { \"nrqlCondition\": { \"expiration\": { \" closeViolationsOnExpiration \": false, \" expirationDuration \": 300, \" openViolationOnExpiration \": true }, \"id\": \"YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID\", \"name\": \"Any less than - Extrapolation\", \"nrql\": { \"query\": \"SELECT average(value) FROM AlertsSmokeTestSignals WHERE wave_type IN ('min-max', 'single-gap') FACET wave_type\" } } } } } }, ... Copy Create a new condition with loss of signal settings Let's say that you want to create a new create a NRQL static condition that triggers a loss of signal violation after no data is received for two minutes. You would set expirationDuration to 120 seconds and set openViolationOnExpiration to true, like in the example below. mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticCreate( accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID policyId: YOUR_POLICY_ID condition: { name: \"Low Host Count - Catastrophic\" enabled: true nrql: { query: \"SELECT uniqueCount(host) from Transaction where appName='my-app-name'\" } signal { aggregationWindow: 60 evaluationOffset: 3 } terms: [{ threshold: 2 thresholdOccurrences: AT_LEAST_ONCE thresholdDuration: 600 operator: BELOW priority: CRITICAL }] valueFunction: SINGLE_VALUE violationTimeLimitSeconds: 86400 expiration : { expirationDuration : 120 openViolationOnExpiration : true } } ) { id name } } Copy Update the loss of signal settings of a condition What if you want to update loss of signal parameters for an alert condition? The following mutation allows you to update a NRQL static condition with new expiration values. mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate( accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID id: YOUR_STATIC_CONDITION_ID condition: { expiration: { closeViolationsOnExpiration : BOOLEAN expirationDuration : DURATION_IN_SECONDS openViolationOnExpiration : BOOLEAN } } ) { id expiration { closeViolationsOnExpiration expirationDuration openViolationOnExpiration } } } Copy Customize gap filling Gap filling replaces gap values in a time series with either the last value found or a static, arbitrary value of your choice. We fill gaps only after another data point has been received after the gaps in signal (after data reception has been restored). You can configure both the type of filling and the value, if the type is set to static: signal.fillOption: Type of replacement value for lost data points. Values can be: NONE: Gap filling is disabled. LAST_VALUE: The last value seen in the time series. STATIC: An arbitrary value, defined in fillValue. signal.fillValue: Value to use for replacing lost data points when fillOption is set to STATIC. Important Gap filling is also affected by expiration.expirationDuration. When a gap is longer than the expiration duration, the signal is considered expired and the gap will no longer be filled. For example, here's how to create a static NRQL condition with gap filling configured: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticCreate( accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID policyId: YOUR_POLICY_ID condition: { enabled: true name: \"Example Gap Filling Condition\" nrql: { query: \"select count(*) from Transaction\" } terms: { operator: ABOVE priority: CRITICAL threshold: 1000 thresholdDuration: 300 thresholdOccurrences: ALL } valueFunction: SINGLE_VALUE violationTimeLimitSeconds: 28800 signal: { aggregationWindow: 60, evaluationOffset: 3, fillOption: STATIC, fillValue: 1 } } ) { id } } Copy",

      "body": "For some types of conditions, you can define a custom violation description that passes useful information downstream for better violation responses or for use by other systems. You can create a custom violation description in the UI or with NRQL. Requirements The custom violation description feature is available for: NRQL alert conditions Infrastructure monitoring alert conditions The custom violation description field has a maximum character size of 4000. What is a custom violation description? For some types of conditions, you can create a custom violation description that passes information about a condition and its violations downstream. Using a description, you can: Capture the reason for the condition Define the signal being monitored Define next steps Add metadata to downstream systems The Custom violation description field allows you to use a general template structure that, when a violation is generated, substitutes the generic sections with specific values. For example, let's say you used this in a description: This is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tag.fullHostname}} Copy A violation resulting from this condition would fill in the details and you'd receive a notification like this: This is my condition name : My Great Alert Condition The hostname is : ip-123-45-67-89.us-west-1.compute.internal Copy Create a custom violation description In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, (select a policy), then (select a condition): Click + Add custom violation description to open the field. For a condition, you can create a custom violation description using this field. Custom violation description template example Here's a custom violation description template example: this is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tag.fullHostname}} Owning Team: {{tag.label.owning_team}} Product: {{tag.label.product}} ec2VpcId: {{tag.aws.ec2VpcId}} Service name : {{tag.label.Name}} AWS Region : {{tag.aws.awsRegion}} AWS Availability Zone: {{tag.aws.awsAvailabilityZone}} Department : {{tag.label.department}} Environment: {{tag.label.environment}} Cluster: {{tag.clusterName}} Cluster Role: {{tag.clusterRole}} EC2 Instance Type: {{tag.instanceType}} EC2 InstanceID: {{tag.aws.ec2InstanceId}} EC2 AmiId: {{tag.aws.ec2AmiId}} EC2 Root Device Type: {{tag.aws.ec2RootDeviceType}} Copy Here's how that data might appear in a notification: How to use attributes The attributes you can use in a custom violation description are a subset of attributes attached to the violation event. Here are some details about the available attributes and how to use them: Violation event attributes: For any of the standard attributes available for use in a custom violation description, use the format {{AN_ATTRIBUTE}}. For example: The target name is : {{targetName}} Copy Tag attributes: For tags, you would use the format {{tag.TAG_NAME}}. There are two types of tags: Entity-related tags: For Infrastructure conditions only. You can find available entity-related tags by going to the New Relic Explorer and looking under a service's Metadata and tags, or by viewing violation details. Here's an example of using tags in a custom violation description: The AWS region is : {{tag.aws.awsRegion}} Responsible team : {{tag.label.owning_team}} Copy Facet clause tags: For NRQL conditions only. If a NRQL condition uses a FACET clause, you can use tag formatting to use those values in your custom violation description. For example, if the NRQL query included FACET hostName, cluster, you could then use this: The host is : {{tag.hostName}} The cluster is : {{tag.cluster}} Copy Please note that tag names cannot include a whitespace. The expanded values can include a whitespace, but not the names of the tags themselves. Create a custom violation description with NRQL You can create a custom violation description using a NRQL alert condition by creating a mutation with a description. Here's an empty mutation template: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: \"YOUR_CONDITION_ID\", condition: {description: \"\"}) { YOUR_CUSTOM_VIOLATION_DESCRIPTION } } Copy Here's an example mutation with a custom violation description: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: 123456, id: \"123456\", condition: {description: \"timestamp : {{timestamp}} \\n accountId : {{accountId}} \\n type : {{type}} \\n event : {{event}} \\n description : {{description}} \\n policyId : {{policyId}} \\n policyName: {{policyName}} \\n conditionName : {{conditionName}} \\n conditionId : {{conditionId}} \\n product : {{product}} \\n conditionType : {{conditionType}} \\n RunbookUrl : {{runbookUrl}} \\n nrqlQuery : {{nrqlQuery}} \\n nrqlEventType : {{nrqlEventType}} \\n targetID : {{targetId}} \\n targetName : {{targetName}} \\n commandLine : {{tag.commandLine}} \\n entityGuid : {{tag.entityGuid}} \\n entityName : {{tag.entityName}} \\n fullHostname : {{tag.fullHostname}} \\n instanceType : {{tag.instanceType}} \\n processDisplayName : {{tag.processDisplayName}}\"}) { description } } Copy For more information on NRQL conditions and using the NerdGraph API, go to NerdGraph API: NRQL condition alerts. For Infrastructure monitoring conditions, you can create the custom violation description when creating an Infrastructure monitoring alert condition. To learn about how to structure a custom violation description, see the example template and the attribute/tag instructions. Mentioning users or notifying channel in Slack When creating a description that you know will be sent to Slack, you may wish to @mention a user or generate a channel-wide notification (e.g. @here or @channel). To achieve this, simply include the User ID or a channel-wide notification in the description surrounded by < and > characters. Here's an example for mentioning a user: Attention <@LewCirne> Copy Here's an example for generating a channel-wide notification: Attention <!channel> Copy Important Note that the Slack convention for channel-wide notifications in Incoming Webhooks is to use a ! prefix instead of @ e.g. !here or !channel For more help Recommendations for learning more: To learn more about NerdGraph, see Introduction to NerdGraph.

      "body": "Loss of signal occurs when New Relic stops receiving data for a while; technically, we detect loss of signal after a significant amount of time has elapsed since data was last received in a time series. Loss of signal can be used to trigger or resolve a violation, which you can use to set up alerts. Gap filling can help you solve issues caused by lost data points. When gaps are detected between valid data points, we automatically fill those gaps with replacement values, such as the last known values or a static value. Gap filling can prevent alerts from triggering or resolving when they shouldn't. Tip The alerts system fills gaps in actively reported signals. This signal history is dropped after 2 hours of inactivity. For gap filling, data points received after this period of inactivity are treated as new signals. To learn more about signal loss, gap filling, and how to request access to these features, see this Explorers Hub post. You can customize loss of signal detection and gap filling using NerdGraph. For example, you can configure how long to wait before considering the signal lost, or what value should be used for filling gaps in the time series. Here are some queries and examples you can use in our NerdGraph API explorer. In this guide we cover the following: Customize loss of signal detection Customize gap filling Customize your loss of signal detection Loss of signal detection opens or closes violations if no data is received after a certain amount of time. For example, if you set the duration of the expiration period to 60 seconds and an integration doesn't seem to send data for more than a minute, a loss of signal violation would be triggered. You can configure the duration of the signal loss and whether to open a violation or close it by using these three fields in NerdGraph: expiration.expirationDuration: How long to wait, in seconds, after the last data point is received by our platform before considering the signal as lost. This is based on the time when data arrives at our platform and not on data timestamps. The default is to leave this null, and therefore this wouldn't enable Loss of Signal Detection. expiration.openViolationOnExpiration: If true, a new violation is opened when a signal is lost. Default is false. To use this field, a duration must be specified. expiration.closeViolationsOnExpiration: If true, open violations related to the signal are closed on expiration. Default is false. To use this field, a duration must be specified. View loss of signal settings for an existing condition Existing NRQL conditions may have their loss of signal settings already configured. To view the existing condition settings, select the fields under nrqlCondition > expiration: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlCondition(id: NRQL_CONDITION_ID) { ... on AlertsNrqlStaticCondition { id name nrql { query } expiration { closeViolationsOnExpiration expirationDuration openViolationOnExpiration } } } } } } } Copy You should see a result like this: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"alerts\": { \"nrqlCondition\": { \"expiration\": { \" closeViolationsOnExpiration \": false, \" expirationDuration \": 300, \" openViolationOnExpiration \": true }, \"id\": \"YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID\", \"name\": \"Any less than - Extrapolation\", \"nrql\": { \"query\": \"SELECT average(value) FROM AlertsSmokeTestSignals WHERE wave_type IN ('min-max', 'single-gap') FACET wave_type\" } } } } } }, ... Copy Create a new condition with loss of signal settings Let's say that you want to create a new create a NRQL static condition that triggers a loss of signal violation after no data is received for two minutes. You would set expirationDuration to 120 seconds and set openViolationOnExpiration to true, like in the example below. mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticCreate( accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID policyId: YOUR_POLICY_ID condition: { name: \"Low Host Count - Catastrophic\" enabled: true nrql: { query: \"SELECT uniqueCount(host) from Transaction where appName='my-app-name'\" } signal { aggregationWindow: 60 evaluationOffset: 3 } terms: [{ threshold: 2 thresholdOccurrences: AT_LEAST_ONCE thresholdDuration: 600 operator: BELOW priority: CRITICAL }] valueFunction: SINGLE_VALUE violationTimeLimitSeconds: 86400 expiration : { expirationDuration : 120 openViolationOnExpiration : true } } ) { id name } } Copy Update the loss of signal settings of a condition What if you want to update loss of signal parameters for an alert condition? The following mutation allows you to update a NRQL static condition with new expiration values. mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate( accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID id: YOUR_STATIC_CONDITION_ID condition: { expiration: { closeViolationsOnExpiration : BOOLEAN expirationDuration : DURATION_IN_SECONDS openViolationOnExpiration : BOOLEAN } } ) { id expiration { closeViolationsOnExpiration expirationDuration openViolationOnExpiration } } } Copy Customize gap filling Gap filling replaces gap values in a time series with either the last value found or a static, arbitrary value of your choice. We fill gaps only after another data point has been received after the gaps in signal (after data reception has been restored). You can configure both the type of filling and the value, if the type is set to static: signal.fillOption: Type of replacement value for lost data points. Values can be: NONE: Gap filling is disabled. LAST_VALUE: The last value seen in the time series. STATIC: An arbitrary value, defined in fillValue. signal.fillValue: Value to use for replacing lost data points when fillOption is set to STATIC. Important Gap filling is also affected by expiration.expirationDuration. When a gap is longer than the expiration duration, the signal is considered expired and the gap will no longer be filled. For example, here's how to create a static NRQL condition with gap filling configured: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticCreate( accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID policyId: YOUR_POLICY_ID condition: { enabled: true name: \"Example Gap Filling Condition\" nrql: { query: \"select count(*) from Transaction\" } terms: { operator: ABOVE priority: CRITICAL threshold: 1000 thresholdDuration: 300 thresholdOccurrences: ALL } valueFunction: SINGLE_VALUE violationTimeLimitSeconds: 28800 signal: { aggregationWindow: 60, evaluationOffset: 3, fillOption: STATIC, fillValue: 1 } } ) { id } } Copy",

      "body": "For some types of conditions, you can define a custom violation description that passes useful information downstream for better violation responses or for use by other systems. You can create a custom violation description in the UI or with NRQL. Requirements The custom violation description feature is available for: NRQL alert conditions Infrastructure monitoring alert conditions The custom violation description field has a maximum character size of 4000. What is a custom violation description? For some types of conditions, you can create a custom violation description that passes information about a condition and its violations downstream. Using a description, you can: Capture the reason for the condition Define the signal being monitored Define next steps Add metadata to downstream systems The Custom violation description field allows you to use a general template structure that, when a violation is generated, substitutes the generic sections with specific values. For example, let's say you used this in a description: This is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tag.fullHostname}} Copy A violation resulting from this condition would fill in the details and you'd receive a notification like this: This is my condition name : My Great Alert Condition The hostname is : ip-123-45-67-89.us-west-1.compute.internal Copy Create a custom violation description In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, (select a policy), then (select a condition): Click + Add custom violation description to open the field. For a condition, you can create a custom violation description using this field. Custom violation description template example Here's a custom violation description template example: this is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tag.fullHostname}} Owning Team: {{tag.label.owning_team}} Product: {{tag.label.product}} ec2VpcId: {{tag.aws.ec2VpcId}} Service name : {{tag.label.Name}} AWS Region : {{tag.aws.awsRegion}} AWS Availability Zone: {{tag.aws.awsAvailabilityZone}} Department : {{tag.label.department}} Environment: {{tag.label.environment}} Cluster: {{tag.clusterName}} Cluster Role: {{tag.clusterRole}} EC2 Instance Type: {{tag.instanceType}} EC2 InstanceID: {{tag.aws.ec2InstanceId}} EC2 AmiId: {{tag.aws.ec2AmiId}} EC2 Root Device Type: {{tag.aws.ec2RootDeviceType}} Copy Here's how that data might appear in a notification: How to use attributes The attributes you can use in a custom violation description are a subset of attributes attached to the violation event. Here are some details about the available attributes and how to use them: Violation event attributes: For any of the standard attributes available for use in a custom violation description, use the format {{AN_ATTRIBUTE}}. For example: The target name is : {{targetName}} Copy Tag attributes: For tags, you would use the format {{tag.TAG_NAME}}. There are two types of tags: Entity-related tags: For Infrastructure conditions only. You can find available entity-related tags by going to the New Relic Explorer and looking under a service's Metadata and tags, or by viewing violation details. Here's an example of using tags in a custom violation description: The AWS region is : {{tag.aws.awsRegion}} Responsible team : {{tag.label.owning_team}} Copy Facet clause tags: For NRQL conditions only. If a NRQL condition uses a FACET clause, you can use tag formatting to use those values in your custom violation description. For example, if the NRQL query included FACET hostName, cluster, you could then use this: The host is : {{tag.hostName}} The cluster is : {{tag.cluster}} Copy Please note that tag names cannot include a whitespace. The expanded values can include a whitespace, but not the names of the tags themselves. Create a custom violation description with NRQL You can create a custom violation description using a NRQL alert condition by creating a mutation with a description. Here's an empty mutation template: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: \"YOUR_CONDITION_ID\", condition: {description: \"\"}) { YOUR_CUSTOM_VIOLATION_DESCRIPTION } } Copy Here's an example mutation with a custom violation description: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: 123456, id: \"123456\", condition: {description: \"timestamp : {{timestamp}} \\n accountId : {{accountId}} \\n type : {{type}} \\n event : {{event}} \\n description : {{description}} \\n policyId : {{policyId}} \\n policyName: {{policyName}} \\n conditionName : {{conditionName}} \\n conditionId : {{conditionId}} \\n product : {{product}} \\n conditionType : {{conditionType}} \\n RunbookUrl : {{runbookUrl}} \\n nrqlQuery : {{nrqlQuery}} \\n nrqlEventType : {{nrqlEventType}} \\n targetID : {{targetId}} \\n targetName : {{targetName}} \\n commandLine : {{tag.commandLine}} \\n entityGuid : {{tag.entityGuid}} \\n entityName : {{tag.entityName}} \\n fullHostname : {{tag.fullHostname}} \\n instanceType : {{tag.instanceType}} \\n processDisplayName : {{tag.processDisplayName}}\"}) { description } } Copy For more information on NRQL conditions and using the NerdGraph API, go to NerdGraph API: NRQL condition alerts. For Infrastructure monitoring conditions, you can create the custom violation description when creating an Infrastructure monitoring alert condition. To learn about how to structure a custom violation description, see the example template and the attribute/tag instructions. Mentioning users or notifying channel in Slack When creating a description that you know will be sent to Slack, you may wish to @mention a user or generate a channel-wide notification (e.g. @here or @channel). To achieve this, simply include the User ID or a channel-wide notification in the description surrounded by < and > characters. Here's an example for mentioning a user: Attention <@LewCirne> Copy Here's an example for generating a channel-wide notification: Attention <!channel> Copy Important Note that the Slack convention for channel-wide notifications in Incoming Webhooks is to use a ! prefix instead of @ e.g. !here or !channel For more help Recommendations for learning more: To learn more about NerdGraph, see Introduction to NerdGraph.

      "body": "You can manage alerts conditions using our GraphQL NerdGraph API. Here are some conditions queries and mutations you can develop in our NerdGraph API explorer. Tip See the NerdGraph introduction for help getting started with NerdGraph API explorer. This document covers the following: Steps to create a NRQL condition NRQL static condition NRQL baseline condition NRQL outlier condition Update a condition Update mutations List and filter NRQL conditions Singular NRQL condition queries Create a description Delete conditions Steps to create a NRQL condition Follow these steps: Decide which condition type you want to create (see NRQL Condition threshold types). Find your relevant policyID by doing one of the following: Use the NerdGraph policies API. Go to one.newrelic.com, in the top nav click Alerts & AI, then click Policies. Choose a policy. Find the ID under the policy name. Provide the appropriate mutation for your NRQL condition type and the relevant values. Tip The NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer is the best place to find up-to-date documentation about the per-field specifics of the NerdGraph NRQL Conditions API. For example, questions like \"What does the valueFunction field accept?\" are best answered with the inline NerdGraph documentation. NRQL static condition Here's an example of creating a static condition: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, policyId: YOUR_POLICY_ID, condition: { name: \"Low Host Count - Catastrophic\" enabled: true nrql: { query: \"SELECT uniqueCount(host) from Transaction where appName='my-app-name'\" } signal: { aggregationWindow: 60 evaluationOffset: 3 } terms: { threshold: 2 thresholdOccurrences: AT_LEAST_ONCE thresholdDuration: 600 operator: BELOW priority: CRITICAL } valueFunction: SINGLE_VALUE violationTimeLimitSeconds: 86400 }) { id name } } Copy NRQL baseline condition Here's an example of creating a baseline condition: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionBaselineCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, policyId: YOUR_POLICY_ID, condition: { name: \"Baseline Condition\" enabled: true baselineDirection: UPPER_ONLY nrql: { query: \"SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction\" } signal: { aggregationWindow: 60 evaluationOffset: 3 } terms: { threshold: 13 thresholdDuration: 180 thresholdOccurrences: ALL operator: ABOVE priority: CRITICAL } violationTimeLimitSeconds: 86400 }) { id name baselineDirection } } Copy NRQL outlier condition Here's an example of creating an outlier condition: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionOutlierCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, policyId: YOUR_POLICY_ID, condition: { name: \"Outlier Condition\" enabled: true expectedGroups: 4 openViolationOnGroupOverlap: false nrql: { query: \"SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction FACET httpResponseCode\" } signal: { aggregationWindow: 60 evaluationOffset: 3 } terms: { threshold: 1 thresholdDuration: 300 thresholdOccurrences: ALL operator: ABOVE priority: CRITICAL } violationTimeLimitSeconds: 86400 }) { id name expectedGroups openViolationOnGroupOverlap } } Copy Update a condition Complete the following: Determine the type of your existing condition by requesting the type field in a nrqlConditionsSearch query like this: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlConditionsSearch { nrqlConditions { id type } } } } } } Copy Tip The type returned is what you use for your update mutation. For example, if the type returned is STATIC, use alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate. If the type returned is BASELINE, use alertsNrqlConditionBaselineUpdate. If the type returned is OUTLIER, use alertsNrqlConditionOutlierUpdate. Provide the id of your condition to your relevant condition type mutation. Note that you can only update conditions of the relevant type. Only provide update mutations for the fields you want to update. Fields you don't provide in the update are not touched. Update mutations Only fields that you provide in the update are changed. In the following example, baselineDirection returns unchanged, but name is updated. mutation { alertsNrqlConditionBaselineUpdate(id: YOUR_CONDITION_ID, accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, condition: { name: \"Your updated name\" }) { id name baselineDirection } } Copy List and filter NRQL conditions To list or filter your NRQL conditions, use the nrqlConditionsSearch query in NerdGraph. Use cursor pagination The basic of list functionality for NRQL conditions allows you to paginate through your NRQL conditions as well as request the total count of conditions per account. The nrqlConditionsSearch query utilizes cursor pagination to paginate through resources. The idea behind cursor pagination is that the client will request a cursor in a programmatic loop until the cursor comes back empty. An initial list response will look something like this: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlConditionsSearch { nextCursor nrqlConditions { id name type } totalCount } } } } } Copy This example returns a JSON response like this: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"alerts\": { \"nrqlConditionsSearch\": { \"nextCursor\": \"WOwfJ4+TWm9QTFeKMGyg+w==:QqkI8S4+Wwnpno6z+uk8kQ==\", \"nrqlConditions\": [ { \"id\": \"4432\", \"name\": \"Baseline Condition\", \"type\": \"BASELINE\" }, { \"id\": \"443\", \"name\": \"A static condition\", \"type\": \"STATIC\" }, // more conditions here in reality ], \"totalCount\": 435 } } } } }, } Copy In order to paginate through conditions in the response, have the client request the cursor to be returned until the nextCursor returns from the response as null: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlConditionsSearch(cursor: \"WOwfJ4+TWm9QTFeKMGyg+w==:QqkI8S4+Wwnpno6z+uk8kQ==\", ) { nextCursor nrqlConditions { id name type } totalCount } } } } } Copy Request type-specific fields Certain fields are only available on specific NRQL condition types. The main reason that mutations are split between the different condition types is because they have minor differences between the fields they accept. For example, valueFunction is only relevant for static NRQL conditions and baselineDirection is only relevant on baseline NRQL conditions. But if these fields are only available on these certain condition types, how do we return them in a list of all of our condition types? The answer is a GraphQL convention known as inline fragments. Inline fragments allow you to access the data on a specific type of NRQL condition: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlConditionsSearch { nrqlConditions { id name type ...on AlertsNrqlStaticCondition { valueFunction } ...on AlertsNrqlBaselineCondition { baselineDirection } ...on AlertsNrqlOutlierCondition { expectedGroups } } } } } } } Copy In the previous example query, we are asking GraphQL to do the hard work for us to determine which NRQL conditions are the correct type. So, when the returned type is a static condition, it will return the valueFunction in the object. When the returned type is a baseline condition, it will return baselineDirection instead, and when the type is an outlier condition, it will return expectedGroups. Here is an example response: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"alerts\": { \"nrqlConditionsSearch\": { \"nrqlConditions\": [ { \"baselineDirection\": \"UPPER_ONLY\", \"id\": \"342\", \"name\": \"My baseline condition\", \"type\": \"BASELINE\" }, { \"id\": \"553\", \"name\": \"My static condition\", \"type\": \"STATIC\", \"valueFunction\": \"SINGLE_VALUE\" }, { \"expectedGroups\": 4, \"id\": \"802\", \"name\": \"My outlier condition\", \"type\": \"OUTLIER\" } ] } } } } } } Copy Filter NRQL conditions You can filter NRQL conditions with the searchCriteria argument of the nrqlConditionsSearch query: Here's an example of filtering NRQL conditions with matching by name. This query returns NRQL conditions that match the provided name. Note that this match is case insensitive. { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlConditionsSearch(searchCriteria: { name: \"Baseline Condition\" }) { nrqlConditions { id name type } } } } } } Copy Singular NRQL condition queries You can use the NRQL condition API to query for a singular condition. Run the nrqlCondition query in the alerts namespace. Similar to type specific fields on the nrqlConditionSearch query, you can also use these inline fragments to request fields that are restricted to a NRQL condition type. { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlCondition(id: YOUR_CONDITION_ID) { id name ...on AlertsNrqlStaticCondition { valueFunction } } } } } } Copy Update the description This will walk you through the procedure to create a description for a NRQL alert condition. Get all the conditions for a policy: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlConditions(policyId: YOUR_POLICY_ID) { nextCursor results { id name description enabled nrql { query } signal { aggregationWindow evaluationOffset } policyId runbookUrl terms { duration operator priority timeFunction threshold } type violationTimeLimitSeconds } } } } } } Copy Get the details for a single condition: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlCondition(id: \"YOUR_CONDITION_ID\") { description id enabled name nrql { query } signal { aggregationWindow evaluationOffset } policyId runbookUrl terms { operator priority threshold thresholdDuration thresholdOccurrences } type violationTimeLimitSeconds } } } } } Copy Create a mutation with the description. Here's an empty mutation template: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: \"YOUR_CONDITION_ID\", condition: {description: \"\"}) { description } } Copy Here's an example mutation with an included example description: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: 123456, id: \"123456\", condition: {description: \"timestamp : {{timestamp}} \\n accountId : {{accountId}} \\n type : {{type}} \\n event : {{event}} \\n description : {{description}} \\n policyId : {{policyId}} \\n policyName: {{policyName}} \\n conditionName : {{conditionName}} \\n conditionId : {{conditionId}} \\n product : {{product}} \\n conditionType : {{conditionType}} \\n RunbookUrl : {{runbookUrl}} \\n nrqlQuery : {{nrqlQuery}} \\n nrqlEventType : {{nrqlEventType}} \\n targetID : {{targetId}} \\n targetName : {{targetName}} \\n commandLine : {{tag.commandLine}} \\n entityGuid : {{tag.entityGuid}} \\n entityName : {{tag.entityName}} \\n fullHostname : {{tag.fullHostname}} \\n instanceType : {{tag.instanceType}} \\n processDisplayName : {{tag.processDisplayName}}\"}) { description } } Copy Delete conditions You can use the alertsConditionDelete mutation to delete any type of condition. You can only request the id field on a delete mutation; for example: mutation { alertsConditionDelete(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CONDITION_ID) { id } } Copy",

Requirements The custom violation description feature is available for: NRQL alert conditions Infrastructure monitoring alert conditions The custom violation description field has a maximum character size of 4000. What is a custom violation description? For some types of conditions, you can create a custom violation description that passes information about a condition and its violations downstream. Using a description, you can: Capture the reason for the condition Define the signal being monitored Define next steps Add metadata to downstream systems The Custom violation description field allows you to use a general template structure that, when a violation is generated, substitutes the generic sections with specific values. For example, let's say you used this in a description: This is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tag.fullHostname}} Copy A violation resulting from this condition would fill in the details and you'd receive a notification like this: This is my condition name : My Great Alert Condition The hostname is : ip-123-45-67-89.us-west-1.compute.internal Copy Create a custom violation description In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, (select a policy), then (select a condition): Click + Add custom violation description to open the field. For a condition, you can create a custom violation description using this field. Custom violation description template example Here's a custom violation description template example: this is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tag.fullHostname}} Owning Team: {{tag.label.owning_team}} Product: {{tag.label.product}} ec2VpcId: {{tag.aws.ec2VpcId}} Service name : {{tag.label.Name}} AWS Region : {{tag.aws.awsRegion}} AWS Availability Zone: {{tag.aws.awsAvailabilityZone}} Department : {{tag.label.department}} Environment: {{tag.label.environment}} Cluster: {{tag.clusterName}} Cluster Role: {{tag.clusterRole}} EC2 Instance Type: {{tag.instanceType}} EC2 InstanceID: {{tag.aws.ec2InstanceId}} EC2 AmiId: {{tag.aws.ec2AmiId}} EC2 Root Device Type: {{tag.aws.ec2RootDeviceType}} Copy Here's how that data might appear in a notification: How to use attributes The attributes you can use in a custom violation description are a subset of attributes attached to the violation event. Here are some details about the available attributes and how to use them: Violation event attributes: For any of the standard attributes available for use in a custom violation description, use the format {{AN_ATTRIBUTE}}. For example: The target name is : {{targetName}} Copy Tag attributes: For tags, you would use the format {{tag.TAG_NAME}}. There are two types of tags: Entity-related tags: For Infrastructure conditions only. You can find available entity-related tags by going to the New Relic Explorer and looking under a service's Metadata and tags, or by viewing violation details. Here's an example of using tags in a custom violation description: The AWS region is : {{tag.aws.awsRegion}} Responsible team : {{tag.label.owning_team}} Copy Facet clause tags: For NRQL conditions only. If a NRQL condition uses a FACET clause, you can use tag formatting to use those values in your custom violation description. For example, if the NRQL query included FACET hostName, cluster, you could then use this: The host is : {{tag.hostName}} The cluster is : {{tag.cluster}} Copy Please note that tag names cannot include a whitespace. The expanded values can include a whitespace, but not the names of the tags themselves. Create a custom violation description with NRQL You can create a custom violation description using a NRQL alert condition by creating a mutation with a description. Here's an empty mutation template: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: \"YOUR_CONDITION_ID\", condition: {description: \"\"}) { YOUR_CUSTOM_VIOLATION_DESCRIPTION } } Copy Here's an example mutation with a custom violation description: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: 123456, id: \"123456\", condition: {description: \"timestamp : {{timestamp}} \\n accountId : {{accountId}} \\n type : {{type}} \\n event : {{event}} \\n description : {{description}} \\n policyId : {{policyId}} \\n policyName: {{policyName}} \\n conditionName : {{conditionName}} \\n conditionId : {{conditionId}} \\n product : {{product}} \\n conditionType : {{conditionType}} \\n RunbookUrl : {{runbookUrl}} \\n nrqlQuery : {{nrqlQuery}} \\n nrqlEventType : {{nrqlEventType}} \\n targetID : {{targetId}} \\n targetName : {{targetName}} \\n commandLine : {{tag.commandLine}} \\n entityGuid : {{tag.entityGuid}} \\n entityName : {{tag.entityName}} \\n fullHostname : {{tag.fullHostname}} \\n instanceType : {{tag.instanceType}} \\n processDisplayName : {{tag.processDisplayName}}\"}) { description } } Copy For more information on NRQL conditions and using the NerdGraph API, go to NerdGraph API: NRQL condition alerts. For Infrastructure monitoring conditions, you can create the custom violation description when creating an Infrastructure monitoring alert condition. To learn about how to structure a custom violation description, see the example template and the attribute/tag instructions. Mentioning users or notifying channel in Slack When creating a description that you know will be sent to Slack, you may wish to @mention a user or generate a channel-wide notification (e.g. @here or @channel). To achieve this, simply include the User ID or a channel-wide notification in the description surrounded by < and > characters. Here's an example for mentioning a user: Attention <@LewCirne> Copy Here's an example for generating a channel-wide notification: Attention <!channel> Copy Important Note that the Slack convention for channel-wide notifications in Incoming Webhooks is to use a ! prefix instead of @ e.g. !here or !channel For more help Recommendations for learning more: To learn more about NerdGraph, see Introduction to NerdGraph.

      "body": "Loss of signal occurs when New Relic stops receiving data for a while; technically, we detect loss of signal after a significant amount of time has elapsed since data was last received in a time series. Loss of signal can be used to trigger or resolve a violation, which you can use to set up alerts. Gap filling can help you solve issues caused by lost data points. When gaps are detected between valid data points, we automatically fill those gaps with replacement values, such as the last known values or a static value. Gap filling can prevent alerts from triggering or resolving when they shouldn't. Tip The alerts system fills gaps in actively reported signals. This signal history is dropped after 2 hours of inactivity. For gap filling, data points received after this period of inactivity are treated as new signals. To learn more about signal loss, gap filling, and how to request access to these features, see this Explorers Hub post. You can customize loss of signal detection and gap filling using NerdGraph. For example, you can configure how long to wait before considering the signal lost, or what value should be used for filling gaps in the time series. Here are some queries and examples you can use in our NerdGraph API explorer. In this guide we cover the following: Customize loss of signal detection Customize gap filling Customize your loss of signal detection Loss of signal detection opens or closes violations if no data is received after a certain amount of time. For example, if you set the duration of the expiration period to 60 seconds and an integration doesn't seem to send data for more than a minute, a loss of signal violation would be triggered. You can configure the duration of the signal loss and whether to open a violation or close it by using these three fields in NerdGraph: expiration.expirationDuration: How long to wait, in seconds, after the last data point is received by our platform before considering the signal as lost. This is based on the time when data arrives at our platform and not on data timestamps. The default is to leave this null, and therefore this wouldn't enable Loss of Signal Detection. expiration.openViolationOnExpiration: If true, a new violation is opened when a signal is lost. Default is false. To use this field, a duration must be specified. expiration.closeViolationsOnExpiration: If true, open violations related to the signal are closed on expiration. Default is false. To use this field, a duration must be specified. View loss of signal settings for an existing condition Existing NRQL conditions may have their loss of signal settings already configured. To view the existing condition settings, select the fields under nrqlCondition > expiration: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlCondition(id: NRQL_CONDITION_ID) { ... on AlertsNrqlStaticCondition { id name nrql { query } expiration { closeViolationsOnExpiration expirationDuration openViolationOnExpiration } } } } } } } Copy You should see a result like this: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"alerts\": { \"nrqlCondition\": { \"expiration\": { \" closeViolationsOnExpiration \": false, \" expirationDuration \": 300, \" openViolationOnExpiration \": true }, \"id\": \"YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID\", \"name\": \"Any less than - Extrapolation\", \"nrql\": { \"query\": \"SELECT average(value) FROM AlertsSmokeTestSignals WHERE wave_type IN ('min-max', 'single-gap') FACET wave_type\" } } } } } }, ... Copy Create a new condition with loss of signal settings Let's say that you want to create a new create a NRQL static condition that triggers a loss of signal violation after no data is received for two minutes. You would set expirationDuration to 120 seconds and set openViolationOnExpiration to true, like in the example below. mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticCreate( accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID policyId: YOUR_POLICY_ID condition: { name: \"Low Host Count - Catastrophic\" enabled: true nrql: { query: \"SELECT uniqueCount(host) from Transaction where appName='my-app-name'\" } signal { aggregationWindow: 60 evaluationOffset: 3 } terms: [{ threshold: 2 thresholdOccurrences: AT_LEAST_ONCE thresholdDuration: 600 operator: BELOW priority: CRITICAL }] valueFunction: SINGLE_VALUE violationTimeLimitSeconds: 86400 expiration : { expirationDuration : 120 openViolationOnExpiration : true } } ) { id name } } Copy Update the loss of signal settings of a condition What if you want to update loss of signal parameters for an alert condition? The following mutation allows you to update a NRQL static condition with new expiration values. mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate( accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID id: YOUR_STATIC_CONDITION_ID condition: { expiration: { closeViolationsOnExpiration : BOOLEAN expirationDuration : DURATION_IN_SECONDS openViolationOnExpiration : BOOLEAN } } ) { id expiration { closeViolationsOnExpiration expirationDuration openViolationOnExpiration } } } Copy Customize gap filling Gap filling replaces gap values in a time series with either the last value found or a static, arbitrary value of your choice. We fill gaps only after another data point has been received after the gaps in signal (after data reception has been restored). You can configure both the type of filling and the value, if the type is set to static: signal.fillOption: Type of replacement value for lost data points. Values can be: NONE: Gap filling is disabled. LAST_VALUE: The last value seen in the time series. STATIC: An arbitrary value, defined in fillValue. signal.fillValue: Value to use for replacing lost data points when fillOption is set to STATIC. Important Gap filling is also affected by expiration.expirationDuration. When a gap is longer than the expiration duration, the signal is considered expired and the gap will no longer be filled. For example, here's how to create a static NRQL condition with gap filling configured: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticCreate( accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID policyId: YOUR_POLICY_ID condition: { enabled: true name: \"Example Gap Filling Condition\" nrql: { query: \"select count(*) from Transaction\" } terms: { operator: ABOVE priority: CRITICAL threshold: 1000 thresholdDuration: 300 thresholdOccurrences: ALL } valueFunction: SINGLE_VALUE violationTimeLimitSeconds: 28800 signal: { aggregationWindow: 60, evaluationOffset: 3, fillOption: STATIC, fillValue: 1 } } ) { id } } Copy",

      "body": "For some types of conditions, you can define a custom violation description that passes useful information downstream for better violation responses or for use by other systems. You can create a custom violation description in the UI or with NRQL. Requirements The custom violation description feature is available for: NRQL alert conditions Infrastructure monitoring alert conditions The custom violation description field has a maximum character size of 4000. What is a custom violation description? For some types of conditions, you can create a custom violation description that passes information about a condition and its violations downstream. Using a description, you can: Capture the reason for the condition Define the signal being monitored Define next steps Add metadata to downstream systems The Custom violation description field allows you to use a general template structure that, when a violation is generated, substitutes the generic sections with specific values. For example, let's say you used this in a description: This is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tag.fullHostname}} Copy A violation resulting from this condition would fill in the details and you'd receive a notification like this: This is my condition name : My Great Alert Condition The hostname is : ip-123-45-67-89.us-west-1.compute.internal Copy Create a custom violation description In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, (select a policy), then (select a condition): Click + Add custom violation description to open the field. For a condition, you can create a custom violation description using this field. Custom violation description template example Here's a custom violation description template example: this is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tag.fullHostname}} Owning Team: {{tag.label.owning_team}} Product: {{tag.label.product}} ec2VpcId: {{tag.aws.ec2VpcId}} Service name : {{tag.label.Name}} AWS Region : {{tag.aws.awsRegion}} AWS Availability Zone: {{tag.aws.awsAvailabilityZone}} Department : {{tag.label.department}} Environment: {{tag.label.environment}} Cluster: {{tag.clusterName}} Cluster Role: {{tag.clusterRole}} EC2 Instance Type: {{tag.instanceType}} EC2 InstanceID: {{tag.aws.ec2InstanceId}} EC2 AmiId: {{tag.aws.ec2AmiId}} EC2 Root Device Type: {{tag.aws.ec2RootDeviceType}} Copy Here's how that data might appear in a notification: How to use attributes The attributes you can use in a custom violation description are a subset of attributes attached to the violation event. Here are some details about the available attributes and how to use them: Violation event attributes: For any of the standard attributes available for use in a custom violation description, use the format {{AN_ATTRIBUTE}}. For example: The target name is : {{targetName}} Copy Tag attributes: For tags, you would use the format {{tag.TAG_NAME}}. There are two types of tags: Entity-related tags: For Infrastructure conditions only. You can find available entity-related tags by going to the New Relic Explorer and looking under a service's Metadata and tags, or by viewing violation details. Here's an example of using tags in a custom violation description: The AWS region is : {{tag.aws.awsRegion}} Responsible team : {{tag.label.owning_team}} Copy Facet clause tags: For NRQL conditions only. If a NRQL condition uses a FACET clause, you can use tag formatting to use those values in your custom violation description. For example, if the NRQL query included FACET hostName, cluster, you could then use this: The host is : {{tag.hostName}} The cluster is : {{tag.cluster}} Copy Please note that tag names cannot include a whitespace. The expanded values can include a whitespace, but not the names of the tags themselves. Create a custom violation description with NRQL You can create a custom violation description using a NRQL alert condition by creating a mutation with a description. Here's an empty mutation template: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: \"YOUR_CONDITION_ID\", condition: {description: \"\"}) { YOUR_CUSTOM_VIOLATION_DESCRIPTION } } Copy Here's an example mutation with a custom violation description: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: 123456, id: \"123456\", condition: {description: \"timestamp : {{timestamp}} \\n accountId : {{accountId}} \\n type : {{type}} \\n event : {{event}} \\n description : {{description}} \\n policyId : {{policyId}} \\n policyName: {{policyName}} \\n conditionName : {{conditionName}} \\n conditionId : {{conditionId}} \\n product : {{product}} \\n conditionType : {{conditionType}} \\n RunbookUrl : {{runbookUrl}} \\n nrqlQuery : {{nrqlQuery}} \\n nrqlEventType : {{nrqlEventType}} \\n targetID : {{targetId}} \\n targetName : {{targetName}} \\n commandLine : {{tag.commandLine}} \\n entityGuid : {{tag.entityGuid}} \\n entityName : {{tag.entityName}} \\n fullHostname : {{tag.fullHostname}} \\n instanceType : {{tag.instanceType}} \\n processDisplayName : {{tag.processDisplayName}}\"}) { description } } Copy For more information on NRQL conditions and using the NerdGraph API, go to NerdGraph API: NRQL condition alerts. For Infrastructure monitoring conditions, you can create the custom violation description when creating an Infrastructure monitoring alert condition. To learn about how to structure a custom violation description, see the example template and the attribute/tag instructions. Mentioning users or notifying channel in Slack When creating a description that you know will be sent to Slack, you may wish to @mention a user or generate a channel-wide notification (e.g. @here or @channel). To achieve this, simply include the User ID or a channel-wide notification in the description surrounded by < and > characters. Here's an example for mentioning a user: Attention <@LewCirne> Copy Here's an example for generating a channel-wide notification: Attention <!channel> Copy Important Note that the Slack convention for channel-wide notifications in Incoming Webhooks is to use a ! prefix instead of @ e.g. !here or !channel For more help Recommendations for learning more: To learn more about NerdGraph, see Introduction to NerdGraph.

      "body": "A policy is a group of one or more conditions. This document explains how to create a policy and how to view existing policies. You can also use the REST API. For an explanation of how policies interact with conditions and other components, see Concepts and workflow. Tip The basic setup process is the same, regardless of which product (APM, browser, etc.) uses the policy. The types of metrics and thresholds for conditions vary depending on the monitored data source. Best practices for naming policies We recommend three common patterns and practices for structuring and naming policies: Targets or resources in your architecture that have people responsible for their well being Teams that are responsible for part of the architecture Individual policies for specific users Policies organized by... Comments Architecture Targets or resources in your organization may have different people responsible for their well-being. Common segments may include the environment type (production, staging, integration, development) or the target or resource type (app server code, client-side code, databases, hosts, etc.). To make these types of policies easier to identify, you can give them names based on your architecture. For example: Product A website (production) Product B website (staging) Mobile product app (iOS) Hosts (production) Databases (production) Teams Specific teams may be responsible for parts of your architecture. For example, you may want to name their policy Team: Site engineering, Team: Website development, etc. Individuals Policies set up for specific individuals may be useful when they want to personally keep an eye on a particular resource or metric. This provides them the freedom to add and remove conditions as well as adjust thresholds whenever they want, without having to communicate those changes to others. To make these policies easier to identify, you can include the person's name; for example, User: John Doe's metrics, User: Jane Doe (production), etc. Create an alert policy As part of the policy workflow, start by giving the policy a meaningful name: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Policies. On the policy index page, click New alert policy. Type a meaningful name for the policy (maximum 64 characters). Select the incident preference. Select Create alert policy. You can continue from here to define the conditions and assign one or more notification channels. If you decide to continue later, select the policy name from the Alert policies index. Change a policy name For your convenience, we allow you to use the same name for different policies, conditions, and notification channels. If you want to use unique names, review or search the index before adding or changing a name. To rename an existing policy: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Policies, and then (select a policy). Click the policy name to edit it, then type a meaningful name for the policy (maximum 64 characters). Alerts automatically updates any of the policy's conditions and notification channels. View existing policies The policies index lists policies in alphabetical order. To view or search for existing policies: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Policies. Use the search box, sort any column, or scroll the list. To view detailed information, click a policy name. Tip To view policy and condition information for a specific entity, select the Settings > Alert conditions page from the entity's product UI. Policy maintenance quick reference After you create a policy, you can: Add more conditions to the policy. Edit the conditions' names, targets, or thresholds. Disable conditions. Add one or more notification channels to a policy. Rename or delete the policy. The user interface shows a Last modified timestamp for any changes to policies, including their conditions and notification channels. Here is a quick reference which also includes links to more detailed information and procedures for maintaining your policies. Add or remove policies assigned to a channel To add or remove policies assigned to a channel: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Notification channels, then (select a channel). Click Alert policies, then (select a policy). From the selected policy, use the windows to select, remove, or clear all. Change a policy name To rename a policy: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, then (select a policy). Click the policy name to edit it, then type a meaningful name for the policy (maximum 64 characters). Check policy user assignment To check whether an account user has been assigned any policies: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Policies, (select a policy), then click Notification channels. Select a user, and then click Alert policies. Check policy channel assignment To check whether a notification channel has any policies assigned to it: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Notification channels. The Policy subscriptions column lists how many policies are assigned to the channel. Create a new policy To create a new alert policy: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Policies. Click New alert policy. Follow standard procedures to complete the basic setup process. Disable a policy You can't disable a policy directly. However, you can disable all of the policy's conditions. When you disable all of the conditions, the policy remains the Alert policies index. The policy itself isn't disabled, and you can re-enable any or all of its conditions at any time. Delete a policy If you delete a policy, we'll continue to apply any other policies assigned to the product entity (target). If you remove all policies for the entity, its color-coded health status indicator will appear light green with an icon. If you delete any of your account's policies, you can't restore them. Instead, you must re-create them if necessary. To delete a policy completely: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Alert policies. From the policy row, click the delete icon. Any notification channels associated with a deleted or disabled policy will remain. You must delete notification channels or remove them individually as necessary. In a deleted policy, incidents and event violations are provided as a read only resource. Check for entities (targets) assigned to a policy To check whether an entity (target) has any policies assigned: Go to the product (APM, browser, etc.). From the selected product's index, check whether the entity's color-coded health status is light green with an icon. Tip Exception: Infrastructure does not use this feature. Change how threshold violations roll up into incidents To select how violations to your thresholds are grouped into incident records (by policy, by condition, or by target and condition): In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, then (select a policy). Click Incident preference. Get context for alert violations with Incident Intelligence If you use Applied Intelligence, you can connect your conditions to Incident Intelligence. From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources and then click Alerts. Select the policies you want to connect to Applied Intelligence, and click Connect. You can add additional alerts policies or remove policies you've already connected in Sources > New Relic Alerts.",

      "body": "For some types of conditions, you can define a custom violation description that passes useful information downstream for better violation responses or for use by other systems. You can create a custom violation description in the UI or with NRQL. Requirements The custom violation description feature is available for: NRQL alert conditions Infrastructure monitoring alert conditions The custom violation description field has a maximum character size of 4000. What is a custom violation description? For some types of conditions, you can create a custom violation description that passes information about a condition and its violations downstream. Using a description, you can: Capture the reason for the condition Define the signal being monitored Define next steps Add metadata to downstream systems The Custom violation description field allows you to use a general template structure that, when a violation is generated, substitutes the generic sections with specific values. For example, let's say you used this in a description: This is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tag.fullHostname}} Copy A violation resulting from this condition would fill in the details and you'd receive a notification like this: This is my condition name : My Great Alert Condition The hostname is : ip-123-45-67-89.us-west-1.compute.internal Copy Create a custom violation description In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, (select a policy), then (select a condition): Click + Add custom violation description to open the field. For a condition, you can create a custom violation description using this field. Custom violation description template example Here's a custom violation description template example: this is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tag.fullHostname}} Owning Team: {{tag.label.owning_team}} Product: {{tag.label.product}} ec2VpcId: {{tag.aws.ec2VpcId}} Service name : {{tag.label.Name}} AWS Region : {{tag.aws.awsRegion}} AWS Availability Zone: {{tag.aws.awsAvailabilityZone}} Department : {{tag.label.department}} Environment: {{tag.label.environment}} Cluster: {{tag.clusterName}} Cluster Role: {{tag.clusterRole}} EC2 Instance Type: {{tag.instanceType}} EC2 InstanceID: {{tag.aws.ec2InstanceId}} EC2 AmiId: {{tag.aws.ec2AmiId}} EC2 Root Device Type: {{tag.aws.ec2RootDeviceType}} Copy Here's how that data might appear in a notification: How to use attributes The attributes you can use in a custom violation description are a subset of attributes attached to the violation event. Here are some details about the available attributes and how to use them: Violation event attributes: For any of the standard attributes available for use in a custom violation description, use the format {{AN_ATTRIBUTE}}. For example: The target name is : {{targetName}} Copy Tag attributes: For tags, you would use the format {{tag.TAG_NAME}}. There are two types of tags: Entity-related tags: For Infrastructure conditions only. You can find available entity-related tags by going to the New Relic Explorer and looking under a service's Metadata and tags, or by viewing violation details. Here's an example of using tags in a custom violation description: The AWS region is : {{tag.aws.awsRegion}} Responsible team : {{tag.label.owning_team}} Copy Facet clause tags: For NRQL conditions only. If a NRQL condition uses a FACET clause, you can use tag formatting to use those values in your custom violation description. For example, if the NRQL query included FACET hostName, cluster, you could then use this: The host is : {{tag.hostName}} The cluster is : {{tag.cluster}} Copy Please note that tag names cannot include a whitespace. The expanded values can include a whitespace, but not the names of the tags themselves. Create a custom violation description with NRQL You can create a custom violation description using a NRQL alert condition by creating a mutation with a description. Here's an empty mutation template: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: \"YOUR_CONDITION_ID\", condition: {description: \"\"}) { YOUR_CUSTOM_VIOLATION_DESCRIPTION } } Copy Here's an example mutation with a custom violation description: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: 123456, id: \"123456\", condition: {description: \"timestamp : {{timestamp}} \\n accountId : {{accountId}} \\n type : {{type}} \\n event : {{event}} \\n description : {{description}} \\n policyId : {{policyId}} \\n policyName: {{policyName}} \\n conditionName : {{conditionName}} \\n conditionId : {{conditionId}} \\n product : {{product}} \\n conditionType : {{conditionType}} \\n RunbookUrl : {{runbookUrl}} \\n nrqlQuery : {{nrqlQuery}} \\n nrqlEventType : {{nrqlEventType}} \\n targetID : {{targetId}} \\n targetName : {{targetName}} \\n commandLine : {{tag.commandLine}} \\n entityGuid : {{tag.entityGuid}} \\n entityName : {{tag.entityName}} \\n fullHostname : {{tag.fullHostname}} \\n instanceType : {{tag.instanceType}} \\n processDisplayName : {{tag.processDisplayName}}\"}) { description } } Copy For more information on NRQL conditions and using the NerdGraph API, go to NerdGraph API: NRQL condition alerts. For Infrastructure monitoring conditions, you can create the custom violation description when creating an Infrastructure monitoring alert condition. To learn about how to structure a custom violation description, see the example template and the attribute/tag instructions. Mentioning users or notifying channel in Slack When creating a description that you know will be sent to Slack, you may wish to @mention a user or generate a channel-wide notification (e.g. @here or @channel). To achieve this, simply include the User ID or a channel-wide notification in the description surrounded by < and > characters. Here's an example for mentioning a user: Attention <@LewCirne> Copy Here's an example for generating a channel-wide notification: Attention <!channel> Copy Important Note that the Slack convention for channel-wide notifications in Incoming Webhooks is to use a ! prefix instead of @ e.g. !here or !channel For more help Recommendations for learning more: To learn more about NerdGraph, see Introduction to NerdGraph.

      "body": "A policy is a group of one or more conditions. This document explains how to create a policy and how to view existing policies. You can also use the REST API. For an explanation of how policies interact with conditions and other components, see Concepts and workflow. Tip The basic setup process is the same, regardless of which product (APM, browser, etc.) uses the policy. The types of metrics and thresholds for conditions vary depending on the monitored data source. Best practices for naming policies We recommend three common patterns and practices for structuring and naming policies: Targets or resources in your architecture that have people responsible for their well being Teams that are responsible for part of the architecture Individual policies for specific users Policies organized by... Comments Architecture Targets or resources in your organization may have different people responsible for their well-being. Common segments may include the environment type (production, staging, integration, development) or the target or resource type (app server code, client-side code, databases, hosts, etc.). To make these types of policies easier to identify, you can give them names based on your architecture. For example: Product A website (production) Product B website (staging) Mobile product app (iOS) Hosts (production) Databases (production) Teams Specific teams may be responsible for parts of your architecture. For example, you may want to name their policy Team: Site engineering, Team: Website development, etc. Individuals Policies set up for specific individuals may be useful when they want to personally keep an eye on a particular resource or metric. This provides them the freedom to add and remove conditions as well as adjust thresholds whenever they want, without having to communicate those changes to others. To make these policies easier to identify, you can include the person's name; for example, User: John Doe's metrics, User: Jane Doe (production), etc. Create an alert policy As part of the policy workflow, start by giving the policy a meaningful name: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Policies. On the policy index page, click New alert policy. Type a meaningful name for the policy (maximum 64 characters). Select the incident preference. Select Create alert policy. You can continue from here to define the conditions and assign one or more notification channels. If you decide to continue later, select the policy name from the Alert policies index. Change a policy name For your convenience, we allow you to use the same name for different policies, conditions, and notification channels. If you want to use unique names, review or search the index before adding or changing a name. To rename an existing policy: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Policies, and then (select a policy). Click the policy name to edit it, then type a meaningful name for the policy (maximum 64 characters). Alerts automatically updates any of the policy's conditions and notification channels. View existing policies The policies index lists policies in alphabetical order. To view or search for existing policies: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Policies. Use the search box, sort any column, or scroll the list. To view detailed information, click a policy name. Tip To view policy and condition information for a specific entity, select the Settings > Alert conditions page from the entity's product UI. Policy maintenance quick reference After you create a policy, you can: Add more conditions to the policy. Edit the conditions' names, targets, or thresholds. Disable conditions. Add one or more notification channels to a policy. Rename or delete the policy. The user interface shows a Last modified timestamp for any changes to policies, including their conditions and notification channels. Here is a quick reference which also includes links to more detailed information and procedures for maintaining your policies. Add or remove policies assigned to a channel To add or remove policies assigned to a channel: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Notification channels, then (select a channel). Click Alert policies, then (select a policy). From the selected policy, use the windows to select, remove, or clear all. Change a policy name To rename a policy: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, then (select a policy). Click the policy name to edit it, then type a meaningful name for the policy (maximum 64 characters). Check policy user assignment To check whether an account user has been assigned any policies: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Policies, (select a policy), then click Notification channels. Select a user, and then click Alert policies. Check policy channel assignment To check whether a notification channel has any policies assigned to it: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Notification channels. The Policy subscriptions column lists how many policies are assigned to the channel. Create a new policy To create a new alert policy: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Policies. Click New alert policy. Follow standard procedures to complete the basic setup process. Disable a policy You can't disable a policy directly. However, you can disable all of the policy's conditions. When you disable all of the conditions, the policy remains the Alert policies index. The policy itself isn't disabled, and you can re-enable any or all of its conditions at any time. Delete a policy If you delete a policy, we'll continue to apply any other policies assigned to the product entity (target). If you remove all policies for the entity, its color-coded health status indicator will appear light green with an icon. If you delete any of your account's policies, you can't restore them. Instead, you must re-create them if necessary. To delete a policy completely: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Alert policies. From the policy row, click the delete icon. Any notification channels associated with a deleted or disabled policy will remain. You must delete notification channels or remove them individually as necessary. In a deleted policy, incidents and event violations are provided as a read only resource. Check for entities (targets) assigned to a policy To check whether an entity (target) has any policies assigned: Go to the product (APM, browser, etc.). From the selected product's index, check whether the entity's color-coded health status is light green with an icon. Tip Exception: Infrastructure does not use this feature. Change how threshold violations roll up into incidents To select how violations to your thresholds are grouped into incident records (by policy, by condition, or by target and condition): In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, then (select a policy). Click Incident preference. Get context for alert violations with Incident Intelligence If you use Applied Intelligence, you can connect your conditions to Incident Intelligence. From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources and then click Alerts. Select the policies you want to connect to Applied Intelligence, and click Connect. You can add additional alerts policies or remove policies you've already connected in Sources > New Relic Alerts.",

      "body": "Our REST API (v2) allows you to configure settings for alerts. The API Explorer also includes the curl request format, available parameters, potential response status codes, and JSON response structure for each of the available API calls. You can also create alert conditions in the UI. Important For infrastructure alerting, see REST API for infrastructure monitoring alerts. Available data and functions via API REST API functions Comments View account data In general, any role can use a user key or REST API key with GET > List functions to view alerts data. The account Owner and Admins may use their API key. List output will be paginated. Available functions include: Alert policies Notification channels Conditions for APM, browser, and mobile (Some limitations apply.) Conditions for external services Conditions for Synthetic monitoring Conditions for NRQL (Some limitations apply.) Events Violations Incidents Maintain account data You may have an Owner or Admin role in your account and a user key or have a custom role that grants permissions to manage Alerts and a user key in order to use any maintenance function, including POST > Create, PUT > Add, PUT > Update, and DELETE. Conditions excluded from the REST API These types of conditions do not have available endpoints in the API: APM: Web transaction percentiles, conditions targeting labels, and baselines NRQL: Baselines Alert policies These API functions include links to the API Explorer, where you can create, delete, or list policies. Important If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you're using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. Create new policies To add new policies, use your user key and include these two values in the API call: Required values Definition Incident incident_preference Determines how Alerts will create incidents and group violations. This must be one of the following: PER_POLICY (default): Roll up by policy. PER_CONDITION: Roll up by condition. PER_CONDITION_AND_TARGET: Roll up by target and condition. Policy name The policy name is required. Leaving it unchanged will create a policy called string. API Explorer: Alerts Policies > POST > Create curl -X POST 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_policies.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"policy\": { \"incident_preference\": \"string\", \"name\": \"string\" } }' Copy Update policies Use this API to update an existing policy's name and incident_preference. You'll need your user key. Required values Definition id Required. To find a policy's ID, use either of these options: From the UI: On a policy's UI page, find the ID under the policy name. With the API: Use the List policies API. Incident incident_preference Determines how alerts will create incidents and group violations. Must be one of the following: PER_POLICY (default): Roll up by policy. PER_CONDITION: Roll up by condition. PER_CONDITION_AND_TARGET: Roll up by target and condition. Policy name Required. If you do not change the name, it defaults to a policy called string. To find a policy's exact name, use the List policies API.

These calls are for conditions with these types of entities: APM: Apps and key transactions Browser: Apps and key transactions Mobile: Mobile apps Exception: The following APM conditions are not available from this API endpoint: Conditions targeting labels (dynamic targeting) Web transaction percentile conditions Baseline conditions Important The API Explorer provides information about other types of conditions using separate endpoints, including external services (APM and mobile), and synthetic monitoring. Consider all types of alert conditions when searching or updating. If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you are using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. Create conditions for policies To add conditions to policies, include these values in the API call: Your user key The policy_id (available from API Explorer: Alerts Policies > GET > List) The required condition values in the API call (described in the API Explorer page and in the Alerts conditions API glossary) API Explorer: Alerts Conditions > POST > Create curl -X POST 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_conditions/policies/$POLICY_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"condition\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"name\": \"string\", \"enabled\": boolean, \"entities\": [ integer ], \"metric\": \"string\", \"gc_metric\": \"string\", \"condition_scope\": \"string\", \"violation_close_timer\": integer, \"runbook_url\": \"string\", \"terms\": [ { \"duration\": \"string\", \"operator\": \"string\", \"priority\": \"string\", \"threshold\": \"string\", \"time_function\": \"string\" } ], \"user_defined\": { \"metric\": \"string\", \"value_function\": \"string\" } } }' Copy The JSON response returns a condition id, which you will need to update or delete the condition. You can also view the condition id from API Explorer: Alerts Conditions > GET > List. Update conditions for policies To update conditions for policies, include these values in the API call: Your user key The condition's id (available from API Explorer: Alerts Conditions > GET > List) The required condition values in the API call (described in the API Explorer page and in the Alerts conditions API glossary) API Explorer: Alerts Conditions > PUT > Update curl -X PUT 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_conditions/$CONDITION_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"condition\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"name\": \"string\", \"enabled\": boolean, \"entities\": [ integer ], \"metric\": \"string\", \"metric\": \"string\", \"gc_metric\": \"string\", \"condition_scope\": \"string\", \"violation_close_timer\": integer, \"runbook_url\": \"string\", \"terms\": [ { \"duration\": \"string\", \"operator\": \"string\", \"priority\": \"string\", \"threshold\": \"string\", \"time_function\": \"string\" } ], \"user_defined\": { \"metric\": \"string\", \"value_function\": \"string\" } } }' Copy Delete conditions from policies To delete conditions from policies, include these values in the API call: Your user key The condition_id (available from API Explorer: Alerts Conditions > GET > List) API Explorer: Alerts Conditions > DELETE > Delete curl -X DELETE 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_conditions/$CONDITION_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i Copy List existing conditions for policies To view a list of existing conditions for your policy, use your REST API key or user key, and the associated policy_id in the API call.

Exception: NRQL baseline conditions are not available from this endpoint. Important If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you are using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. Create NRQL conditions for policies Recommendation: Due to the way NRQL data is aggregated, set the nrql[since_value] to 3 or higher to prevent false positives. This equates to the Evaluation Offset value in the Alerts Condition UI. API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > POST > Create To create NRQL conditions for policies: curl -X POST 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_nrql_conditions/policies/$POLICY_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"nrql_condition\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"name\": \"string\", \"runbook_url\": \"string\", \"enabled\": boolean, \"terms\": [ { \"duration\": \"string\", \"operator\": \"string\", \"priority\": \"string\", \"threshold\": \"string\", \"time_function\": \"string\" } ], \"value_function\": \"string\", \"nrql\": { \"query\": \"string\", \"since_value\": \"string\" }, \"signal\": { \"aggregation_window\": \"string\", \"evaluation_offset\": \"string\", \"fill_option\": \"string\", \"fill_value\": \"string\" }, \"expiration\": { \"expiration_duration\": \"string\", \"open_violation_on_expiration\": boolean, \"close_violations_on_expiration\": boolean } } }' Copy If you set nrql[since_value] to 3 and nrql[query] to SELECT count FROM myEvent, New Relic evaluates the following query against the terms[threshold] value once per minute: SELECT count FROM myEvent SINCE 3 minutes ago UNTIL 2 minutes ago Copy If you set type as outlier, you can omit the value_function. However, two additional fields are required: expected_groups and ignore_overlap. For more information, see Alerts Conditions API field names. If you omit type or set it as static, it will default to standard NRQL alerting. Update NRQL conditions for policies Recommendation: Due to the way NRQL data is aggregated, set the nrql[since_value] to 3 or higher to prevent false positives. This allows three minutes to aggregate data, and equates to the Evaluation Offset value in the Alerts Condition UI. To update NRQL conditions for policies, include these values in the API call: Your user key The condition's id (available from API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > GET > List) The required condition values in the API call (described in the API Explorer page and in the Alerts conditions API glossary) API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > PUT > Update curl -X PUT 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_nrql_conditions/$CONDITION_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"nrql_condition\": { \"name\": \"string\", \"runbook_url\": \"string\", \"enabled\": boolean, \"terms\": [ { \"duration\": \"string\", \"operator\": \"string\", \"priority\": \"string\", \"threshold\": \"string\", \"time_function\": \"string\" } ], \"value_function\": \"string\", \"nrql\": { \"query\": \"string\", \"since_value\": \"string\" } } }' Copy Delete NRQL conditions for policies To delete NRQL conditions from policies, include these values in the API call: Your user key The condition's id (available from API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > GET > List) API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > DELETE > Delete curl -X DELETE 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_nrql_conditions/$CONDITION_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i Copy List existing NRQL conditions for policies To view a list of existing conditions for your alert policy, use your user key or REST API key, and the associated policy_id in the API call.

      "body": "In a policy, a condition identifies what triggers an alert. You can use the REST API to disable and enable conditions. You can also disable and enable conditions in New Relic One. Policies can't be enabled or disabled, whether via the API or the UI. Policies can only be created, deleted, or have their conditions changed. Requirements Modifying any attribute in a condition using the API requires: An API key and permissions to manage Alerts The condition's id (available from API Explorer: Alerts Conditions > GET > List) If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you are using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. Enable and disable a condition The process for disabling or enabling a condition is the same general process for changing any attribute in a condition. A more detailed example comes after this general procedure: Find the ID for the policy that contains the condition you want to change. If the policy's ID is unknown, use the policy's name or type to make an API call and find the policy's ID. For more on this process, see List a single policy. With the policy ID, make an API call that returns the conditions associated with that policy. There are four different condition categories. If you don't know the category, this may require making up to four API calls in order to find the condition. Details on searching for condition ID If you don't know the category of the condition you want to change, you must search for it by making API calls using the four condition categories. Here are the different API call formats for the various condition categories. APM, browser, and mobile monitoring Conditions available: apm_app_metric, apm_kt_metric, browser_metric, and mobile_metric API Explorer link Get>List External services Conditions available: apm_external_service, mobile_external_service API Explorer link Get>List Synthetic monitoring API Explorer link Get>List Plugins API Explorer link Get>List For the returned JSON, find the JSON object of the condition you want to change. Copy and paste the condition's JSON in a text editor of your choice and edit the JSON. To enable the condition, set \"enabled\" to true. To disable the condition, set \"enabled\" to false. Update the condition by submitting your edited JSON via an Update API request. Our different products require different API requests. Details on Update API requests Use the Update API request that corresponds to the product in question: Conditions for APM, browser, and mobile Conditions available: apm_app_metric, apm_kt_metric, browser_metric, and mobile_metric API Explorer PUT>Update link Conditions for external services Conditions available: apm_external_service, mobile_external_service API Explorer PUT>Update Conditions for Synthetic monitoring) API Explorer PUT>Update Conditions for Plugins API Explorer PUT>Update Tip An Update API request can only change one condition at a time, it cannot update a vector of objects. For example, to change three conditions, you will have to make three separate requests. Example: Disable an APM condition The following example shows how to disable a condition for an apm_app_metric condition. With the exception of the types of API calls required, the process is similar to the process for changing other condition types. Obtain the policy_id of the policy you want to update. For an imaginary policy named Logjam Alert, the command would be: curl -X GET 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_policies.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -G --data-urlencode 'filter[name]= Logjam Alert' <---<<< {policy_name} Copy The output for this request might look like: { \"policies\": [ { \"id\": 85, <---<<< $POLICY_ID \"incident_preference\": \"PER_POLICY\", \"name\": \"Logjam Alert\", \"created_at\": 1461176510393, \"updated_at\": 1461176510393 } ] } Copy List all of this policy's conditions and locate the {condition_id}: curl -X GET 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_conditions.json' \\ -H 'X-Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -G -d 'policy_id=85' Copy The output for this request might look like: { \"conditions\": [ { \"id\": 12345, <---<<< $CONDITION_ID \"type\": \"apm_app_metric\", \"name\": \"Apdex (Low)\", \"enabled\": true, <---<<< Note the condition is enabled \"entities\": [ \"8288171\" ], \"metric\": \"apdex\", \"terms\": [ { \"duration\": \"5\", \"operator\": \"below\", \"priority\": \"critical\", \"threshold\": \"1\", \"time_function\": \"any\" } ] }, { \"id\": 2468, <---<<< another condition_id \"type\": \"apm_app_metric\", \"name\": \"Throughput (Low)\", ... } ] } Copy Copy the JSON for only the condition in question and paste it in a text editor. Change \"enabled\": true to \"enabled\": false. The edited JSON would look like: curl -X PUT 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_conditions/12345.json' \\ -H 'X-Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"condition\": { \"type\": \"apm_app_metric\", \"name\": \"Apdex (Low)\", \"enabled\": false, <---<<< Changed to false \"entities\": [ \"8288171\" ], \"metric\": \"apdex\", \"terms\": [ { \"duration\": \"5\", \"operator\": \"below\", \"priority\": \"critical\", \"threshold\": \"1\", \"time_function\": \"any\" } ] } }' Copy Update the condition by submitting the edited condition JSON via an Update API request. For this specific condition, you would follow the steps in Update conditions for APM policies. Other product conditions would have other API requests, as detailed in Update API requests.

      "body": "The REST API endpoints allow you to create conditions for your policies. This glossary contains the names and descriptions of each of the fields that you can use to define or update a condition. Required and optional fields The API includes four types of New Relic Alerts conditions: APM External services Synthetic monitoring Plugins All of the fields used with a specific condition type are required except for these optional fields: enabled (defaults to false) runbook_url user_defined Field definitions Not every field listed in this glossary is required for every condition type. The condition type for which a field must be used is listed in each description. aggregation_window Streaming alerts gathers data together into specific amounts of time before running the function in the NRQL query. These windows of time are customizable. The default is 1 minute. The maximum is 15 minutes. Data points are collected together based their timestamps and reported as a batch. The customizable aggregation window provides greater flexibility and fewer false violations when alerting on irregular or less frequent data points. In the UI, under Advanced signal settings, this is the Aggregation window field. close_violations_on_expiration When true, this closes all currently open violations when no signal is heard within the expiration_duration time. The default is False. condition_scope This field allows you to scope a condition to either a JVM instance or to a whole application. This may be one of the strings: instance application Used for: Conditions Entity conditions For instance-based and JVM health metrics, see also violation_close_timer. enabled This is the status of your alert condition and is optional. The default is false. This field may be used to enable or disable a condition for maintenance or testing periods. Used for: Conditions External service conditions Synthetic monitoring conditions Plugin conditions entities This is an array of entity IDs identifying the objects which will be monitored with your condition. These may be application IDs, browser IDs, plugin IDs, key transaction IDs, external service IDs, etc. These are entered as a series of comma separated integers if there is more than one. Used for: Conditions External service conditions Plugin conditions evaluation_offset The offset is how long we wait for late data before evaluating each aggregation window. Waiting longer gives a more accurate signal but increases latency. The default is 3 minutes. In the UI, under Advanced signal settings, this is the Offset evaluation by field. expected_groups This is the number of groups you expect to see at any given time. It is used in combination with the ignore_overlap option. Used for: NRQL outlier conditions expiration_duration How long to wait, in seconds, after the last data point is received by our platform before considering the signal as lost. This is based on the time when data arrives and not on data timestamps. The default is null. Add a value to enable loss of signal detection. external_service_url This is the URL of the external service to be monitored. This string must not include the protocol. For example, use example.com, not https://example.com. Used for: External service conditions fill_option For sporadic data, you can avoid false alerts by filling the gaps (empty windows) with synthetic data. none: (Default) Use this if you don’t want to take any action on empty aggregation windows. On evaluation, an empty aggregation window will reset the threshold duration timer. For example, if a condition says that all aggregation windows must have data points above the threshold for 5 minutes, and 1 of the 5 aggregation windows is empty, then the condition won’t be in violation. static: Use this if you’d like to insert a custom static value into the empty aggregation windows before they’re evaluated. This option has an additional, required parameter of fillValue that specifies what static value should be used. This defaults to 0. last_value: Use this to insert the last seen value before evaluation occurs. We maintain the state of the last seen value for 2 hours. In the UI, under Advanced signal settings, this is the Fill data gaps with field. fill_value This is the value used by the fill_option custom value. The default is 0. ignore_overlap If disabled, this looks for a convergence (or overlapping) of groups. If the condition is looking for two or more groups, and the returned values can't be separated into that number of distinct groups, then that will also produce a violation. This type of overlap event is represented on a chart by group bands touching. Used for: NRQL outlier conditions metric The metric field is used for three alert categories. The exact parameters available for use depend on the setting in the type field. These are listed below according to their alert type field. Alerts plugin conditions For Plugin conditions this is the metric, which has been defined in a plugin, that will be used to trigger a notification. Alerts conditions The value specified in the type field controls which of the parameters may be specified. The type field and corresponding available parameter names are listed in the following table. Only one may be specified. type Parameter apm_app_metric apdex error_percentage response_time_web response_time_background throughput_web throughput_background user_defined apm_kt_metric apdex error_percentage error_count response_time throughput browser_metric end_user_apdex total_page_load page_rendering web_application network dom_processing request_queuing ajax_response_time page_views_with_js_errors page_view_throughput ajax_throughput user_defined browser_metric_baseline page_view_throughput average_response_time ajax_response_time ajax_application_time mobile_metric database images json, network view_loading network_error_percentage status_error_percentage user_defined Alerts external service conditions The value specified in the type field controls which of the parameters may be specified. The type field and corresponding available parameter names are listed in the following table. Only one may be specified. type Parameter apm_external_service apdex error_percentage response_time_web response_time_background throughput_web throughput_background user_defined apm_app_metric_baseline external_service_transaction_time error_count database_transaction_time throughput_web response_time_web non_web_transaction_time web_transaction_database_time non_web_transaction_database_time mobile_external_service response_time_average response_time_minimum response_time_maximum throughput network_failure_percentage http_status_error_percentage metric_description This is a title for the metric which is displayed in notifications. Make this descriptive and unique so the reader will understand the nature of plugin metric being used to trigger an alert. Used for: Plugin conditions monitor_id This is the GUID of the Synthetic monitoring to alert on. Used for: Synthetic monitoring conditions name This condition title will allow to you identify it in the UI. Follow the guidelines for making this descriptive but short. Used for: Conditions External service conditions Synthetic monitoring conditions Plugin conditions nrql[query] This is the NRQL query that alerts monitors as part of a NRQL condition. Used for: NRQL conditions nrql[since_value] This is the timeframe (in minutes) in which to evaluate the specified NRQL query. since_value must be between 1 and 20. Used for: NRQL conditions open_violation_on_expiration When true, this opens a loss of signal violation when no signal within the expiration_duration time. The default is False. plugin[guid] This is the GUID of the plugin for which the trigger is being defined. Used for: Plugin conditions plugin[id] This is the ID of the plugin for which the trigger is being defined. Used for: Plugin conditions runbook_url The runbook URL to display in notifications. This field is optional. Used for: Conditions External service conditions Synthetic monitoring conditions Plugin conditions terms[duration] This is the time (in minutes) for the condition to persist before triggering an event. It corresponds to the duration set when adding a threshold in the UI. Used for: Conditions terms[operator] This determines what comparison will be used between the value_function and the terms [ threshold] value to trigger an event. It corresponds to the operation selected when adding a threshold in the UI. It must be one of the following strings: above below equal Used for: Conditions External service conditions Plugin conditions terms[priority] This corresponds to the severity level selected when setting the threshold values for the condition in the UI. This must be one of the following strings: critical warning Used for: Conditions External service conditions Plugin conditions terms[threshold] This is the threshold that the value_function must be compared to using the terms [ operator] for an event to be triggered. It corresponds to the numeric value specified in the UI when adding the threshold values. This is a numeric value and must be 0 (zero) or greater. Used for: Conditions External service conditions Plugin conditions terms[time_function] This corresponds to the settings made in the UI when adding the threshold values. The choices are: all (corresponding to for at least in the UI) any (corresponding to at least once in in the UI) Used for: Conditions External service conditions Plugin conditions type This defines the type of metric that will be used for the alert. Allowable content for the metric field depends on the type value chosen. There are two product categories : Alerts conditions For this category, type is set to one of the following strings indicating the type of alerts condition. type Use apm_app_metric APM application metric will trigger an alert. apm_app_metric_baseline APM application metric will trigger an alert (using a baseline threshold). apm_kt_metric APM key transaction metric will trigger an alert. browser_metric Browser metric will trigger an alert. browser_metric_baseline Browser metric will trigger an alert (using a baseline threshold). mobile_metric Mobile metric will trigger an alert. Used for: Conditions Alerts external service conditions For this category, type is set to one of the following strings indicating the type of external service condition. type Use apm_external_service APM external metric will trigger an alert. mobile_external_service Mobile external metric will trigger an alert. Used for: External service conditions user_defined[metric] (optional) This is the name of a user defined custom metric to be used to determine if an event should be triggered. The user_defined [ value_function] associated with the metric is compared with the terms [ threshold] value when evaluating if an incident should be triggered. The comparison is performed using the operator defined by terms [ operator]. Used for: Conditions External service conditions Synthetic monitoring conditions Plugin conditions user_defined[value_function] (optional) This is the numeric value obtained from the custom metric specified by user_defined [ metric]. It is compared with the terms [ threshold] value when evaluating if an incident should be triggered. The comparison is performed using the operator defined by terms [ operator]. One of these value functions must be specified: average min max total sample_size Used for: Conditions value_function This is the value function used from the plugin metric. This may be one of the strings: min max average sample_size total percent Used for: Plugin conditions When used for a NRQL condition, the options are: single_value (condition is evaluated based on each query's returned value) sum (condition is evaluated based on the sum of each query's returned values over the specified duration) violation_time_limit_seconds Use to automatically close instance-based violations after the number of seconds specified. Must be one of these values: 3600 7200 14400 28800 43200 86400 Used for: Location conditions NRQL conditions violation_close_timer Use to automatically close instance-based violations, including JVM health metric violations, after the number of hours specified. Must be one of these values: 1 2 4 8 12 24 Used for: apm_app_metric (with condition_scope set to instance) apm_jvm_metric",

      "body": "The REST API endpoints allow you to create conditions for your policies. This glossary contains the names and descriptions of each of the fields that you can use to define or update a condition. Required and optional fields The API includes four types of New Relic Alerts conditions: APM External services Synthetic monitoring Plugins All of the fields used with a specific condition type are required except for these optional fields: enabled (defaults to false) runbook_url user_defined Field definitions Not every field listed in this glossary is required for every condition type. The condition type for which a field must be used is listed in each description. aggregation_window Streaming alerts gathers data together into specific amounts of time before running the function in the NRQL query. These windows of time are customizable. The default is 1 minute. The maximum is 15 minutes. Data points are collected together based their timestamps and reported as a batch. The customizable aggregation window provides greater flexibility and fewer false violations when alerting on irregular or less frequent data points. In the UI, under Advanced signal settings, this is the Aggregation window field. close_violations_on_expiration When true, this closes all currently open violations when no signal is heard within the expiration_duration time. The default is False. condition_scope This field allows you to scope a condition to either a JVM instance or to a whole application. This may be one of the strings: instance application Used for: Conditions Entity conditions For instance-based and JVM health metrics, see also violation_close_timer. enabled This is the status of your alert condition and is optional. The default is false. This field may be used to enable or disable a condition for maintenance or testing periods. Used for: Conditions External service conditions Synthetic monitoring conditions Plugin conditions entities This is an array of entity IDs identifying the objects which will be monitored with your condition. These may be application IDs, browser IDs, plugin IDs, key transaction IDs, external service IDs, etc. These are entered as a series of comma separated integers if there is more than one. Used for: Conditions External service conditions Plugin conditions evaluation_offset The offset is how long we wait for late data before evaluating each aggregation window. Waiting longer gives a more accurate signal but increases latency. The default is 3 minutes. In the UI, under Advanced signal settings, this is the Offset evaluation by field. expected_groups This is the number of groups you expect to see at any given time. It is used in combination with the ignore_overlap option. Used for: NRQL outlier conditions expiration_duration How long to wait, in seconds, after the last data point is received by our platform before considering the signal as lost. This is based on the time when data arrives and not on data timestamps. The default is null. Add a value to enable loss of signal detection. external_service_url This is the URL of the external service to be monitored. This string must not include the protocol. For example, use example.com, not https://example.com. Used for: External service conditions fill_option For sporadic data, you can avoid false alerts by filling the gaps (empty windows) with synthetic data. none: (Default) Use this if you don’t want to take any action on empty aggregation windows. On evaluation, an empty aggregation window will reset the threshold duration timer. For example, if a condition says that all aggregation windows must have data points above the threshold for 5 minutes, and 1 of the 5 aggregation windows is empty, then the condition won’t be in violation. static: Use this if you’d like to insert a custom static value into the empty aggregation windows before they’re evaluated. This option has an additional, required parameter of fillValue that specifies what static value should be used. This defaults to 0. last_value: Use this to insert the last seen value before evaluation occurs. We maintain the state of the last seen value for 2 hours. In the UI, under Advanced signal settings, this is the Fill data gaps with field. fill_value This is the value used by the fill_option custom value. The default is 0. ignore_overlap If disabled, this looks for a convergence (or overlapping) of groups. If the condition is looking for two or more groups, and the returned values can't be separated into that number of distinct groups, then that will also produce a violation. This type of overlap event is represented on a chart by group bands touching. Used for: NRQL outlier conditions metric The metric field is used for three alert categories. The exact parameters available for use depend on the setting in the type field. These are listed below according to their alert type field. Alerts plugin conditions For Plugin conditions this is the metric, which has been defined in a plugin, that will be used to trigger a notification. Alerts conditions The value specified in the type field controls which of the parameters may be specified. The type field and corresponding available parameter names are listed in the following table. Only one may be specified. type Parameter apm_app_metric apdex error_percentage response_time_web response_time_background throughput_web throughput_background user_defined apm_kt_metric apdex error_percentage error_count response_time throughput browser_metric end_user_apdex total_page_load page_rendering web_application network dom_processing request_queuing ajax_response_time page_views_with_js_errors page_view_throughput ajax_throughput user_defined browser_metric_baseline page_view_throughput average_response_time ajax_response_time ajax_application_time mobile_metric database images json, network view_loading network_error_percentage status_error_percentage user_defined Alerts external service conditions The value specified in the type field controls which of the parameters may be specified. The type field and corresponding available parameter names are listed in the following table. Only one may be specified. type Parameter apm_external_service apdex error_percentage response_time_web response_time_background throughput_web throughput_background user_defined apm_app_metric_baseline external_service_transaction_time error_count database_transaction_time throughput_web response_time_web non_web_transaction_time web_transaction_database_time non_web_transaction_database_time mobile_external_service response_time_average response_time_minimum response_time_maximum throughput network_failure_percentage http_status_error_percentage metric_description This is a title for the metric which is displayed in notifications. Make this descriptive and unique so the reader will understand the nature of plugin metric being used to trigger an alert. Used for: Plugin conditions monitor_id This is the GUID of the Synthetic monitoring to alert on. Used for: Synthetic monitoring conditions name This condition title will allow to you identify it in the UI. Follow the guidelines for making this descriptive but short. Used for: Conditions External service conditions Synthetic monitoring conditions Plugin conditions nrql[query] This is the NRQL query that alerts monitors as part of a NRQL condition. Used for: NRQL conditions nrql[since_value] This is the timeframe (in minutes) in which to evaluate the specified NRQL query. since_value must be between 1 and 20. Used for: NRQL conditions open_violation_on_expiration When true, this opens a loss of signal violation when no signal within the expiration_duration time. The default is False. plugin[guid] This is the GUID of the plugin for which the trigger is being defined. Used for: Plugin conditions plugin[id] This is the ID of the plugin for which the trigger is being defined. Used for: Plugin conditions runbook_url The runbook URL to display in notifications. This field is optional. Used for: Conditions External service conditions Synthetic monitoring conditions Plugin conditions terms[duration] This is the time (in minutes) for the condition to persist before triggering an event. It corresponds to the duration set when adding a threshold in the UI. Used for: Conditions terms[operator] This determines what comparison will be used between the value_function and the terms [ threshold] value to trigger an event. It corresponds to the operation selected when adding a threshold in the UI. It must be one of the following strings: above below equal Used for: Conditions External service conditions Plugin conditions terms[priority] This corresponds to the severity level selected when setting the threshold values for the condition in the UI. This must be one of the following strings: critical warning Used for: Conditions External service conditions Plugin conditions terms[threshold] This is the threshold that the value_function must be compared to using the terms [ operator] for an event to be triggered. It corresponds to the numeric value specified in the UI when adding the threshold values. This is a numeric value and must be 0 (zero) or greater. Used for: Conditions External service conditions Plugin conditions terms[time_function] This corresponds to the settings made in the UI when adding the threshold values. The choices are: all (corresponding to for at least in the UI) any (corresponding to at least once in in the UI) Used for: Conditions External service conditions Plugin conditions type This defines the type of metric that will be used for the alert. Allowable content for the metric field depends on the type value chosen. There are two product categories : Alerts conditions For this category, type is set to one of the following strings indicating the type of alerts condition. type Use apm_app_metric APM application metric will trigger an alert. apm_app_metric_baseline APM application metric will trigger an alert (using a baseline threshold). apm_kt_metric APM key transaction metric will trigger an alert. browser_metric Browser metric will trigger an alert. browser_metric_baseline Browser metric will trigger an alert (using a baseline threshold). mobile_metric Mobile metric will trigger an alert. Used for: Conditions Alerts external service conditions For this category, type is set to one of the following strings indicating the type of external service condition. type Use apm_external_service APM external metric will trigger an alert. mobile_external_service Mobile external metric will trigger an alert. Used for: External service conditions user_defined[metric] (optional) This is the name of a user defined custom metric to be used to determine if an event should be triggered. The user_defined [ value_function] associated with the metric is compared with the terms [ threshold] value when evaluating if an incident should be triggered. The comparison is performed using the operator defined by terms [ operator]. Used for: Conditions External service conditions Synthetic monitoring conditions Plugin conditions user_defined[value_function] (optional) This is the numeric value obtained from the custom metric specified by user_defined [ metric]. It is compared with the terms [ threshold] value when evaluating if an incident should be triggered. The comparison is performed using the operator defined by terms [ operator]. One of these value functions must be specified: average min max total sample_size Used for: Conditions value_function This is the value function used from the plugin metric. This may be one of the strings: min max average sample_size total percent Used for: Plugin conditions When used for a NRQL condition, the options are: single_value (condition is evaluated based on each query's returned value) sum (condition is evaluated based on the sum of each query's returned values over the specified duration) violation_time_limit_seconds Use to automatically close instance-based violations after the number of seconds specified. Must be one of these values: 3600 7200 14400 28800 43200 86400 Used for: Location conditions NRQL conditions violation_close_timer Use to automatically close instance-based violations, including JVM health metric violations, after the number of hours specified. Must be one of these values: 1 2 4 8 12 24 Used for: apm_app_metric (with condition_scope set to instance) apm_jvm_metric",

Used for: Conditions External service conditions Synthetic monitoring conditions Plugin conditions nrql[query] This is the NRQL query that alerts monitors as part of a NRQL condition. Used for: NRQL conditions nrql[since_value] This is the timeframe (in minutes) in which to evaluate the specified NRQL query. since_value must be between 1 and 20. Used for: NRQL conditions open_violation_on_expiration When true, this opens a loss of signal violation when no signal within the expiration_duration time. The default is False. plugin[guid] This is the GUID of the plugin for which the trigger is being defined. Used for: Plugin conditions plugin[id] This is the ID of the plugin for which the trigger is being defined. Used for: Plugin conditions runbook_url The runbook URL to display in notifications. This field is optional. Used for: Conditions External service conditions Synthetic monitoring conditions Plugin conditions terms[duration] This is the time (in minutes) for the condition to persist before triggering an event. It corresponds to the duration set when adding a threshold in the UI. Used for: Conditions terms[operator] This determines what comparison will be used between the value_function and the terms [ threshold] value to trigger an event. It corresponds to the operation selected when adding a threshold in the UI. It must be one of the following strings: above below equal Used for: Conditions External service conditions Plugin conditions terms[priority] This corresponds to the severity level selected when setting the threshold values for the condition in the UI. This must be one of the following strings: critical warning Used for: Conditions External service conditions Plugin conditions terms[threshold] This is the threshold that the value_function must be compared to using the terms [ operator] for an event to be triggered. It corresponds to the numeric value specified in the UI when adding the threshold values. This is a numeric value and must be 0 (zero) or greater. Used for: Conditions External service conditions Plugin conditions terms[time_function] This corresponds to the settings made in the UI when adding the threshold values. The choices are: all (corresponding to for at least in the UI) any (corresponding to at least once in in the UI) Used for: Conditions External service conditions Plugin conditions type This defines the type of metric that will be used for the alert. Allowable content for the metric field depends on the type value chosen. There are two product categories : Alerts conditions For this category, type is set to one of the following strings indicating the type of alerts condition. type Use apm_app_metric APM application metric will trigger an alert. apm_app_metric_baseline APM application metric will trigger an alert (using a baseline threshold). apm_kt_metric APM key transaction metric will trigger an alert. browser_metric Browser metric will trigger an alert. browser_metric_baseline Browser metric will trigger an alert (using a baseline threshold). mobile_metric Mobile metric will trigger an alert.

      "body": "In a policy, a condition identifies what triggers an alert. You can use the REST API to disable and enable conditions. You can also disable and enable conditions in New Relic One. Policies can't be enabled or disabled, whether via the API or the UI. Policies can only be created, deleted, or have their conditions changed. Requirements Modifying any attribute in a condition using the API requires: An API key and permissions to manage Alerts The condition's id (available from API Explorer: Alerts Conditions > GET > List) If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you are using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. Enable and disable a condition The process for disabling or enabling a condition is the same general process for changing any attribute in a condition. A more detailed example comes after this general procedure: Find the ID for the policy that contains the condition you want to change. If the policy's ID is unknown, use the policy's name or type to make an API call and find the policy's ID. For more on this process, see List a single policy. With the policy ID, make an API call that returns the conditions associated with that policy. There are four different condition categories. If you don't know the category, this may require making up to four API calls in order to find the condition. Details on searching for condition ID If you don't know the category of the condition you want to change, you must search for it by making API calls using the four condition categories. Here are the different API call formats for the various condition categories. APM, browser, and mobile monitoring Conditions available: apm_app_metric, apm_kt_metric, browser_metric, and mobile_metric API Explorer link Get>List External services Conditions available: apm_external_service, mobile_external_service API Explorer link Get>List Synthetic monitoring API Explorer link Get>List Plugins API Explorer link Get>List For the returned JSON, find the JSON object of the condition you want to change. Copy and paste the condition's JSON in a text editor of your choice and edit the JSON. To enable the condition, set \"enabled\" to true. To disable the condition, set \"enabled\" to false. Update the condition by submitting your edited JSON via an Update API request. Our different products require different API requests. Details on Update API requests Use the Update API request that corresponds to the product in question: Conditions for APM, browser, and mobile Conditions available: apm_app_metric, apm_kt_metric, browser_metric, and mobile_metric API Explorer PUT>Update link Conditions for external services Conditions available: apm_external_service, mobile_external_service API Explorer PUT>Update Conditions for Synthetic monitoring) API Explorer PUT>Update Conditions for Plugins API Explorer PUT>Update Tip An Update API request can only change one condition at a time, it cannot update a vector of objects. For example, to change three conditions, you will have to make three separate requests. Example: Disable an APM condition The following example shows how to disable a condition for an apm_app_metric condition. With the exception of the types of API calls required, the process is similar to the process for changing other condition types. Obtain the policy_id of the policy you want to update. For an imaginary policy named Logjam Alert, the command would be: curl -X GET 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_policies.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -G --data-urlencode 'filter[name]= Logjam Alert' <---<<< {policy_name} Copy The output for this request might look like: { \"policies\": [ { \"id\": 85, <---<<< $POLICY_ID \"incident_preference\": \"PER_POLICY\", \"name\": \"Logjam Alert\", \"created_at\": 1461176510393, \"updated_at\": 1461176510393 } ] } Copy List all of this policy's conditions and locate the {condition_id}: curl -X GET 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_conditions.json' \\ -H 'X-Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -G -d 'policy_id=85' Copy The output for this request might look like: { \"conditions\": [ { \"id\": 12345, <---<<< $CONDITION_ID \"type\": \"apm_app_metric\", \"name\": \"Apdex (Low)\", \"enabled\": true, <---<<< Note the condition is enabled \"entities\": [ \"8288171\" ], \"metric\": \"apdex\", \"terms\": [ { \"duration\": \"5\", \"operator\": \"below\", \"priority\": \"critical\", \"threshold\": \"1\", \"time_function\": \"any\" } ] }, { \"id\": 2468, <---<<< another condition_id \"type\": \"apm_app_metric\", \"name\": \"Throughput (Low)\", ... } ] } Copy Copy the JSON for only the condition in question and paste it in a text editor. Change \"enabled\": true to \"enabled\": false. The edited JSON would look like: curl -X PUT 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_conditions/12345.json' \\ -H 'X-Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"condition\": { \"type\": \"apm_app_metric\", \"name\": \"Apdex (Low)\", \"enabled\": false, <---<<< Changed to false \"entities\": [ \"8288171\" ], \"metric\": \"apdex\", \"terms\": [ { \"duration\": \"5\", \"operator\": \"below\", \"priority\": \"critical\", \"threshold\": \"1\", \"time_function\": \"any\" } ] } }' Copy Update the condition by submitting the edited condition JSON via an Update API request. For this specific condition, you would follow the steps in Update conditions for APM policies. Other product conditions would have other API requests, as detailed in Update API requests.

      "body": "For some types of conditions, you can define a custom violation description that passes useful information downstream for better violation responses or for use by other systems. You can create a custom violation description in the UI or with NRQL. Requirements The custom violation description feature is available for: NRQL alert conditions Infrastructure monitoring alert conditions The custom violation description field has a maximum character size of 4000. What is a custom violation description? For some types of conditions, you can create a custom violation description that passes information about a condition and its violations downstream. Using a description, you can: Capture the reason for the condition Define the signal being monitored Define next steps Add metadata to downstream systems The Custom violation description field allows you to use a general template structure that, when a violation is generated, substitutes the generic sections with specific values. For example, let's say you used this in a description: This is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tag.fullHostname}} Copy A violation resulting from this condition would fill in the details and you'd receive a notification like this: This is my condition name : My Great Alert Condition The hostname is : ip-123-45-67-89.us-west-1.compute.internal Copy Create a custom violation description In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, (select a policy), then (select a condition): Click + Add custom violation description to open the field. For a condition, you can create a custom violation description using this field. Custom violation description template example Here's a custom violation description template example: this is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tag.fullHostname}} Owning Team: {{tag.label.owning_team}} Product: {{tag.label.product}} ec2VpcId: {{tag.aws.ec2VpcId}} Service name : {{tag.label.Name}} AWS Region : {{tag.aws.awsRegion}} AWS Availability Zone: {{tag.aws.awsAvailabilityZone}} Department : {{tag.label.department}} Environment: {{tag.label.environment}} Cluster: {{tag.clusterName}} Cluster Role: {{tag.clusterRole}} EC2 Instance Type: {{tag.instanceType}} EC2 InstanceID: {{tag.aws.ec2InstanceId}} EC2 AmiId: {{tag.aws.ec2AmiId}} EC2 Root Device Type: {{tag.aws.ec2RootDeviceType}} Copy Here's how that data might appear in a notification: How to use attributes The attributes you can use in a custom violation description are a subset of attributes attached to the violation event. Here are some details about the available attributes and how to use them: Violation event attributes: For any of the standard attributes available for use in a custom violation description, use the format {{AN_ATTRIBUTE}}. For example: The target name is : {{targetName}} Copy Tag attributes: For tags, you would use the format {{tag.TAG_NAME}}. There are two types of tags: Entity-related tags: For Infrastructure conditions only. You can find available entity-related tags by going to the New Relic Explorer and looking under a service's Metadata and tags, or by viewing violation details. Here's an example of using tags in a custom violation description: The AWS region is : {{tag.aws.awsRegion}} Responsible team : {{tag.label.owning_team}} Copy Facet clause tags: For NRQL conditions only. If a NRQL condition uses a FACET clause, you can use tag formatting to use those values in your custom violation description. For example, if the NRQL query included FACET hostName, cluster, you could then use this: The host is : {{tag.hostName}} The cluster is : {{tag.cluster}} Copy Please note that tag names cannot include a whitespace. The expanded values can include a whitespace, but not the names of the tags themselves. Create a custom violation description with NRQL You can create a custom violation description using a NRQL alert condition by creating a mutation with a description. Here's an empty mutation template: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: \"YOUR_CONDITION_ID\", condition: {description: \"\"}) { YOUR_CUSTOM_VIOLATION_DESCRIPTION } } Copy Here's an example mutation with a custom violation description: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: 123456, id: \"123456\", condition: {description: \"timestamp : {{timestamp}} \\n accountId : {{accountId}} \\n type : {{type}} \\n event : {{event}} \\n description : {{description}} \\n policyId : {{policyId}} \\n policyName: {{policyName}} \\n conditionName : {{conditionName}} \\n conditionId : {{conditionId}} \\n product : {{product}} \\n conditionType : {{conditionType}} \\n RunbookUrl : {{runbookUrl}} \\n nrqlQuery : {{nrqlQuery}} \\n nrqlEventType : {{nrqlEventType}} \\n targetID : {{targetId}} \\n targetName : {{targetName}} \\n commandLine : {{tag.commandLine}} \\n entityGuid : {{tag.entityGuid}} \\n entityName : {{tag.entityName}} \\n fullHostname : {{tag.fullHostname}} \\n instanceType : {{tag.instanceType}} \\n processDisplayName : {{tag.processDisplayName}}\"}) { description } } Copy For more information on NRQL conditions and using the NerdGraph API, go to NerdGraph API: NRQL condition alerts. For Infrastructure monitoring conditions, you can create the custom violation description when creating an Infrastructure monitoring alert condition. To learn about how to structure a custom violation description, see the example template and the attribute/tag instructions. Mentioning users or notifying channel in Slack When creating a description that you know will be sent to Slack, you may wish to @mention a user or generate a channel-wide notification (e.g. @here or @channel). To achieve this, simply include the User ID or a channel-wide notification in the description surrounded by < and > characters. Here's an example for mentioning a user: Attention <@LewCirne> Copy Here's an example for generating a channel-wide notification: Attention <!channel> Copy Important Note that the Slack convention for channel-wide notifications in Incoming Webhooks is to use a ! prefix instead of @ e.g. !here or !channel For more help Recommendations for learning more: To learn more about NerdGraph, see Introduction to NerdGraph.

      "body": "A policy is a group of one or more conditions. This document explains how to create a policy and how to view existing policies. You can also use the REST API. For an explanation of how policies interact with conditions and other components, see Concepts and workflow. Tip The basic setup process is the same, regardless of which product (APM, browser, etc.) uses the policy. The types of metrics and thresholds for conditions vary depending on the monitored data source. Best practices for naming policies We recommend three common patterns and practices for structuring and naming policies: Targets or resources in your architecture that have people responsible for their well being Teams that are responsible for part of the architecture Individual policies for specific users Policies organized by... Comments Architecture Targets or resources in your organization may have different people responsible for their well-being. Common segments may include the environment type (production, staging, integration, development) or the target or resource type (app server code, client-side code, databases, hosts, etc.). To make these types of policies easier to identify, you can give them names based on your architecture. For example: Product A website (production) Product B website (staging) Mobile product app (iOS) Hosts (production) Databases (production) Teams Specific teams may be responsible for parts of your architecture. For example, you may want to name their policy Team: Site engineering, Team: Website development, etc. Individuals Policies set up for specific individuals may be useful when they want to personally keep an eye on a particular resource or metric. This provides them the freedom to add and remove conditions as well as adjust thresholds whenever they want, without having to communicate those changes to others. To make these policies easier to identify, you can include the person's name; for example, User: John Doe's metrics, User: Jane Doe (production), etc. Create an alert policy As part of the policy workflow, start by giving the policy a meaningful name: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Policies. On the policy index page, click New alert policy. Type a meaningful name for the policy (maximum 64 characters). Select the incident preference. Select Create alert policy. You can continue from here to define the conditions and assign one or more notification channels. If you decide to continue later, select the policy name from the Alert policies index. Change a policy name For your convenience, we allow you to use the same name for different policies, conditions, and notification channels. If you want to use unique names, review or search the index before adding or changing a name. To rename an existing policy: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Policies, and then (select a policy). Click the policy name to edit it, then type a meaningful name for the policy (maximum 64 characters). Alerts automatically updates any of the policy's conditions and notification channels. View existing policies The policies index lists policies in alphabetical order. To view or search for existing policies: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Policies. Use the search box, sort any column, or scroll the list. To view detailed information, click a policy name. Tip To view policy and condition information for a specific entity, select the Settings > Alert conditions page from the entity's product UI. Policy maintenance quick reference After you create a policy, you can: Add more conditions to the policy. Edit the conditions' names, targets, or thresholds. Disable conditions. Add one or more notification channels to a policy. Rename or delete the policy. The user interface shows a Last modified timestamp for any changes to policies, including their conditions and notification channels. Here is a quick reference which also includes links to more detailed information and procedures for maintaining your policies. Add or remove policies assigned to a channel To add or remove policies assigned to a channel: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Notification channels, then (select a channel). Click Alert policies, then (select a policy). From the selected policy, use the windows to select, remove, or clear all. Change a policy name To rename a policy: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, then (select a policy). Click the policy name to edit it, then type a meaningful name for the policy (maximum 64 characters). Check policy user assignment To check whether an account user has been assigned any policies: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Policies, (select a policy), then click Notification channels. Select a user, and then click Alert policies. Check policy channel assignment To check whether a notification channel has any policies assigned to it: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Notification channels. The Policy subscriptions column lists how many policies are assigned to the channel. Create a new policy To create a new alert policy: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Policies. Click New alert policy. Follow standard procedures to complete the basic setup process. Disable a policy You can't disable a policy directly. However, you can disable all of the policy's conditions. When you disable all of the conditions, the policy remains the Alert policies index. The policy itself isn't disabled, and you can re-enable any or all of its conditions at any time. Delete a policy If you delete a policy, we'll continue to apply any other policies assigned to the product entity (target). If you remove all policies for the entity, its color-coded health status indicator will appear light green with an icon. If you delete any of your account's policies, you can't restore them. Instead, you must re-create them if necessary. To delete a policy completely: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Alert policies. From the policy row, click the delete icon. Any notification channels associated with a deleted or disabled policy will remain. You must delete notification channels or remove them individually as necessary. In a deleted policy, incidents and event violations are provided as a read only resource. Check for entities (targets) assigned to a policy To check whether an entity (target) has any policies assigned: Go to the product (APM, browser, etc.). From the selected product's index, check whether the entity's color-coded health status is light green with an icon. Tip Exception: Infrastructure does not use this feature. Change how threshold violations roll up into incidents To select how violations to your thresholds are grouped into incident records (by policy, by condition, or by target and condition): In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, then (select a policy). Click Incident preference. Get context for alert violations with Incident Intelligence If you use Applied Intelligence, you can connect your conditions to Incident Intelligence. From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources and then click Alerts. Select the policies you want to connect to Applied Intelligence, and click Connect. You can add additional alerts policies or remove policies you've already connected in Sources > New Relic Alerts.",

      "body": "For some types of conditions, you can define a custom violation description that passes useful information downstream for better violation responses or for use by other systems. You can create a custom violation description in the UI or with NRQL. Requirements The custom violation description feature is available for: NRQL alert conditions Infrastructure monitoring alert conditions The custom violation description field has a maximum character size of 4000. What is a custom violation description? For some types of conditions, you can create a custom violation description that passes information about a condition and its violations downstream. Using a description, you can: Capture the reason for the condition Define the signal being monitored Define next steps Add metadata to downstream systems The Custom violation description field allows you to use a general template structure that, when a violation is generated, substitutes the generic sections with specific values. For example, let's say you used this in a description: This is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tag.fullHostname}} Copy A violation resulting from this condition would fill in the details and you'd receive a notification like this: This is my condition name : My Great Alert Condition The hostname is : ip-123-45-67-89.us-west-1.compute.internal Copy Create a custom violation description In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, (select a policy), then (select a condition): Click + Add custom violation description to open the field. For a condition, you can create a custom violation description using this field. Custom violation description template example Here's a custom violation description template example: this is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tag.fullHostname}} Owning Team: {{tag.label.owning_team}} Product: {{tag.label.product}} ec2VpcId: {{tag.aws.ec2VpcId}} Service name : {{tag.label.Name}} AWS Region : {{tag.aws.awsRegion}} AWS Availability Zone: {{tag.aws.awsAvailabilityZone}} Department : {{tag.label.department}} Environment: {{tag.label.environment}} Cluster: {{tag.clusterName}} Cluster Role: {{tag.clusterRole}} EC2 Instance Type: {{tag.instanceType}} EC2 InstanceID: {{tag.aws.ec2InstanceId}} EC2 AmiId: {{tag.aws.ec2AmiId}} EC2 Root Device Type: {{tag.aws.ec2RootDeviceType}} Copy Here's how that data might appear in a notification: How to use attributes The attributes you can use in a custom violation description are a subset of attributes attached to the violation event. Here are some details about the available attributes and how to use them: Violation event attributes: For any of the standard attributes available for use in a custom violation description, use the format {{AN_ATTRIBUTE}}. For example: The target name is : {{targetName}} Copy Tag attributes: For tags, you would use the format {{tag.TAG_NAME}}. There are two types of tags: Entity-related tags: For Infrastructure conditions only. You can find available entity-related tags by going to the New Relic Explorer and looking under a service's Metadata and tags, or by viewing violation details. Here's an example of using tags in a custom violation description: The AWS region is : {{tag.aws.awsRegion}} Responsible team : {{tag.label.owning_team}} Copy Facet clause tags: For NRQL conditions only. If a NRQL condition uses a FACET clause, you can use tag formatting to use those values in your custom violation description. For example, if the NRQL query included FACET hostName, cluster, you could then use this: The host is : {{tag.hostName}} The cluster is : {{tag.cluster}} Copy Please note that tag names cannot include a whitespace. The expanded values can include a whitespace, but not the names of the tags themselves. Create a custom violation description with NRQL You can create a custom violation description using a NRQL alert condition by creating a mutation with a description. Here's an empty mutation template: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: \"YOUR_CONDITION_ID\", condition: {description: \"\"}) { YOUR_CUSTOM_VIOLATION_DESCRIPTION } } Copy Here's an example mutation with a custom violation description: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: 123456, id: \"123456\", condition: {description: \"timestamp : {{timestamp}} \\n accountId : {{accountId}} \\n type : {{type}} \\n event : {{event}} \\n description : {{description}} \\n policyId : {{policyId}} \\n policyName: {{policyName}} \\n conditionName : {{conditionName}} \\n conditionId : {{conditionId}} \\n product : {{product}} \\n conditionType : {{conditionType}} \\n RunbookUrl : {{runbookUrl}} \\n nrqlQuery : {{nrqlQuery}} \\n nrqlEventType : {{nrqlEventType}} \\n targetID : {{targetId}} \\n targetName : {{targetName}} \\n commandLine : {{tag.commandLine}} \\n entityGuid : {{tag.entityGuid}} \\n entityName : {{tag.entityName}} \\n fullHostname : {{tag.fullHostname}} \\n instanceType : {{tag.instanceType}} \\n processDisplayName : {{tag.processDisplayName}}\"}) { description } } Copy For more information on NRQL conditions and using the NerdGraph API, go to NerdGraph API: NRQL condition alerts. For Infrastructure monitoring conditions, you can create the custom violation description when creating an Infrastructure monitoring alert condition. To learn about how to structure a custom violation description, see the example template and the attribute/tag instructions. Mentioning users or notifying channel in Slack When creating a description that you know will be sent to Slack, you may wish to @mention a user or generate a channel-wide notification (e.g. @here or @channel). To achieve this, simply include the User ID or a channel-wide notification in the description surrounded by < and > characters. Here's an example for mentioning a user: Attention <@LewCirne> Copy Here's an example for generating a channel-wide notification: Attention <!channel> Copy Important Note that the Slack convention for channel-wide notifications in Incoming Webhooks is to use a ! prefix instead of @ e.g. !here or !channel For more help Recommendations for learning more: To learn more about NerdGraph, see Introduction to NerdGraph.

      "body": "For some types of conditions, you can define a custom violation description that passes useful information downstream for better violation responses or for use by other systems. You can create a custom violation description in the UI or with NRQL. Requirements The custom violation description feature is available for: NRQL alert conditions Infrastructure monitoring alert conditions The custom violation description field has a maximum character size of 4000. What is a custom violation description? For some types of conditions, you can create a custom violation description that passes information about a condition and its violations downstream. Using a description, you can: Capture the reason for the condition Define the signal being monitored Define next steps Add metadata to downstream systems The Custom violation description field allows you to use a general template structure that, when a violation is generated, substitutes the generic sections with specific values. For example, let's say you used this in a description: This is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tag.fullHostname}} Copy A violation resulting from this condition would fill in the details and you'd receive a notification like this: This is my condition name : My Great Alert Condition The hostname is : ip-123-45-67-89.us-west-1.compute.internal Copy Create a custom violation description In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, (select a policy), then (select a condition): Click + Add custom violation description to open the field. For a condition, you can create a custom violation description using this field. Custom violation description template example Here's a custom violation description template example: this is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tag.fullHostname}} Owning Team: {{tag.label.owning_team}} Product: {{tag.label.product}} ec2VpcId: {{tag.aws.ec2VpcId}} Service name : {{tag.label.Name}} AWS Region : {{tag.aws.awsRegion}} AWS Availability Zone: {{tag.aws.awsAvailabilityZone}} Department : {{tag.label.department}} Environment: {{tag.label.environment}} Cluster: {{tag.clusterName}} Cluster Role: {{tag.clusterRole}} EC2 Instance Type: {{tag.instanceType}} EC2 InstanceID: {{tag.aws.ec2InstanceId}} EC2 AmiId: {{tag.aws.ec2AmiId}} EC2 Root Device Type: {{tag.aws.ec2RootDeviceType}} Copy Here's how that data might appear in a notification: How to use attributes The attributes you can use in a custom violation description are a subset of attributes attached to the violation event. Here are some details about the available attributes and how to use them: Violation event attributes: For any of the standard attributes available for use in a custom violation description, use the format {{AN_ATTRIBUTE}}. For example: The target name is : {{targetName}} Copy Tag attributes: For tags, you would use the format {{tag.TAG_NAME}}. There are two types of tags: Entity-related tags: For Infrastructure conditions only. You can find available entity-related tags by going to the New Relic Explorer and looking under a service's Metadata and tags, or by viewing violation details. Here's an example of using tags in a custom violation description: The AWS region is : {{tag.aws.awsRegion}} Responsible team : {{tag.label.owning_team}} Copy Facet clause tags: For NRQL conditions only. If a NRQL condition uses a FACET clause, you can use tag formatting to use those values in your custom violation description. For example, if the NRQL query included FACET hostName, cluster, you could then use this: The host is : {{tag.hostName}} The cluster is : {{tag.cluster}} Copy Please note that tag names cannot include a whitespace. The expanded values can include a whitespace, but not the names of the tags themselves. Create a custom violation description with NRQL You can create a custom violation description using a NRQL alert condition by creating a mutation with a description. Here's an empty mutation template: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: \"YOUR_CONDITION_ID\", condition: {description: \"\"}) { YOUR_CUSTOM_VIOLATION_DESCRIPTION } } Copy Here's an example mutation with a custom violation description: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: 123456, id: \"123456\", condition: {description: \"timestamp : {{timestamp}} \\n accountId : {{accountId}} \\n type : {{type}} \\n event : {{event}} \\n description : {{description}} \\n policyId : {{policyId}} \\n policyName: {{policyName}} \\n conditionName : {{conditionName}} \\n conditionId : {{conditionId}} \\n product : {{product}} \\n conditionType : {{conditionType}} \\n RunbookUrl : {{runbookUrl}} \\n nrqlQuery : {{nrqlQuery}} \\n nrqlEventType : {{nrqlEventType}} \\n targetID : {{targetId}} \\n targetName : {{targetName}} \\n commandLine : {{tag.commandLine}} \\n entityGuid : {{tag.entityGuid}} \\n entityName : {{tag.entityName}} \\n fullHostname : {{tag.fullHostname}} \\n instanceType : {{tag.instanceType}} \\n processDisplayName : {{tag.processDisplayName}}\"}) { description } } Copy For more information on NRQL conditions and using the NerdGraph API, go to NerdGraph API: NRQL condition alerts. For Infrastructure monitoring conditions, you can create the custom violation description when creating an Infrastructure monitoring alert condition. To learn about how to structure a custom violation description, see the example template and the attribute/tag instructions. Mentioning users or notifying channel in Slack When creating a description that you know will be sent to Slack, you may wish to @mention a user or generate a channel-wide notification (e.g. @here or @channel). To achieve this, simply include the User ID or a channel-wide notification in the description surrounded by < and > characters. Here's an example for mentioning a user: Attention <@LewCirne> Copy Here's an example for generating a channel-wide notification: Attention <!channel> Copy Important Note that the Slack convention for channel-wide notifications in Incoming Webhooks is to use a ! prefix instead of @ e.g. !here or !channel For more help Recommendations for learning more: To learn more about NerdGraph, see Introduction to NerdGraph.

      "body": "A policy is a group of one or more conditions. This document explains how to create a policy and how to view existing policies. You can also use the REST API. For an explanation of how policies interact with conditions and other components, see Concepts and workflow. Tip The basic setup process is the same, regardless of which product (APM, browser, etc.) uses the policy. The types of metrics and thresholds for conditions vary depending on the monitored data source. Best practices for naming policies We recommend three common patterns and practices for structuring and naming policies: Targets or resources in your architecture that have people responsible for their well being Teams that are responsible for part of the architecture Individual policies for specific users Policies organized by... Comments Architecture Targets or resources in your organization may have different people responsible for their well-being. Common segments may include the environment type (production, staging, integration, development) or the target or resource type (app server code, client-side code, databases, hosts, etc.). To make these types of policies easier to identify, you can give them names based on your architecture. For example: Product A website (production) Product B website (staging) Mobile product app (iOS) Hosts (production) Databases (production) Teams Specific teams may be responsible for parts of your architecture. For example, you may want to name their policy Team: Site engineering, Team: Website development, etc. Individuals Policies set up for specific individuals may be useful when they want to personally keep an eye on a particular resource or metric. This provides them the freedom to add and remove conditions as well as adjust thresholds whenever they want, without having to communicate those changes to others. To make these policies easier to identify, you can include the person's name; for example, User: John Doe's metrics, User: Jane Doe (production), etc. Create an alert policy As part of the policy workflow, start by giving the policy a meaningful name: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Policies. On the policy index page, click New alert policy. Type a meaningful name for the policy (maximum 64 characters). Select the incident preference. Select Create alert policy. You can continue from here to define the conditions and assign one or more notification channels. If you decide to continue later, select the policy name from the Alert policies index. Change a policy name For your convenience, we allow you to use the same name for different policies, conditions, and notification channels. If you want to use unique names, review or search the index before adding or changing a name. To rename an existing policy: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Policies, and then (select a policy). Click the policy name to edit it, then type a meaningful name for the policy (maximum 64 characters). Alerts automatically updates any of the policy's conditions and notification channels. View existing policies The policies index lists policies in alphabetical order. To view or search for existing policies: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Policies. Use the search box, sort any column, or scroll the list. To view detailed information, click a policy name. Tip To view policy and condition information for a specific entity, select the Settings > Alert conditions page from the entity's product UI. Policy maintenance quick reference After you create a policy, you can: Add more conditions to the policy. Edit the conditions' names, targets, or thresholds. Disable conditions.

      "body": "For some types of conditions, you can define a custom violation description that passes useful information downstream for better violation responses or for use by other systems. You can create a custom violation description in the UI or with NRQL. Requirements The custom violation description feature is available for: NRQL alert conditions Infrastructure monitoring alert conditions The custom violation description field has a maximum character size of 4000. What is a custom violation description? For some types of conditions, you can create a custom violation description that passes information about a condition and its violations downstream. Using a description, you can: Capture the reason for the condition Define the signal being monitored Define next steps Add metadata to downstream systems The Custom violation description field allows you to use a general template structure that, when a violation is generated, substitutes the generic sections with specific values. For example, let's say you used this in a description: This is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tag.fullHostname}} Copy A violation resulting from this condition would fill in the details and you'd receive a notification like this: This is my condition name : My Great Alert Condition The hostname is : ip-123-45-67-89.us-west-1.compute.internal Copy Create a custom violation description In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, (select a policy), then (select a condition): Click + Add custom violation description to open the field. For a condition, you can create a custom violation description using this field. Custom violation description template example Here's a custom violation description template example: this is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tag.fullHostname}} Owning Team: {{tag.label.owning_team}} Product: {{tag.label.product}} ec2VpcId: {{tag.aws.ec2VpcId}} Service name : {{tag.label.Name}} AWS Region : {{tag.aws.awsRegion}} AWS Availability Zone: {{tag.aws.awsAvailabilityZone}} Department : {{tag.label.department}} Environment: {{tag.label.environment}} Cluster: {{tag.clusterName}} Cluster Role: {{tag.clusterRole}} EC2 Instance Type: {{tag.instanceType}} EC2 InstanceID: {{tag.aws.ec2InstanceId}} EC2 AmiId: {{tag.aws.ec2AmiId}} EC2 Root Device Type: {{tag.aws.ec2RootDeviceType}} Copy Here's how that data might appear in a notification: How to use attributes The attributes you can use in a custom violation description are a subset of attributes attached to the violation event. Here are some details about the available attributes and how to use them: Violation event attributes: For any of the standard attributes available for use in a custom violation description, use the format {{AN_ATTRIBUTE}}. For example: The target name is : {{targetName}} Copy Tag attributes: For tags, you would use the format {{tag.TAG_NAME}}. There are two types of tags: Entity-related tags: For Infrastructure conditions only. You can find available entity-related tags by going to the New Relic Explorer and looking under a service's Metadata and tags, or by viewing violation details. Here's an example of using tags in a custom violation description: The AWS region is : {{tag.aws.awsRegion}} Responsible team : {{tag.label.owning_team}} Copy Facet clause tags: For NRQL conditions only. If a NRQL condition uses a FACET clause, you can use tag formatting to use those values in your custom violation description. For example, if the NRQL query included FACET hostName, cluster, you could then use this: The host is : {{tag.hostName}} The cluster is : {{tag.cluster}} Copy Please note that tag names cannot include a whitespace. The expanded values can include a whitespace, but not the names of the tags themselves. Create a custom violation description with NRQL You can create a custom violation description using a NRQL alert condition by creating a mutation with a description. Here's an empty mutation template: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: \"YOUR_CONDITION_ID\", condition: {description: \"\"}) { YOUR_CUSTOM_VIOLATION_DESCRIPTION } } Copy Here's an example mutation with a custom violation description: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: 123456, id: \"123456\", condition: {description: \"timestamp : {{timestamp}} \\n accountId : {{accountId}} \\n type : {{type}} \\n event : {{event}} \\n description : {{description}} \\n policyId : {{policyId}} \\n policyName: {{policyName}} \\n conditionName : {{conditionName}} \\n conditionId : {{conditionId}} \\n product : {{product}} \\n conditionType : {{conditionType}} \\n RunbookUrl : {{runbookUrl}} \\n nrqlQuery : {{nrqlQuery}} \\n nrqlEventType : {{nrqlEventType}} \\n targetID : {{targetId}} \\n targetName : {{targetName}} \\n commandLine : {{tag.commandLine}} \\n entityGuid : {{tag.entityGuid}} \\n entityName : {{tag.entityName}} \\n fullHostname : {{tag.fullHostname}} \\n instanceType : {{tag.instanceType}} \\n processDisplayName : {{tag.processDisplayName}}\"}) { description } } Copy For more information on NRQL conditions and using the NerdGraph API, go to NerdGraph API: NRQL condition alerts. For Infrastructure monitoring conditions, you can create the custom violation description when creating an Infrastructure monitoring alert condition. To learn about how to structure a custom violation description, see the example template and the attribute/tag instructions. Mentioning users or notifying channel in Slack When creating a description that you know will be sent to Slack, you may wish to @mention a user or generate a channel-wide notification (e.g. @here or @channel). To achieve this, simply include the User ID or a channel-wide notification in the description surrounded by < and > characters. Here's an example for mentioning a user: Attention <@LewCirne> Copy Here's an example for generating a channel-wide notification: Attention <!channel> Copy Important Note that the Slack convention for channel-wide notifications in Incoming Webhooks is to use a ! prefix instead of @ e.g. !here or !channel For more help Recommendations for learning more: To learn more about NerdGraph, see Introduction to NerdGraph.

      "body": "A policy is a group of one or more conditions. This document explains how to create a policy and how to view existing policies. You can also use the REST API. For an explanation of how policies interact with conditions and other components, see Concepts and workflow. Tip The basic setup process is the same, regardless of which product (APM, browser, etc.) uses the policy. The types of metrics and thresholds for conditions vary depending on the monitored data source. Best practices for naming policies We recommend three common patterns and practices for structuring and naming policies: Targets or resources in your architecture that have people responsible for their well being Teams that are responsible for part of the architecture Individual policies for specific users Policies organized by... Comments Architecture Targets or resources in your organization may have different people responsible for their well-being. Common segments may include the environment type (production, staging, integration, development) or the target or resource type (app server code, client-side code, databases, hosts, etc.). To make these types of policies easier to identify, you can give them names based on your architecture. For example: Product A website (production) Product B website (staging) Mobile product app (iOS) Hosts (production) Databases (production) Teams Specific teams may be responsible for parts of your architecture. For example, you may want to name their policy Team: Site engineering, Team: Website development, etc. Individuals Policies set up for specific individuals may be useful when they want to personally keep an eye on a particular resource or metric. This provides them the freedom to add and remove conditions as well as adjust thresholds whenever they want, without having to communicate those changes to others. To make these policies easier to identify, you can include the person's name; for example, User: John Doe's metrics, User: Jane Doe (production), etc. Create an alert policy As part of the policy workflow, start by giving the policy a meaningful name: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Policies. On the policy index page, click New alert policy. Type a meaningful name for the policy (maximum 64 characters). Select the incident preference. Select Create alert policy. You can continue from here to define the conditions and assign one or more notification channels. If you decide to continue later, select the policy name from the Alert policies index. Change a policy name For your convenience, we allow you to use the same name for different policies, conditions, and notification channels. If you want to use unique names, review or search the index before adding or changing a name. To rename an existing policy: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Policies, and then (select a policy). Click the policy name to edit it, then type a meaningful name for the policy (maximum 64 characters). Alerts automatically updates any of the policy's conditions and notification channels. View existing policies The policies index lists policies in alphabetical order. To view or search for existing policies: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Policies. Use the search box, sort any column, or scroll the list. To view detailed information, click a policy name. Tip To view policy and condition information for a specific entity, select the Settings > Alert conditions page from the entity's product UI. Policy maintenance quick reference After you create a policy, you can: Add more conditions to the policy. Edit the conditions' names, targets, or thresholds. Disable conditions. Add one or more notification channels to a policy. Rename or delete the policy. The user interface shows a Last modified timestamp for any changes to policies, including their conditions and notification channels. Here is a quick reference which also includes links to more detailed information and procedures for maintaining your policies. Add or remove policies assigned to a channel To add or remove policies assigned to a channel: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Notification channels, then (select a channel). Click Alert policies, then (select a policy). From the selected policy, use the windows to select, remove, or clear all. Change a policy name To rename a policy: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, then (select a policy). Click the policy name to edit it, then type a meaningful name for the policy (maximum 64 characters). Check policy user assignment To check whether an account user has been assigned any policies: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Policies, (select a policy), then click Notification channels. Select a user, and then click Alert policies. Check policy channel assignment To check whether a notification channel has any policies assigned to it: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Notification channels. The Policy subscriptions column lists how many policies are assigned to the channel. Create a new policy To create a new alert policy: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Policies. Click New alert policy. Follow standard procedures to complete the basic setup process. Disable a policy You can't disable a policy directly. However, you can disable all of the policy's conditions. When you disable all of the conditions, the policy remains the Alert policies index. The policy itself isn't disabled, and you can re-enable any or all of its conditions at any time. Delete a policy If you delete a policy, we'll continue to apply any other policies assigned to the product entity (target). If you remove all policies for the entity, its color-coded health status indicator will appear light green with an icon. If you delete any of your account's policies, you can't restore them. Instead, you must re-create them if necessary. To delete a policy completely: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Alert policies. From the policy row, click the delete icon. Any notification channels associated with a deleted or disabled policy will remain. You must delete notification channels or remove them individually as necessary. In a deleted policy, incidents and event violations are provided as a read only resource. Check for entities (targets) assigned to a policy To check whether an entity (target) has any policies assigned: Go to the product (APM, browser, etc.). From the selected product's index, check whether the entity's color-coded health status is light green with an icon. Tip Exception: Infrastructure does not use this feature. Change how threshold violations roll up into incidents To select how violations to your thresholds are grouped into incident records (by policy, by condition, or by target and condition): In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, then (select a policy). Click Incident preference. Get context for alert violations with Incident Intelligence If you use Applied Intelligence, you can connect your conditions to Incident Intelligence. From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources and then click Alerts. Select the policies you want to connect to Applied Intelligence, and click Connect. You can add additional alerts policies or remove policies you've already connected in Sources > New Relic Alerts.",

      "body": "For some types of conditions, you can define a custom violation description that passes useful information downstream for better violation responses or for use by other systems. You can create a custom violation description in the UI or with NRQL. Requirements The custom violation description feature is available for: NRQL alert conditions Infrastructure monitoring alert conditions The custom violation description field has a maximum character size of 4000. What is a custom violation description? For some types of conditions, you can create a custom violation description that passes information about a condition and its violations downstream. Using a description, you can: Capture the reason for the condition Define the signal being monitored Define next steps Add metadata to downstream systems The Custom violation description field allows you to use a general template structure that, when a violation is generated, substitutes the generic sections with specific values. For example, let's say you used this in a description: This is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tag.fullHostname}} Copy A violation resulting from this condition would fill in the details and you'd receive a notification like this: This is my condition name : My Great Alert Condition The hostname is : ip-123-45-67-89.us-west-1.compute.internal Copy Create a custom violation description In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, (select a policy), then (select a condition): Click + Add custom violation description to open the field. For a condition, you can create a custom violation description using this field. Custom violation description template example Here's a custom violation description template example: this is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tag.fullHostname}} Owning Team: {{tag.label.owning_team}} Product: {{tag.label.product}} ec2VpcId: {{tag.aws.ec2VpcId}} Service name : {{tag.label.Name}} AWS Region : {{tag.aws.awsRegion}} AWS Availability Zone: {{tag.aws.awsAvailabilityZone}} Department : {{tag.label.department}} Environment: {{tag.label.environment}} Cluster: {{tag.clusterName}} Cluster Role: {{tag.clusterRole}} EC2 Instance Type: {{tag.instanceType}} EC2 InstanceID: {{tag.aws.ec2InstanceId}} EC2 AmiId: {{tag.aws.ec2AmiId}} EC2 Root Device Type: {{tag.aws.ec2RootDeviceType}} Copy Here's how that data might appear in a notification: How to use attributes The attributes you can use in a custom violation description are a subset of attributes attached to the violation event. Here are some details about the available attributes and how to use them: Violation event attributes: For any of the standard attributes available for use in a custom violation description, use the format {{AN_ATTRIBUTE}}. For example: The target name is : {{targetName}} Copy Tag attributes: For tags, you would use the format {{tag.TAG_NAME}}. There are two types of tags: Entity-related tags: For Infrastructure conditions only. You can find available entity-related tags by going to the New Relic Explorer and looking under a service's Metadata and tags, or by viewing violation details. Here's an example of using tags in a custom violation description: The AWS region is : {{tag.aws.awsRegion}} Responsible team : {{tag.label.owning_team}} Copy Facet clause tags: For NRQL conditions only. If a NRQL condition uses a FACET clause, you can use tag formatting to use those values in your custom violation description. For example, if the NRQL query included FACET hostName, cluster, you could then use this: The host is : {{tag.hostName}} The cluster is : {{tag.cluster}} Copy Please note that tag names cannot include a whitespace. The expanded values can include a whitespace, but not the names of the tags themselves. Create a custom violation description with NRQL You can create a custom violation description using a NRQL alert condition by creating a mutation with a description. Here's an empty mutation template: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: \"YOUR_CONDITION_ID\", condition: {description: \"\"}) { YOUR_CUSTOM_VIOLATION_DESCRIPTION } } Copy Here's an example mutation with a custom violation description: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: 123456, id: \"123456\", condition: {description: \"timestamp : {{timestamp}} \\n accountId : {{accountId}} \\n type : {{type}} \\n event : {{event}} \\n description : {{description}} \\n policyId : {{policyId}} \\n policyName: {{policyName}} \\n conditionName : {{conditionName}} \\n conditionId : {{conditionId}} \\n product : {{product}} \\n conditionType : {{conditionType}} \\n RunbookUrl : {{runbookUrl}} \\n nrqlQuery : {{nrqlQuery}} \\n nrqlEventType : {{nrqlEventType}} \\n targetID : {{targetId}} \\n targetName : {{targetName}} \\n commandLine : {{tag.commandLine}} \\n entityGuid : {{tag.entityGuid}} \\n entityName : {{tag.entityName}} \\n fullHostname : {{tag.fullHostname}} \\n instanceType : {{tag.instanceType}} \\n processDisplayName : {{tag.processDisplayName}}\"}) { description } } Copy For more information on NRQL conditions and using the NerdGraph API, go to NerdGraph API: NRQL condition alerts. For Infrastructure monitoring conditions, you can create the custom violation description when creating an Infrastructure monitoring alert condition. To learn about how to structure a custom violation description, see the example template and the attribute/tag instructions. Mentioning users or notifying channel in Slack When creating a description that you know will be sent to Slack, you may wish to @mention a user or generate a channel-wide notification (e.g. @here or @channel). To achieve this, simply include the User ID or a channel-wide notification in the description surrounded by < and > characters. Here's an example for mentioning a user: Attention <@LewCirne> Copy Here's an example for generating a channel-wide notification: Attention <!channel> Copy Important Note that the Slack convention for channel-wide notifications in Incoming Webhooks is to use a ! prefix instead of @ e.g. !here or !channel For more help Recommendations for learning more: To learn more about NerdGraph, see Introduction to NerdGraph.

For an explanation of how policies interact with conditions and other components, see Concepts and workflow. Tip The basic setup process is the same, regardless of which product (APM, browser, etc.) uses the policy. The types of metrics and thresholds for conditions vary depending on the monitored data source. Best practices for naming policies We recommend three common patterns and practices for structuring and naming policies: Targets or resources in your architecture that have people responsible for their well being Teams that are responsible for part of the architecture Individual policies for specific users Policies organized by... Comments Architecture Targets or resources in your organization may have different people responsible for their well-being. Common segments may include the environment type (production, staging, integration, development) or the target or resource type (app server code, client-side code, databases, hosts, etc.). To make these types of policies easier to identify, you can give them names based on your architecture. For example: Product A website (production) Product B website (staging) Mobile product app (iOS) Hosts (production) Databases (production) Teams Specific teams may be responsible for parts of your architecture. For example, you may want to name their policy Team: Site engineering, Team: Website development, etc. Individuals Policies set up for specific individuals may be useful when they want to personally keep an eye on a particular resource or metric. This provides them the freedom to add and remove conditions as well as adjust thresholds whenever they want, without having to communicate those changes to others. To make these policies easier to identify, you can include the person's name; for example, User: John Doe's metrics, User: Jane Doe (production), etc. Create an alert policy As part of the policy workflow, start by giving the policy a meaningful name: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Policies. On the policy index page, click New alert policy. Type a meaningful name for the policy (maximum 64 characters). Select the incident preference. Select Create alert policy. You can continue from here to define the conditions and assign one or more notification channels. If you decide to continue later, select the policy name from the Alert policies index. Change a policy name For your convenience, we allow you to use the same name for different policies, conditions, and notification channels. If you want to use unique names, review or search the index before adding or changing a name. To rename an existing policy: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Policies, and then (select a policy). Click the policy name to edit it, then type a meaningful name for the policy (maximum 64 characters). Alerts automatically updates any of the policy's conditions and notification channels. View existing policies The policies index lists policies in alphabetical order. To view or search for existing policies: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Policies. Use the search box, sort any column, or scroll the list. To view detailed information, click a policy name. Tip To view policy and condition information for a specific entity, select the Settings > Alert conditions page from the entity's product UI. Policy maintenance quick reference After you create a policy, you can: Add more conditions to the policy. Edit the conditions' names, targets, or thresholds. Disable conditions. Add one or more notification channels to a policy. Rename or delete the policy. The user interface shows a Last modified timestamp for any changes to policies, including their conditions and notification channels. Here is a quick reference which also includes links to more detailed information and procedures for maintaining your policies. Add or remove policies assigned to a channel To add or remove policies assigned to a channel: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Notification channels, then (select a channel). Click Alert policies, then (select a policy). From the selected policy, use the windows to select, remove, or clear all. Change a policy name To rename a policy: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, then (select a policy). Click the policy name to edit it, then type a meaningful name for the policy (maximum 64 characters). Check policy user assignment To check whether an account user has been assigned any policies: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Policies, (select a policy), then click Notification channels. Select a user, and then click Alert policies. Check policy channel assignment To check whether a notification channel has any policies assigned to it: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Notification channels. The Policy subscriptions column lists how many policies are assigned to the channel. Create a new policy To create a new alert policy: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Policies. Click New alert policy. Follow standard procedures to complete the basic setup process. Disable a policy You can't disable a policy directly. However, you can disable all of the policy's conditions. When you disable all of the conditions, the policy remains the Alert policies index. The policy itself isn't disabled, and you can re-enable any or all of its conditions at any time. Delete a policy If you delete a policy, we'll continue to apply any other policies assigned to the product entity (target). If you remove all policies for the entity, its color-coded health status indicator will appear light green with an icon. If you delete any of your account's policies, you can't restore them. Instead, you must re-create them if necessary. To delete a policy completely: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Alert policies. From the policy row, click the delete icon. Any notification channels associated with a deleted or disabled policy will remain. You must delete notification channels or remove them individually as necessary. In a deleted policy, incidents and event violations are provided as a read only resource. Check for entities (targets) assigned to a policy To check whether an entity (target) has any policies assigned: Go to the product (APM, browser, etc.). From the selected product's index, check whether the entity's color-coded health status is light green with an icon. Tip Exception: Infrastructure does not use this feature. Change how threshold violations roll up into incidents To select how violations to your thresholds are grouped into incident records (by policy, by condition, or by target and condition): In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, then (select a policy). Click Incident preference. Get context for alert violations with Incident Intelligence If you use Applied Intelligence, you can connect your conditions to Incident Intelligence.

      "body": "This document explains the different ways violations can be closed. How violations automatically close A violation will automatically close when the targeted signal returns to a non-violating state for the time period indicated in the condition's thresholds. This wait time is called the recovery period. For example: If the violating behavior is \"Apdex score below 0.80 at least once in 5 minutes,\" then the violation will automatically close when the Apdex score is equal to or higher than .80 for 5 consecutive minutes. The same applies to a \"for at least x minutes\" threshold: x minutes of non-violating behavior are required to automatically close the violation. When a violation closes automatically: The closing timestamp is backdated to the start of the recovery period. The evaluation resets and restarts from when the previous violation ended. All conditions have a violation time limit setting that will automatically force-close a long-lasting violation. Manually close a violation You can manually close an open violation. This is useful, for example, when a signal has violated the threshold, but it no longer exists and also doesn't have a violation time limit. (A time limit would automatically close a long-lasting violation.) To close a violation: Go to the open violation you want to close. Click Manually close violation. To close all violations associated with a condition: Go to the condition you want to close. Disable the condition and then re-enable it. Important An incident will close automatically when all of its associated critical violations have been closed. Set a time limit for long-lasting violations The violation time limit setting will automatically force-close a long-lasting violation after the number of days/hours you select. This is most useful for ephemeral entities that, when they disappear, cause a continual violation that won't automatically close. Limits and Defaults All alert violations will have a violation time limit applied to them. Most alert conditions will allow you to edit this field. The default value, if one is not supplied during configuration, is 3 days (24 hours for Infrastructure conditions). The violation time limit for non-Infrastructure conditions can be set as low as 5 minutes, and as high as 30 days. If, for some reason, the signal is still violating in 30 days, the violation will close, and a new violation will open. Infrastructure conditions can be set to the following hours: 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48, or 72. Examples: You set the violation time limit to 12 hours. If that violation lasts for 12 hours, it will be closed at 12 hours and the condition's evaluation of that entity will be reset. Your JVM has a CPU spike and this creates a violation. The JVM then crashes and is replaced by a new JVM. If you have not set a violation time limit, the crashed JVM’s violation will never close.",

      "body": "For some types of conditions, you can define a custom violation description that passes useful information downstream for better violation responses or for use by other systems. You can create a custom violation description in the UI or with NRQL. Requirements The custom violation description feature is available for: NRQL alert conditions Infrastructure monitoring alert conditions The custom violation description field has a maximum character size of 4000. What is a custom violation description? For some types of conditions, you can create a custom violation description that passes information about a condition and its violations downstream. Using a description, you can: Capture the reason for the condition Define the signal being monitored Define next steps Add metadata to downstream systems The Custom violation description field allows you to use a general template structure that, when a violation is generated, substitutes the generic sections with specific values. For example, let's say you used this in a description: This is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tag.fullHostname}} Copy A violation resulting from this condition would fill in the details and you'd receive a notification like this: This is my condition name : My Great Alert Condition The hostname is : ip-123-45-67-89.us-west-1.compute.internal Copy Create a custom violation description In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, (select a policy), then (select a condition): Click + Add custom violation description to open the field. For a condition, you can create a custom violation description using this field. Custom violation description template example Here's a custom violation description template example: this is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tag.fullHostname}} Owning Team: {{tag.label.owning_team}} Product: {{tag.label.product}} ec2VpcId: {{tag.aws.ec2VpcId}} Service name : {{tag.label.Name}} AWS Region : {{tag.aws.awsRegion}} AWS Availability Zone: {{tag.aws.awsAvailabilityZone}} Department : {{tag.label.department}} Environment: {{tag.label.environment}} Cluster: {{tag.clusterName}} Cluster Role: {{tag.clusterRole}} EC2 Instance Type: {{tag.instanceType}} EC2 InstanceID: {{tag.aws.ec2InstanceId}} EC2 AmiId: {{tag.aws.ec2AmiId}} EC2 Root Device Type: {{tag.aws.ec2RootDeviceType}} Copy Here's how that data might appear in a notification: How to use attributes The attributes you can use in a custom violation description are a subset of attributes attached to the violation event. Here are some details about the available attributes and how to use them: Violation event attributes: For any of the standard attributes available for use in a custom violation description, use the format {{AN_ATTRIBUTE}}. For example: The target name is : {{targetName}} Copy Tag attributes: For tags, you would use the format {{tag.TAG_NAME}}. There are two types of tags: Entity-related tags: For Infrastructure conditions only. You can find available entity-related tags by going to the New Relic Explorer and looking under a service's Metadata and tags, or by viewing violation details. Here's an example of using tags in a custom violation description: The AWS region is : {{tag.aws.awsRegion}} Responsible team : {{tag.label.owning_team}} Copy Facet clause tags: For NRQL conditions only. If a NRQL condition uses a FACET clause, you can use tag formatting to use those values in your custom violation description. For example, if the NRQL query included FACET hostName, cluster, you could then use this: The host is : {{tag.hostName}} The cluster is : {{tag.cluster}} Copy Please note that tag names cannot include a whitespace. The expanded values can include a whitespace, but not the names of the tags themselves. Create a custom violation description with NRQL You can create a custom violation description using a NRQL alert condition by creating a mutation with a description. Here's an empty mutation template: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: \"YOUR_CONDITION_ID\", condition: {description: \"\"}) { YOUR_CUSTOM_VIOLATION_DESCRIPTION } } Copy Here's an example mutation with a custom violation description: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: 123456, id: \"123456\", condition: {description: \"timestamp : {{timestamp}} \\n accountId : {{accountId}} \\n type : {{type}} \\n event : {{event}} \\n description : {{description}} \\n policyId : {{policyId}} \\n policyName: {{policyName}} \\n conditionName : {{conditionName}} \\n conditionId : {{conditionId}} \\n product : {{product}} \\n conditionType : {{conditionType}} \\n RunbookUrl : {{runbookUrl}} \\n nrqlQuery : {{nrqlQuery}} \\n nrqlEventType : {{nrqlEventType}} \\n targetID : {{targetId}} \\n targetName : {{targetName}} \\n commandLine : {{tag.commandLine}} \\n entityGuid : {{tag.entityGuid}} \\n entityName : {{tag.entityName}} \\n fullHostname : {{tag.fullHostname}} \\n instanceType : {{tag.instanceType}} \\n processDisplayName : {{tag.processDisplayName}}\"}) { description } } Copy For more information on NRQL conditions and using the NerdGraph API, go to NerdGraph API: NRQL condition alerts. For Infrastructure monitoring conditions, you can create the custom violation description when creating an Infrastructure monitoring alert condition. To learn about how to structure a custom violation description, see the example template and the attribute/tag instructions. Mentioning users or notifying channel in Slack When creating a description that you know will be sent to Slack, you may wish to @mention a user or generate a channel-wide notification (e.g. @here or @channel). To achieve this, simply include the User ID or a channel-wide notification in the description surrounded by < and > characters. Here's an example for mentioning a user: Attention <@LewCirne> Copy Here's an example for generating a channel-wide notification: Attention <!channel> Copy Important Note that the Slack convention for channel-wide notifications in Incoming Webhooks is to use a ! prefix instead of @ e.g. !here or !channel For more help Recommendations for learning more: To learn more about NerdGraph, see Introduction to NerdGraph.

For an explanation of how policies interact with conditions and other components, see Concepts and workflow. Tip The basic setup process is the same, regardless of which product (APM, browser, etc.) uses the policy. The types of metrics and thresholds for conditions vary depending on the monitored data source. Best practices for naming policies We recommend three common patterns and practices for structuring and naming policies: Targets or resources in your architecture that have people responsible for their well being Teams that are responsible for part of the architecture Individual policies for specific users Policies organized by... Comments Architecture Targets or resources in your organization may have different people responsible for their well-being. Common segments may include the environment type (production, staging, integration, development) or the target or resource type (app server code, client-side code, databases, hosts, etc.). To make these types of policies easier to identify, you can give them names based on your architecture. For example: Product A website (production) Product B website (staging) Mobile product app (iOS) Hosts (production) Databases (production) Teams Specific teams may be responsible for parts of your architecture. For example, you may want to name their policy Team: Site engineering, Team: Website development, etc. Individuals Policies set up for specific individuals may be useful when they want to personally keep an eye on a particular resource or metric. This provides them the freedom to add and remove conditions as well as adjust thresholds whenever they want, without having to communicate those changes to others. To make these policies easier to identify, you can include the person's name; for example, User: John Doe's metrics, User: Jane Doe (production), etc. Create an alert policy As part of the policy workflow, start by giving the policy a meaningful name: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Policies. On the policy index page, click New alert policy. Type a meaningful name for the policy (maximum 64 characters). Select the incident preference. Select Create alert policy. You can continue from here to define the conditions and assign one or more notification channels. If you decide to continue later, select the policy name from the Alert policies index. Change a policy name For your convenience, we allow you to use the same name for different policies, conditions, and notification channels. If you want to use unique names, review or search the index before adding or changing a name. To rename an existing policy: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Policies, and then (select a policy). Click the policy name to edit it, then type a meaningful name for the policy (maximum 64 characters). Alerts automatically updates any of the policy's conditions and notification channels. View existing policies The policies index lists policies in alphabetical order. To view or search for existing policies: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Policies. Use the search box, sort any column, or scroll the list. To view detailed information, click a policy name. Tip To view policy and condition information for a specific entity, select the Settings > Alert conditions page from the entity's product UI. Policy maintenance quick reference After you create a policy, you can: Add more conditions to the policy. Edit the conditions' names, targets, or thresholds. Disable conditions. Add one or more notification channels to a policy. Rename or delete the policy. The user interface shows a Last modified timestamp for any changes to policies, including their conditions and notification channels.

      "body": "For some types of conditions, you can define a custom violation description that passes useful information downstream for better violation responses or for use by other systems. You can create a custom violation description in the UI or with NRQL. Requirements The custom violation description feature is available for: NRQL alert conditions Infrastructure monitoring alert conditions The custom violation description field has a maximum character size of 4000. What is a custom violation description? For some types of conditions, you can create a custom violation description that passes information about a condition and its violations downstream. Using a description, you can: Capture the reason for the condition Define the signal being monitored Define next steps Add metadata to downstream systems The Custom violation description field allows you to use a general template structure that, when a violation is generated, substitutes the generic sections with specific values. For example, let's say you used this in a description: This is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tag.fullHostname}} Copy A violation resulting from this condition would fill in the details and you'd receive a notification like this: This is my condition name : My Great Alert Condition The hostname is : ip-123-45-67-89.us-west-1.compute.internal Copy Create a custom violation description In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, (select a policy), then (select a condition): Click + Add custom violation description to open the field. For a condition, you can create a custom violation description using this field. Custom violation description template example Here's a custom violation description template example: this is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tag.fullHostname}} Owning Team: {{tag.label.owning_team}} Product: {{tag.label.product}} ec2VpcId: {{tag.aws.ec2VpcId}} Service name : {{tag.label.Name}} AWS Region : {{tag.aws.awsRegion}} AWS Availability Zone: {{tag.aws.awsAvailabilityZone}} Department : {{tag.label.department}} Environment: {{tag.label.environment}} Cluster: {{tag.clusterName}} Cluster Role: {{tag.clusterRole}} EC2 Instance Type: {{tag.instanceType}} EC2 InstanceID: {{tag.aws.ec2InstanceId}} EC2 AmiId: {{tag.aws.ec2AmiId}} EC2 Root Device Type: {{tag.aws.ec2RootDeviceType}} Copy Here's how that data might appear in a notification: How to use attributes The attributes you can use in a custom violation description are a subset of attributes attached to the violation event. Here are some details about the available attributes and how to use them: Violation event attributes: For any of the standard attributes available for use in a custom violation description, use the format {{AN_ATTRIBUTE}}. For example: The target name is : {{targetName}} Copy Tag attributes: For tags, you would use the format {{tag.TAG_NAME}}. There are two types of tags: Entity-related tags: For Infrastructure conditions only. You can find available entity-related tags by going to the New Relic Explorer and looking under a service's Metadata and tags, or by viewing violation details. Here's an example of using tags in a custom violation description: The AWS region is : {{tag.aws.awsRegion}} Responsible team : {{tag.label.owning_team}} Copy Facet clause tags: For NRQL conditions only. If a NRQL condition uses a FACET clause, you can use tag formatting to use those values in your custom violation description. For example, if the NRQL query included FACET hostName, cluster, you could then use this: The host is : {{tag.hostName}} The cluster is : {{tag.cluster}} Copy Please note that tag names cannot include a whitespace. The expanded values can include a whitespace, but not the names of the tags themselves. Create a custom violation description with NRQL You can create a custom violation description using a NRQL alert condition by creating a mutation with a description. Here's an empty mutation template: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: \"YOUR_CONDITION_ID\", condition: {description: \"\"}) { YOUR_CUSTOM_VIOLATION_DESCRIPTION } } Copy Here's an example mutation with a custom violation description: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: 123456, id: \"123456\", condition: {description: \"timestamp : {{timestamp}} \\n accountId : {{accountId}} \\n type : {{type}} \\n event : {{event}} \\n description : {{description}} \\n policyId : {{policyId}} \\n policyName: {{policyName}} \\n conditionName : {{conditionName}} \\n conditionId : {{conditionId}} \\n product : {{product}} \\n conditionType : {{conditionType}} \\n RunbookUrl : {{runbookUrl}} \\n nrqlQuery : {{nrqlQuery}} \\n nrqlEventType : {{nrqlEventType}} \\n targetID : {{targetId}} \\n targetName : {{targetName}} \\n commandLine : {{tag.commandLine}} \\n entityGuid : {{tag.entityGuid}} \\n entityName : {{tag.entityName}} \\n fullHostname : {{tag.fullHostname}} \\n instanceType : {{tag.instanceType}} \\n processDisplayName : {{tag.processDisplayName}}\"}) { description } } Copy For more information on NRQL conditions and using the NerdGraph API, go to NerdGraph API: NRQL condition alerts. For Infrastructure monitoring conditions, you can create the custom violation description when creating an Infrastructure monitoring alert condition. To learn about how to structure a custom violation description, see the example template and the attribute/tag instructions. Mentioning users or notifying channel in Slack When creating a description that you know will be sent to Slack, you may wish to @mention a user or generate a channel-wide notification (e.g. @here or @channel). To achieve this, simply include the User ID or a channel-wide notification in the description surrounded by < and > characters. Here's an example for mentioning a user: Attention <@LewCirne> Copy Here's an example for generating a channel-wide notification: Attention <!channel> Copy Important Note that the Slack convention for channel-wide notifications in Incoming Webhooks is to use a ! prefix instead of @ e.g. !here or !channel For more help Recommendations for learning more: To learn more about NerdGraph, see Introduction to NerdGraph.

Tip The basic setup process is the same, regardless of which product (APM, browser, etc.) uses the policy. The types of metrics and thresholds for conditions vary depending on the monitored data source. Best practices for naming policies We recommend three common patterns and practices for structuring and naming policies: Targets or resources in your architecture that have people responsible for their well being Teams that are responsible for part of the architecture Individual policies for specific users Policies organized by... Comments Architecture Targets or resources in your organization may have different people responsible for their well-being. Common segments may include the environment type (production, staging, integration, development) or the target or resource type (app server code, client-side code, databases, hosts, etc.). To make these types of policies easier to identify, you can give them names based on your architecture. For example: Product A website (production) Product B website (staging) Mobile product app (iOS) Hosts (production) Databases (production) Teams Specific teams may be responsible for parts of your architecture. For example, you may want to name their policy Team: Site engineering, Team: Website development, etc. Individuals Policies set up for specific individuals may be useful when they want to personally keep an eye on a particular resource or metric.

      "body": "For some types of conditions, you can define a custom violation description that passes useful information downstream for better violation responses or for use by other systems. You can create a custom violation description in the UI or with NRQL. Requirements The custom violation description feature is available for: NRQL alert conditions Infrastructure monitoring alert conditions The custom violation description field has a maximum character size of 4000. What is a custom violation description? For some types of conditions, you can create a custom violation description that passes information about a condition and its violations downstream. Using a description, you can: Capture the reason for the condition Define the signal being monitored Define next steps Add metadata to downstream systems The Custom violation description field allows you to use a general template structure that, when a violation is generated, substitutes the generic sections with specific values. For example, let's say you used this in a description: This is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tag.fullHostname}} Copy A violation resulting from this condition would fill in the details and you'd receive a notification like this: This is my condition name : My Great Alert Condition The hostname is : ip-123-45-67-89.us-west-1.compute.internal Copy Create a custom violation description In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, (select a policy), then (select a condition): Click + Add custom violation description to open the field. For a condition, you can create a custom violation description using this field. Custom violation description template example Here's a custom violation description template example: this is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tag.fullHostname}} Owning Team: {{tag.label.owning_team}} Product: {{tag.label.product}} ec2VpcId: {{tag.aws.ec2VpcId}} Service name : {{tag.label.Name}} AWS Region : {{tag.aws.awsRegion}} AWS Availability Zone: {{tag.aws.awsAvailabilityZone}} Department : {{tag.label.department}} Environment: {{tag.label.environment}} Cluster: {{tag.clusterName}} Cluster Role: {{tag.clusterRole}} EC2 Instance Type: {{tag.instanceType}} EC2 InstanceID: {{tag.aws.ec2InstanceId}} EC2 AmiId: {{tag.aws.ec2AmiId}} EC2 Root Device Type: {{tag.aws.ec2RootDeviceType}} Copy Here's how that data might appear in a notification: How to use attributes The attributes you can use in a custom violation description are a subset of attributes attached to the violation event. Here are some details about the available attributes and how to use them: Violation event attributes: For any of the standard attributes available for use in a custom violation description, use the format {{AN_ATTRIBUTE}}. For example: The target name is : {{targetName}} Copy Tag attributes: For tags, you would use the format {{tag.TAG_NAME}}. There are two types of tags: Entity-related tags: For Infrastructure conditions only. You can find available entity-related tags by going to the New Relic Explorer and looking under a service's Metadata and tags, or by viewing violation details. Here's an example of using tags in a custom violation description: The AWS region is : {{tag.aws.awsRegion}} Responsible team : {{tag.label.owning_team}} Copy Facet clause tags: For NRQL conditions only. If a NRQL condition uses a FACET clause, you can use tag formatting to use those values in your custom violation description. For example, if the NRQL query included FACET hostName, cluster, you could then use this: The host is : {{tag.hostName}} The cluster is : {{tag.cluster}} Copy Please note that tag names cannot include a whitespace. The expanded values can include a whitespace, but not the names of the tags themselves. Create a custom violation description with NRQL You can create a custom violation description using a NRQL alert condition by creating a mutation with a description. Here's an empty mutation template: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: \"YOUR_CONDITION_ID\", condition: {description: \"\"}) { YOUR_CUSTOM_VIOLATION_DESCRIPTION } } Copy Here's an example mutation with a custom violation description: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: 123456, id: \"123456\", condition: {description: \"timestamp : {{timestamp}} \\n accountId : {{accountId}} \\n type : {{type}} \\n event : {{event}} \\n description : {{description}} \\n policyId : {{policyId}} \\n policyName: {{policyName}} \\n conditionName : {{conditionName}} \\n conditionId : {{conditionId}} \\n product : {{product}} \\n conditionType : {{conditionType}} \\n RunbookUrl : {{runbookUrl}} \\n nrqlQuery : {{nrqlQuery}} \\n nrqlEventType : {{nrqlEventType}} \\n targetID : {{targetId}} \\n targetName : {{targetName}} \\n commandLine : {{tag.commandLine}} \\n entityGuid : {{tag.entityGuid}} \\n entityName : {{tag.entityName}} \\n fullHostname : {{tag.fullHostname}} \\n instanceType : {{tag.instanceType}} \\n processDisplayName : {{tag.processDisplayName}}\"}) { description } } Copy For more information on NRQL conditions and using the NerdGraph API, go to NerdGraph API: NRQL condition alerts. For Infrastructure monitoring conditions, you can create the custom violation description when creating an Infrastructure monitoring alert condition. To learn about how to structure a custom violation description, see the example template and the attribute/tag instructions. Mentioning users or notifying channel in Slack When creating a description that you know will be sent to Slack, you may wish to @mention a user or generate a channel-wide notification (e.g. @here or @channel). To achieve this, simply include the User ID or a channel-wide notification in the description surrounded by < and > characters. Here's an example for mentioning a user: Attention <@LewCirne> Copy Here's an example for generating a channel-wide notification: Attention <!channel> Copy Important Note that the Slack convention for channel-wide notifications in Incoming Webhooks is to use a ! prefix instead of @ e.g. !here or !channel For more help Recommendations for learning more: To learn more about NerdGraph, see Introduction to NerdGraph. See the alerts landing page. Browse New Relic's Explorers Hub for community discussions about Alerts. Find additional help or file a support ticket.

      "body": "For some types of conditions, you can define a custom violation description that passes useful information downstream for better violation responses or for use by other systems. You can create a custom violation description in the UI or with NRQL. Requirements The custom violation description feature is available for: NRQL alert conditions Infrastructure monitoring alert conditions The custom violation description field has a maximum character size of 4000. What is a custom violation description? For some types of conditions, you can create a custom violation description that passes information about a condition and its violations downstream. Using a description, you can: Capture the reason for the condition Define the signal being monitored Define next steps Add metadata to downstream systems The Custom violation description field allows you to use a general template structure that, when a violation is generated, substitutes the generic sections with specific values. For example, let's say you used this in a description: This is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tag.fullHostname}} Copy A violation resulting from this condition would fill in the details and you'd receive a notification like this: This is my condition name : My Great Alert Condition The hostname is : ip-123-45-67-89.us-west-1.compute.internal Copy Create a custom violation description In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, (select a policy), then (select a condition): Click + Add custom violation description to open the field. For a condition, you can create a custom violation description using this field. Custom violation description template example Here's a custom violation description template example: this is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tag.fullHostname}} Owning Team: {{tag.label.owning_team}} Product: {{tag.label.product}} ec2VpcId: {{tag.aws.ec2VpcId}} Service name : {{tag.label.Name}} AWS Region : {{tag.aws.awsRegion}} AWS Availability Zone: {{tag.aws.awsAvailabilityZone}} Department : {{tag.label.department}} Environment: {{tag.label.environment}} Cluster: {{tag.clusterName}} Cluster Role: {{tag.clusterRole}} EC2 Instance Type: {{tag.instanceType}} EC2 InstanceID: {{tag.aws.ec2InstanceId}} EC2 AmiId: {{tag.aws.ec2AmiId}} EC2 Root Device Type: {{tag.aws.ec2RootDeviceType}} Copy Here's how that data might appear in a notification: How to use attributes The attributes you can use in a custom violation description are a subset of attributes attached to the violation event. Here are some details about the available attributes and how to use them: Violation event attributes: For any of the standard attributes available for use in a custom violation description, use the format {{AN_ATTRIBUTE}}. For example: The target name is : {{targetName}} Copy Tag attributes: For tags, you would use the format {{tag.TAG_NAME}}. There are two types of tags: Entity-related tags: For Infrastructure conditions only. You can find available entity-related tags by going to the New Relic Explorer and looking under a service's Metadata and tags, or by viewing violation details. Here's an example of using tags in a custom violation description: The AWS region is : {{tag.aws.awsRegion}} Responsible team : {{tag.label.owning_team}} Copy Facet clause tags: For NRQL conditions only. If a NRQL condition uses a FACET clause, you can use tag formatting to use those values in your custom violation description. For example, if the NRQL query included FACET hostName, cluster, you could then use this: The host is : {{tag.hostName}} The cluster is : {{tag.cluster}} Copy Please note that tag names cannot include a whitespace. The expanded values can include a whitespace, but not the names of the tags themselves. Create a custom violation description with NRQL You can create a custom violation description using a NRQL alert condition by creating a mutation with a description. Here's an empty mutation template: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: \"YOUR_CONDITION_ID\", condition: {description: \"\"}) { YOUR_CUSTOM_VIOLATION_DESCRIPTION } } Copy Here's an example mutation with a custom violation description: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: 123456, id: \"123456\", condition: {description: \"timestamp : {{timestamp}} \\n accountId : {{accountId}} \\n type : {{type}} \\n event : {{event}} \\n description : {{description}} \\n policyId : {{policyId}} \\n policyName: {{policyName}} \\n conditionName : {{conditionName}} \\n conditionId : {{conditionId}} \\n product : {{product}} \\n conditionType : {{conditionType}} \\n RunbookUrl : {{runbookUrl}} \\n nrqlQuery : {{nrqlQuery}} \\n nrqlEventType : {{nrqlEventType}} \\n targetID : {{targetId}} \\n targetName : {{targetName}} \\n commandLine : {{tag.commandLine}} \\n entityGuid : {{tag.entityGuid}} \\n entityName : {{tag.entityName}} \\n fullHostname : {{tag.fullHostname}} \\n instanceType : {{tag.instanceType}} \\n processDisplayName : {{tag.processDisplayName}}\"}) { description } } Copy For more information on NRQL conditions and using the NerdGraph API, go to NerdGraph API: NRQL condition alerts. For Infrastructure monitoring conditions, you can create the custom violation description when creating an Infrastructure monitoring alert condition. To learn about how to structure a custom violation description, see the example template and the attribute/tag instructions. Mentioning users or notifying channel in Slack When creating a description that you know will be sent to Slack, you may wish to @mention a user or generate a channel-wide notification (e.g. @here or @channel).

Here's an example for mentioning a user: Attention <@LewCirne> Copy Here's an example for generating a channel-wide notification: Attention <!channel> Copy Important Note that the Slack convention for channel-wide notifications in Incoming Webhooks is to use a ! prefix instead of @ e.g. !here or !channel For more help Recommendations for learning more: To learn more about NerdGraph, see Introduction to NerdGraph.

      "body": "For some types of conditions, you can define a custom violation description that passes useful information downstream for better violation responses or for use by other systems. You can create a custom violation description in the UI or with NRQL. Requirements The custom violation description feature is available for: NRQL alert conditions Infrastructure monitoring alert conditions The custom violation description field has a maximum character size of 4000. What is a custom violation description? For some types of conditions, you can create a custom violation description that passes information about a condition and its violations downstream. Using a description, you can: Capture the reason for the condition Define the signal being monitored Define next steps Add metadata to downstream systems The Custom violation description field allows you to use a general template structure that, when a violation is generated, substitutes the generic sections with specific values. For example, let's say you used this in a description: This is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tag.fullHostname}} Copy A violation resulting from this condition would fill in the details and you'd receive a notification like this: This is my condition name : My Great Alert Condition The hostname is : ip-123-45-67-89.us-west-1.compute.internal Copy Create a custom violation description In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, (select a policy), then (select a condition): Click + Add custom violation description to open the field. For a condition, you can create a custom violation description using this field. Custom violation description template example Here's a custom violation description template example: this is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tag.fullHostname}} Owning Team: {{tag.label.owning_team}} Product: {{tag.label.product}} ec2VpcId: {{tag.aws.ec2VpcId}} Service name : {{tag.label.Name}} AWS Region : {{tag.aws.awsRegion}} AWS Availability Zone: {{tag.aws.awsAvailabilityZone}} Department : {{tag.label.department}} Environment: {{tag.label.environment}} Cluster: {{tag.clusterName}} Cluster Role: {{tag.clusterRole}} EC2 Instance Type: {{tag.instanceType}} EC2 InstanceID: {{tag.aws.ec2InstanceId}} EC2 AmiId: {{tag.aws.ec2AmiId}} EC2 Root Device Type: {{tag.aws.ec2RootDeviceType}} Copy Here's how that data might appear in a notification: How to use attributes The attributes you can use in a custom violation description are a subset of attributes attached to the violation event. Here are some details about the available attributes and how to use them: Violation event attributes: For any of the standard attributes available for use in a custom violation description, use the format {{AN_ATTRIBUTE}}. For example: The target name is : {{targetName}} Copy Tag attributes: For tags, you would use the format {{tag.TAG_NAME}}. There are two types of tags: Entity-related tags: For Infrastructure conditions only. You can find available entity-related tags by going to the New Relic Explorer and looking under a service's Metadata and tags, or by viewing violation details. Here's an example of using tags in a custom violation description: The AWS region is : {{tag.aws.awsRegion}} Responsible team : {{tag.label.owning_team}} Copy Facet clause tags: For NRQL conditions only. If a NRQL condition uses a FACET clause, you can use tag formatting to use those values in your custom violation description. For example, if the NRQL query included FACET hostName, cluster, you could then use this: The host is : {{tag.hostName}} The cluster is : {{tag.cluster}} Copy Please note that tag names cannot include a whitespace. The expanded values can include a whitespace, but not the names of the tags themselves. Create a custom violation description with NRQL You can create a custom violation description using a NRQL alert condition by creating a mutation with a description. Here's an empty mutation template: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: \"YOUR_CONDITION_ID\", condition: {description: \"\"}) { YOUR_CUSTOM_VIOLATION_DESCRIPTION } } Copy Here's an example mutation with a custom violation description: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: 123456, id: \"123456\", condition: {description: \"timestamp : {{timestamp}} \\n accountId : {{accountId}} \\n type : {{type}} \\n event : {{event}} \\n description : {{description}} \\n policyId : {{policyId}} \\n policyName: {{policyName}} \\n conditionName : {{conditionName}} \\n conditionId : {{conditionId}} \\n product : {{product}} \\n conditionType : {{conditionType}} \\n RunbookUrl : {{runbookUrl}} \\n nrqlQuery : {{nrqlQuery}} \\n nrqlEventType : {{nrqlEventType}} \\n targetID : {{targetId}} \\n targetName : {{targetName}} \\n commandLine : {{tag.commandLine}} \\n entityGuid : {{tag.entityGuid}} \\n entityName : {{tag.entityName}} \\n fullHostname : {{tag.fullHostname}} \\n instanceType : {{tag.instanceType}} \\n processDisplayName : {{tag.processDisplayName}}\"}) { description } } Copy For more information on NRQL conditions and using the NerdGraph API, go to NerdGraph API: NRQL condition alerts. For Infrastructure monitoring conditions, you can create the custom violation description when creating an Infrastructure monitoring alert condition. To learn about how to structure a custom violation description, see the example template and the attribute/tag instructions. Mentioning users or notifying channel in Slack When creating a description that you know will be sent to Slack, you may wish to @mention a user or generate a channel-wide notification (e.g. @here or @channel). To achieve this, simply include the User ID or a channel-wide notification in the description surrounded by < and > characters. Here's an example for mentioning a user: Attention <@LewCirne> Copy Here's an example for generating a channel-wide notification: Attention <!channel> Copy Important Note that the Slack convention for channel-wide notifications in Incoming Webhooks is to use a ! prefix instead of @ e.g. !here or !channel For more help Recommendations for learning more: To learn more about NerdGraph, see Introduction to NerdGraph.
