Microsoft Azure users: See the Azure troubleshooting solutions. No browser data appears: See the troubleshooting tips when using the browser agent. Basic solutions To troubleshoot the most common reasons for missing data, try these solutions as applicable. Basic solutions Comments Check app and framework for compatibility with agent .NET Framework compatibility and requirements or .NET Core compatibility and requirements Configure for short-lived .NET process If you have a short-lived (below 60 seconds) process, it may not report data. For more information, see Monitor short-lived processes. .NET Core: Check Kestrel requirements. Make sure you are using a Kestrel app/web server supported by New Relic. Otherwise, you may need to ensure your .NET agent has .NET Framework support enabled. .NET Core: Check environment variables. Make sure you have configured all the required environment variables, then restart the agent. .NET Framework: Restart IIS. If your app is not receiving traffic, no data will be reported to New Relic. To restart IIS: From a command line, run IISRESET. Verify that traffic is being sent to your application. Run New Relic Diagnostics. To try to automatically identify the issue, use New Relic Diagnostics. Check for profiler conflicts. If you are using Microsoft's System Center Operations Manager (SCOM), follow the troubleshooting procedures to resolve .NET and SCOM conflicts. Review log files. If log files exist, open them and review for errors. Advanced solutions To remedy more complex issues when no data appears, try these solutions as applicable: Advanced solutions Comments .NET Framework: Check Registry permissions. Check for a registry key permissions error. .NET Framework: Run Windows Event Viewer. If applicable: Run the Windows Event Viewer, and look for application events from the New Relic .NET Profiler. Search for messages whose source is the New Relic .NET Profiler or New Relic .NET agent. If there are no New Relic event messages, look for messages from the .NET Runtime. For more information, see No data or event log: CoCreate errors. Get debug logs. If your logs did not show errors, increase the logging level temporarily to collect debug logs. Check proxy settings. Ensure your proxy settings are correct and that your settings include a host attribute. Get additional help. If data still does not appear, get support at support.newrelic.com.",

Basic solutions To troubleshoot the most common reasons for missing data, try these solutions as applicable. Basic solutions Comments Check app and framework for compatibility with agent .NET Framework compatibility and requirements or .NET Core compatibility and requirements Configure for short-lived .NET process If you have a short-lived (below 60 seconds) process, it may not report data. For more information, see Monitor short-lived processes. .NET Core: Check Kestrel requirements. Make sure you are using a Kestrel app/web server supported by New Relic. Otherwise, you may need to ensure your .NET agent has .NET Framework support enabled. .NET Core: Check environment variables. Make sure you have configured all the required environment variables, then restart the agent. .NET Framework: Restart IIS. If your app is not receiving traffic, no data will be reported to New Relic. To restart IIS: From a command line, run IISRESET. Verify that traffic is being sent to your application. Run New Relic Diagnostics. To try to automatically identify the issue, use New Relic Diagnostics. Check for profiler conflicts. If you are using Microsoft's System Center Operations Manager (SCOM), follow the troubleshooting procedures to resolve .NET and SCOM conflicts. Review log files. If log files exist, open them and review for errors. Advanced solutions To remedy more complex issues when no data appears, try these solutions as applicable: Advanced solutions Comments .NET Framework: Check Registry permissions. Check for a registry key permissions error. .NET Framework: Run Windows Event Viewer. If applicable: Run the Windows Event Viewer, and look for application events from the New Relic .NET Profiler. Search for messages whose source is the New Relic .NET Profiler or New Relic .NET agent. If there are no New Relic event messages, look for messages from the .NET Runtime. For more information, see No data or event log: CoCreate errors. Get debug logs. If your logs did not show errors, increase the logging level temporarily to collect debug logs. Check proxy settings.

Microsoft Azure users: See the Azure troubleshooting solutions. No browser data appears: See the troubleshooting tips when using the browser agent. Basic solutions To troubleshoot the most common reasons for missing data, try these solutions as applicable. Basic solutions Comments Check app and framework for compatibility with agent .NET Framework compatibility and requirements or .NET Core compatibility and requirements Configure for short-lived .NET process If you have a short-lived (below 60 seconds) process, it may not report data. For more information, see Monitor short-lived processes. .NET Core: Check Kestrel requirements. Make sure you are using a Kestrel app/web server supported by New Relic. Otherwise, you may need to ensure your .NET agent has .NET Framework support enabled. .NET Core: Check environment variables. Make sure you have configured all the required environment variables, then restart the agent. .NET Framework: Restart IIS. If your app is not receiving traffic, no data will be reported to New Relic. To restart IIS: From a command line, run IISRESET. Verify that traffic is being sent to your application. Run New Relic Diagnostics. To try to automatically identify the issue, use New Relic Diagnostics. Check for profiler conflicts. If you are using Microsoft's System Center Operations Manager (SCOM), follow the troubleshooting procedures to resolve .NET and SCOM conflicts. Review log files. If log files exist, open them and review for errors. Advanced solutions To remedy more complex issues when no data appears, try these solutions as applicable: Advanced solutions Comments .NET Framework: Check Registry permissions. Check for a registry key permissions error. .NET Framework: Run Windows Event Viewer. If applicable: Run the Windows Event Viewer, and look for application events from the New Relic .NET Profiler. Search for messages whose source is the New Relic .NET Profiler or New Relic .NET agent. If there are no New Relic event messages, look for messages from the .NET Runtime. For more information, see No data or event log: CoCreate errors. Get debug logs. If your logs did not show errors, increase the logging level temporarily to collect debug logs. Check proxy settings. Ensure your proxy settings are correct and that your settings include a host attribute. Get additional help. If data still does not appear, get support at support.newrelic.com.",

Requirements Caution This API has been deprecated. Please use the AddCustomAttribute instead. Compatible with all agent versions. Must be called inside a transaction. Description Attaches a custom attribute (a key/value pair) to the current transaction. For the attribute value, you can report either a string or an IConvertible. (The call name is AddCustomParameter because \"custom attributes\" were previously called \"custom parameters.\") Custom attributes can be used to add more detail and context to errors and transaction traces that are being reported to New Relic. For example, you might add a user name attribute to a transaction to help you filter and analyze your data. You can attach up to 64 attributes per transaction.

      "body": "This document contains the configuration options for the APM .NET agent. Important As of September 2021, a small subset of APIs, configuration options, and installation options for .NET will be replaced by new methods. For more details, including how you can easily prepare for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. Configuration overview APM agent configuration options allow you to control some aspects of how the agent behaves. Some of these config options are part of the basic install process (like setting your license key and app name), but most are more advanced settings, such as: setting a log level, setting up proxy host access, excluding certain attributes, and enabling distributed tracing. The .NET agent gets its configuration from the newrelic.config file, which is generated as part of the install process. By default, only a global newrelic.config file is created, but you can also create app-local newrelic.config files for finer control over a multi-app system. Other ways to set config options include: using environment variables, or setting server-side configuration from the UI. For more on the various config options and what overrides what, see Config settings precedence. Support for both .NET Framework and .NET Core use the same configuration options and have the same APM features, unless otherwise stated. If you make changes to the config file and want to validate that it's in the right format, you can check it against the XSD file (for example, at C:\\ProgramData\\New Relic\\.NET Agent\\newrelic.xsd for Windows) with any XSD validator. Important For IIS: after you change your newrelic.config or app.config file, perform an IISRESET from an administrative command prompt. Log level adjustments do not require a reset. Configuration methods and precedence levels Upon installation, the .NET agent's configuration file (newrelic.config) applies to all monitored applications, but you can configure the agent in other ways. Here's a diagram showing how different configuration options take precedence over one another: This diagram explains the order of precedence for different ways you might configure the .NET agent. Here are details about the configuration methods shown in the diagram, and their precedence levels: .NET configuration Details and precedence web.config or app.config or appsettings.json Configuration settings set in these files take highest precedence. However, if the agent is disabled in the local or global newrelic.config, the NewRelic.AgentEnabled settings in these files will be ignored. Environment variables Second-highest precedence. For more about these, see .NET environment variables. Server-side configuration Third-highest precedence. A limited number of server-side configuration settings are available; the other settings will come from other configuration sources. App-local newrelic.config Fourth-highest precedence. You can create app-local newrelic.config files to configure individual apps on a multi-app system. These local configuration files override settings in the global newrelic.config file. The agent looks for app-local config files in the following directories, in this order: A directory specified in your web.config or app.config file with the NewRelic.ConfigFile property The web app's root directory (with the app.config or web.config) The directory containing your app's executable file Note that the app-local config file must be complete and validate against the XSD file (for example, at C:\\ProgramData\\New Relic\\.NET Agent\\newrelic.xsd for Windows). Default (global) newrelic.config Default source and the lowest precedence. Will configure all applications on a host in the absence of other config files. The global config file is located in the New Relic agent home directory: %PROGRAMDATA%\\New Relic\\.NET Agent Required environment variables New Relic's .NET agent relies on environment variables to tell the .NET Common Language Runtime (CLR) to attach New Relic to your processes. Some .NET agent install procedures (like the MSI installer) will automatically set these variables for you; some procedures will require you to manually set them. Caution Security recommendation: You should consider what users can set system environment variables. You should also secure the accounts under which your applications execute to prevent user environment variables overriding system environment variables .NET Framework environment variables For .NET Framework, the following variables are required: COR_ENABLE_PROFILING=1 COR_PROFILER={71DA0A04-7777-4EC6-9643-7D28B46A8A41} NEWRELIC_INSTALL_PATH=path\\to\\agent\\directory Copy The .NET agent installer will add these to IIS or as system-wide environment variables. .NET Core environment variables For .NET Core, the following variables are required: Linux: CORECLR_ENABLE_PROFILING=1 CORECLR_PROFILER={36032161-FFC0-4B61-B559-F6C5D41BAE5A} CORECLR_NEWRELIC_HOME=path/to/agent/directory CORECLR_PROFILER_PATH=\"${CORECLR_NEWRELIC_HOME}/libNewRelicProfiler.so\" Copy Windows: CORECLR_ENABLE_PROFILING=1 CORECLR_PROFILER={36032161-FFC0-4B61-B559-F6C5D41BAE5A} NEWRELIC_INSTALL_PATH=path\\to\\agent\\directory CORECLR_NEWRELIC_HOME=path\\to\\agent\\directory Copy The .NET agent installer will add these to IIS or as system-wide environment variables. If your system has previously used monitoring services (non-New Relic), you may have a \"profiler conflict\" when trying to install and use the New Relic agent. More details: Profiler conflict explanation New Relic’s .NET agents rely on environment variables to tell the .NET Common Language Runtime (CLR) to load New Relic into your processes. The install-related environment variables are Microsoft variables, not New Relic variables. They can be used by other .NET profilers, and only one profiler can be attached to a process at a time. For this reason, if you have used previous application monitoring products, you may have profiler conflicts. For specific install instructions, see the .NET agent install documentation. Optional environment variables Some configuration options in New Relic's .NET agent can be set via environment variables as an alternative to setting them in a config file. Below is a list of environment variables recognized by the .NET agent with example values. NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=XXXXXXXX NEW_RELIC_LOG=MyApp.log NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=Descriptive Name MAX_TRANSACTION_SAMPLES_STORED=500 MAX_EVENT_SAMPLES_STORED=500 NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED=true NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ENABLED=false NEW_RELIC_LABELS=foo:bar;zip:zap NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_OBSCURING_KEY=XXXXXXXX NEW_RELIC_DISABLE_SAMPLERS=true NEWRELIC_PROFILER_LOG_DIRECTORY=path\\to\\agent\\directory (not configurable via config file) Copy Setup options, newrelic.config Use these options to setup and configure your agent via the newrelic.config file. The New Relic .NET agent supports the following categories of setup options: Configuration element Service element Obscuring key element Proxy element Log element Application element (configuration) Data transmission element Host name Configuration element The root element of the configuration document is a configuration element. <configuration xmlns=\"urn:newrelic-config\" agentEnabled=\"true\" maxStackTraceLines=\"50\" timingPrecision=\"low\"> Copy The configuration element supports the following attributes: agentEnabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the New Relic agent. maxStackTraceLines Type Integer Default 80 The maximum number of stack frames to trace in any stack dump. timingPrecision Type String Default low Controls the precision of the timers. High precision will provide better data, but at a lower execution speed. Possible values are high and low. Service element The first child of the configuration element is a service element. The service element configures the agent's connection to the New Relic service. <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" sendEnvironmentInfo=\"true\" syncStartup=\"false\" sendDataOnExit=\"false\" sendDataOnExitThreshold=\"60000\" autoStart=\"true\"/> Copy The service element supports the following attributes: licenseKey (required) Type String Default (none) Your New Relic license key. New Relic uses the license key to match your app's data to the correct account in the UI. Set the license key via environment variable. Alternatively, set the NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY environment variable in the application's environment. NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=XXXXXXXX Copy sendEnvironmentInfo Type Boolean Default true Instructs the agent to record execution environment information. Environment information includes operating system, agent version, and which assemblies are available. syncStartup Type Boolean Default false Block application startup until the agent connects to New Relic. If set to true, the first transaction may take substantially longer to complete, because it is blocked until the connection to New Relic is finished. sendDataOnExit Type Boolean Default false Block application shutdown until the agent sends all data from the latest harvest cycle. sendDataOnExitThreshold Type Integer Default 60000 Unit Milliseconds The minimum amount of time the process must run before the agent blocks it from shutting down. This setting only applies when sendDataOnExit is true. completeTransactionsOnThread Type Boolean Default false If false, the agent uses a pool thread to complete the transaction processing. If true, the agent will complete transaction processing on the request thread. requestTimeout Type Integer Default 2000 (sendDataOnExit enabled) 120000 (sendDataOnExit disabled) Unit Milliseconds The agent's request timeout when communicating with New Relic. autoStart Type Boolean Default True Automatically start the .NET agent when the first instrumented method is hit. ssl (DEPRECATED) Type Boolean Default true The option to disable SSL is valid only for .NET agent versions 7.x and earlier. .NET agent version 8.x and higher communicate only via SSL. The agent communicates with New Relic via HTTPS by default, and New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and the New Relic REST API. Obscuring key element The obscuringKey element is an optional child of the service element. The .NET Agent uses this value to deobfuscate supported configuration values. For example, when an obfuscated proxy password is supplied, it will be deobfuscated using this key. <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\"> <obscuringKey>OBSCURING_KEY</obscuringKey> </service> Copy The obscuring key may also be configured by setting the NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_OBSCURING_KEY environment variable. Caution Security recommendation: The placement of the obscuring Key in the same configuration file as an obfuscated value may pose a security risk. Consider placing the obscuring key in an environment variable and limiting access to environment variables within your environment. Proxy element The proxy element is an optional child of the service element. The proxy element is used when the agent communicates to the New Relic back-end service via a proxy. <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\"> <proxy host=\"hostname\" port=\"PROXY_PORT\" uriPath=\"path/to/something.aspx\" domain=\"mydomain.com\" user=\"PROXY_USERNAME\" password=\"PROXY_PASSWORD\" passwordObfuscated=\"OBFUSCATED_PROXY_PASSWORD\"/> </service> Copy The proxy element supports the following attributes: host Type String Default (none) Defines the proxy host. port Type Integer Default 8080 Defines the proxy port. uriPath Type String Default (none) Optionally define a proxy URI path. domain Type String Default (none) Optionally define a domain to use when authenticating with the proxy server. user Type String Default (none) Optionally define a user name for authentication. password Type String Default (none) Optionally define a password for authentication. passwordObfuscated Type String Default (none) For additional security, the .NET Agent supports the use of an obfuscated proxy password with the passwordObfuscated attribute. The obfuscated proxy password is generated using the following New Relic CLI command: newrelic agent config obfuscate --key OBSCURING_KEY --value \"CLEAR_TEXT_PROXY_PASSWORD\" Copy Important When using an obfuscated proxy password, the obscuring key must also be configured. Log element The log element is a child of the configuration element. The log element configures New Relic's logging . The agent generates its own log file to keep its logging information separate from your application's logs. <log level=\"info\" auditLog=\"false\" console=\"false\" directory=\"PATH\\TO\\LOG\\DIRECTORY\" fileName=\"FILENAME.log\" /> Copy The log element supports the following attributes: level Type String Default info Defines the level of detail recorded in the log file. Possible values, in increasing order of detail, are: off error warn info debug finest all Important Increasing the log level will increase New Relic's performance impact. auditLog Type Boolean Default false Records all data sent to and received from New Relic in both an auditlog log file and the standard log file. console Type Boolean Default false Send log messages to the console, in addition to the log file. directory Type String Default C:\\ProgramData\\New Relic\\.NET Agent\\Logs The directory to hold log files generated by the agent. If this is omitted, then a directory named logs in the New Relic agent install area will be used by default. fileName Type String Default (none) Defines a name for the log file. If you do not define a fileName, the name is derived from the name of the monitored process. Alternatively, set the NEW_RELIC_LOG environment variable in the application's environment. NEW_RELIC_LOG=MyApp.log Copy Application element (required) The application element is a child of the configuration element. This required element defines your application name, and disables or enables sampling. name Type String Default My Application The name of your .NET application is a child of the application element. New Relic will aggregate your data according to this name. For example, if you have two running applications named AppA and AppB, you will see two applications in the New Relic interface: AppA and AppB. You can also assign up to three names to your app. The first name is the primary name. For example: <application> <name>MY APPLICATION PRIMARY</name> <name>SECOND APP NAME</name> <name>THIRD APP NAME</name> </application> Copy Alternatively, set the NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME environment variable in the application's environment. NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=Descriptive Name Copy disableSamplers Type Boolean Default false Samplers collect information about memory and CPU consumption. Set this to true to disable sampling. Alternatively, set the NEW_RELIC_DISABLE_SAMPLERS environment variable in the application's environment. NEW_RELIC_DISABLE_SAMPLERS=true Copy Data transmission element The dataTransmission element is a child of the configuration element. This element affects how data is sent to New Relic and can be used if you have specific data transmission requirements. <dataTransmission putForDataSend=\"false\" compressedContentEncoding=\"deflate\"/> Copy The dataTransmission element supports the following attributes: putForDataSend Type Boolean Default false Defines the HTTP method used when sending data to New Relic. Set this to true to enable using the PUT method when sending data. The POST method is used by default. Host name If the default host name label in the APM UI is not useful, you can decorate that name in the New Relic UI with a display name. After the application process is restarted and the .NET agent is reporting again, the display name will appear in the Servers drop-down list. This host name setting does not affect the list of hosts on your application's Summary page. To set a display name, choose one of the following options. The environment variable takes precedence over the config file value. Then restart your application to see your changes in the New Relic UI. Set using config file Set the displayName attribute in the processHost element in newrelic.config. The processHost element is a child of the configuration element. <configuration . . . > <processHost displayName=\"CUSTOM_NAME\" /> </configuration> Copy Set using environment variable Set the NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME environment variable: NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME = \"CUSTOM_NAME\" Copy Cloud platform utilization Configures the utilization configuration element to control how the agent collects utilization information and sends it to the New Relic service to determine pricing. The agent can collect information from Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2 instances, Docker containers, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, Pivotal Cloud Foundry, and Kubernetes. detectAws Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent polls AWS metadata API. detectAzure Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent polls Azure metadata API. detectGcp Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent polls GCP metadata API. detectPcf Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent polls PCF information from environment variables. detectDocker Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent reads Docker information from the file system. detectKubernetes Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent polls Kubernetes information from environment variables. Instrumentation options Use these options to configure which elements of your application and environment to instrument. New Relic for .NET supports the following categories of instrumentation options: Instrumentation element Applications element (instrumentation) Attributes element Instrumentation element The instrumentation element is a child of the configuration element. By default, the .NET agent instruments IIS asp worker processes and Azure web and worker roles. To instrument other processes, see Instrumenting custom applications. Applications element (instrumentation) The applications element is a child of the instrumentation element. The applications element specifies which non-web apps to instrument. It contains a name attribute. Important This is not the same as the application (configuration) element, which is a child of the configuration element. <instrumentation> <applications> <application name=\"MyService1.exe\" /> <application name=\"MyService2.exe\" /> <application name=\"MyService3.exe\" /> </applications> </instrumentation> Copy Attributes element An attribute is a key/value pair that determines the properties of an event or transaction. Each attribute is sent to APM transaction traces, APM error traces, Transaction events, TransactionError events, or PageView events. The primary attributes element enables or disables attribute collection for the .NET agent, and defines specific attributes to collect or exclude. You can also configure attribute settings based on their destination: Error collection, transaction traces, browser instrumentation, and transaction events. In this example, the agent excludes all attributes whose key begins with myApiKey (myApiKey.bar, myApiKey.value), but collects the custom attribute myApiKey.foo. <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>myApiKey.*</exclude> <include>myApiKey.foo</include> </attributes> Copy You can view the .NET APM attributes on the .NET agent attributes page. You can also define custom attributes with the agent API call AddCustomParameter. enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable attribute collection. When set to false in the primary attribute element, this setting overrides all attribute settings for individual destinations. include Type String Default (none) If attributes are enabled, the agent will collect all attribute keys specified in this list. To specify multiple attribute keys, specify each individually. You can also use a * wildcard character at the end of a key to match multiple attributes (for example, myApiKey.*). For more information, see Attribute rules. exclude Type String Default (none) If attributes are enabled, the agent will not collect attribute keys specified in this list. To specify multiple attribute keys, specify each individually. You can also use a * wildcard character at the end of a key to match multiple attributes (for example, myApiKey.*). For more information, see Attribute rules. Feature options Use these options to enable, disable, and configure New Relic features. New Relic for .NET allows you to configure the following features: App pools Cross application traces Error collection High security mode Strip exception messages Transaction events Custom events Custom parameters Tags/labels Browser instrumentation Slow Queries Transaction traces Datastore tracer Distributed tracing Span events Capture HTTP Request Headers App pools Important This is only applicable to a system's global config file. The applicationPools element is a child of the configuration element. The applicationPools element specifies for the profiler exactly which application pools to instrument and uses the same name as the IIS application pool name. This configuration element is useful when you may need to instrument only a small subset of your app pools. For example, a given server might have several hundred application pools, but only a few of those pools need to be instrumented by the .NET agent. Here is an example of disabling instrumentation for specific application pools: <applicationPools> <applicationPool name=\"Foo\" instrument=\"false\"/> <applicationPool name=\"Bar\" instrument=\"false\"/> </applicationPools> Copy Here is an example of disabling instrumentation for all application pools currently executing on the server and enabling instrumentation for specific application pools: <applicationPools> <defaultBehavior instrument=\"false\"/> <applicationPool name=\"Foo\" instrument=\"true\"/> <applicationPool name=\"Bar\" instrument=\"true\"/> </applicationPools> Copy The applicationPools element supports the following elements: defaultBehavior Type Boolean Default false Defines how the .NET agent will behave on a \"global\" level for application pools served via IIS. The .NET agent instruments all application pools by default. When true, application pools listed under applicationPool with an instrument attribute set to false will not be instrumented. Essentially, when set to false, the application pool list acts as an allow list. When set to true, the application pool list acts as a deny list. applicationPool Defines instrumentation behavior for a specific application pool. The name attribute is the name of an application pool. Enable or disable profiling in the instrument attribute. Define this application in the name attribute. Cross application traces The crossApplicationTracer element is a child of the configuration element. crossApplicationTracer links transaction traces across applications. When linked in a service-oriented architecture, all instrumented applications that communicate with each other via HTTP will now \"link\" transaction traces with the applications that they call and the applications they are called by. Cross application tracing makes it easier to understand the performance relationship between services and applications. <crossApplicationTracer enabled=\"true\"/> Copy The crossApplicationTracer element supports the following attribute: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable cross application tracing Error collection The errorCollector element is a child of the configuration element. errorCollector configures error collection, which captures information about uncaught exceptions and sends them to New Relic. <errorCollector enabled=\"true\" captureEvents=\"true\" maxEventSamplesStored=\"100\"> <ignoreClasses> <errorClass>System.IO.FileNotFoundException</errorClass> <errorClass>System.Threading.ThreadAbortException</errorClass> </ignoreClasses> <ignoreMessages> <errorClass name=\"System.Exception\"> <message>Ignore message</message> <message>Ignore too</message> </errorClass> </ignoreMessages> <ignoreStatusCodes> <code>401</code> <code>404</code> </ignoreStatusCodes> <expectedClasses> <errorClass>System.ArgumentNullException</errorClass> <errorClass>System.ArgumentOutOfRangeException</errorClass> </expectedClasses> <expectedMessages> <errorClass name=\"System.Exception\"> <message>Expected message</message> <message>Expected too</message> </errorClass> </expectedMessages> <expectedStatusCodes>403,500-505</expectedStatusCodes> <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>myApiKey.*</exclude> <include>myApiKey.foo</include> </attributes> </errorCollector> Copy Tip For an overview of error configuration in APM, see Manage errors in APM. The errorCollector element supports the following elements and attributes: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the error collector. captureEvents Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the capturing of error events. maxEventSamplesStored Type Integer Default 100 Reservoir limit for error events. ignoreClasses A list of fully qualified class names to be ignored. The maximum number of error class and message combinations that SHOULD be reported is 50. If more than 50 are listed, then only the first 50 SHOULD be used ignoreMessages An optional map of fully qualified class names to list of strings matching a substring of the message of an error. The maximum number of error class and message combinations that SHOULD be reported is 50. If more than 50 are listed, then only the first 50 SHOULD be used ignoreErrors (DEPRECATED) Type String Default (none) Lists specific exceptions to not report to New Relic. The full name of the exception should be used, such as System.IO.FileNotFoundException. ignoreStatusCodes Type String Default (none) Lists specific HTTP error codes to not report to New Relic. You can use standard integral HTTP error codes, such as just 401, or you may use Microsoft full status codes with decimal points, such as 401.4 or 403.18. The status codes should be equal to or greater than 400. expectedClasses A list of fully qualified class names to be marked as expected. The maximum number of error class and message combinations that SHOULD be reported is 50. If more than 50 are listed, then only the first 50 SHOULD be used expectedMessages An optional map of fully qualified class names to list of strings matching a substring of the message of an error. The maximum number of error class and message combinations that SHOULD be reported is 50. If more than 50 are listed, then only the first 50 SHOULD be used expectedStatusCodes A comma separated list of status codes. The list may include integer ranges, using a single dash (-) and will be inclusive of both the starting and ending integer in the range. attributes Use this sub-element to customize your agent attribute settings for error traces. This sub-element uses the same settings as the primary attributes element: enabled, include, and exclude. High security mode The highSecurity element is a child of the configuration element. To enable high security mode, set this property to true and enable the high security property in the New Relic user interface. Enabling high security turns SSL on; request parameters, custom parameters and HTTP request headers are not collected; strip exception messages is enabled; and queries can't be sent to New Relic in their raw form. enabled Type Boolean Default false Enable or disable high security mode. Example: <highSecurity enabled=\"true\"/> Copy Strip exception messages The stripExceptionMessages element is a child of the configuration element. To enable strip exception messages, set this property to true. By default, this is set to false, which means that the agent sends messages from all exceptions to the New Relic collector. If you enable high security mode, this is automatically changed to true, and the agent strips the messages from exceptions. enabled Type Boolean Default false Enable or disable strip exception messages. Example: <stripExceptionMessages enabled=\"true\"/> Copy Transaction events The transactionEvents element is a child of the configuration element. Use transactionEvents to configure transaction events. <transactionEvents enabled=\"true\" maximumSamplesStored=\"10000\"> <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>myApiKey.*</exclude> <include>myApiKey.foo</include> </attributes> </transactionEvents> Copy The transactionEvents element supports the following attributes: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the event recorder. maximumSamplesStored Type Integer Default 10000 The maximum number of samples to store in memory at once. Alternatively, set the MAX_TRANSACTION_SAMPLES_STORED environment variable in the application's environment. MAX_TRANSACTION_SAMPLES_STORED=500 Copy attributes Use this sub-element to customize your agent attribute settings for transaction events. This sub-element uses the same settings as the primary attributes element: enabled, include, and exclude. Tip These attribute settings are specific to transaction events. Attribute settings can be applied globally to all event types to with this configuration setting. Caution When distributed tracing and/or Infinite Tracing are enabled, information from transaction events is applied to the root Span Event of the transaction. Consider applying any attribute settings for transaction events to span events and/or apply them as Global Attribute settings. Custom events The customEvents element is a child of the configuration element. Use customEvents to configure custom events. <customEvents enabled=\"true\" maximumSamplesStored=\"10000\"/> Copy The CustomEvents element supports the following attributes: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the event recorder. maximumSamplesStored Type Integer Default 10000 The maximum number of samples to store in memory at once. Alternatively, set the MAX_EVENT_SAMPLES_STORED environment variable in the application's environment. MAX_EVENT_SAMPLES_STORED=500 Copy Custom parameters The customParameters element is a child of the configuration element. Use customParameters to configure custom parameters. <customParameters enabled=\"true\" /> Copy The CustomParameters element supports the following attributes: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the capture of custom parameters. Labels (tags) The labels element is a child of the configuration element. This sets tag names and values. The list is a semicolon delimited list of colon-separated name and value pairs. You can also use with the NEW_RELIC_LABELS environment variable. Example: <labels>foo:bar;zip:zap</labels> Copy Browser instrumentation The browserMonitoring element is a child of the configuration element. browserMonitoring configures browser monitoring in your .NET application. Browser gives you insight your end users' performance experience. This is accomplished by measuring the time it takes for your users' browsers to download and render your webpages by injecting a small amount of JavaScript code into the header and footer of each page. // If you use both the Exclude and Attribute elements // the Exclude element must be listed first. <browserMonitoring autoInstrument=\"true\"> <requestPathsExcluded> <path regex=\"url-regex-1\"/> <path regex=\"url-regex-2\"/> ... <path regex=\"url-regex-n\"/> </requestPathsExcluded> <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>myApiKey.*</exclude> <include>myApiKey.foo</include> </attributes> </browserMonitoring> Copy The browserMonitoring element supports the following attributes: autoInstrument Type Boolean Default true By default the agent automatically injects the browser agent JavaScript. To turn off automatic injection, set this attribute to false. attributes Use this sub-element to customize your agent attribute settings for browser monitoring. This sub-element uses the same settings as the primary attributes element: enabled, include, and exclude. requestPathsExcluded Use this sub-element to prevent the browser agent from being injected in specific pages. The element is used as follows: <requestPathsExcluded> <path regex=\"url-regex-1\"/> <path regex=\"url-regex-2\"/> ... <path regex=\"url-regex-n\"/> </requestPathsExcluded> Copy The agent will not inject the browser agent into pages whose URL matches one of the specified regular expressions. The regular expression should follow Microsoft guidelines for the Regex class. It is a reference to the virtual directory of the path in your application and not the full URL of the path you wish to exclude. For example, to exclude the pages in https://www.mywebsite.com/mywebpages/ you would simply insert /mywebpages/ as the path regex value. The requestPathsExcluded element should be used in cases where it is impossible or undesirable to use the DisableBrowserMonitoring() call. To minimize a possible performance impact try to use as few regular expressions as possible and keep them as simple as possible. Slow queries The slowSql element is a child of the configuration element. slowSql configures capturing information about slow query executions, and captures and obfuscates explain plans for these queries. <slowSql enabled=\"true\"/> Copy The slowSql element supports the following attribute: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable slow query tracing. Transaction traces The transactionTracer element is a child of the configuration element. transactionTracer configures transaction traces. Included in the trace is the exact call sequence of the transactions, including any query statements issued. <transactionTracer enabled=\"true\" transactionThreshold=\"apdex_f\" recordSql=\"obfuscated\" explainEnabled=\"true\" explainThreshold=\"500\" maxSegments=\"3000\" maxExplainPlans=\"20\"> <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>myApiKey.*</exclude> <include>myApiKey.foo</include> </attributes> </transactionTracer> Copy The transactionTracer element supports the following attributes: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable transaction traces. transactionThreshold Type String Default apdex_f Defines the threshold for transaction traces. If a transaction takes longer than the threshold, it is eligible for being traced. See transaction trace basics for more about the rules governing traces. The default value is apdex_f, which sets the threshold to four times the application's apdex_t value. For more information about apdex_t, see Apdex. You can also set the threshold to be a specific time value in milliseconds. recordSql Type String Default obfuscated Select a query tracing policy. Options are off, which records nothing; obfuscated, which records an obfuscated version of the query; or raw, which records the query exactly as it is issued to the database. Caution Recording raw queries may capture sensitive information. explainEnabled Type Boolean Default false When true, the agent captures EXPLAIN statements for slow queries. explainThreshold Type Integer Default 500 Unit Milliseconds The agent collects slow query data for queries that exceed this threshold, along with any available explain plans, as part of transaction traces. maxSegments Type Integer Default 3000 The maximum number of segments to collect in a transaction trace. maxExplainPlans Type Integer Default 20 The maximum number of explain plans to collect during a harvest cycle. attributes Use this sub-element to customize your agent attribute settings for transaction traces. This sub-element uses the same settings as the primary attributes element: enabled, include, and exclude. Datastore tracer The datastoreTracer element is a child of the configuration element. <datastoreTracer> <instanceReporting enabled=\"true\" /> <databaseNameReporting enabled=\"true\" /> <queryParameters enabled=\"false\" /> </datastoreTracer> Copy The datastoreTracer element supports the following sub-elements: instanceReporting Use this sub-element to enable collection of datastore instance metrics (such as the host and port) for some database drivers. These are reported on slow query traces and transaction traces. The default value of attribute enabled is true. databaseNameReporting Use this sub-element to enable collection of the database name on slow query traces and transaction traces for some database drivers. The default value of attribute enabled is true. queryParameters Use this sub-element to enable collection of the SQL query parameters on slow query traces. The default value of attribute enabled is false. Caution Recording query parameters may capture sensitive information. The transactionTracer.recordSql configuration option must be set to raw or this option is ignored. Distributed tracing The distributedTracing element is a child of the configuration element. <distributedTracing enabled=\"false\" excludeNewrelicHeader=\"false\"/> Copy Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. Enabling distributed tracing disables cross application tracing, and has other effects on APM features. Before enabling, read the planning guide. Important Requires .NET agent version 8.6.45.0 or higher. The distributedTracing element supports the following attributes: To enable or disable, see Enable distributed tracing. enabled Type Boolean Default false Alternatively, enable distributed tracing via the NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED environment variable in the application's environment. NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED=true Copy excludeNewrelicHeader Type Boolean Default false By default, supported versions of the agent utilize both the newrelic header and W3C Trace Context headers for distributed tracing. The newrelic distributed tracing header allows interoperability with older agents that don't support W3C Trace Context headers. Agent versions that support W3C Trace Context headers will prioritize them over newrelic headers for distributed tracing. If you do not want to utilize the newrelic header, setting this to true will result in the agent excluding the newrelic header and only using W3C Trace Context headers for distributed tracing. Distributed tracing reports span events. Span event reporting is enabled by default, but distributed tracing must be enabled for spans to be reported. To disable span events, choose one of the following options: Disable span events via config file Set the <spanEvents> element to false to disable via the newrelic.config file. This element is a child of the <configuration> element. <configuration . . . > <spanEvents enabled=\"false\" /> </configuration> Copy Disable span events via environment variable Set the NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ENABLED environment variable in the application's environment. NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ENABLED=false Copy Infinite Tracing Infinite Tracing extends the distributed tracing service by employing a trace observer that is external to the agent. It observes 100% of your application traces across various services and provides actionable data so you can solve issues faster. Important Infinite Tracing requires .NET Agent version 8.30 or higher. To turn on Infinite Tracing, enable distributed tracing and add the additional settings below <configuration . . . > <distributedTracing enabled=\"true\" /> <infiniteTracing> <trace_observer host=\"YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST\" /> </infiniteTracing> </configuration> Copy The infiniteTracing element supports the following elements: trace_observer The trace_observer element identifies an observer host that is independent from the agent. For help getting a valid Infinite Tracing trace observer host entry, see Find or create a trace observer endpoint. The trace observer may be configured using the NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST environment variable as well. Important When configuring the trace observer, you should not supply the protocol as part of the host. For example, use myhost.infinitetracing.com instead of https://myhost.infinitetracing.com. Span events The spanEvents element is a child of the configuration element. Use spanEvents to configure span events. <spanEvents enabled=\"true\"> <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>myApiKey.*</exclude> <include>myApiKey.foo</include> </attributes> </spanEvents> Copy The spanEvents element supports the following attributes: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the event recorder. attributes Use this sub-element to customize your agent attribute settings for span events. This sub-element uses the same settings as the primary attributes element: enabled, include, and exclude. Tip These attribute settings are specific to span events. Attribute settings may be applied globally to all event types to with this configuration setting. Capture HTTP Request Headers The allowAllHeaders element is a child of the configuration element. Set this to true to allow the .NET Agent to capture all HTTP request headers as request.headers.{http-header-name} attributes. Set this to false to only allow the .NET agent to collect the following HTTP request headers: request.headers.referer request.headers.accept request.headers.content-length request.headers.host request.headers.user-agent Copy enabled Type Boolean Default false Enable or disable HTTP request headers capture. Example: <allowAllHeaders enabled=\"true\" /> <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <include>request.headers.*</include> </attributes> Copy Important The allowAllHeaders setting is only available in the .NET Agent version 8.40.0+. When using allowAllHeaders to capture attributes, the captured request header attributes are still being controlled by the root level and destination level attributes settings. Without setting the request.header.* in the include list under the attributes element (see the following), the .NET Agent still filters out all header attributes. The default newrelic.config is set to include the request.header.*. <allowAllHeaders enabled=\"true\" /> <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <include>request.headers.*</include> ... </attributes> Copy The default newrelic.config is also set to explicitly exclude the following HTTP request headers to prevent the .NET Agent collecting unwanted data. <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>request.headers.cookie</exclude> <exclude>request.headers.authorization</exclude> <exclude>request.headers.proxy-authorization</exclude> <exclude>request.headers.x-*</exclude> </attributes> Copy Settings in app.config or web.config For ASP.NET and .NET Framework console apps you can also configure the following settings in your app's app.config or web.config, within the outermost element, <configuration>: Enable and disable the agent <appSettings> <add key = \"NewRelic.AgentEnabled\" value=\"false\" /> </appSettings> Copy Important If the agent is disabled in the local or global newrelic.config, the NewRelic.AgentEnabled settings in these files will be ignored. Application name For more information, see Name your .NET application. <appSettings> <add key = \"NewRelic.AppName\" value =\"Descriptive Name\" /> </appSettings> Copy License key <appSettings> <add key = \"NewRelic.LicenseKey\" value =\"XXXXXXXX\" /> </appSettings> Copy Change newrelic.config location Designates an alternative location for the config file outside of the local root of the app or global config location. The location entered must be an absolute path. <appSettings> <add key = \"NewRelic.ConfigFile\" value=\"C:\\Path-to-alternate-config-dir\\newrelic.config\" /> </appSettings> Copy Settings in appsettings.json For .NET Core apps, you can configure the following settings in appsettings.json if the following is true: The appsettings.json file must be located in the current working directory of the application. The application must have the following dependencies: Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.Json Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.EnvironmentVariables Enable and disable the agent { \"NewRelic.AgentEnabled\":\"false\" } Copy Important If the agent is disabled in the local or global newrelic.config, the NewRelic.AgentEnabled setting in this file will be ignored. Application name For more information, see Name your .NET application. { \"NewRelic.AppName\": \"Descriptive Name\" } Copy License key { \"NewRelic.LicenseKey\": \"XXXXXXXX\" } Copy Change newrelic.config location Designates an alternative location for the config file outside of the local root of the app or global config location.

The agent's support for .NET Core takes advantage of the compatibility, speed, expanded API features, and cross-platform capabilities of Microsoft's .NET Core. The agent does not support Microsoft .NET Core versions earlier than 2.0. With New Relic's support for .NET, you can monitor your apps in dynamic or distributed environments, such as: Cloud-managed server VM images On-host VM servers Microsoft Azure App Services Self-hosted Windows and Linux systems Amazon AWS EC2 VMs Install the agent on Windows with our guided install Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the .NET agent for Windows IIS applications. Ready to get started? Click the Guided install button. If your account reports data through our EU datacenter, click EU Guided install. Guided install EU Guided install In addition to the .NET agent, you can use this to install our infrastructure agent to discover other applications, infrastructure, and log sources running in your environment and recommend which ones should be instrumented. The install automates the configuration and deployment of each system you choose to instrument. Install the agent Before you install the .NET agent, create your New Relic account. Then, review the requirements for .NET Framework or the requirements for .NET Core. When you are ready to install, use our launcher, or see the install instructions appropriate for your operating system: Windows or Linux. Add .NET data Tip To stay up-to-date with new features and bug fixes, see the .NET agent release notes. After you install the agent and wait a few minutes for your app to generate traffic, data will appear in the APM Summary page. If no data appears, or if you encounter other problems, see New Relic's .NET agent troubleshooting procedures. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Summary: After installing the .NET agent, you will see a summary of your app's performance on the Summary page. Configure the agent The most important part of agent configuration is to give your app a descriptive name. New Relic uses this app name to aggregate metrics when you have multiple apps or hosts. The agent also includes a variety of configuration options to further customize your installation. Extend your instrumentation After installing the .NET agent, extend the agent's instrumentation with one or more of these methods: Instrumentation options Details Browser instrumentation Integrate the .NET agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user activity. ASP.NET apps (.NET Framework only): Use any of the available options to install the browser agent. ASP.NET Core apps (targeting .NET Core or .NET Framework): Use either the API method or the copy/paste method to inject the browser agent into your webpages. Custom instrumentation Instrument transactions not captured as part of New Relic's automatic framework instrumentation. Agent API See the .NET agent API guide to learn how to customize the agent's behavior. For example, you can collect custom metrics, flag an error, or ignore a particular transaction entirely. Custom attributes Customize the attributes attached to transactions. Customizing attributes allows you to avoid sending sensitive attributes, or to collect additional attributes for deeper visibility into your transactions. Distributed tracing Enable distributed tracing to understand activity across a complex, distributed system that uses many services and microservices. Open source telemetry Explore these tools: OpenTelemetry exporter and .NET Telemetry SDK. Check the source code The .NET agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "New Relic's .NET agent includes an API that allows you to extend the agent's standard functionality. For example, you can use the .NET agent API for: Customizing your app name Creating custom transaction parameters Reporting custom errors and metrics You can also customize some of the .NET agent's default behavior by adjusting configuration settings or using custom instrumentation. Requirements Important As of September 2021, a small subset of APIs, configuration options, and installation options for .NET will be replaced by new methods. For more details, including how you can easily prepare for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. To use the .NET agent API: Make sure you have the latest .NET agent release. Add a reference to the agent in your project: Add a reference to NewRelic.Api.Agent.dll to your project. OR View and download the API package from the NuGet Package Library. Instrument missing sections of your code with transactions To instrument your app, New Relic separates each path through your code into its own transaction. New Relic times (or \"instruments\") the parent method in these transactions to measure your app's overall performance, and collects transaction traces from long-running transactions for additional detail. Use these methods when New Relic is not instrumenting a particular part of your code at all: If you want to... Do this... Prevent a transaction from reporting to New Relic Use IgnoreTransaction() or an XML file to ignore the transaction. Create a transaction where none exists Use attributes or an XML file to create a new transaction. Time specific methods using segments If a transaction is already visible in the New Relic UI, but you don't have enough data about a particular method that was called during that transaction, you can create segments to time those individual methods in greater detail. For example, you might want to time a particularly critical method with complex logic. When you want to instrument a method within an existing transaction, see Custom instrumentation via attributes or Add detail to transactions via XML. Enhance the metadata of a transaction Sometimes the code you are targeting is visible in the New Relic UI, but some details of the method are not useful. For example: The default name might not be helpful. (Perhaps it is causing a metric grouping issue.) You want to add custom attributes to your transactions so you can filter them in dashboards. Use these methods when you want to change how New Relic instruments a transaction that's already visible in the New Relic UI: If you want to... Do this... Change the name of a transaction Use SetTransactionName() or an XML file. Prevent a transaction from affecting your Apdex score Use IgnoreApdex(). Add metadata (such as your customer's account name or subscription level) to your transactions Use custom attributes. See AddCustomAttribute(). Instrument asynchronous work For supported frameworks, the .NET agent usually detects async work and instruments it correctly. However, if your app uses another framework, or the default async instrumentation is inaccurate, you can explicitly connect async work. If you want to... Do this... Trace an async method that New Relic is already instrumenting Use an XML file to instrument async methods in IIS apps. Also see the New Relic's troubleshooting tips for missing async metrics. Trace an async method that New Relic is not instrumenting Use an XML file to instrument async methods in IIS apps. Also see the New Relic's troubleshooting tips for missing async metrics. View calls to external services For .NET agent version 8.9 or higher, you can use the following distributed tracing payload APIs to manually pass distributed tracing context between New Relic-monitored services that don't automatically connect to one another in a distributed trace. If you want to... Do this... Instrument an outgoing request to an external application or database Create a distributed trace payload to attach to an outgoing request using CreateDistributedTracePayload(). Connect incoming requests with the originator of the request to complete a span of the trace Receive a payload on an incoming request using AcceptDistributedTracePayload(). For .NET agent versions lower than 8.9, use cross application tracing. Collect or ignore errors Usually the .NET agent detects errors automatically. However, you can manually mark an error with the agent. You can also ignore errors . If you want to... Do this... Report an error the .NET agent does not report automatically Use NoticeError(). Capture errors or prevent the .NET agent from reporting an error at all Use your .NET agent configuration file. Send custom event and metric data from your app APM includes a number of ways to record arbitrary custom data. For an explanation of New Relic data types, see Data collection. If you want to... Do this... Send data about an event so you can analyze it in dashboards Create a custom event. See RecordCustomEvent(). Tag your events with metadata to filter and facet them in dashboards or error analytics Add custom attributes. See .NET agent attributes and Enable and disable attributes. Report custom performance data Use RecordMetric() to create a custom metric. To view the data, use the query builder. Control the browser monitoring agent Usually the browser agent is added automatically to your pages or deployed by copy/pasting the JavaScript snippet. For more information about these recommended methods, see Add apps to browser monitoring. However, you can also control the browser agent via APM agent API calls. For more information, see Browser monitoring and the .NET agent.",

      "body": "For your New Relic-monitored Java application, one custom instrumentation method is to use an XML file that lists the methods and classes you want to instrument. This documentation shows an example XML instrumentation file. For more information, see Java instrumentation by XML. Edit XML file in UI To edit your XML file directly from the New Relic UI: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Settings > Instrumentation. From here you can: Download a sample XML file. Select an edit existing XML file. Search the instrumentation history. XML file format The XML file format includes root and child nodes. Caution Do not instrument all of your methods, as this can lead to a metric grouping issue. Root node: extension The root node of an XML file is extension. It can have three different attributes: Value Definition name A unique but descriptive name identifying your XML extension. enabled Identifies whether the extension will be read by the Java agent. Default is true. If false, New Relic will ignore the extension. version The version of the extension. If two extensions have the same name, only the extension with the highest version will be used. Instrumentation (child of extension) The instrumentation node is a child of extension. It can have one attribute: metricPrefix. This is the prefix used for the metric names when the nameTransaction node is not specified. Default is CUSTOM. Pointcut (child of instrumentation) The pointcut is a child node of instrumentation and can have several attributes. Also, a pointcut can have several different child nodes. Value Definition transactionStartPoint If a transaction is not already in progress when this pointcut is reached, then a transaction will be started. If a transaction is already in progress, then that transaction will continue. A new transaction will not be created. metricNameFormat The name format to use for a metric. If not present, then this will default to the class name followed by the method name. You can only set the metricNameFormat on pointcuts where transactionStartPoint is set to false. excludeFromTransactionTrace When true the transaction trace will not be provided if this pointcut initiates the transaction. If the pointcut is reached in the middle of a transaction, then the transaction trace will still be present, but this method will be excluded from the call graph. ignoreTransaction When true the entire transaction will be ignored. transactionType Sets the type of the transaction. Possible values are background (default, reported as a non-web transaction) and web (reported as a web transaction). Child nodes for pointcut A pointcut can have several different child nodes: Value Definition nameTransaction If this element is present, the agent will name the transaction using the class name and method(s) instrumented by this pointcut. methodAnnotation The case sensitive full name of an annotation class including the package name. All methods that are marked with this annotation will be matched. className The case sensitive name of the class to match, including the package name. Pair this node with the method node. If this node is present on a pointcut, then the interfaceName node cannot be present on the same pointcut node. The className node has the attribute includeSubclasses. If true the methods on the class with the matching name will be instrumented along with the matching methods on any child class of this class. If false (default), only methods on the exact class specified will be instrumented. The className must follow these rules: Inner classes can be instrumented. The full package structure with dots between packages must be used. To match subclasses of the specified class, set the attribute includeSubclasses to true. interfaceName The case sensitive name of an interface, including the package name, whose implementation classes will be matched. Pair this node with the method node. If this node is present on a pointcut, then the className node cannot be present on the same pointcut node. The interfaceName must follow this rule: The full package structure with dots between packages must be used. method A method on the class to instrument. Pair this node with a className node. Also, the method node can have children. traceByReturnType The class name, including package, in the format used in bytecode, e.g. Ljava/lang/String;. All methods that return an object of that class will be matched. traceLambda A boolean indicating whether to match lambdas. The traceLambda node has the attributes: includeNonstatic - a boolean indicating whether to match non static methods (defaults to false); pattern - a string with the pattern to search for the lambda methods. Child nodes for method The method node can have several children. For more information and examples, see Troubleshooting Java custom instrumentation. Value Definition name The exact case sensitive name of the method to match. A method name node must follow these rules: Public, protected, private, and package methods can all be instrumented. Static and instance methods can be instrumented. Constructors cannot be instrumented. parameters The parameter types of the method specified in order. If the parameters element is not present, then all methods matching the name will be matched. This includes private and protected declarations. A method parameters node contains a list of the method's parameters, specified by type elements. Here are the major rules for the type elements: Primitives are specified using their normal name: int, float, double, long, byte, short, boolean, char. Objects require a full package structure. For example, do not use String in the XML; instead, use java.lang.String. Do not use generics with collection objects. For example, write java.util.List instead of java.util.List<String>. Include brackets for arrays. For example, an array of integers will be int[ ] and an array of strings will be java.lang.String[ ]. Include two sets of brackets for an array of arrays. For example, an array of arrays of longs would be long[ ][ ]. To send the parameter as an analytic event to New Relic One, add an XML attribute to the type element called attributeName. To use a method with no parameters, the parameters node needs to be present to match a \"no arguments\" method. returnType The case sensitive name of a class indicating a return type to match. All methods that return this class type will be matched. Example Here is a sample class and an XML file that could be used to instrument that class. Sample class package test; import java.util.HashMap; import java.util.Map; import java.util.concurrent.Executors; import java.util.concurrent.ScheduledExecutorService; import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit; public class SampleTester { private String configName; private Map<String, Long> maxSampleTimes; public SampleTester(String pConfigName) { configName = pConfigName; maxSampleTimes = new HashMap<>(); } public void checkSample(String name, long[] times) { if (times != null) { maxSampleTimes.put(name, getFirst(times)); } else { maxSampleTimes.put(name, (long) getFirst()); } } private Long getFirst(long[] times) { return times[0]; } private int getFirst() { return 0; } public void printMaxRepeat(final long max) throws Exception { Runnable myRunnable = new Runnable() { public void run() { try { printMax(max); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); } } }; ScheduledExecutorService scheduledExecutor = Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(1); scheduledExecutor.scheduleWithFixedDelay(myRunnable, 0, 10000, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS); } private void printMax(long max) { System.out.println(\"max is \" + max); } } Copy Sample XML instrumentation file and explanation <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> <extension xmlns=\"https://newrelic.com/docs/java/xsd/v1.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"newrelic-extension extension.xsd \" name=\"customExtension\" version=\"1.0\"> <instrumentation metricPrefix=\"EXAMPLE\"> <pointcut transactionStartPoint=\"true\"> <!--class name is preceded by package name--> <className>test.SampleTester</className> <method> <name>checkSample</name> <parameters> <type attributeName=\"sampleName\">java.lang.String</type> <type>long[]</type> </parameters> </method> <!--two methods with the same name but different signatures can share one node--> <method> <name>getFirst</name> </method> <method> <name>run</name> </method> </pointcut> <pointcut transactionStartPoint=\"false\" ignoreTransaction=\"false\" excludeFromTransactionTrace=\"false\" metricNameFormat=\"SampleTester/methods\"> <className>test.SampleTester</className> <method> <name>printMaxRepeat</name> </method> <method> <name>printMax</name> </method> </pointcut> </instrumentation> </extension> Copy The first block of the XML file specifies the name and version of the extension. As the XML extension is default enabled, that attribute is not specified. The second block specifies the methods in SampleClass that should be instrumented. A transaction is started at the beginning of the block. It is worth noting that in the example class, there are two methods that share a name (getFirst) but have different signatures. These are instrumented with a single method node. By removing the parameters node, all methods with the same name can be matched under one method node. In the third block, the specified methods do not have a transaction started on them. This is because the transaction has already been started in run. The transaction will not be ignored, and will be included in the transaction trace.",

      "body": "The New Relic Java agent is compatible with Scala, and supports New Relic API calls, annotations, and custom instrumentation. All information below is supplemental to New Relic's Java agent installation directions. Tip For Heroku, see Java agent with Scala on Heroku. Scala frameworks If your framework is not natively supported by New Relic, or if you want to set up additional monitoring, custom instrumentation is a great way to dig deeper into your application. Instrument Scala with the Scala API The New Relic Scala agent API lets you control, customize, and extend the functionality of the APM Java agent using idiomatic Scala code. It can be used alongside the New Relic Java API as well as allow users to Create segments for synchronous and asynchronous anonymous functions Create segments for synchronous and asynchronous code blocks Create a transaction if one has not already been started Important For best results when using the API, ensure that you have the latest Java agent release. The New Relic Scala API requires Java agent 7.1.0 or higher. Use the Scala API To access the API class add the following information to your Scala configuration file: Configure using the project/build.scala file Add the following line (replacing S.V with the Scala version and X.Y.Z with the Java agent version you use) to the appDependencies method in your application's project/build.scala file: \"com.newrelic.agent.java\" % \"newrelic-scala-api_S.V\" % \"X.Y.Z\" Copy Configure using the project/build.sbt file Add the following line (replacing S.V with the Scala version and X.Y.Z with theJava agent version you use) to your application's project/build.sbt file: libraryDependencies += \"com.newrelic.agent.java\" % \"newrelic-scala-api_S.V\" % \"X.Y.Z\" Copy Supported Scala versions are 2.10, 2.11, 2.12 and 2.13. Scala 3.0 users can use the 2.13 jar. The jar is deployed to Maven Central and it is also in the New Relic Java agent's installation zip file. You can call the API when the Java agent is not running. The underlying API methods are just stubs; the implementation is added when the Java agent is running. Segments To create segment for a synchronous code block use TraceOps.trace. For example: import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.trace trace(\"statement segment\") { val i = 1 val j = 2 println(i + j) } // trace can also be used as an expression val x: Int = trace(\"expression segment\") { val i = 1 val j = 2 i + j } println(x) // 2 Copy trace can also be used in Scala For comprehensions import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.trace // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Option[Int] = for { one <- trace(\"segment one\")(Option(1)) two <- trace(\"segment two\")(Option(one + 1)) three <- trace(\"segment three\")(Option(two + 1)) } yield three println(x) // Some(3) Copy If you want to create segment for an asynchronous code block containing a Scala Future use TraceOps.asyncTrace. This will ensure the timing for the segment includes the time taken for the Future to complete. In the example below segment time will be no less than 5 seconds due to the delay created in the wrapped Future. import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.asyncTrace // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = asyncTrace(\"segment name\")(Future { Thread.sleep(5000) 1 }) x.foreach(println) // prints 1 on completion of Future Copy asyncTrace can also be used in Scala For comprehensions import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.asyncTrace // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = for { one <- asyncTrace(\"segment one\")(Future(1)) two <- asyncTrace(\"segment two\")(Future(one + 1)) three <- asyncTrace(\"segment three\")(Future(two + 1)) } yield three x.foreach(println) // prints 3 on completion of Future Copy If you want to create segment for a synchronous anonymous function use TraceOps.traceFun. For example: import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.traceFun val x: Option[Int] = Option(1) .map(traceFun(\"statement segment\")(i => i + 1)) println(x) //Some(2) Copy If you want to create segment for an asynchronous function that returns a Scala Future use TraceOps.asyncTrace. This will ensure the timing for the segment includes the time taken for the function to complete. In the example below segment time will be no less than 5 seconds due to the delay created in the wrapped Future. import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.asyncTraceFun // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = Future(1) .flatMap(asyncTraceFun(\"statement segment\")(i => Future(i + 1))) x.foreach(println) // prints 2 on completion of Future Copy Transactions Transactions can be created using the TraceOps.txn method. For example: import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.txn txn { val i = 1 val j = 2 println(i + j) } Copy txn can be used as a statement (as above) or as an expression import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.txn val i: Int = txn(1 + 2) //transaction created println(i) // 3 Copy txn can be used with any of the TraceOp methods to create segments. The example below create a transaction with 3 segments. import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.{txn, asyncTrace} // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = txn( for { one <- asyncTrace(\"segment one\")(Future(1)) two <- asyncTrace(\"segment two\")(Future(one + 1)) three <- asyncTrace(\"segment three\")(Future(two + 1)) } yield three ) x.foreach(println) // prints 3 on completion of Future Copy Instrument Scala with the Java agent API Instrument Scala to use the New Relic API class or annotations. Add the following information to your Scala configuration file: Configure using the project/build.scala file Add the following line (replacing X.Y.Z with the Java agent version you use) to the appDependencies method in your application's project/build.scala file: \"com.newrelic.agent.java\" % \"newrelic-api\" % \"X.Y.Z\" Copy Configure using the project/build.sbt file Add the following line (replacing X.Y.Z with the Java agent version you use) to your application's project/build.sbt file: libraryDependencies += \"com.newrelic.agent.java\" % \"newrelic-api\" % \"X.Y.Z\" Copy Import the NewRelic class and use it in your application: import com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic ... NewRelic.setTransactionName(null, \"/myTransaction\"); Copy More API functions For more about the Java agent API and its functionality, see the Java agent API introduction. Instrument Scala with XML instrumentation XML instrumentation is available for any Scala application running with the Java agent. It allows instrumentation to be added without any changes to the code. For more information, see Java instrumentation by XML.

      "body": "New Relic's .NET agent includes an API that allows you to extend the agent's standard functionality. For example, you can use the .NET agent API for: Customizing your app name Creating custom transaction parameters Reporting custom errors and metrics You can also customize some of the .NET agent's default behavior by adjusting configuration settings or using custom instrumentation. Requirements Important As of September 2021, a small subset of APIs, configuration options, and installation options for .NET will be replaced by new methods. For more details, including how you can easily prepare for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. To use the .NET agent API: Make sure you have the latest .NET agent release. Add a reference to the agent in your project: Add a reference to NewRelic.Api.Agent.dll to your project. OR View and download the API package from the NuGet Package Library. Instrument missing sections of your code with transactions To instrument your app, New Relic separates each path through your code into its own transaction. New Relic times (or \"instruments\") the parent method in these transactions to measure your app's overall performance, and collects transaction traces from long-running transactions for additional detail. Use these methods when New Relic is not instrumenting a particular part of your code at all: If you want to... Do this... Prevent a transaction from reporting to New Relic Use IgnoreTransaction() or an XML file to ignore the transaction. Create a transaction where none exists Use attributes or an XML file to create a new transaction. Time specific methods using segments If a transaction is already visible in the New Relic UI, but you don't have enough data about a particular method that was called during that transaction, you can create segments to time those individual methods in greater detail. For example, you might want to time a particularly critical method with complex logic. When you want to instrument a method within an existing transaction, see Custom instrumentation via attributes or Add detail to transactions via XML. Enhance the metadata of a transaction Sometimes the code you are targeting is visible in the New Relic UI, but some details of the method are not useful. For example: The default name might not be helpful. (Perhaps it is causing a metric grouping issue.) You want to add custom attributes to your transactions so you can filter them in dashboards. Use these methods when you want to change how New Relic instruments a transaction that's already visible in the New Relic UI: If you want to... Do this... Change the name of a transaction Use SetTransactionName() or an XML file. Prevent a transaction from affecting your Apdex score Use IgnoreApdex(). Add metadata (such as your customer's account name or subscription level) to your transactions Use custom attributes. See AddCustomAttribute(). Instrument asynchronous work For supported frameworks, the .NET agent usually detects async work and instruments it correctly. However, if your app uses another framework, or the default async instrumentation is inaccurate, you can explicitly connect async work. If you want to... Do this... Trace an async method that New Relic is already instrumenting Use an XML file to instrument async methods in IIS apps. Also see the New Relic's troubleshooting tips for missing async metrics. Trace an async method that New Relic is not instrumenting Use an XML file to instrument async methods in IIS apps. Also see the New Relic's troubleshooting tips for missing async metrics. View calls to external services For .NET agent version 8.9 or higher, you can use the following distributed tracing payload APIs to manually pass distributed tracing context between New Relic-monitored services that don't automatically connect to one another in a distributed trace. If you want to... Do this... Instrument an outgoing request to an external application or database Create a distributed trace payload to attach to an outgoing request using CreateDistributedTracePayload(). Connect incoming requests with the originator of the request to complete a span of the trace Receive a payload on an incoming request using AcceptDistributedTracePayload(). For .NET agent versions lower than 8.9, use cross application tracing. Collect or ignore errors Usually the .NET agent detects errors automatically. However, you can manually mark an error with the agent. You can also ignore errors . If you want to... Do this... Report an error the .NET agent does not report automatically Use NoticeError(). Capture errors or prevent the .NET agent from reporting an error at all Use your .NET agent configuration file. Send custom event and metric data from your app APM includes a number of ways to record arbitrary custom data. For an explanation of New Relic data types, see Data collection. If you want to... Do this... Send data about an event so you can analyze it in dashboards Create a custom event. See RecordCustomEvent(). Tag your events with metadata to filter and facet them in dashboards or error analytics Add custom attributes. See .NET agent attributes and Enable and disable attributes. Report custom performance data Use RecordMetric() to create a custom metric. To view the data, use the query builder. Control the browser monitoring agent Usually the browser agent is added automatically to your pages or deployed by copy/pasting the JavaScript snippet. For more information about these recommended methods, see Add apps to browser monitoring. However, you can also control the browser agent via APM agent API calls. For more information, see Browser monitoring and the .NET agent.",

It can have three different attributes: Value Definition name A unique but descriptive name identifying your XML extension. enabled Identifies whether the extension will be read by the Java agent. Default is true. If false, New Relic will ignore the extension. version The version of the extension. If two extensions have the same name, only the extension with the highest version will be used. Instrumentation (child of extension) The instrumentation node is a child of extension. It can have one attribute: metricPrefix. This is the prefix used for the metric names when the nameTransaction node is not specified. Default is CUSTOM. Pointcut (child of instrumentation) The pointcut is a child node of instrumentation and can have several attributes. Also, a pointcut can have several different child nodes. Value Definition transactionStartPoint If a transaction is not already in progress when this pointcut is reached, then a transaction will be started. If a transaction is already in progress, then that transaction will continue. A new transaction will not be created. metricNameFormat The name format to use for a metric. If not present, then this will default to the class name followed by the method name. You can only set the metricNameFormat on pointcuts where transactionStartPoint is set to false. excludeFromTransactionTrace When true the transaction trace will not be provided if this pointcut initiates the transaction. If the pointcut is reached in the middle of a transaction, then the transaction trace will still be present, but this method will be excluded from the call graph. ignoreTransaction When true the entire transaction will be ignored. transactionType Sets the type of the transaction. Possible values are background (default, reported as a non-web transaction) and web (reported as a web transaction). Child nodes for pointcut A pointcut can have several different child nodes: Value Definition nameTransaction If this element is present, the agent will name the transaction using the class name and method(s) instrumented by this pointcut. methodAnnotation The case sensitive full name of an annotation class including the package name. All methods that are marked with this annotation will be matched. className The case sensitive name of the class to match, including the package name. Pair this node with the method node. If this node is present on a pointcut, then the interfaceName node cannot be present on the same pointcut node. The className node has the attribute includeSubclasses. If true the methods on the class with the matching name will be instrumented along with the matching methods on any child class of this class. If false (default), only methods on the exact class specified will be instrumented. The className must follow these rules: Inner classes can be instrumented. The full package structure with dots between packages must be used. To match subclasses of the specified class, set the attribute includeSubclasses to true. interfaceName The case sensitive name of an interface, including the package name, whose implementation classes will be matched. Pair this node with the method node. If this node is present on a pointcut, then the className node cannot be present on the same pointcut node. The interfaceName must follow this rule: The full package structure with dots between packages must be used. method A method on the class to instrument. Pair this node with a className node. Also, the method node can have children. traceByReturnType The class name, including package, in the format used in bytecode, e.g. Ljava/lang/String;. All methods that return an object of that class will be matched. traceLambda A boolean indicating whether to match lambdas. The traceLambda node has the attributes: includeNonstatic - a boolean indicating whether to match non static methods (defaults to false); pattern - a string with the pattern to search for the lambda methods. Child nodes for method The method node can have several children. For more information and examples, see Troubleshooting Java custom instrumentation. Value Definition name The exact case sensitive name of the method to match. A method name node must follow these rules: Public, protected, private, and package methods can all be instrumented. Static and instance methods can be instrumented. Constructors cannot be instrumented. parameters The parameter types of the method specified in order. If the parameters element is not present, then all methods matching the name will be matched. This includes private and protected declarations. A method parameters node contains a list of the method's parameters, specified by type elements. Here are the major rules for the type elements: Primitives are specified using their normal name: int, float, double, long, byte, short, boolean, char. Objects require a full package structure. For example, do not use String in the XML; instead, use java.lang.String. Do not use generics with collection objects. For example, write java.util.List instead of java.util.List<String>. Include brackets for arrays. For example, an array of integers will be int[ ] and an array of strings will be java.lang.String[ ]. Include two sets of brackets for an array of arrays. For example, an array of arrays of longs would be long[ ][ ]. To send the parameter as an analytic event to New Relic One, add an XML attribute to the type element called attributeName. To use a method with no parameters, the parameters node needs to be present to match a \"no arguments\" method. returnType The case sensitive name of a class indicating a return type to match. All methods that return this class type will be matched. Example Here is a sample class and an XML file that could be used to instrument that class. Sample class package test; import java.util.HashMap; import java.util.Map; import java.util.concurrent.Executors; import java.util.concurrent.ScheduledExecutorService; import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit; public class SampleTester { private String configName; private Map<String, Long> maxSampleTimes; public SampleTester(String pConfigName) { configName = pConfigName; maxSampleTimes = new HashMap<>(); } public void checkSample(String name, long[] times) { if (times != null) { maxSampleTimes.put(name, getFirst(times)); } else { maxSampleTimes.put(name, (long) getFirst()); } } private Long getFirst(long[] times) { return times[0]; } private int getFirst() { return 0; } public void printMaxRepeat(final long max) throws Exception { Runnable myRunnable = new Runnable() { public void run() { try { printMax(max); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); } } }; ScheduledExecutorService scheduledExecutor = Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(1); scheduledExecutor.scheduleWithFixedDelay(myRunnable, 0, 10000, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS); } private void printMax(long max) { System.out.println(\"max is \" + max); } } Copy Sample XML instrumentation file and explanation <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> <extension xmlns=\"https://newrelic.com/docs/java/xsd/v1.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"newrelic-extension extension.xsd \" name=\"customExtension\" version=\"1.0\"> <instrumentation metricPrefix=\"EXAMPLE\"> <pointcut transactionStartPoint=\"true\"> <!--class name is preceded by package name--> <className>test.SampleTester</className> <method> <name>checkSample</name> <parameters> <type attributeName=\"sampleName\">java.lang.String</type> <type>long[]</type> </parameters> </method> <!--two methods with the same name but different signatures can share one node--> <method> <name>getFirst</name> </method> <method> <name>run</name> </method> </pointcut> <pointcut transactionStartPoint=\"false\" ignoreTransaction=\"false\" excludeFromTransactionTrace=\"false\" metricNameFormat=\"SampleTester/methods\"> <className>test.SampleTester</className> <method> <name>printMaxRepeat</name> </method> <method> <name>printMax</name> </method> </pointcut> </instrumentation> </extension> Copy The first block of the XML file specifies the name and version of the extension. As the XML extension is default enabled, that attribute is not specified. The second block specifies the methods in SampleClass that should be instrumented. A transaction is started at the beginning of the block. It is worth noting that in the example class, there are two methods that share a name (getFirst) but have different signatures. These are instrumented with a single method node. By removing the parameters node, all methods with the same name can be matched under one method node. In the third block, the specified methods do not have a transaction started on them. This is because the transaction has already been started in run. The transaction will not be ignored, and will be included in the transaction trace.",

      "body": "The New Relic Java agent is compatible with Scala, and supports New Relic API calls, annotations, and custom instrumentation. All information below is supplemental to New Relic's Java agent installation directions. Tip For Heroku, see Java agent with Scala on Heroku. Scala frameworks If your framework is not natively supported by New Relic, or if you want to set up additional monitoring, custom instrumentation is a great way to dig deeper into your application. Instrument Scala with the Scala API The New Relic Scala agent API lets you control, customize, and extend the functionality of the APM Java agent using idiomatic Scala code. It can be used alongside the New Relic Java API as well as allow users to Create segments for synchronous and asynchronous anonymous functions Create segments for synchronous and asynchronous code blocks Create a transaction if one has not already been started Important For best results when using the API, ensure that you have the latest Java agent release. The New Relic Scala API requires Java agent 7.1.0 or higher. Use the Scala API To access the API class add the following information to your Scala configuration file: Configure using the project/build.scala file Add the following line (replacing S.V with the Scala version and X.Y.Z with the Java agent version you use) to the appDependencies method in your application's project/build.scala file: \"com.newrelic.agent.java\" % \"newrelic-scala-api_S.V\" % \"X.Y.Z\" Copy Configure using the project/build.sbt file Add the following line (replacing S.V with the Scala version and X.Y.Z with theJava agent version you use) to your application's project/build.sbt file: libraryDependencies += \"com.newrelic.agent.java\" % \"newrelic-scala-api_S.V\" % \"X.Y.Z\" Copy Supported Scala versions are 2.10, 2.11, 2.12 and 2.13. Scala 3.0 users can use the 2.13 jar. The jar is deployed to Maven Central and it is also in the New Relic Java agent's installation zip file. You can call the API when the Java agent is not running. The underlying API methods are just stubs; the implementation is added when the Java agent is running. Segments To create segment for a synchronous code block use TraceOps.trace. For example: import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.trace trace(\"statement segment\") { val i = 1 val j = 2 println(i + j) } // trace can also be used as an expression val x: Int = trace(\"expression segment\") { val i = 1 val j = 2 i + j } println(x) // 2 Copy trace can also be used in Scala For comprehensions import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.trace // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Option[Int] = for { one <- trace(\"segment one\")(Option(1)) two <- trace(\"segment two\")(Option(one + 1)) three <- trace(\"segment three\")(Option(two + 1)) } yield three println(x) // Some(3) Copy If you want to create segment for an asynchronous code block containing a Scala Future use TraceOps.asyncTrace. This will ensure the timing for the segment includes the time taken for the Future to complete. In the example below segment time will be no less than 5 seconds due to the delay created in the wrapped Future. import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.asyncTrace // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = asyncTrace(\"segment name\")(Future { Thread.sleep(5000) 1 }) x.foreach(println) // prints 1 on completion of Future Copy asyncTrace can also be used in Scala For comprehensions import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.asyncTrace // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = for { one <- asyncTrace(\"segment one\")(Future(1)) two <- asyncTrace(\"segment two\")(Future(one + 1)) three <- asyncTrace(\"segment three\")(Future(two + 1)) } yield three x.foreach(println) // prints 3 on completion of Future Copy If you want to create segment for a synchronous anonymous function use TraceOps.traceFun. For example: import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.traceFun val x: Option[Int] = Option(1) .map(traceFun(\"statement segment\")(i => i + 1)) println(x) //Some(2) Copy If you want to create segment for an asynchronous function that returns a Scala Future use TraceOps.asyncTrace. This will ensure the timing for the segment includes the time taken for the function to complete. In the example below segment time will be no less than 5 seconds due to the delay created in the wrapped Future. import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.asyncTraceFun // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = Future(1) .flatMap(asyncTraceFun(\"statement segment\")(i => Future(i + 1))) x.foreach(println) // prints 2 on completion of Future Copy Transactions Transactions can be created using the TraceOps.txn method. For example: import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.txn txn { val i = 1 val j = 2 println(i + j) } Copy txn can be used as a statement (as above) or as an expression import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.txn val i: Int = txn(1 + 2) //transaction created println(i) // 3 Copy txn can be used with any of the TraceOp methods to create segments. The example below create a transaction with 3 segments. import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.{txn, asyncTrace} // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = txn( for { one <- asyncTrace(\"segment one\")(Future(1)) two <- asyncTrace(\"segment two\")(Future(one + 1)) three <- asyncTrace(\"segment three\")(Future(two + 1)) } yield three ) x.foreach(println) // prints 3 on completion of Future Copy Instrument Scala with the Java agent API Instrument Scala to use the New Relic API class or annotations. Add the following information to your Scala configuration file: Configure using the project/build.scala file Add the following line (replacing X.Y.Z with the Java agent version you use) to the appDependencies method in your application's project/build.scala file: \"com.newrelic.agent.java\" % \"newrelic-api\" % \"X.Y.Z\" Copy Configure using the project/build.sbt file Add the following line (replacing X.Y.Z with the Java agent version you use) to your application's project/build.sbt file: libraryDependencies += \"com.newrelic.agent.java\" % \"newrelic-api\" % \"X.Y.Z\" Copy Import the NewRelic class and use it in your application: import com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic ... NewRelic.setTransactionName(null, \"/myTransaction\"); Copy More API functions For more about the Java agent API and its functionality, see the Java agent API introduction. Instrument Scala with XML instrumentation XML instrumentation is available for any Scala application running with the Java agent. It allows instrumentation to be added without any changes to the code. For more information, see Java instrumentation by XML. Additional instrumentation If you use Kamon, take a look at the New Relic Kamon reporter.",

      "body": "New Relic's .NET agent includes an API that allows you to extend the agent's standard functionality. For example, you can use the .NET agent API for: Customizing your app name Creating custom transaction parameters Reporting custom errors and metrics You can also customize some of the .NET agent's default behavior by adjusting configuration settings or using custom instrumentation. Requirements Important As of September 2021, a small subset of APIs, configuration options, and installation options for .NET will be replaced by new methods. For more details, including how you can easily prepare for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. To use the .NET agent API: Make sure you have the latest .NET agent release. Add a reference to the agent in your project: Add a reference to NewRelic.Api.Agent.dll to your project. OR View and download the API package from the NuGet Package Library. Instrument missing sections of your code with transactions To instrument your app, New Relic separates each path through your code into its own transaction. New Relic times (or \"instruments\") the parent method in these transactions to measure your app's overall performance, and collects transaction traces from long-running transactions for additional detail. Use these methods when New Relic is not instrumenting a particular part of your code at all: If you want to... Do this... Prevent a transaction from reporting to New Relic Use IgnoreTransaction() or an XML file to ignore the transaction. Create a transaction where none exists Use attributes or an XML file to create a new transaction. Time specific methods using segments If a transaction is already visible in the New Relic UI, but you don't have enough data about a particular method that was called during that transaction, you can create segments to time those individual methods in greater detail. For example, you might want to time a particularly critical method with complex logic. When you want to instrument a method within an existing transaction, see Custom instrumentation via attributes or Add detail to transactions via XML. Enhance the metadata of a transaction Sometimes the code you are targeting is visible in the New Relic UI, but some details of the method are not useful. For example: The default name might not be helpful. (Perhaps it is causing a metric grouping issue.) You want to add custom attributes to your transactions so you can filter them in dashboards. Use these methods when you want to change how New Relic instruments a transaction that's already visible in the New Relic UI: If you want to... Do this... Change the name of a transaction Use SetTransactionName() or an XML file. Prevent a transaction from affecting your Apdex score Use IgnoreApdex(). Add metadata (such as your customer's account name or subscription level) to your transactions Use custom attributes. See AddCustomAttribute(). Instrument asynchronous work For supported frameworks, the .NET agent usually detects async work and instruments it correctly. However, if your app uses another framework, or the default async instrumentation is inaccurate, you can explicitly connect async work. If you want to... Do this... Trace an async method that New Relic is already instrumenting Use an XML file to instrument async methods in IIS apps. Also see the New Relic's troubleshooting tips for missing async metrics. Trace an async method that New Relic is not instrumenting Use an XML file to instrument async methods in IIS apps. Also see the New Relic's troubleshooting tips for missing async metrics. View calls to external services For .NET agent version 8.9 or higher, you can use the following distributed tracing payload APIs to manually pass distributed tracing context between New Relic-monitored services that don't automatically connect to one another in a distributed trace. If you want to... Do this... Instrument an outgoing request to an external application or database Create a distributed trace payload to attach to an outgoing request using CreateDistributedTracePayload(). Connect incoming requests with the originator of the request to complete a span of the trace Receive a payload on an incoming request using AcceptDistributedTracePayload(). For .NET agent versions lower than 8.9, use cross application tracing. Collect or ignore errors Usually the .NET agent detects errors automatically. However, you can manually mark an error with the agent. You can also ignore errors . If you want to... Do this... Report an error the .NET agent does not report automatically Use NoticeError(). Capture errors or prevent the .NET agent from reporting an error at all Use your .NET agent configuration file. Send custom event and metric data from your app APM includes a number of ways to record arbitrary custom data. For an explanation of New Relic data types, see Data collection. If you want to... Do this... Send data about an event so you can analyze it in dashboards Create a custom event. See RecordCustomEvent(). Tag your events with metadata to filter and facet them in dashboards or error analytics Add custom attributes. See .NET agent attributes and Enable and disable attributes. Report custom performance data Use RecordMetric() to create a custom metric. To view the data, use the query builder. Control the browser monitoring agent Usually the browser agent is added automatically to your pages or deployed by copy/pasting the JavaScript snippet. For more information about these recommended methods, see Add apps to browser monitoring. However, you can also control the browser agent via APM agent API calls. For more information, see Browser monitoring and the .NET agent.",

If this node is present on a pointcut, then the interfaceName node cannot be present on the same pointcut node. The className node has the attribute includeSubclasses. If true the methods on the class with the matching name will be instrumented along with the matching methods on any child class of this class. If false (default), only methods on the exact class specified will be instrumented. The className must follow these rules: Inner classes can be instrumented. The full package structure with dots between packages must be used. To match subclasses of the specified class, set the attribute includeSubclasses to true. interfaceName The case sensitive name of an interface, including the package name, whose implementation classes will be matched. Pair this node with the method node. If this node is present on a pointcut, then the className node cannot be present on the same pointcut node. The interfaceName must follow this rule: The full package structure with dots between packages must be used. method A method on the class to instrument. Pair this node with a className node. Also, the method node can have children. traceByReturnType The class name, including package, in the format used in bytecode, e.g. Ljava/lang/String;. All methods that return an object of that class will be matched. traceLambda A boolean indicating whether to match lambdas. The traceLambda node has the attributes: includeNonstatic - a boolean indicating whether to match non static methods (defaults to false); pattern - a string with the pattern to search for the lambda methods. Child nodes for method The method node can have several children. For more information and examples, see Troubleshooting Java custom instrumentation. Value Definition name The exact case sensitive name of the method to match. A method name node must follow these rules: Public, protected, private, and package methods can all be instrumented. Static and instance methods can be instrumented. Constructors cannot be instrumented. parameters The parameter types of the method specified in order. If the parameters element is not present, then all methods matching the name will be matched. This includes private and protected declarations. A method parameters node contains a list of the method's parameters, specified by type elements. Here are the major rules for the type elements: Primitives are specified using their normal name: int, float, double, long, byte, short, boolean, char. Objects require a full package structure. For example, do not use String in the XML; instead, use java.lang.String. Do not use generics with collection objects. For example, write java.util.List instead of java.util.List<String>. Include brackets for arrays. For example, an array of integers will be int[ ] and an array of strings will be java.lang.String[ ]. Include two sets of brackets for an array of arrays. For example, an array of arrays of longs would be long[ ][ ]. To send the parameter as an analytic event to New Relic One, add an XML attribute to the type element called attributeName. To use a method with no parameters, the parameters node needs to be present to match a \"no arguments\" method. returnType The case sensitive name of a class indicating a return type to match. All methods that return this class type will be matched. Example Here is a sample class and an XML file that could be used to instrument that class. Sample class package test; import java.util.HashMap; import java.util.Map; import java.util.concurrent.Executors; import java.util.concurrent.ScheduledExecutorService; import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit; public class SampleTester { private String configName; private Map<String, Long> maxSampleTimes; public SampleTester(String pConfigName) { configName = pConfigName; maxSampleTimes = new HashMap<>(); } public void checkSample(String name, long[] times) { if (times != null) { maxSampleTimes.put(name, getFirst(times)); } else { maxSampleTimes.put(name, (long) getFirst()); } } private Long getFirst(long[] times) { return times[0]; } private int getFirst() { return 0; } public void printMaxRepeat(final long max) throws Exception { Runnable myRunnable = new Runnable() { public void run() { try { printMax(max); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); } } }; ScheduledExecutorService scheduledExecutor = Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(1); scheduledExecutor.scheduleWithFixedDelay(myRunnable, 0, 10000, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS); } private void printMax(long max) { System.out.println(\"max is \" + max); } } Copy Sample XML instrumentation file and explanation <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> <extension xmlns=\"https://newrelic.com/docs/java/xsd/v1.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"newrelic-extension extension.xsd \" name=\"customExtension\" version=\"1.0\"> <instrumentation metricPrefix=\"EXAMPLE\"> <pointcut transactionStartPoint=\"true\"> <!--class name is preceded by package name--> <className>test.SampleTester</className> <method> <name>checkSample</name> <parameters> <type attributeName=\"sampleName\">java.lang.String</type> <type>long[]</type> </parameters> </method> <!--two methods with the same name but different signatures can share one node--> <method> <name>getFirst</name> </method> <method> <name>run</name> </method> </pointcut> <pointcut transactionStartPoint=\"false\" ignoreTransaction=\"false\" excludeFromTransactionTrace=\"false\" metricNameFormat=\"SampleTester/methods\"> <className>test.SampleTester</className> <method> <name>printMaxRepeat</name> </method> <method> <name>printMax</name> </method> </pointcut> </instrumentation> </extension> Copy The first block of the XML file specifies the name and version of the extension. As the XML extension is default enabled, that attribute is not specified. The second block specifies the methods in SampleClass that should be instrumented. A transaction is started at the beginning of the block. It is worth noting that in the example class, there are two methods that share a name (getFirst) but have different signatures. These are instrumented with a single method node. By removing the parameters node, all methods with the same name can be matched under one method node. In the third block, the specified methods do not have a transaction started on them. This is because the transaction has already been started in run. The transaction will not be ignored, and will be included in the transaction trace.",

      "body": "The New Relic Java agent is compatible with Scala, and supports New Relic API calls, annotations, and custom instrumentation. All information below is supplemental to New Relic's Java agent installation directions. Tip For Heroku, see Java agent with Scala on Heroku. Scala frameworks If your framework is not natively supported by New Relic, or if you want to set up additional monitoring, custom instrumentation is a great way to dig deeper into your application. Instrument Scala with the Scala API The New Relic Scala agent API lets you control, customize, and extend the functionality of the APM Java agent using idiomatic Scala code. It can be used alongside the New Relic Java API as well as allow users to Create segments for synchronous and asynchronous anonymous functions Create segments for synchronous and asynchronous code blocks Create a transaction if one has not already been started Important For best results when using the API, ensure that you have the latest Java agent release. The New Relic Scala API requires Java agent 7.1.0 or higher. Use the Scala API To access the API class add the following information to your Scala configuration file: Configure using the project/build.scala file Add the following line (replacing S.V with the Scala version and X.Y.Z with the Java agent version you use) to the appDependencies method in your application's project/build.scala file: \"com.newrelic.agent.java\" % \"newrelic-scala-api_S.V\" % \"X.Y.Z\" Copy Configure using the project/build.sbt file Add the following line (replacing S.V with the Scala version and X.Y.Z with theJava agent version you use) to your application's project/build.sbt file: libraryDependencies += \"com.newrelic.agent.java\" % \"newrelic-scala-api_S.V\" % \"X.Y.Z\" Copy Supported Scala versions are 2.10, 2.11, 2.12 and 2.13. Scala 3.0 users can use the 2.13 jar. The jar is deployed to Maven Central and it is also in the New Relic Java agent's installation zip file. You can call the API when the Java agent is not running. The underlying API methods are just stubs; the implementation is added when the Java agent is running. Segments To create segment for a synchronous code block use TraceOps.trace. For example: import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.trace trace(\"statement segment\") { val i = 1 val j = 2 println(i + j) } // trace can also be used as an expression val x: Int = trace(\"expression segment\") { val i = 1 val j = 2 i + j } println(x) // 2 Copy trace can also be used in Scala For comprehensions import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.trace // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Option[Int] = for { one <- trace(\"segment one\")(Option(1)) two <- trace(\"segment two\")(Option(one + 1)) three <- trace(\"segment three\")(Option(two + 1)) } yield three println(x) // Some(3) Copy If you want to create segment for an asynchronous code block containing a Scala Future use TraceOps.asyncTrace. This will ensure the timing for the segment includes the time taken for the Future to complete. In the example below segment time will be no less than 5 seconds due to the delay created in the wrapped Future. import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.asyncTrace // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = asyncTrace(\"segment name\")(Future { Thread.sleep(5000) 1 }) x.foreach(println) // prints 1 on completion of Future Copy asyncTrace can also be used in Scala For comprehensions import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.asyncTrace // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = for { one <- asyncTrace(\"segment one\")(Future(1)) two <- asyncTrace(\"segment two\")(Future(one + 1)) three <- asyncTrace(\"segment three\")(Future(two + 1)) } yield three x.foreach(println) // prints 3 on completion of Future Copy If you want to create segment for a synchronous anonymous function use TraceOps.traceFun. For example: import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.traceFun val x: Option[Int] = Option(1) .map(traceFun(\"statement segment\")(i => i + 1)) println(x) //Some(2) Copy If you want to create segment for an asynchronous function that returns a Scala Future use TraceOps.asyncTrace. This will ensure the timing for the segment includes the time taken for the function to complete. In the example below segment time will be no less than 5 seconds due to the delay created in the wrapped Future. import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.asyncTraceFun // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = Future(1) .flatMap(asyncTraceFun(\"statement segment\")(i => Future(i + 1))) x.foreach(println) // prints 2 on completion of Future Copy Transactions Transactions can be created using the TraceOps.txn method. For example: import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.txn txn { val i = 1 val j = 2 println(i + j) } Copy txn can be used as a statement (as above) or as an expression import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.txn val i: Int = txn(1 + 2) //transaction created println(i) // 3 Copy txn can be used with any of the TraceOp methods to create segments. The example below create a transaction with 3 segments. import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.{txn, asyncTrace} // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = txn( for { one <- asyncTrace(\"segment one\")(Future(1)) two <- asyncTrace(\"segment two\")(Future(one + 1)) three <- asyncTrace(\"segment three\")(Future(two + 1)) } yield three ) x.foreach(println) // prints 3 on completion of Future Copy Instrument Scala with the Java agent API Instrument Scala to use the New Relic API class or annotations. Add the following information to your Scala configuration file: Configure using the project/build.scala file Add the following line (replacing X.Y.Z with the Java agent version you use) to the appDependencies method in your application's project/build.scala file: \"com.newrelic.agent.java\" % \"newrelic-api\" % \"X.Y.Z\" Copy Configure using the project/build.sbt file Add the following line (replacing X.Y.Z with the Java agent version you use) to your application's project/build.sbt file: libraryDependencies += \"com.newrelic.agent.java\" % \"newrelic-api\" % \"X.Y.Z\" Copy Import the NewRelic class and use it in your application: import com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic ... NewRelic.setTransactionName(null, \"/myTransaction\"); Copy More API functions For more about the Java agent API and its functionality, see the Java agent API introduction. Instrument Scala with XML instrumentation XML instrumentation is available for any Scala application running with the Java agent. It allows instrumentation to be added without any changes to the code. For more information, see Java instrumentation by XML. Additional instrumentation If you use Kamon, take a look at the New Relic Kamon reporter.",

      "body": "New Relic's .NET agent includes an API that allows you to extend the agent's standard functionality. For example, you can use the .NET agent API for: Customizing your app name Creating custom transaction parameters Reporting custom errors and metrics You can also customize some of the .NET agent's default behavior by adjusting configuration settings or using custom instrumentation. Requirements Important As of September 2021, a small subset of APIs, configuration options, and installation options for .NET will be replaced by new methods. For more details, including how you can easily prepare for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. To use the .NET agent API: Make sure you have the latest .NET agent release. Add a reference to the agent in your project: Add a reference to NewRelic.Api.Agent.dll to your project. OR View and download the API package from the NuGet Package Library. Instrument missing sections of your code with transactions To instrument your app, New Relic separates each path through your code into its own transaction. New Relic times (or \"instruments\") the parent method in these transactions to measure your app's overall performance, and collects transaction traces from long-running transactions for additional detail. Use these methods when New Relic is not instrumenting a particular part of your code at all: If you want to... Do this... Prevent a transaction from reporting to New Relic Use IgnoreTransaction() or an XML file to ignore the transaction. Create a transaction where none exists Use attributes or an XML file to create a new transaction. Time specific methods using segments If a transaction is already visible in the New Relic UI, but you don't have enough data about a particular method that was called during that transaction, you can create segments to time those individual methods in greater detail. For example, you might want to time a particularly critical method with complex logic. When you want to instrument a method within an existing transaction, see Custom instrumentation via attributes or Add detail to transactions via XML. Enhance the metadata of a transaction Sometimes the code you are targeting is visible in the New Relic UI, but some details of the method are not useful. For example: The default name might not be helpful. (Perhaps it is causing a metric grouping issue.) You want to add custom attributes to your transactions so you can filter them in dashboards. Use these methods when you want to change how New Relic instruments a transaction that's already visible in the New Relic UI: If you want to... Do this... Change the name of a transaction Use SetTransactionName() or an XML file. Prevent a transaction from affecting your Apdex score Use IgnoreApdex(). Add metadata (such as your customer's account name or subscription level) to your transactions Use custom attributes. See AddCustomAttribute(). Instrument asynchronous work For supported frameworks, the .NET agent usually detects async work and instruments it correctly. However, if your app uses another framework, or the default async instrumentation is inaccurate, you can explicitly connect async work. If you want to... Do this... Trace an async method that New Relic is already instrumenting Use an XML file to instrument async methods in IIS apps. Also see the New Relic's troubleshooting tips for missing async metrics. Trace an async method that New Relic is not instrumenting Use an XML file to instrument async methods in IIS apps. Also see the New Relic's troubleshooting tips for missing async metrics. View calls to external services For .NET agent version 8.9 or higher, you can use the following distributed tracing payload APIs to manually pass distributed tracing context between New Relic-monitored services that don't automatically connect to one another in a distributed trace. If you want to... Do this... Instrument an outgoing request to an external application or database Create a distributed trace payload to attach to an outgoing request using CreateDistributedTracePayload(). Connect incoming requests with the originator of the request to complete a span of the trace Receive a payload on an incoming request using AcceptDistributedTracePayload(). For .NET agent versions lower than 8.9, use cross application tracing. Collect or ignore errors Usually the .NET agent detects errors automatically. However, you can manually mark an error with the agent. You can also ignore errors . If you want to... Do this... Report an error the .NET agent does not report automatically Use NoticeError(). Capture errors or prevent the .NET agent from reporting an error at all Use your .NET agent configuration file. Send custom event and metric data from your app APM includes a number of ways to record arbitrary custom data. For an explanation of New Relic data types, see Data collection. If you want to... Do this... Send data about an event so you can analyze it in dashboards Create a custom event. See RecordCustomEvent(). Tag your events with metadata to filter and facet them in dashboards or error analytics Add custom attributes. See .NET agent attributes and Enable and disable attributes. Report custom performance data Use RecordMetric() to create a custom metric. To view the data, use the query builder. Control the browser monitoring agent Usually the browser agent is added automatically to your pages or deployed by copy/pasting the JavaScript snippet. For more information about these recommended methods, see Add apps to browser monitoring. However, you can also control the browser agent via APM agent API calls. For more information, see Browser monitoring and the .NET agent.",

      "body": "For your New Relic-monitored Java application, one custom instrumentation method is to use an XML file that lists the methods and classes you want to instrument. This documentation shows an example XML instrumentation file. For more information, see Java instrumentation by XML. Edit XML file in UI To edit your XML file directly from the New Relic UI: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Settings > Instrumentation. From here you can: Download a sample XML file. Select an edit existing XML file. Search the instrumentation history. XML file format The XML file format includes root and child nodes. Caution Do not instrument all of your methods, as this can lead to a metric grouping issue. Root node: extension The root node of an XML file is extension. It can have three different attributes: Value Definition name A unique but descriptive name identifying your XML extension. enabled Identifies whether the extension will be read by the Java agent. Default is true. If false, New Relic will ignore the extension. version The version of the extension. If two extensions have the same name, only the extension with the highest version will be used. Instrumentation (child of extension) The instrumentation node is a child of extension. It can have one attribute: metricPrefix. This is the prefix used for the metric names when the nameTransaction node is not specified. Default is CUSTOM. Pointcut (child of instrumentation) The pointcut is a child node of instrumentation and can have several attributes. Also, a pointcut can have several different child nodes. Value Definition transactionStartPoint If a transaction is not already in progress when this pointcut is reached, then a transaction will be started. If a transaction is already in progress, then that transaction will continue. A new transaction will not be created. metricNameFormat The name format to use for a metric. If not present, then this will default to the class name followed by the method name. You can only set the metricNameFormat on pointcuts where transactionStartPoint is set to false. excludeFromTransactionTrace When true the transaction trace will not be provided if this pointcut initiates the transaction. If the pointcut is reached in the middle of a transaction, then the transaction trace will still be present, but this method will be excluded from the call graph. ignoreTransaction When true the entire transaction will be ignored. transactionType Sets the type of the transaction. Possible values are background (default, reported as a non-web transaction) and web (reported as a web transaction). Child nodes for pointcut A pointcut can have several different child nodes: Value Definition nameTransaction If this element is present, the agent will name the transaction using the class name and method(s) instrumented by this pointcut. methodAnnotation The case sensitive full name of an annotation class including the package name. All methods that are marked with this annotation will be matched. className The case sensitive name of the class to match, including the package name. Pair this node with the method node. If this node is present on a pointcut, then the interfaceName node cannot be present on the same pointcut node. The className node has the attribute includeSubclasses. If true the methods on the class with the matching name will be instrumented along with the matching methods on any child class of this class. If false (default), only methods on the exact class specified will be instrumented. The className must follow these rules: Inner classes can be instrumented. The full package structure with dots between packages must be used. To match subclasses of the specified class, set the attribute includeSubclasses to true. interfaceName The case sensitive name of an interface, including the package name, whose implementation classes will be matched. Pair this node with the method node. If this node is present on a pointcut, then the className node cannot be present on the same pointcut node. The interfaceName must follow this rule: The full package structure with dots between packages must be used. method A method on the class to instrument. Pair this node with a className node. Also, the method node can have children. traceByReturnType The class name, including package, in the format used in bytecode, e.g. Ljava/lang/String;. All methods that return an object of that class will be matched. traceLambda A boolean indicating whether to match lambdas. The traceLambda node has the attributes: includeNonstatic - a boolean indicating whether to match non static methods (defaults to false); pattern - a string with the pattern to search for the lambda methods. Child nodes for method The method node can have several children. For more information and examples, see Troubleshooting Java custom instrumentation. Value Definition name The exact case sensitive name of the method to match. A method name node must follow these rules: Public, protected, private, and package methods can all be instrumented. Static and instance methods can be instrumented. Constructors cannot be instrumented. parameters The parameter types of the method specified in order. If the parameters element is not present, then all methods matching the name will be matched. This includes private and protected declarations. A method parameters node contains a list of the method's parameters, specified by type elements. Here are the major rules for the type elements: Primitives are specified using their normal name: int, float, double, long, byte, short, boolean, char. Objects require a full package structure. For example, do not use String in the XML; instead, use java.lang.String. Do not use generics with collection objects. For example, write java.util.List instead of java.util.List<String>. Include brackets for arrays. For example, an array of integers will be int[ ] and an array of strings will be java.lang.String[ ]. Include two sets of brackets for an array of arrays. For example, an array of arrays of longs would be long[ ][ ]. To send the parameter as an analytic event to New Relic One, add an XML attribute to the type element called attributeName. To use a method with no parameters, the parameters node needs to be present to match a \"no arguments\" method. returnType The case sensitive name of a class indicating a return type to match. All methods that return this class type will be matched. Example Here is a sample class and an XML file that could be used to instrument that class. Sample class package test; import java.util.HashMap; import java.util.Map; import java.util.concurrent.Executors; import java.util.concurrent.ScheduledExecutorService; import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit; public class SampleTester { private String configName; private Map<String, Long> maxSampleTimes; public SampleTester(String pConfigName) { configName = pConfigName; maxSampleTimes = new HashMap<>(); } public void checkSample(String name, long[] times) { if (times != null) { maxSampleTimes.put(name, getFirst(times)); } else { maxSampleTimes.put(name, (long) getFirst()); } } private Long getFirst(long[] times) { return times[0]; } private int getFirst() { return 0; } public void printMaxRepeat(final long max) throws Exception { Runnable myRunnable = new Runnable() { public void run() { try { printMax(max); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); } } }; ScheduledExecutorService scheduledExecutor = Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(1); scheduledExecutor.scheduleWithFixedDelay(myRunnable, 0, 10000, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS); } private void printMax(long max) { System.out.println(\"max is \" + max); } } Copy Sample XML instrumentation file and explanation <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> <extension xmlns=\"https://newrelic.com/docs/java/xsd/v1.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"newrelic-extension extension.xsd \" name=\"customExtension\" version=\"1.0\"> <instrumentation metricPrefix=\"EXAMPLE\"> <pointcut transactionStartPoint=\"true\"> <!--class name is preceded by package name--> <className>test.SampleTester</className> <method> <name>checkSample</name> <parameters> <type attributeName=\"sampleName\">java.lang.String</type> <type>long[]</type> </parameters> </method> <!--two methods with the same name but different signatures can share one node--> <method> <name>getFirst</name> </method> <method> <name>run</name> </method> </pointcut> <pointcut transactionStartPoint=\"false\" ignoreTransaction=\"false\" excludeFromTransactionTrace=\"false\" metricNameFormat=\"SampleTester/methods\"> <className>test.SampleTester</className> <method> <name>printMaxRepeat</name> </method> <method> <name>printMax</name> </method> </pointcut> </instrumentation> </extension> Copy The first block of the XML file specifies the name and version of the extension. As the XML extension is default enabled, that attribute is not specified. The second block specifies the methods in SampleClass that should be instrumented. A transaction is started at the beginning of the block. It is worth noting that in the example class, there are two methods that share a name (getFirst) but have different signatures. These are instrumented with a single method node. By removing the parameters node, all methods with the same name can be matched under one method node. In the third block, the specified methods do not have a transaction started on them. This is because the transaction has already been started in run. The transaction will not be ignored, and will be included in the transaction trace.",

      "body": "The New Relic Java agent is compatible with Scala, and supports New Relic API calls, annotations, and custom instrumentation. All information below is supplemental to New Relic's Java agent installation directions. Tip For Heroku, see Java agent with Scala on Heroku. Scala frameworks If your framework is not natively supported by New Relic, or if you want to set up additional monitoring, custom instrumentation is a great way to dig deeper into your application. Instrument Scala with the Scala API The New Relic Scala agent API lets you control, customize, and extend the functionality of the APM Java agent using idiomatic Scala code. It can be used alongside the New Relic Java API as well as allow users to Create segments for synchronous and asynchronous anonymous functions Create segments for synchronous and asynchronous code blocks Create a transaction if one has not already been started Important For best results when using the API, ensure that you have the latest Java agent release. The New Relic Scala API requires Java agent 7.1.0 or higher. Use the Scala API To access the API class add the following information to your Scala configuration file: Configure using the project/build.scala file Add the following line (replacing S.V with the Scala version and X.Y.Z with the Java agent version you use) to the appDependencies method in your application's project/build.scala file: \"com.newrelic.agent.java\" % \"newrelic-scala-api_S.V\" % \"X.Y.Z\" Copy Configure using the project/build.sbt file Add the following line (replacing S.V with the Scala version and X.Y.Z with theJava agent version you use) to your application's project/build.sbt file: libraryDependencies += \"com.newrelic.agent.java\" % \"newrelic-scala-api_S.V\" % \"X.Y.Z\" Copy Supported Scala versions are 2.10, 2.11, 2.12 and 2.13. Scala 3.0 users can use the 2.13 jar. The jar is deployed to Maven Central and it is also in the New Relic Java agent's installation zip file. You can call the API when the Java agent is not running. The underlying API methods are just stubs; the implementation is added when the Java agent is running. Segments To create segment for a synchronous code block use TraceOps.trace. For example: import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.trace trace(\"statement segment\") { val i = 1 val j = 2 println(i + j) } // trace can also be used as an expression val x: Int = trace(\"expression segment\") { val i = 1 val j = 2 i + j } println(x) // 2 Copy trace can also be used in Scala For comprehensions import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.trace // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Option[Int] = for { one <- trace(\"segment one\")(Option(1)) two <- trace(\"segment two\")(Option(one + 1)) three <- trace(\"segment three\")(Option(two + 1)) } yield three println(x) // Some(3) Copy If you want to create segment for an asynchronous code block containing a Scala Future use TraceOps.asyncTrace. This will ensure the timing for the segment includes the time taken for the Future to complete. In the example below segment time will be no less than 5 seconds due to the delay created in the wrapped Future. import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.asyncTrace // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = asyncTrace(\"segment name\")(Future { Thread.sleep(5000) 1 }) x.foreach(println) // prints 1 on completion of Future Copy asyncTrace can also be used in Scala For comprehensions import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.asyncTrace // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = for { one <- asyncTrace(\"segment one\")(Future(1)) two <- asyncTrace(\"segment two\")(Future(one + 1)) three <- asyncTrace(\"segment three\")(Future(two + 1)) } yield three x.foreach(println) // prints 3 on completion of Future Copy If you want to create segment for a synchronous anonymous function use TraceOps.traceFun. For example: import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.traceFun val x: Option[Int] = Option(1) .map(traceFun(\"statement segment\")(i => i + 1)) println(x) //Some(2) Copy If you want to create segment for an asynchronous function that returns a Scala Future use TraceOps.asyncTrace. This will ensure the timing for the segment includes the time taken for the function to complete. In the example below segment time will be no less than 5 seconds due to the delay created in the wrapped Future. import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.asyncTraceFun // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = Future(1) .flatMap(asyncTraceFun(\"statement segment\")(i => Future(i + 1))) x.foreach(println) // prints 2 on completion of Future Copy Transactions Transactions can be created using the TraceOps.txn method. For example: import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.txn txn { val i = 1 val j = 2 println(i + j) } Copy txn can be used as a statement (as above) or as an expression import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.txn val i: Int = txn(1 + 2) //transaction created println(i) // 3 Copy txn can be used with any of the TraceOp methods to create segments. The example below create a transaction with 3 segments. import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.{txn, asyncTrace} // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = txn( for { one <- asyncTrace(\"segment one\")(Future(1)) two <- asyncTrace(\"segment two\")(Future(one + 1)) three <- asyncTrace(\"segment three\")(Future(two + 1)) } yield three ) x.foreach(println) // prints 3 on completion of Future Copy Instrument Scala with the Java agent API Instrument Scala to use the New Relic API class or annotations. Add the following information to your Scala configuration file: Configure using the project/build.scala file Add the following line (replacing X.Y.Z with the Java agent version you use) to the appDependencies method in your application's project/build.scala file: \"com.newrelic.agent.java\" % \"newrelic-api\" % \"X.Y.Z\" Copy Configure using the project/build.sbt file Add the following line (replacing X.Y.Z with the Java agent version you use) to your application's project/build.sbt file: libraryDependencies += \"com.newrelic.agent.java\" % \"newrelic-api\" % \"X.Y.Z\" Copy Import the NewRelic class and use it in your application: import com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic ... NewRelic.setTransactionName(null, \"/myTransaction\"); Copy More API functions For more about the Java agent API and its functionality, see the Java agent API introduction. Instrument Scala with XML instrumentation XML instrumentation is available for any Scala application running with the Java agent. It allows instrumentation to be added without any changes to the code. For more information, see Java instrumentation by XML.

      "body": "New Relic's .NET agent supports both .NET Framework and .NET Core. This document describes compatibility and support for .NET Core applications. See Compatibility and requirements for .NET Framework for .NET Framework applications. New Relic's .NET agent includes built-in instrumentation for some of the most popular parts of the .NET Core ecosystem, including frameworks, databases, and message queuing systems. After installation, the agent runs within the monitored process; there is not a separate process or service created by the agent. For frameworks and libraries that are not automatically instrumented out of the box, you can extend the agent with .NET custom instrumentation. Requirements Before you install the New Relic .NET agent on Windows or Linux, make sure your system meets these requirements: Microsoft .NET Core version The .NET agent supports .NET Core versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 3.0, 3.1, and .NET 5.0. Table of minimum agent versions required per .NET Core version .NET Core Version Minimum Required .NET Agent Version .NET Core 2.0 > = 8.19.353.0 .NET Core 2.1 > = 8.19.353.0 .NET Core 2.2 > = 8.19.353.0 .NET Core 3.0 > = 8.21.34.0 .NET Core 3.1 > = 8.21.34.0 .NET 5.0 > = 8.35.0 The agent is not compatible with .NET Core versions 1.0 or 1.1. For .NET Core 2.1 or higher applications with tiered compilation enabled, the agent will disable tiered compilation. .NET Core 2.1 support requires .NET Core runtime 2.1.3 and .NET Core SDK 2.1.401 or higher due to a bug in the .NET Core profiling API. Target framework version The .NET agent only supports applications targeting .NET Core 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 3.0, 3.1, and NET 5.0. You can find the target framework in your .csproj file: Supported: <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.0</TargetFramework> Copy <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework> Copy <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.2</TargetFramework> Copy <TargetFramework>netcoreapp3.0</TargetFramework> Copy <TargetFramework>netcoreapp3.1</TargetFramework> Copy <TargetFramework>net5.0</TargetFramework> Copy Unsupported: <TargetFramework>net452</TargetFramework> Copy Important If you want to monitor an ASP.NET Core application targeting .NET Framework, ensure your install of the .NET agent has .NET Framework support enabled. App/web servers Ensure you use one of these app/web servers: Kestrel Kestrel with IIS reverse proxy via AspNetCoreModule Kestrel with IIS reverse proxy via AspNetCoreModuleV2 Kestrel with Nginx reverse proxy Kestrel with Apache reverse proxy Operating system The agent has been verified to work with the following operating systems: Operating system Supported versions Windows (32- and 64-bit Intel compatible architectures) Server 2008 R2 SP1 Server 2012 Server 2012 R2 Server 2016 Server 2019 Windows containers running on Server 2016 (NanoServer based images are not supported) Linux (64-bit Intel compatible only) All x64 Linux distributions supported by the .NET Core 2.0+/.NET 5 runtime are supported by the .NET agent. For a full list, refer to Microsoft's documentation for the version of the runtime you are using. Microsoft Azure For Azure-specific installation instructions, see: Install on Azure Cloud Services Install on Azure Service Fabric Install on Azure Web Apps Processor architectures The agent is available in both 32-bit (x86) and 64-bit (x64) versions on Windows as well as 64-bit (x64) on Linux. Permissions Installing and running the .NET agent requires these permissions: Component Necessary permissions Install the agent The process or user that installs the agent must have sufficient permissions to set environment variables and write access to the directory where the agent is installed. Run the agent The monitored process must have read/write access to the directory in which you installed the agent. The agent runs as a part of the monitored process and relies on those permissions to function. For applications using IIS via reverse proxy, the group IIS_IUSRS is often used. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Network requirements The agent requires your firewall to allow outgoing connections to specific networks and ports. Automatic instrumentation If your application is hosted in ASP.NET Core, the agent automatically creates and instruments transactions. The .NET agent will automatically instrument your application after install. If your app is not automatically instrumented, or if you want to add instrumentation, use custom instrumentation. App frameworks The .NET agent automatically instruments these application frameworks: ASP.NET Core MVC 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 3.0, 3.1, and 5.0 (includes Web API) Datastores The .NET agent automatically instruments the performance of .NET application calls to these datastores: Datastore Instance details Notes Microsoft SQL Server Use System.Data.SqlClient version 4.3.1 or Microsoft.Data.SqlClient. PostgresSQL Use Npgsql 4.0. Prior versions of Npgsql may also be instrumented, but duplicate and/or missing metrics are possible. MongoDB Use driver version 2.3.x, 2.4.x, 2.5.x, or 2.6.x. Driver version 2.7.x: The .NET agent will support pre-existing API methods, but not new methods introduced in 2.7.x. MySQL Use MySql.Data version 6.10.4. or the MySQL Connector StackExchange.Redis The .NET agent does not directly monitor datastore processes. Also, the .NET SQL parameter capture in a query trace does not list parameters for a parameterized query or a stored procedure. Collecting instance details for supported datastores is enabled by default. To request instance-level information from datastores not currently listed, get support at support.newrelic.com. External call libraries The .NET agent automatically instruments these external call libraries : Libraries Supported methods HttpClient The agent instruments these HttpClient methods: SendAsync GetAsync PostAsync PutAsync DeleteAsync GetStringAsync GetStreamAsync GetByteArrayAsync Messaging The agent automatically instruments these message systems: RabbitMQ 5.1.0 or higher: Puts and takes on messages and queue purge. When receiving messages using an IBasicConsumer, the EventingBasicConsumer is the only implementation that is instrumented by the .NET agent. BasicGet is instrumented, but the agent does not support distributed tracing for BasicGet. Unavailable features The following features are not available for the .NET agent: Memory usage on Linux due to an ongoing .NET Core issue (try using .NET performance metrics to get this information) Automatic brower monitoring script injection (API or manual instrumentation is required) The .NET agent does not support trim self-contained deployments and executables, because the compiler can potentially trim assemblies that the agent depends on. Infinite Tracing is not supported on Alpine Linux due to a GRPC compatibility issue. See this agent issue for more information. Connect the agent to other New Relic products In addition to APM, the .NET agent integrates with other New Relic products to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The browser monitoring JavaScript agent will not be injected by the .NET agent for ASP.NET core applications. However, you can inject the browser agent by using the .NET agent API or the browser agent's copy/paste method. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see browser monitoring and the .NET agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. Dashboards The .NET agent sends default events and attributes for NRQL queries. You can also record custom events for advanced analysis.",

Guided install EU Guided install In addition to the .NET agent, you can use this to install our infrastructure agent to discover other applications, infrastructure, and log sources running in your environment and recommend which ones should be instrumented. The install automates the configuration and deployment of each system you choose to instrument. Install the agent Before you install the .NET agent, create your New Relic account. Then, review the requirements for .NET Framework or the requirements for .NET Core. When you are ready to install, use our launcher, or see the install instructions appropriate for your operating system: Windows or Linux. Add .NET data Tip To stay up-to-date with new features and bug fixes, see the .NET agent release notes. After you install the agent and wait a few minutes for your app to generate traffic, data will appear in the APM Summary page. If no data appears, or if you encounter other problems, see New Relic's .NET agent troubleshooting procedures. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Summary: After installing the .NET agent, you will see a summary of your app's performance on the Summary page. Configure the agent The most important part of agent configuration is to give your app a descriptive name. New Relic uses this app name to aggregate metrics when you have multiple apps or hosts. The agent also includes a variety of configuration options to further customize your installation. Extend your instrumentation After installing the .NET agent, extend the agent's instrumentation with one or more of these methods: Instrumentation options Details Browser instrumentation Integrate the .NET agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user activity. ASP.NET apps (.NET Framework only): Use any of the available options to install the browser agent. ASP.NET Core apps (targeting .NET Core or .NET Framework): Use either the API method or the copy/paste method to inject the browser agent into your webpages. Custom instrumentation Instrument transactions not captured as part of New Relic's automatic framework instrumentation. Agent API See the .NET agent API guide to learn how to customize the agent's behavior. For example, you can collect custom metrics, flag an error, or ignore a particular transaction entirely. Custom attributes Customize the attributes attached to transactions. Customizing attributes allows you to avoid sending sensitive attributes, or to collect additional attributes for deeper visibility into your transactions. Distributed tracing Enable distributed tracing to understand activity across a complex, distributed system that uses many services and microservices. Open source telemetry Explore these tools: OpenTelemetry exporter and .NET Telemetry SDK. Check the source code The .NET agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "Our .NET agent supports both .NET Framework and .NET Core. Here we describe the compatibility and support for .NET Framework applications. For .NET Core, see Compatibility and requirements for .NET Core. The agent includes built-in instrumentation for some of the most popular parts of the .NET Framework ecosystem, including frameworks, databases, and message queuing systems. After you download and install the agent, it runs within the monitored process. The agent does not create a separate process or service. For frameworks and libraries that are not automatically instrumented, you can extend the agent with .NET custom instrumentation. Requirements Before you install New Relic's .NET agent, make sure your system meets these requirements: .NET Framework version .NET Framework 4.5 or higher .NET Framework 4.5 or higher requires the New Relic .NET agent version 7.0 or higher. .NET Framework 4.0 or lower To instrument applications running on .NET Framework version 4.0 and lower, you must run a version of the New Relic .NET agent earlier than 7.0. For more information and download procedures, see Technical support for .NET frameworks 4.0 or earlier. Here are additional details about .NET Framework versions 4.0 and lower: .NET Framework version Notes .NET Framework 2.0 Unless you have installed only .NET Framework 4.0 or higher, you must have .NET Framework version 3.5 installed on the target host, in addition to any other .NET Framework versions you have installed. .NET Framework 3.0 Unless you have installed only .NET Framework 4.0 or higher, you must have .NET Framework version 3.5 installed on the target host, in addition to any other .NET Framework versions you have installed. .NET Framework 3.5 Fully supported by .NET agent versions below 7.0. .NET Framework 4.0 Fully supported by .NET agent versions below 7.0. If you use .NET Framework 1.1 for any app on your target system, you must disable instrumentation of that app with applicationPool set to instrument=\"false\". The .NET agent can cause crashes in .NET 1.1 apps. App/web servers You must use one of these app/web servers: IIS Self-hosted OWIN Self-hosted WCF Kestrel Kestrel with IIS reverse proxy via AspNetCoreModule Kestrel with IIS reverse proxy via AspNetCoreModuleV2 The agent automatically creates transactions for apps hosted in IIS. If you self-host with WCF and OWIN version 3 or higher, the agent also automatically creates transactions. For other self-hosted services, you will need to create transactions via custom instrumentation. CLRs The agent requires CLR version 4.0. Legacy applications running on CLR 2.0 can be instrumented with agent versions earlier than 7.0. Operating system The agent requires one of these operating systems: Windows Server 2008 Windows Server 2008 R2 Windows Server 2012 Windows Server 2012 R2 Windows Server 2016 Windows Server 2019 Windows 10 Windows Azure (OS Family 1, 2, and 3) Windows containers running on Windows 2016 (NanoServer based images are not supported) Use of other monitoring software The .NET Common Language Runtime (CLR) only allows one profiler to access the profiling API of a process at any given time. Running our .NET agent alongside other monitoring software will result in a profiler conflict. For more information, see Errors while using other APM software. Microsoft Azure For Azure-specific installation instructions, see: Install on Azure Cloud Services Install on Azure Service Fabric Install on Azure Web Apps Processor architectures The agent is available in both a 32-bit and 64-bit version. On 64-bit systems, the 64-bit agent can instrument both 32-bit and 64-bit applications. Permissions Installation requires elevated privileges (Administrator). For example, you can: Be logged in as an administrator user. Be a member of the Administrators group. On newer operating systems, provide elevation credentials when prompted. The monitored process must have read/write access to the directory in which the agent is installed. The agent runs as a part of the monitored process and relies on those permissions to function. Recommendation: Restrict permissions for the newrelic.config file and give read/write access only to the owner of the monitored process. Review permissions for the logs created by the agent to minimize the number of users with access and their privileges. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Code Access Security The use of Code Access Security is compatible with the .NET agent only when Full Trust is provided. The agent is not compatible with more restrictive trust levels. Network requirements The agent requires your firewall to allow outgoing connections to specific networks and ports. Application lifespan The .NET agent uploads data at the end of each harvest cycle (once per minute). If your .NET app doesn't run that long, you can set the service element's sendDataOnExit attribute to true in the newrelic.config file. Automatic instrumentation If your application is hosted in ASP.NET or another fully supported framework, the .NET agent will automatically instrument your application after install. If your app is not automatically instrumented, or if you want to add instrumentation, use custom instrumentation. The .NET agent does not directly monitor datastore processes. Also, by default the .NET SQL parameter capture in a query trace does not list parameters for a parameterized query or a stored procedure. Collection of the SQL query parameters can be enabled in the agent configuration. App frameworks The agent automatically instruments some application frameworks; we refer to these frameworks as fully supported. Compatibility status .NET app frameworks Fully supported These frameworks are fully supported: ASP.NET MVC 2 ASP.NET MVC 3 ASP.NET MVC 4 ASP.NET MVC 5 ASP.NET Web API v2 ASP.NET Core MVC 2.0 ASP.NET Core 2.1 ASP.NET Core 2.2 ASP.NET Web Forms Castle MonoRail v2 (not the same as Mono) OWIN-hosted web API applications on .NET framework using: Microsoft.Owin.Host.HttpListener v2.x Microsoft.Owin.Host.HttpListener v3.x Microsoft.Owin.Host.HttpListener v4.x SOAP-based web services WCF Hosting Models IIS Hosted (with and without ASP Compatibility) Self Hosted Binding Types (both client and service) WCF Instrumentation has been tested for the following common binding types. Varying levels of support are available for distributed tracing (DT) and cross application tracing (CAT): Binding Distributed Tracing (DT) Support Cross Application Tracing (CAT) Support BasicHTTP supported supported WebHTTP supported supported WSHTTP supported supported NetTCP supported supported NetNamedPipe not supported * not supported * NetMSMQ not supported * not supported * * Distributed tracing may be manually implemented using these Distributed Tracing API methods. Invocation Methods (both client and service) Synchronous Asynchronous Processing Model (APM) Begin/End Task Asynchronous Processing (TAP) Event-based Asynchronous Processing (EAP) Client support only. Not fully supported These frameworks are not fully supported: ASP.NET Web API v1: See the troubleshooting information about using ASP.NET Web API v1 with New Relic's .NET agent 5.0 or higher for apps targeting .NET Framework 4.0. (This does not affect .NET Framework 4.5 or higher.) Mono: New Relic does not support Mono, an open-source .NET framework that runs on Linux. This is because there is no Profiler API to inject into the .NET agent as a profiler into Mono-based .NET applications. The Profiler API is a Component Object Model (COM)-based interface and is not supported on Linux. Not supported Classic ASP is not supported, because the agent can only instrument .NET Framework-based apps. Sharepoint is not supported. Datastores Collecting instance details for supported datastores requires .NET agent version 6.5.29.0 or higher and is enabled by default. To request instance-level information from datastores not currently listed, get support at support.newrelic.com. In order to automatically instrument the performance of .NET Framework application calls to these datastores, make sure you have the .NET agent version 8.14 or higher: Datastore Instance details Other notes Couchbase SDK version 2.x.x (2.4.0 or higher is not supported). With Couchbase, the following are not instrumented by default in favor of their multi-document counterparts: Get(string key) GetDocument(string key) Remove(string key) Remove(string key, ulong cas) Upsert<T>(string key, T value) IBM DB2 Microsoft SQL Server MongoDB We support both the modern and legacy MongoDB drivers. Legacy - mongocsharpdriver Driver versions 1.10.0 or earlier: Instance details are not available in these driver versions. Modern - MongoDB.Driver Driver version 2.3.x, 2.4.x, 2.5.x, or 2.6.x Driver version 2.7.x: The .NET agent will support pre-existing API methods, but not new methods introduced in 2.7.x. MySQL Use MySql.Data version 6.10.4. or the MySQL Connector Oracle PostgreSQL Use Npgsql 4.0. Prior versions of Npgsql may also be instrumented, but duplicate and/or missing metrics are possible. ServiceStack.Redis StackExchange.Redis Messaging The agent automatically instruments these message systems: MSMQ: Puts and takes on messages NServiceBus 5.0 (6.0 or higher not supported): Puts and takes on messages and cross application tracing RabbitMQ 3.5 or higher: Puts and takes on messages and queue purge. When receiving messages using an IBasicConsumer, the EventingBasicConsumer is the only implementation that is instrumented by the .NET agent. BasicGet is instrumented, but the agent does not support distributed tracing for BasicGet. CMS The agent automatically instruments the EPiServer content management system. External call libraries The agent automatically instruments these external call libraries : Libraries Supported methods HttpClient The agent instruments these HttpClient methods: SendAsync GetAsync PostAsync PutAsync DeleteAsync GetStringAsync GetStreamAsync GetByteArrayAsync RestSharp The agent instruments these RestSharp methods: ExecuteTaskAsync ExecuteGetTaskAsync ExecutePostTaskAsync Execute ExecuteAsGet ExecuteAsPost DownloadData HttpWebRequest The agent instruments these HttpWebRequest methods: GetResponse Connect the agent to other New Relic products In addition to APM, the agent integrates with other New Relic products to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring For ASP.NET applications, the .NET agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the .NET agent. Automatic browser injection is not supported for ASP.NET core applications. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. Dashboards The .NET agent sends default events and attributes for NRQL queries. You can also record custom events for advanced analysis. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from Synthetics monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

For frameworks and libraries that are not automatically instrumented out of the box, you can extend the agent with .NET custom instrumentation. Requirements Before you install the New Relic .NET agent on Windows or Linux, make sure your system meets these requirements: Microsoft .NET Core version The .NET agent supports .NET Core versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 3.0, 3.1, and .NET 5.0. Table of minimum agent versions required per .NET Core version .NET Core Version Minimum Required .NET Agent Version .NET Core 2.0 > = 8.19.353.0 .NET Core 2.1 > = 8.19.353.0 .NET Core 2.2 > = 8.19.353.0 .NET Core 3.0 > = 8.21.34.0 .NET Core 3.1 > = 8.21.34.0 .NET 5.0 > = 8.35.0 The agent is not compatible with .NET Core versions 1.0 or 1.1. For .NET Core 2.1 or higher applications with tiered compilation enabled, the agent will disable tiered compilation. .NET Core 2.1 support requires .NET Core runtime 2.1.3 and .NET Core SDK 2.1.401 or higher due to a bug in the .NET Core profiling API. Target framework version The .NET agent only supports applications targeting .NET Core 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 3.0, 3.1, and NET 5.0. You can find the target framework in your .csproj file: Supported: <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.0</TargetFramework> Copy <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework> Copy <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.2</TargetFramework> Copy <TargetFramework>netcoreapp3.0</TargetFramework> Copy <TargetFramework>netcoreapp3.1</TargetFramework> Copy <TargetFramework>net5.0</TargetFramework> Copy Unsupported: <TargetFramework>net452</TargetFramework> Copy Important If you want to monitor an ASP.NET Core application targeting .NET Framework, ensure your install of the .NET agent has .NET Framework support enabled. App/web servers Ensure you use one of these app/web servers: Kestrel Kestrel with IIS reverse proxy via AspNetCoreModule Kestrel with IIS reverse proxy via AspNetCoreModuleV2 Kestrel with Nginx reverse proxy Kestrel with Apache reverse proxy Operating system The agent has been verified to work with the following operating systems: Operating system Supported versions Windows (32- and 64-bit Intel compatible architectures) Server 2008 R2 SP1 Server 2012 Server 2012 R2 Server 2016 Server 2019 Windows containers running on Server 2016 (NanoServer based images are not supported) Linux (64-bit Intel compatible only) All x64 Linux distributions supported by the .NET Core 2.0+/.NET 5 runtime are supported by the .NET agent. For a full list, refer to Microsoft's documentation for the version of the runtime you are using. Microsoft Azure For Azure-specific installation instructions, see: Install on Azure Cloud Services Install on Azure Service Fabric Install on Azure Web Apps Processor architectures The agent is available in both 32-bit (x86) and 64-bit (x64) versions on Windows as well as 64-bit (x64) on Linux. Permissions Installing and running the .NET agent requires these permissions: Component Necessary permissions Install the agent The process or user that installs the agent must have sufficient permissions to set environment variables and write access to the directory where the agent is installed. Run the agent The monitored process must have read/write access to the directory in which you installed the agent. The agent runs as a part of the monitored process and relies on those permissions to function. For applications using IIS via reverse proxy, the group IIS_IUSRS is often used. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Network requirements The agent requires your firewall to allow outgoing connections to specific networks and ports. Automatic instrumentation If your application is hosted in ASP.NET Core, the agent automatically creates and instruments transactions. The .NET agent will automatically instrument your application after install. If your app is not automatically instrumented, or if you want to add instrumentation, use custom instrumentation. App frameworks The .NET agent automatically instruments these application frameworks: ASP.NET Core MVC 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 3.0, 3.1, and 5.0 (includes Web API) Datastores The .NET agent automatically instruments the performance of .NET application calls to these datastores: Datastore Instance details Notes Microsoft SQL Server Use System.Data.SqlClient version 4.3.1 or Microsoft.Data.SqlClient. PostgresSQL Use Npgsql 4.0. Prior versions of Npgsql may also be instrumented, but duplicate and/or missing metrics are possible. MongoDB Use driver version 2.3.x, 2.4.x, 2.5.x, or 2.6.x. Driver version 2.7.x: The .NET agent will support pre-existing API methods, but not new methods introduced in 2.7.x. MySQL Use MySql.Data version 6.10.4. or the MySQL Connector StackExchange.Redis The .NET agent does not directly monitor datastore processes. Also, the .NET SQL parameter capture in a query trace does not list parameters for a parameterized query or a stored procedure. Collecting instance details for supported datastores is enabled by default. To request instance-level information from datastores not currently listed, get support at support.newrelic.com.

When receiving messages using an IBasicConsumer, the EventingBasicConsumer is the only implementation that is instrumented by the .NET agent. BasicGet is instrumented, but the agent does not support distributed tracing for BasicGet. Unavailable features The following features are not available for the .NET agent: Memory usage on Linux due to an ongoing .NET Core issue (try using .NET performance metrics to get this information) Automatic brower monitoring script injection (API or manual instrumentation is required) The .NET agent does not support trim self-contained deployments and executables, because the compiler can potentially trim assemblies that the agent depends on. Infinite Tracing is not supported on Alpine Linux due to a GRPC compatibility issue. See this agent issue for more information. Connect the agent to other New Relic products In addition to APM, the .NET agent integrates with other New Relic products to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The browser monitoring JavaScript agent will not be injected by the .NET agent for ASP.NET core applications. However, you can inject the browser agent by using the .NET agent API or the browser agent's copy/paste method. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see browser monitoring and the .NET agent.

Here are additional details about .NET Framework versions 4.0 and lower: .NET Framework version Notes .NET Framework 2.0 Unless you have installed only .NET Framework 4.0 or higher, you must have .NET Framework version 3.5 installed on the target host, in addition to any other .NET Framework versions you have installed. .NET Framework 3.0 Unless you have installed only .NET Framework 4.0 or higher, you must have .NET Framework version 3.5 installed on the target host, in addition to any other .NET Framework versions you have installed. .NET Framework 3.5 Fully supported by .NET agent versions below 7.0. .NET Framework 4.0 Fully supported by .NET agent versions below 7.0. If you use .NET Framework 1.1 for any app on your target system, you must disable instrumentation of that app with applicationPool set to instrument=\"false\". The .NET agent can cause crashes in .NET 1.1 apps. App/web servers You must use one of these app/web servers: IIS Self-hosted OWIN Self-hosted WCF Kestrel Kestrel with IIS reverse proxy via AspNetCoreModule Kestrel with IIS reverse proxy via AspNetCoreModuleV2 The agent automatically creates transactions for apps hosted in IIS. If you self-host with WCF and OWIN version 3 or higher, the agent also automatically creates transactions. For other self-hosted services, you will need to create transactions via custom instrumentation. CLRs The agent requires CLR version 4.0. Legacy applications running on CLR 2.0 can be instrumented with agent versions earlier than 7.0. Operating system The agent requires one of these operating systems: Windows Server 2008 Windows Server 2008 R2 Windows Server 2012 Windows Server 2012 R2 Windows Server 2016 Windows Server 2019 Windows 10 Windows Azure (OS Family 1, 2, and 3) Windows containers running on Windows 2016 (NanoServer based images are not supported) Use of other monitoring software The .NET Common Language Runtime (CLR) only allows one profiler to access the profiling API of a process at any given time. Running our .NET agent alongside other monitoring software will result in a profiler conflict. For more information, see Errors while using other APM software. Microsoft Azure For Azure-specific installation instructions, see: Install on Azure Cloud Services Install on Azure Service Fabric Install on Azure Web Apps Processor architectures The agent is available in both a 32-bit and 64-bit version. On 64-bit systems, the 64-bit agent can instrument both 32-bit and 64-bit applications. Permissions Installation requires elevated privileges (Administrator). For example, you can: Be logged in as an administrator user. Be a member of the Administrators group. On newer operating systems, provide elevation credentials when prompted. The monitored process must have read/write access to the directory in which the agent is installed. The agent runs as a part of the monitored process and relies on those permissions to function. Recommendation: Restrict permissions for the newrelic.config file and give read/write access only to the owner of the monitored process. Review permissions for the logs created by the agent to minimize the number of users with access and their privileges. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Code Access Security The use of Code Access Security is compatible with the .NET agent only when Full Trust is provided. The agent is not compatible with more restrictive trust levels. Network requirements The agent requires your firewall to allow outgoing connections to specific networks and ports. Application lifespan The .NET agent uploads data at the end of each harvest cycle (once per minute). If your .NET app doesn't run that long, you can set the service element's sendDataOnExit attribute to true in the newrelic.config file. Automatic instrumentation If your application is hosted in ASP.NET or another fully supported framework, the .NET agent will automatically instrument your application after install. If your app is not automatically instrumented, or if you want to add instrumentation, use custom instrumentation. The .NET agent does not directly monitor datastore processes. Also, by default the .NET SQL parameter capture in a query trace does not list parameters for a parameterized query or a stored procedure. Collection of the SQL query parameters can be enabled in the agent configuration. App frameworks The agent automatically instruments some application frameworks; we refer to these frameworks as fully supported. Compatibility status .NET app frameworks Fully supported These frameworks are fully supported: ASP.NET MVC 2 ASP.NET MVC 3 ASP.NET MVC 4 ASP.NET MVC 5 ASP.NET Web API v2 ASP.NET Core MVC 2.0 ASP.NET Core 2.1 ASP.NET Core 2.2 ASP.NET Web Forms Castle MonoRail v2 (not the same as Mono) OWIN-hosted web API applications on .NET framework using: Microsoft.Owin.Host.HttpListener v2.x Microsoft.Owin.Host.HttpListener v3.x Microsoft.Owin.Host.HttpListener v4.x SOAP-based web services WCF Hosting Models IIS Hosted (with and without ASP Compatibility) Self Hosted Binding Types (both client and service) WCF Instrumentation has been tested for the following common binding types. Varying levels of support are available for distributed tracing (DT) and cross application tracing (CAT): Binding Distributed Tracing (DT) Support Cross Application Tracing (CAT) Support BasicHTTP supported supported WebHTTP supported supported WSHTTP supported supported NetTCP supported supported NetNamedPipe not supported * not supported * NetMSMQ not supported * not supported * * Distributed tracing may be manually implemented using these Distributed Tracing API methods. Invocation Methods (both client and service) Synchronous Asynchronous Processing Model (APM) Begin/End Task Asynchronous Processing (TAP) Event-based Asynchronous Processing (EAP) Client support only. Not fully supported These frameworks are not fully supported: ASP.NET Web API v1: See the troubleshooting information about using ASP.NET Web API v1 with New Relic's .NET agent 5.0 or higher for apps targeting .NET Framework 4.0. (This does not affect .NET Framework 4.5 or higher.) Mono: New Relic does not support Mono, an open-source .NET framework that runs on Linux. This is because there is no Profiler API to inject into the .NET agent as a profiler into Mono-based .NET applications. The Profiler API is a Component Object Model (COM)-based interface and is not supported on Linux. Not supported Classic ASP is not supported, because the agent can only instrument .NET Framework-based apps. Sharepoint is not supported. Datastores Collecting instance details for supported datastores requires .NET agent version 6.5.29.0 or higher and is enabled by default. To request instance-level information from datastores not currently listed, get support at support.newrelic.com. In order to automatically instrument the performance of .NET Framework application calls to these datastores, make sure you have the .NET agent version 8.14 or higher: Datastore Instance details Other notes Couchbase SDK version 2.x.x (2.4.0 or higher is not supported). With Couchbase, the following are not instrumented by default in favor of their multi-document counterparts: Get(string key) GetDocument(string key) Remove(string key) Remove(string key, ulong cas) Upsert<T>(string key, T value) IBM DB2 Microsoft SQL Server MongoDB We support both the modern and legacy MongoDB drivers. Legacy - mongocsharpdriver Driver versions 1.10.0 or earlier: Instance details are not available in these driver versions. Modern - MongoDB.Driver Driver version 2.3.x, 2.4.x, 2.5.x, or 2.6.x Driver version 2.7.x: The .NET agent will support pre-existing API methods, but not new methods introduced in 2.7.x. MySQL Use MySql.Data version 6.10.4. or the MySQL Connector Oracle PostgreSQL Use Npgsql 4.0. Prior versions of Npgsql may also be instrumented, but duplicate and/or missing metrics are possible. ServiceStack.Redis StackExchange.Redis Messaging The agent automatically instruments these message systems: MSMQ: Puts and takes on messages NServiceBus 5.0 (6.0 or higher not supported): Puts and takes on messages and cross application tracing RabbitMQ 3.5 or higher: Puts and takes on messages and queue purge. When receiving messages using an IBasicConsumer, the EventingBasicConsumer is the only implementation that is instrumented by the .NET agent. BasicGet is instrumented, but the agent does not support distributed tracing for BasicGet. CMS The agent automatically instruments the EPiServer content management system. External call libraries The agent automatically instruments these external call libraries : Libraries Supported methods HttpClient The agent instruments these HttpClient methods: SendAsync GetAsync PostAsync PutAsync DeleteAsync GetStringAsync GetStreamAsync GetByteArrayAsync RestSharp The agent instruments these RestSharp methods: ExecuteTaskAsync ExecuteGetTaskAsync ExecutePostTaskAsync Execute ExecuteAsGet ExecuteAsPost DownloadData HttpWebRequest The agent instruments these HttpWebRequest methods: GetResponse Connect the agent to other New Relic products In addition to APM, the agent integrates with other New Relic products to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring For ASP.NET applications, the .NET agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the .NET agent. Automatic browser injection is not supported for ASP.NET core applications. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. Dashboards The .NET agent sends default events and attributes for NRQL queries. You can also record custom events for advanced analysis. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from Synthetics monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

Get proactive notifications from alerts to ensure your app is up and running smoothly. Use the query builder to query your data and create custom dashboards with that data. Install infrastructure monitoring to view the performance of your app's host environment. Tip To use .NET or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Support for both .NET Framework and .NET Core New Relic's .NET agent supports both .NET Framework and .NET Core, and it works with all .NET compatible languages, such as VB.NET, C#, and CLI. The agent's support for .NET Core takes advantage of the compatibility, speed, expanded API features, and cross-platform capabilities of Microsoft's .NET Core. The agent does not support Microsoft .NET Core versions earlier than 2.0. With New Relic's support for .NET, you can monitor your apps in dynamic or distributed environments, such as: Cloud-managed server VM images On-host VM servers Microsoft Azure App Services Self-hosted Windows and Linux systems Amazon AWS EC2 VMs Install the agent on Windows with our guided install Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the .NET agent for Windows IIS applications. Ready to get started? Click the Guided install button. If your account reports data through our EU datacenter, click EU Guided install. Guided install EU Guided install In addition to the .NET agent, you can use this to install our infrastructure agent to discover other applications, infrastructure, and log sources running in your environment and recommend which ones should be instrumented. The install automates the configuration and deployment of each system you choose to instrument. Install the agent Before you install the .NET agent, create your New Relic account. Then, review the requirements for .NET Framework or the requirements for .NET Core. When you are ready to install, use our launcher, or see the install instructions appropriate for your operating system: Windows or Linux. Add .NET data Tip To stay up-to-date with new features and bug fixes, see the .NET agent release notes. After you install the agent and wait a few minutes for your app to generate traffic, data will appear in the APM Summary page. If no data appears, or if you encounter other problems, see New Relic's .NET agent troubleshooting procedures. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Summary: After installing the .NET agent, you will see a summary of your app's performance on the Summary page. Configure the agent The most important part of agent configuration is to give your app a descriptive name. New Relic uses this app name to aggregate metrics when you have multiple apps or hosts. The agent also includes a variety of configuration options to further customize your installation. Extend your instrumentation After installing the .NET agent, extend the agent's instrumentation with one or more of these methods: Instrumentation options Details Browser instrumentation Integrate the .NET agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user activity. ASP.NET apps (.NET Framework only): Use any of the available options to install the browser agent. ASP.NET Core apps (targeting .NET Core or .NET Framework): Use either the API method or the copy/paste method to inject the browser agent into your webpages. Custom instrumentation Instrument transactions not captured as part of New Relic's automatic framework instrumentation. Agent API See the .NET agent API guide to learn how to customize the agent's behavior. For example, you can collect custom metrics, flag an error, or ignore a particular transaction entirely. Custom attributes Customize the attributes attached to transactions. Customizing attributes allows you to avoid sending sensitive attributes, or to collect additional attributes for deeper visibility into your transactions. Distributed tracing Enable distributed tracing to understand activity across a complex, distributed system that uses many services and microservices. Open source telemetry Explore these tools: OpenTelemetry exporter and .NET Telemetry SDK. Check the source code The .NET agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "Our .NET agent supports both .NET Framework and .NET Core. Here we describe the compatibility and support for .NET Framework applications. For .NET Core, see Compatibility and requirements for .NET Core. The agent includes built-in instrumentation for some of the most popular parts of the .NET Framework ecosystem, including frameworks, databases, and message queuing systems. After you download and install the agent, it runs within the monitored process. The agent does not create a separate process or service. For frameworks and libraries that are not automatically instrumented, you can extend the agent with .NET custom instrumentation. Requirements Before you install New Relic's .NET agent, make sure your system meets these requirements: .NET Framework version .NET Framework 4.5 or higher .NET Framework 4.5 or higher requires the New Relic .NET agent version 7.0 or higher. .NET Framework 4.0 or lower To instrument applications running on .NET Framework version 4.0 and lower, you must run a version of the New Relic .NET agent earlier than 7.0. For more information and download procedures, see Technical support for .NET frameworks 4.0 or earlier. Here are additional details about .NET Framework versions 4.0 and lower: .NET Framework version Notes .NET Framework 2.0 Unless you have installed only .NET Framework 4.0 or higher, you must have .NET Framework version 3.5 installed on the target host, in addition to any other .NET Framework versions you have installed. .NET Framework 3.0 Unless you have installed only .NET Framework 4.0 or higher, you must have .NET Framework version 3.5 installed on the target host, in addition to any other .NET Framework versions you have installed. .NET Framework 3.5 Fully supported by .NET agent versions below 7.0. .NET Framework 4.0 Fully supported by .NET agent versions below 7.0. If you use .NET Framework 1.1 for any app on your target system, you must disable instrumentation of that app with applicationPool set to instrument=\"false\". The .NET agent can cause crashes in .NET 1.1 apps. App/web servers You must use one of these app/web servers: IIS Self-hosted OWIN Self-hosted WCF Kestrel Kestrel with IIS reverse proxy via AspNetCoreModule Kestrel with IIS reverse proxy via AspNetCoreModuleV2 The agent automatically creates transactions for apps hosted in IIS. If you self-host with WCF and OWIN version 3 or higher, the agent also automatically creates transactions. For other self-hosted services, you will need to create transactions via custom instrumentation. CLRs The agent requires CLR version 4.0. Legacy applications running on CLR 2.0 can be instrumented with agent versions earlier than 7.0. Operating system The agent requires one of these operating systems: Windows Server 2008 Windows Server 2008 R2 Windows Server 2012 Windows Server 2012 R2 Windows Server 2016 Windows Server 2019 Windows 10 Windows Azure (OS Family 1, 2, and 3) Windows containers running on Windows 2016 (NanoServer based images are not supported) Use of other monitoring software The .NET Common Language Runtime (CLR) only allows one profiler to access the profiling API of a process at any given time. Running our .NET agent alongside other monitoring software will result in a profiler conflict. For more information, see Errors while using other APM software. Microsoft Azure For Azure-specific installation instructions, see: Install on Azure Cloud Services Install on Azure Service Fabric Install on Azure Web Apps Processor architectures The agent is available in both a 32-bit and 64-bit version. On 64-bit systems, the 64-bit agent can instrument both 32-bit and 64-bit applications. Permissions Installation requires elevated privileges (Administrator). For example, you can: Be logged in as an administrator user. Be a member of the Administrators group. On newer operating systems, provide elevation credentials when prompted. The monitored process must have read/write access to the directory in which the agent is installed. The agent runs as a part of the monitored process and relies on those permissions to function. Recommendation: Restrict permissions for the newrelic.config file and give read/write access only to the owner of the monitored process. Review permissions for the logs created by the agent to minimize the number of users with access and their privileges. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Code Access Security The use of Code Access Security is compatible with the .NET agent only when Full Trust is provided. The agent is not compatible with more restrictive trust levels. Network requirements The agent requires your firewall to allow outgoing connections to specific networks and ports. Application lifespan The .NET agent uploads data at the end of each harvest cycle (once per minute). If your .NET app doesn't run that long, you can set the service element's sendDataOnExit attribute to true in the newrelic.config file. Automatic instrumentation If your application is hosted in ASP.NET or another fully supported framework, the .NET agent will automatically instrument your application after install. If your app is not automatically instrumented, or if you want to add instrumentation, use custom instrumentation. The .NET agent does not directly monitor datastore processes. Also, by default the .NET SQL parameter capture in a query trace does not list parameters for a parameterized query or a stored procedure. Collection of the SQL query parameters can be enabled in the agent configuration.

(This does not affect .NET Framework 4.5 or higher.) Mono: New Relic does not support Mono, an open-source .NET framework that runs on Linux. This is because there is no Profiler API to inject into the .NET agent as a profiler into Mono-based .NET applications. The Profiler API is a Component Object Model (COM)-based interface and is not supported on Linux. Not supported Classic ASP is not supported, because the agent can only instrument .NET Framework-based apps. Sharepoint is not supported. Datastores Collecting instance details for supported datastores requires .NET agent version 6.5.29.0 or higher and is enabled by default. To request instance-level information from datastores not currently listed, get support at support.newrelic.com. In order to automatically instrument the performance of .NET Framework application calls to these datastores, make sure you have the .NET agent version 8.14 or higher: Datastore Instance details Other notes Couchbase SDK version 2.x.x (2.4.0 or higher is not supported). With Couchbase, the following are not instrumented by default in favor of their multi-document counterparts: Get(string key) GetDocument(string key) Remove(string key) Remove(string key, ulong cas) Upsert<T>(string key, T value) IBM DB2 Microsoft SQL Server MongoDB We support both the modern and legacy MongoDB drivers. Legacy - mongocsharpdriver Driver versions 1.10.0 or earlier: Instance details are not available in these driver versions. Modern - MongoDB.Driver Driver version 2.3.x, 2.4.x, 2.5.x, or 2.6.x Driver version 2.7.x: The .NET agent will support pre-existing API methods, but not new methods introduced in 2.7.x. MySQL Use MySql.Data version 6.10.4. or the MySQL Connector Oracle PostgreSQL Use Npgsql 4.0. Prior versions of Npgsql may also be instrumented, but duplicate and/or missing metrics are possible. ServiceStack.Redis StackExchange.Redis Messaging The agent automatically instruments these message systems: MSMQ: Puts and takes on messages NServiceBus 5.0 (6.0 or higher not supported): Puts and takes on messages and cross application tracing RabbitMQ 3.5 or higher: Puts and takes on messages and queue purge. When receiving messages using an IBasicConsumer, the EventingBasicConsumer is the only implementation that is instrumented by the .NET agent. BasicGet is instrumented, but the agent does not support distributed tracing for BasicGet. CMS The agent automatically instruments the EPiServer content management system. External call libraries The agent automatically instruments these external call libraries : Libraries Supported methods HttpClient The agent instruments these HttpClient methods: SendAsync GetAsync PostAsync PutAsync DeleteAsync GetStringAsync GetStreamAsync GetByteArrayAsync RestSharp The agent instruments these RestSharp methods: ExecuteTaskAsync ExecuteGetTaskAsync ExecutePostTaskAsync Execute ExecuteAsGet ExecuteAsPost DownloadData HttpWebRequest The agent instruments these HttpWebRequest methods: GetResponse Connect the agent to other New Relic products In addition to APM, the agent integrates with other New Relic products to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring For ASP.NET applications, the .NET agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the .NET agent. Automatic browser injection is not supported for ASP.NET core applications. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. Dashboards The .NET agent sends default events and attributes for NRQL queries. You can also record custom events for advanced analysis. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from Synthetics monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

      "body": "New Relic's .NET agent supports both .NET Framework and .NET Core. This document describes compatibility and support for .NET Core applications. See Compatibility and requirements for .NET Framework for .NET Framework applications. New Relic's .NET agent includes built-in instrumentation for some of the most popular parts of the .NET Core ecosystem, including frameworks, databases, and message queuing systems. After installation, the agent runs within the monitored process; there is not a separate process or service created by the agent. For frameworks and libraries that are not automatically instrumented out of the box, you can extend the agent with .NET custom instrumentation. Requirements Before you install the New Relic .NET agent on Windows or Linux, make sure your system meets these requirements: Microsoft .NET Core version The .NET agent supports .NET Core versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 3.0, 3.1, and .NET 5.0. Table of minimum agent versions required per .NET Core version .NET Core Version Minimum Required .NET Agent Version .NET Core 2.0 > = 8.19.353.0 .NET Core 2.1 > = 8.19.353.0 .NET Core 2.2 > = 8.19.353.0 .NET Core 3.0 > = 8.21.34.0 .NET Core 3.1 > = 8.21.34.0 .NET 5.0 > = 8.35.0 The agent is not compatible with .NET Core versions 1.0 or 1.1. For .NET Core 2.1 or higher applications with tiered compilation enabled, the agent will disable tiered compilation. .NET Core 2.1 support requires .NET Core runtime 2.1.3 and .NET Core SDK 2.1.401 or higher due to a bug in the .NET Core profiling API. Target framework version The .NET agent only supports applications targeting .NET Core 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 3.0, 3.1, and NET 5.0. You can find the target framework in your .csproj file: Supported: <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.0</TargetFramework> Copy <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework> Copy <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.2</TargetFramework> Copy <TargetFramework>netcoreapp3.0</TargetFramework> Copy <TargetFramework>netcoreapp3.1</TargetFramework> Copy <TargetFramework>net5.0</TargetFramework> Copy Unsupported: <TargetFramework>net452</TargetFramework> Copy Important If you want to monitor an ASP.NET Core application targeting .NET Framework, ensure your install of the .NET agent has .NET Framework support enabled. App/web servers Ensure you use one of these app/web servers: Kestrel Kestrel with IIS reverse proxy via AspNetCoreModule Kestrel with IIS reverse proxy via AspNetCoreModuleV2 Kestrel with Nginx reverse proxy Kestrel with Apache reverse proxy Operating system The agent has been verified to work with the following operating systems: Operating system Supported versions Windows (32- and 64-bit Intel compatible architectures) Server 2008 R2 SP1 Server 2012 Server 2012 R2 Server 2016 Server 2019 Windows containers running on Server 2016 (NanoServer based images are not supported) Linux (64-bit Intel compatible only) All x64 Linux distributions supported by the .NET Core 2.0+/.NET 5 runtime are supported by the .NET agent. For a full list, refer to Microsoft's documentation for the version of the runtime you are using. Microsoft Azure For Azure-specific installation instructions, see: Install on Azure Cloud Services Install on Azure Service Fabric Install on Azure Web Apps Processor architectures The agent is available in both 32-bit (x86) and 64-bit (x64) versions on Windows as well as 64-bit (x64) on Linux. Permissions Installing and running the .NET agent requires these permissions: Component Necessary permissions Install the agent The process or user that installs the agent must have sufficient permissions to set environment variables and write access to the directory where the agent is installed. Run the agent The monitored process must have read/write access to the directory in which you installed the agent. The agent runs as a part of the monitored process and relies on those permissions to function. For applications using IIS via reverse proxy, the group IIS_IUSRS is often used. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Network requirements The agent requires your firewall to allow outgoing connections to specific networks and ports. Automatic instrumentation If your application is hosted in ASP.NET Core, the agent automatically creates and instruments transactions. The .NET agent will automatically instrument your application after install. If your app is not automatically instrumented, or if you want to add instrumentation, use custom instrumentation. App frameworks The .NET agent automatically instruments these application frameworks: ASP.NET Core MVC 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 3.0, 3.1, and 5.0 (includes Web API) Datastores The .NET agent automatically instruments the performance of .NET application calls to these datastores: Datastore Instance details Notes Microsoft SQL Server Use System.Data.SqlClient version 4.3.1 or Microsoft.Data.SqlClient. PostgresSQL Use Npgsql 4.0. Prior versions of Npgsql may also be instrumented, but duplicate and/or missing metrics are possible. MongoDB Use driver version 2.3.x, 2.4.x, 2.5.x, or 2.6.x. Driver version 2.7.x: The .NET agent will support pre-existing API methods, but not new methods introduced in 2.7.x. MySQL Use MySql.Data version 6.10.4. or the MySQL Connector StackExchange.Redis The .NET agent does not directly monitor datastore processes. Also, the .NET SQL parameter capture in a query trace does not list parameters for a parameterized query or a stored procedure. Collecting instance details for supported datastores is enabled by default. To request instance-level information from datastores not currently listed, get support at support.newrelic.com. External call libraries The .NET agent automatically instruments these external call libraries : Libraries Supported methods HttpClient The agent instruments these HttpClient methods: SendAsync GetAsync PostAsync PutAsync DeleteAsync GetStringAsync GetStreamAsync GetByteArrayAsync Messaging The agent automatically instruments these message systems: RabbitMQ 5.1.0 or higher: Puts and takes on messages and queue purge. When receiving messages using an IBasicConsumer, the EventingBasicConsumer is the only implementation that is instrumented by the .NET agent. BasicGet is instrumented, but the agent does not support distributed tracing for BasicGet. Unavailable features The following features are not available for the .NET agent: Memory usage on Linux due to an ongoing .NET Core issue (try using .NET performance metrics to get this information) Automatic brower monitoring script injection (API or manual instrumentation is required) The .NET agent does not support trim self-contained deployments and executables, because the compiler can potentially trim assemblies that the agent depends on. Infinite Tracing is not supported on Alpine Linux due to a GRPC compatibility issue. See this agent issue for more information. Connect the agent to other New Relic products In addition to APM, the .NET agent integrates with other New Relic products to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The browser monitoring JavaScript agent will not be injected by the .NET agent for ASP.NET core applications. However, you can inject the browser agent by using the .NET agent API or the browser agent's copy/paste method. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see browser monitoring and the .NET agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another.

Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Support for both .NET Framework and .NET Core New Relic's .NET agent supports both .NET Framework and .NET Core, and it works with all .NET compatible languages, such as VB.NET, C#, and CLI. The agent's support for .NET Core takes advantage of the compatibility, speed, expanded API features, and cross-platform capabilities of Microsoft's .NET Core. The agent does not support Microsoft .NET Core versions earlier than 2.0. With New Relic's support for .NET, you can monitor your apps in dynamic or distributed environments, such as: Cloud-managed server VM images On-host VM servers Microsoft Azure App Services Self-hosted Windows and Linux systems Amazon AWS EC2 VMs Install the agent on Windows with our guided install Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the .NET agent for Windows IIS applications. Ready to get started? Click the Guided install button. If your account reports data through our EU datacenter, click EU Guided install. Guided install EU Guided install In addition to the .NET agent, you can use this to install our infrastructure agent to discover other applications, infrastructure, and log sources running in your environment and recommend which ones should be instrumented. The install automates the configuration and deployment of each system you choose to instrument. Install the agent Before you install the .NET agent, create your New Relic account. Then, review the requirements for .NET Framework or the requirements for .NET Core. When you are ready to install, use our launcher, or see the install instructions appropriate for your operating system: Windows or Linux. Add .NET data Tip To stay up-to-date with new features and bug fixes, see the .NET agent release notes. After you install the agent and wait a few minutes for your app to generate traffic, data will appear in the APM Summary page. If no data appears, or if you encounter other problems, see New Relic's .NET agent troubleshooting procedures. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Summary: After installing the .NET agent, you will see a summary of your app's performance on the Summary page. Configure the agent The most important part of agent configuration is to give your app a descriptive name. New Relic uses this app name to aggregate metrics when you have multiple apps or hosts. The agent also includes a variety of configuration options to further customize your installation. Extend your instrumentation After installing the .NET agent, extend the agent's instrumentation with one or more of these methods: Instrumentation options Details Browser instrumentation Integrate the .NET agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user activity. ASP.NET apps (.NET Framework only): Use any of the available options to install the browser agent. ASP.NET Core apps (targeting .NET Core or .NET Framework): Use either the API method or the copy/paste method to inject the browser agent into your webpages. Custom instrumentation Instrument transactions not captured as part of New Relic's automatic framework instrumentation. Agent API See the .NET agent API guide to learn how to customize the agent's behavior. For example, you can collect custom metrics, flag an error, or ignore a particular transaction entirely. Custom attributes Customize the attributes attached to transactions. Customizing attributes allows you to avoid sending sensitive attributes, or to collect additional attributes for deeper visibility into your transactions. Distributed tracing Enable distributed tracing to understand activity across a complex, distributed system that uses many services and microservices. Open source telemetry Explore these tools: OpenTelemetry exporter and .NET Telemetry SDK. Check the source code The .NET agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

Description Tip This call only allows you to assign values to pre-existing keys. For a more flexible method to create key/value pairs, use AddCustomParameter(). Define user-related custom attributes to associate with a browser page view (user name, account name, and product name). The values are automatically associated with pre-existing keys (user, account, and product), then attached to the parent APM transaction.

Specify a name or username to associate with this page view. This value is assigned to the user key. $account_value string Required (can be null). Specify the name of a user account to associate with this page view. This value is assigned to the account key. $product_value string Required (can be null). Specify the name of a product to associate with this page view. This value is assigned to the product key.

Requirements Caution This API has been deprecated. Please use the AddCustomAttribute instead. Compatible with all agent versions. Must be called inside a transaction. Description Attaches a custom attribute (a key/value pair) to the current transaction. For the attribute value, you can report either a string or an IConvertible. (The call name is AddCustomParameter because \"custom attributes\" were previously called \"custom parameters.\") Custom attributes can be used to add more detail and context to errors and transaction traces that are being reported to New Relic. For example, you might add a user name attribute to a transaction to help you filter and analyze your data. You can attach up to 64 attributes per transaction. (Each call to this API method counts as one \"user\" attribute.) You can also attach (or \"forward\") these attributes to browser monitoring's PageView events. For more information, see .NET agent attributes. Important If you want to use your custom parameters or attributes, avoid using any of the reserved terms used by NRQL. Parameters Parameter Description AddCustomParameter(string $key, string $value) Copy $key string Required. The key name to add to the transaction attributes. Only the first 255 characters are retained. $value string Required. The string value to add to the current transaction. There is a 255 character limit.

Important As of version 1.4.0, the infrastructure monitoring agent package includes the additional newrelic-infra-ctl binary, which is used to help troubleshoot a running agent. Although this binary is not required to execute the agent, we recommend to add it in your path. Install using configuration management tools To install the infrastructure monitoring agent with a configuration management tool, see the documentation for: Ansible Chef Docker (install as container) Elastic Beanstalk Puppet Install for Docker containers on instrumented hosts See Docker instrumentation for infrastructure monitoring. Install using Azure extensions See Azure extensions for infrastructure monitoring. Install using tarball files For custom setup scenarios, you can install the infrastructure monitoring agent using our tarball files in assisted or manual modes. This is especially useful when you need to adapt the default installation settings to your environment, or to install the infrastructure monitoring agent on distributions that lack the newrelic-infra package in their repositories. Important Installing the agent using tarball files is officially supported only for the AWS Graviton 2 processor. Update the agent Follow standard procedures to update the infrastructure monitoring agent. If you are using sudo to install or update the agent, use the -E argument to allow bypassing the environment variables, or specify the NRIA_MODE environment variable just after sudo. export NRIA_MODE=\"SET_MODE_HERE\" Copy OR sudo -E YOUR_PACKAGE_MANAGER_UPDATE_COMMAND Copy What's next? Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then view your hosts in the New Relic One UI. If necessary, follow our troubleshooting procedures if no data appears. Important The hostname for your server cannot be localhost. Data will not be reported for servers with that name. Make sure the host name uses a unique name. The only required configuration option is the license_key setting, which is created as part of the installation procedures. You may also want to: Add custom attributes to annotate your infrastructure data. Connect your AWS account if your servers are hosted on Amazon EC2. Enable log forwarding. Add other New Relic infrastructure integrations to collect data from external services.",

Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Add Ruby data Install the gem Important If you are using the agent in a Docker container, install the agent within each container. The Ruby agent's gem is available from rubygems.org as newrelic_rpm. For applications using Bundler, add this gem to the Gemfile: gem 'newrelic_rpm' Copy To use Infinite Tracing, the Infinite Tracing gem is also available from rubygems.org as newrelic-infinite_tracing. For applications using Bundler, additionally include the Infinite Tracing gem in the Gemfile: gem 'newrelic-infinite_tracing' Copy The next step varies depending on if you are using Rails or Sinatra: Ruby installation Comments If using Rails or Sinatra Rails: If you're using Rails 3 or higher, or Rails 2.3 in the recommended configuration, Rails will automatically call Bundler.require and cause newrelic_rpm to be required during startup of your application. Sinatra: If you're using Sinatra or another framework, you must either manually call require 'newrelic_rpm', or call Bundler.require. If not using Rails or Sinatra In order to use automatic browser application monitoring and Cross application tracing in a Rack application that does not use Sinatra or Rails, you must manually include additional Rack middlewares provided by the agent. Place the New Relic gem as low in the list as possible, allowing the frameworks above it to be instrumented when the gem initializes. Install the configuration file After installing the agent, you will need to install the newrelic.yml configuration file, and name your app: Sign in to New Relic. From the account dropdown, select Account settings. On the Account settings page, look for the Download a clean configuration file section and click the newrelic.yml file. Copy the newrelic.yml file into the config sub-directory of your application. Change the default application name to a meaningful name. Alternatively, you can generate a newrelic.yml file manually with the following command: newrelic install --license_key=\"YOUR_KEY\" \"My application\" Copy You may also use the --force option with this command if you need to overwrite an existing newrelic.yml. Update the agent See Upgrade Ruby agent versions. Install agent outside production environments Typically you will install the Ruby agent in your production environment. If you want to try out the Ruby agent in a development or localhost environment, verify in the relevant environment: block of the newrelic.yml file that the monitor_mode config value has been set to true. For example, to deploy New Relic in your development environment and still be able to view your app's performance metrics: In the development: block, set the monitor_mode config value to true. Uninstall the Ruby agent gem To uninstall the Ruby agent using Bundler, remove gem 'newrelic_rpm' from your Gemfile. If you are not using Bundler, remove all references to newrelic_rpm from your environment.rb file. Install on older versions of Rails If you're installing the Ruby agent on Rails 2.x, and aren't using Bundler, follow these procedures. Ruby installation Comments Rails 2.1 - 2.3 without Bundler Install the gem using gem install newrelic_rpm. Edit environment.rb, and add to the initializer block: config.gem \"newrelic_rpm\" Copy If enabling Infinite Tracing, add the following to the next line in the environment.rb file: config.gem \"newrelic-infinite_tracing\" Copy Rails earlier than 2.1 New Relic does not officially support Rails versions prior to 2.1. However, if you want to use New Relic for Rails versions 2.0. * , edit environment.rb and add this statement after the initializer: block: require \"newrelic_rpm\" Copy Infinite Tracing If enabling Infinite Tracing, add the following to the next line in the environment.rb file: require \"newrelic/infinite_tracing\" Copy",

Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Monitor app performance After you install the Python agent, it begins to collect data about your app. You can view the data as charts and tables in New Relic One. View the big picture of your app. Monitor your app's Apdex (user satisfaction). Get a high-level summary of your app with Summary page. Enable distributed tracing to see activity across an architecture having many services.

Simple scripts and background tasks Monitor job-based or task queuing systems, like Celery, or other standalone non-web functions. Business data analysis with data exploration. Use the Python agent with our data explorer to organize, query, and visualize your data to answer key questions about application performance and customer experience. Use default transaction attributes, or add your own. Query your data using the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). Send your own event data. Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards. Install the Python agent Before you install the Python agent, make sure your system meets the system requirements. You must also create a New Relic account. We support a number of web frameworks and libraries right out of the box, including Django, WSGI, and Gunicorn. If you use one of the supported web frameworks, installation is easy. If you use an unsupported framework, the process will involve some additions to your app code and/or web server files. For a quick and simple install process that will work for the majority of setups, follow these simple steps: Download and install the Python package. Create config file. Integrate the Python agent with your application. Read the Quick Start guide Add Python data Monitor non-web scripts, background tasks, and functions The Python agent also lets you monitor non-web scripts, worker processes, tasks, and functions. The installation process for these non-web transactions is similar to the one used for a web app, with one major difference: instead of going through the standard integration process described in the install instructions, you would manually \"wrap\" any function you want to monitor. For more information, see Non-web tasks and processes. For instructions on monitoring Celery tasks, see Celery background tasks. What's next after installation? Once you get the agent up and running, some suggested next steps are: Explore your data in and get comfortable with the user interface. Read some documentation about Full-Stack Observability. For example, read about the capabilities of Full-Stack observability and the APM page. Change your application's name, or other configuration options. Learn about setting up custom instrumentation for application activity not monitored by default. Consider these open source telemetry tools: OpenCensus exporter and Python Telemetry SDK. Troubleshooting After you complete the install process, your data should appear in the APM UI within five minutes. If it does not, use these troubleshooting resources: If no data appears, follow these troubleshooting steps. If you experience issues when installing or running the Python agent on a new host, test that the package is installed correctly and that it can contact New Relic's data collector service. For other problems, see the full list of troubleshooting documentation. Check the source code The Python agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

Before you use browser with your .NET agent, refer to the .NET agent release notes, and make sure you have the installed the latest .NET agent release. Follow the .NET agent requirements to install browser monitoring. Then follow the procedures in this document to manually instrument the .NET agent. Auto-instrumentation Important This feature is not available for asp.net core applications whether they are monitored by the .NET Framework or Core agent. Browser auto-instrumentation is enabled by default. With browser auto-instrumentation, the .NET Framework agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript header into any page that has a content-type of text/html and also has <head> tag within the page. The <head> tag search starts at the beginning of the DOM. The .NET agent injects the JavaScript header through the addition of an HttpModule that modifies the page using HTTP response filters before streaming the content to the user. The first time you enable auto-instrumentation, you may need to clean your asp.net cache directory so that aspx pages are recompiled. Use the following command: flush_dotnet_temp.cmd Copy With this injection, previously functioning pages may stop working if a content-type is not set correctly. To correct, review and update the content-types in your app or disable auto-instrumentation. Manual instrumentation via agent API If you cannot enable auto-instrumentation, you can still include the browser agent manually by using the New Relic .NET agent API and including appropriate code in your pages. To download the NewRelic.Api.agent.dll, re-run the installation and reference the .dll: From the New Relic .NET agent directory, select the New Relic.Net agent section, then select API Assembly. NuGet: Install and reference the .dll by running Install-package NewRelic.Agent.Api. To set up your web application to call the New Relic .NET agent API, add a reference to NewRelic.Api.Agent.dll to your project. Optional: If you are modifying the deployed application directory on the web server, copy NewRelic.Api.Agent.dll into the application's bin directory. Call the API in your <head> tag. If a meta-tag with the X-UA-COMPATIBLE http-equiv attribute exists, set it after that meta tag. .NET Web Forms view engine When using .NET Web Forms view engine, be sure to use = and not :. That way the view engine will recognize the string of HTML returned from the API as HTML / JavaScript and render it appropriately. If you are using .NET ASP Web Forms with master pages, add the header manually by calling GetBrowserTimingHeader() in your master page under the <head> tag: <%= NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.GetBrowserTimingHeader() %> Copy Import the namespace with: <%@ Import Namespace=\"NewRelic.Api.Agent\" %> Copy Other view engines such as Razor For other view engines such as Razor, you can use the GetBrowserTimingHeader() method to generate the header string. Here is a Razor-based view example: <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang=\"en\"> <head> @Html.Raw(NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.GetBrowserTimingHeader()) ... </head> </html> Copy .NET MVC When using .NET MVC, call the Html.Raw helper. That way, .NET MVC will recognize the string of HTML returned from the API as HTML / JavaScript and render it appropriately. Disable instrumentation To disable instrumentation: Disable auto-instrumentation To fully disable auto-instrumentation, edit newrelic.config and set the autoInstrument flag to false: <!-- disable auto instrumentation --> <browserMonitoring autoInstrument=\"false\"/> Copy Important If you change the flag or uninstall the .NET agent, be sure to flush your cache again so that references to the agent are removed from compiled files. Disable auto-instrumentation on a particular view To disable only auto-instrumentation on a particular view, use the agent API call DisableBrowserMonitoring(). Add this call in any view where browser scripts are not needed or wanted. Put this API call as close as possible to the top of the view where you want it disabled.

      "body": "New Relic's .NET agent supports both .NET Framework and .NET Core. This document describes compatibility and support for .NET Core applications. See Compatibility and requirements for .NET Framework for .NET Framework applications. New Relic's .NET agent includes built-in instrumentation for some of the most popular parts of the .NET Core ecosystem, including frameworks, databases, and message queuing systems. After installation, the agent runs within the monitored process; there is not a separate process or service created by the agent. For frameworks and libraries that are not automatically instrumented out of the box, you can extend the agent with .NET custom instrumentation. Requirements Before you install the New Relic .NET agent on Windows or Linux, make sure your system meets these requirements: Microsoft .NET Core version The .NET agent supports .NET Core versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 3.0, 3.1, and .NET 5.0. Table of minimum agent versions required per .NET Core version .NET Core Version Minimum Required .NET Agent Version .NET Core 2.0 > = 8.19.353.0 .NET Core 2.1 > = 8.19.353.0 .NET Core 2.2 > = 8.19.353.0 .NET Core 3.0 > = 8.21.34.0 .NET Core 3.1 > = 8.21.34.0 .NET 5.0 > = 8.35.0 The agent is not compatible with .NET Core versions 1.0 or 1.1. For .NET Core 2.1 or higher applications with tiered compilation enabled, the agent will disable tiered compilation. .NET Core 2.1 support requires .NET Core runtime 2.1.3 and .NET Core SDK 2.1.401 or higher due to a bug in the .NET Core profiling API. Target framework version The .NET agent only supports applications targeting .NET Core 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 3.0, 3.1, and NET 5.0. You can find the target framework in your .csproj file: Supported: <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.0</TargetFramework> Copy <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework> Copy <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.2</TargetFramework> Copy <TargetFramework>netcoreapp3.0</TargetFramework> Copy <TargetFramework>netcoreapp3.1</TargetFramework> Copy <TargetFramework>net5.0</TargetFramework> Copy Unsupported: <TargetFramework>net452</TargetFramework> Copy Important If you want to monitor an ASP.NET Core application targeting .NET Framework, ensure your install of the .NET agent has .NET Framework support enabled. App/web servers Ensure you use one of these app/web servers: Kestrel Kestrel with IIS reverse proxy via AspNetCoreModule Kestrel with IIS reverse proxy via AspNetCoreModuleV2 Kestrel with Nginx reverse proxy Kestrel with Apache reverse proxy Operating system The agent has been verified to work with the following operating systems: Operating system Supported versions Windows (32- and 64-bit Intel compatible architectures) Server 2008 R2 SP1 Server 2012 Server 2012 R2 Server 2016 Server 2019 Windows containers running on Server 2016 (NanoServer based images are not supported) Linux (64-bit Intel compatible only) All x64 Linux distributions supported by the .NET Core 2.0+/.NET 5 runtime are supported by the .NET agent. For a full list, refer to Microsoft's documentation for the version of the runtime you are using. Microsoft Azure For Azure-specific installation instructions, see: Install on Azure Cloud Services Install on Azure Service Fabric Install on Azure Web Apps Processor architectures The agent is available in both 32-bit (x86) and 64-bit (x64) versions on Windows as well as 64-bit (x64) on Linux. Permissions Installing and running the .NET agent requires these permissions: Component Necessary permissions Install the agent The process or user that installs the agent must have sufficient permissions to set environment variables and write access to the directory where the agent is installed. Run the agent The monitored process must have read/write access to the directory in which you installed the agent. The agent runs as a part of the monitored process and relies on those permissions to function. For applications using IIS via reverse proxy, the group IIS_IUSRS is often used. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Network requirements The agent requires your firewall to allow outgoing connections to specific networks and ports. Automatic instrumentation If your application is hosted in ASP.NET Core, the agent automatically creates and instruments transactions. The .NET agent will automatically instrument your application after install. If your app is not automatically instrumented, or if you want to add instrumentation, use custom instrumentation. App frameworks The .NET agent automatically instruments these application frameworks: ASP.NET Core MVC 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 3.0, 3.1, and 5.0 (includes Web API) Datastores The .NET agent automatically instruments the performance of .NET application calls to these datastores: Datastore Instance details Notes Microsoft SQL Server Use System.Data.SqlClient version 4.3.1 or Microsoft.Data.SqlClient. PostgresSQL Use Npgsql 4.0. Prior versions of Npgsql may also be instrumented, but duplicate and/or missing metrics are possible. MongoDB Use driver version 2.3.x, 2.4.x, 2.5.x, or 2.6.x. Driver version 2.7.x: The .NET agent will support pre-existing API methods, but not new methods introduced in 2.7.x. MySQL Use MySql.Data version 6.10.4. or the MySQL Connector StackExchange.Redis The .NET agent does not directly monitor datastore processes. Also, the .NET SQL parameter capture in a query trace does not list parameters for a parameterized query or a stored procedure. Collecting instance details for supported datastores is enabled by default. To request instance-level information from datastores not currently listed, get support at support.newrelic.com. External call libraries The .NET agent automatically instruments these external call libraries : Libraries Supported methods HttpClient The agent instruments these HttpClient methods: SendAsync GetAsync PostAsync PutAsync DeleteAsync GetStringAsync GetStreamAsync GetByteArrayAsync Messaging The agent automatically instruments these message systems: RabbitMQ 5.1.0 or higher: Puts and takes on messages and queue purge. When receiving messages using an IBasicConsumer, the EventingBasicConsumer is the only implementation that is instrumented by the .NET agent. BasicGet is instrumented, but the agent does not support distributed tracing for BasicGet. Unavailable features The following features are not available for the .NET agent: Memory usage on Linux due to an ongoing .NET Core issue (try using .NET performance metrics to get this information) Automatic brower monitoring script injection (API or manual instrumentation is required) The .NET agent does not support trim self-contained deployments and executables, because the compiler can potentially trim assemblies that the agent depends on. Infinite Tracing is not supported on Alpine Linux due to a GRPC compatibility issue. See this agent issue for more information. Connect the agent to other New Relic products In addition to APM, the .NET agent integrates with other New Relic products to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The browser monitoring JavaScript agent will not be injected by the .NET agent for ASP.NET core applications. However, you can inject the browser agent by using the .NET agent API or the browser agent's copy/paste method. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see browser monitoring and the .NET agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. Dashboards The .NET agent sends default events and attributes for NRQL queries. You can also record custom events for advanced analysis.",

      "body": "New Relic's .NET agent supports both .NET Framework and .NET Core. This document describes compatibility and support for .NET Core applications. See Compatibility and requirements for .NET Framework for .NET Framework applications. New Relic's .NET agent includes built-in instrumentation for some of the most popular parts of the .NET Core ecosystem, including frameworks, databases, and message queuing systems. After installation, the agent runs within the monitored process; there is not a separate process or service created by the agent. For frameworks and libraries that are not automatically instrumented out of the box, you can extend the agent with .NET custom instrumentation. Requirements Before you install the New Relic .NET agent on Windows or Linux, make sure your system meets these requirements: Microsoft .NET Core version The .NET agent supports .NET Core versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 3.0, 3.1, and .NET 5.0. Table of minimum agent versions required per .NET Core version .NET Core Version Minimum Required .NET Agent Version .NET Core 2.0 > = 8.19.353.0 .NET Core 2.1 > = 8.19.353.0 .NET Core 2.2 > = 8.19.353.0 .NET Core 3.0 > = 8.21.34.0 .NET Core 3.1 > = 8.21.34.0 .NET 5.0 > = 8.35.0 The agent is not compatible with .NET Core versions 1.0 or 1.1. For .NET Core 2.1 or higher applications with tiered compilation enabled, the agent will disable tiered compilation. .NET Core 2.1 support requires .NET Core runtime 2.1.3 and .NET Core SDK 2.1.401 or higher due to a bug in the .NET Core profiling API. Target framework version The .NET agent only supports applications targeting .NET Core 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 3.0, 3.1, and NET 5.0. You can find the target framework in your .csproj file: Supported: <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.0</TargetFramework> Copy <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework> Copy <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.2</TargetFramework> Copy <TargetFramework>netcoreapp3.0</TargetFramework> Copy <TargetFramework>netcoreapp3.1</TargetFramework> Copy <TargetFramework>net5.0</TargetFramework> Copy Unsupported: <TargetFramework>net452</TargetFramework> Copy Important If you want to monitor an ASP.NET Core application targeting .NET Framework, ensure your install of the .NET agent has .NET Framework support enabled. App/web servers Ensure you use one of these app/web servers: Kestrel Kestrel with IIS reverse proxy via AspNetCoreModule Kestrel with IIS reverse proxy via AspNetCoreModuleV2 Kestrel with Nginx reverse proxy Kestrel with Apache reverse proxy Operating system The agent has been verified to work with the following operating systems: Operating system Supported versions Windows (32- and 64-bit Intel compatible architectures) Server 2008 R2 SP1 Server 2012 Server 2012 R2 Server 2016 Server 2019 Windows containers running on Server 2016 (NanoServer based images are not supported) Linux (64-bit Intel compatible only) All x64 Linux distributions supported by the .NET Core 2.0+/.NET 5 runtime are supported by the .NET agent. For a full list, refer to Microsoft's documentation for the version of the runtime you are using. Microsoft Azure For Azure-specific installation instructions, see: Install on Azure Cloud Services Install on Azure Service Fabric Install on Azure Web Apps Processor architectures The agent is available in both 32-bit (x86) and 64-bit (x64) versions on Windows as well as 64-bit (x64) on Linux. Permissions Installing and running the .NET agent requires these permissions: Component Necessary permissions Install the agent The process or user that installs the agent must have sufficient permissions to set environment variables and write access to the directory where the agent is installed. Run the agent The monitored process must have read/write access to the directory in which you installed the agent. The agent runs as a part of the monitored process and relies on those permissions to function. For applications using IIS via reverse proxy, the group IIS_IUSRS is often used. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Network requirements The agent requires your firewall to allow outgoing connections to specific networks and ports. Automatic instrumentation If your application is hosted in ASP.NET Core, the agent automatically creates and instruments transactions. The .NET agent will automatically instrument your application after install. If your app is not automatically instrumented, or if you want to add instrumentation, use custom instrumentation. App frameworks The .NET agent automatically instruments these application frameworks: ASP.NET Core MVC 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 3.0, 3.1, and 5.0 (includes Web API) Datastores The .NET agent automatically instruments the performance of .NET application calls to these datastores: Datastore Instance details Notes Microsoft SQL Server Use System.Data.SqlClient version 4.3.1 or Microsoft.Data.SqlClient. PostgresSQL Use Npgsql 4.0. Prior versions of Npgsql may also be instrumented, but duplicate and/or missing metrics are possible. MongoDB Use driver version 2.3.x, 2.4.x, 2.5.x, or 2.6.x. Driver version 2.7.x: The .NET agent will support pre-existing API methods, but not new methods introduced in 2.7.x. MySQL Use MySql.Data version 6.10.4. or the MySQL Connector StackExchange.Redis The .NET agent does not directly monitor datastore processes. Also, the .NET SQL parameter capture in a query trace does not list parameters for a parameterized query or a stored procedure. Collecting instance details for supported datastores is enabled by default. To request instance-level information from datastores not currently listed, get support at support.newrelic.com. External call libraries The .NET agent automatically instruments these external call libraries : Libraries Supported methods HttpClient The agent instruments these HttpClient methods: SendAsync GetAsync PostAsync PutAsync DeleteAsync GetStringAsync GetStreamAsync GetByteArrayAsync Messaging The agent automatically instruments these message systems: RabbitMQ 5.1.0 or higher: Puts and takes on messages and queue purge. When receiving messages using an IBasicConsumer, the EventingBasicConsumer is the only implementation that is instrumented by the .NET agent. BasicGet is instrumented, but the agent does not support distributed tracing for BasicGet. Unavailable features The following features are not available for the .NET agent: Memory usage on Linux due to an ongoing .NET Core issue (try using .NET performance metrics to get this information) Automatic brower monitoring script injection (API or manual instrumentation is required) The .NET agent does not support trim self-contained deployments and executables, because the compiler can potentially trim assemblies that the agent depends on. Infinite Tracing is not supported on Alpine Linux due to a GRPC compatibility issue. See this agent issue for more information. Connect the agent to other New Relic products In addition to APM, the .NET agent integrates with other New Relic products to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The browser monitoring JavaScript agent will not be injected by the .NET agent for ASP.NET core applications. However, you can inject the browser agent by using the .NET agent API or the browser agent's copy/paste method. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see browser monitoring and the .NET agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. Dashboards The .NET agent sends default events and attributes for NRQL queries. You can also record custom events for advanced analysis.",

      "body": "With the .NET agent, you can add browser monitoring instrumentation to your webpages. Before you use browser with your .NET agent, refer to the .NET agent release notes, and make sure you have the installed the latest .NET agent release. Follow the .NET agent requirements to install browser monitoring. Then follow the procedures in this document to manually instrument the .NET agent. Auto-instrumentation Important This feature is not available for asp.net core applications whether they are monitored by the .NET Framework or Core agent. Browser auto-instrumentation is enabled by default. With browser auto-instrumentation, the .NET Framework agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript header into any page that has a content-type of text/html and also has <head> tag within the page. The <head> tag search starts at the beginning of the DOM. The .NET agent injects the JavaScript header through the addition of an HttpModule that modifies the page using HTTP response filters before streaming the content to the user. The first time you enable auto-instrumentation, you may need to clean your asp.net cache directory so that aspx pages are recompiled. Use the following command: flush_dotnet_temp.cmd Copy With this injection, previously functioning pages may stop working if a content-type is not set correctly. To correct, review and update the content-types in your app or disable auto-instrumentation. Manual instrumentation via agent API If you cannot enable auto-instrumentation, you can still include the browser agent manually by using the New Relic .NET agent API and including appropriate code in your pages. To download the NewRelic.Api.agent.dll, re-run the installation and reference the .dll: From the New Relic .NET agent directory, select the New Relic.Net agent section, then select API Assembly. NuGet: Install and reference the .dll by running Install-package NewRelic.Agent.Api. To set up your web application to call the New Relic .NET agent API, add a reference to NewRelic.Api.Agent.dll to your project. Optional: If you are modifying the deployed application directory on the web server, copy NewRelic.Api.Agent.dll into the application's bin directory. Call the API in your <head> tag. If a meta-tag with the X-UA-COMPATIBLE http-equiv attribute exists, set it after that meta tag. .NET Web Forms view engine When using .NET Web Forms view engine, be sure to use = and not :. That way the view engine will recognize the string of HTML returned from the API as HTML / JavaScript and render it appropriately. If you are using .NET ASP Web Forms with master pages, add the header manually by calling GetBrowserTimingHeader() in your master page under the <head> tag: <%= NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.GetBrowserTimingHeader() %> Copy Import the namespace with: <%@ Import Namespace=\"NewRelic.Api.Agent\" %> Copy Other view engines such as Razor For other view engines such as Razor, you can use the GetBrowserTimingHeader() method to generate the header string. Here is a Razor-based view example: <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang=\"en\"> <head> @Html.Raw(NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.GetBrowserTimingHeader()) ... </head> </html> Copy .NET MVC When using .NET MVC, call the Html.Raw helper. That way, .NET MVC will recognize the string of HTML returned from the API as HTML / JavaScript and render it appropriately. Disable instrumentation To disable instrumentation: Disable auto-instrumentation To fully disable auto-instrumentation, edit newrelic.config and set the autoInstrument flag to false: <!-- disable auto instrumentation --> <browserMonitoring autoInstrument=\"false\"/> Copy Important If you change the flag or uninstall the .NET agent, be sure to flush your cache again so that references to the agent are removed from compiled files. Disable auto-instrumentation on a particular view To disable only auto-instrumentation on a particular view, use the agent API call DisableBrowserMonitoring(). Add this call in any view where browser scripts are not needed or wanted. Put this API call as close as possible to the top of the view where you want it disabled. Disable both automatic and manual instrumentation on a particular view To disable both auto-instrumentation and manual instrumentation for individual webpages, use the agent API call DisableBrowserMonitoring(true). Troubleshooting Follow the troubleshooting procedures if you are unable to view any browser timing data.",

Support for both .NET Framework and .NET Core New Relic's .NET agent supports both .NET Framework and .NET Core, and it works with all .NET compatible languages, such as VB.NET, C#, and CLI. The agent's support for .NET Core takes advantage of the compatibility, speed, expanded API features, and cross-platform capabilities of Microsoft's .NET Core. The agent does not support Microsoft .NET Core versions earlier than 2.0. With New Relic's support for .NET, you can monitor your apps in dynamic or distributed environments, such as: Cloud-managed server VM images On-host VM servers Microsoft Azure App Services Self-hosted Windows and Linux systems Amazon AWS EC2 VMs Install the agent on Windows with our guided install Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the .NET agent for Windows IIS applications. Ready to get started? Click the Guided install button. If your account reports data through our EU datacenter, click EU Guided install. Guided install EU Guided install In addition to the .NET agent, you can use this to install our infrastructure agent to discover other applications, infrastructure, and log sources running in your environment and recommend which ones should be instrumented. The install automates the configuration and deployment of each system you choose to instrument. Install the agent Before you install the .NET agent, create your New Relic account. Then, review the requirements for .NET Framework or the requirements for .NET Core. When you are ready to install, use our launcher, or see the install instructions appropriate for your operating system: Windows or Linux. Add .NET data Tip To stay up-to-date with new features and bug fixes, see the .NET agent release notes. After you install the agent and wait a few minutes for your app to generate traffic, data will appear in the APM Summary page. If no data appears, or if you encounter other problems, see New Relic's .NET agent troubleshooting procedures. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Summary: After installing the .NET agent, you will see a summary of your app's performance on the Summary page. Configure the agent The most important part of agent configuration is to give your app a descriptive name. New Relic uses this app name to aggregate metrics when you have multiple apps or hosts. The agent also includes a variety of configuration options to further customize your installation. Extend your instrumentation After installing the .NET agent, extend the agent's instrumentation with one or more of these methods: Instrumentation options Details Browser instrumentation Integrate the .NET agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user activity. ASP.NET apps (.NET Framework only): Use any of the available options to install the browser agent. ASP.NET Core apps (targeting .NET Core or .NET Framework): Use either the API method or the copy/paste method to inject the browser agent into your webpages. Custom instrumentation Instrument transactions not captured as part of New Relic's automatic framework instrumentation. Agent API See the .NET agent API guide to learn how to customize the agent's behavior. For example, you can collect custom metrics, flag an error, or ignore a particular transaction entirely. Custom attributes Customize the attributes attached to transactions. Customizing attributes allows you to avoid sending sensitive attributes, or to collect additional attributes for deeper visibility into your transactions. Distributed tracing Enable distributed tracing to understand activity across a complex, distributed system that uses many services and microservices. Open source telemetry Explore these tools: OpenTelemetry exporter and .NET Telemetry SDK. Check the source code The .NET agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "With the .NET agent, you can add browser monitoring instrumentation to your webpages. Before you use browser with your .NET agent, refer to the .NET agent release notes, and make sure you have the installed the latest .NET agent release. Follow the .NET agent requirements to install browser monitoring. Then follow the procedures in this document to manually instrument the .NET agent. Auto-instrumentation Important This feature is not available for asp.net core applications whether they are monitored by the .NET Framework or Core agent. Browser auto-instrumentation is enabled by default. With browser auto-instrumentation, the .NET Framework agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript header into any page that has a content-type of text/html and also has <head> tag within the page. The <head> tag search starts at the beginning of the DOM. The .NET agent injects the JavaScript header through the addition of an HttpModule that modifies the page using HTTP response filters before streaming the content to the user. The first time you enable auto-instrumentation, you may need to clean your asp.net cache directory so that aspx pages are recompiled. Use the following command: flush_dotnet_temp.cmd Copy With this injection, previously functioning pages may stop working if a content-type is not set correctly. To correct, review and update the content-types in your app or disable auto-instrumentation. Manual instrumentation via agent API If you cannot enable auto-instrumentation, you can still include the browser agent manually by using the New Relic .NET agent API and including appropriate code in your pages. To download the NewRelic.Api.agent.dll, re-run the installation and reference the .dll: From the New Relic .NET agent directory, select the New Relic.Net agent section, then select API Assembly. NuGet: Install and reference the .dll by running Install-package NewRelic.Agent.Api. To set up your web application to call the New Relic .NET agent API, add a reference to NewRelic.Api.Agent.dll to your project. Optional: If you are modifying the deployed application directory on the web server, copy NewRelic.Api.Agent.dll into the application's bin directory. Call the API in your <head> tag. If a meta-tag with the X-UA-COMPATIBLE http-equiv attribute exists, set it after that meta tag. .NET Web Forms view engine When using .NET Web Forms view engine, be sure to use = and not :. That way the view engine will recognize the string of HTML returned from the API as HTML / JavaScript and render it appropriately. If you are using .NET ASP Web Forms with master pages, add the header manually by calling GetBrowserTimingHeader() in your master page under the <head> tag: <%= NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.GetBrowserTimingHeader() %> Copy Import the namespace with: <%@ Import Namespace=\"NewRelic.Api.Agent\" %> Copy Other view engines such as Razor For other view engines such as Razor, you can use the GetBrowserTimingHeader() method to generate the header string. Here is a Razor-based view example: <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang=\"en\"> <head> @Html.Raw(NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.GetBrowserTimingHeader()) ... </head> </html> Copy .NET MVC When using .NET MVC, call the Html.Raw helper. That way, .NET MVC will recognize the string of HTML returned from the API as HTML / JavaScript and render it appropriately. Disable instrumentation To disable instrumentation: Disable auto-instrumentation To fully disable auto-instrumentation, edit newrelic.config and set the autoInstrument flag to false: <!-- disable auto instrumentation --> <browserMonitoring autoInstrument=\"false\"/> Copy Important If you change the flag or uninstall the .NET agent, be sure to flush your cache again so that references to the agent are removed from compiled files. Disable auto-instrumentation on a particular view To disable only auto-instrumentation on a particular view, use the agent API call DisableBrowserMonitoring(). Add this call in any view where browser scripts are not needed or wanted. Put this API call as close as possible to the top of the view where you want it disabled. Disable both automatic and manual instrumentation on a particular view To disable both auto-instrumentation and manual instrumentation for individual webpages, use the agent API call DisableBrowserMonitoring(true). Troubleshooting Follow the troubleshooting procedures if you are unable to view any browser timing data.",

      "body": "New Relic's .NET agent supports both .NET Framework and .NET Core. This document describes compatibility and support for .NET Core applications. See Compatibility and requirements for .NET Framework for .NET Framework applications. New Relic's .NET agent includes built-in instrumentation for some of the most popular parts of the .NET Core ecosystem, including frameworks, databases, and message queuing systems. After installation, the agent runs within the monitored process; there is not a separate process or service created by the agent. For frameworks and libraries that are not automatically instrumented out of the box, you can extend the agent with .NET custom instrumentation. Requirements Before you install the New Relic .NET agent on Windows or Linux, make sure your system meets these requirements: Microsoft .NET Core version The .NET agent supports .NET Core versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 3.0, 3.1, and .NET 5.0. Table of minimum agent versions required per .NET Core version .NET Core Version Minimum Required .NET Agent Version .NET Core 2.0 > = 8.19.353.0 .NET Core 2.1 > = 8.19.353.0 .NET Core 2.2 > = 8.19.353.0 .NET Core 3.0 > = 8.21.34.0 .NET Core 3.1 > = 8.21.34.0 .NET 5.0 > = 8.35.0 The agent is not compatible with .NET Core versions 1.0 or 1.1. For .NET Core 2.1 or higher applications with tiered compilation enabled, the agent will disable tiered compilation. .NET Core 2.1 support requires .NET Core runtime 2.1.3 and .NET Core SDK 2.1.401 or higher due to a bug in the .NET Core profiling API. Target framework version The .NET agent only supports applications targeting .NET Core 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 3.0, 3.1, and NET 5.0. You can find the target framework in your .csproj file: Supported: <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.0</TargetFramework> Copy <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework> Copy <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.2</TargetFramework> Copy <TargetFramework>netcoreapp3.0</TargetFramework> Copy <TargetFramework>netcoreapp3.1</TargetFramework> Copy <TargetFramework>net5.0</TargetFramework> Copy Unsupported: <TargetFramework>net452</TargetFramework> Copy Important If you want to monitor an ASP.NET Core application targeting .NET Framework, ensure your install of the .NET agent has .NET Framework support enabled. App/web servers Ensure you use one of these app/web servers: Kestrel Kestrel with IIS reverse proxy via AspNetCoreModule Kestrel with IIS reverse proxy via AspNetCoreModuleV2 Kestrel with Nginx reverse proxy Kestrel with Apache reverse proxy Operating system The agent has been verified to work with the following operating systems: Operating system Supported versions Windows (32- and 64-bit Intel compatible architectures) Server 2008 R2 SP1 Server 2012 Server 2012 R2 Server 2016 Server 2019 Windows containers running on Server 2016 (NanoServer based images are not supported) Linux (64-bit Intel compatible only) All x64 Linux distributions supported by the .NET Core 2.0+/.NET 5 runtime are supported by the .NET agent. For a full list, refer to Microsoft's documentation for the version of the runtime you are using. Microsoft Azure For Azure-specific installation instructions, see: Install on Azure Cloud Services Install on Azure Service Fabric Install on Azure Web Apps Processor architectures The agent is available in both 32-bit (x86) and 64-bit (x64) versions on Windows as well as 64-bit (x64) on Linux. Permissions Installing and running the .NET agent requires these permissions: Component Necessary permissions Install the agent The process or user that installs the agent must have sufficient permissions to set environment variables and write access to the directory where the agent is installed. Run the agent The monitored process must have read/write access to the directory in which you installed the agent. The agent runs as a part of the monitored process and relies on those permissions to function. For applications using IIS via reverse proxy, the group IIS_IUSRS is often used. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Network requirements The agent requires your firewall to allow outgoing connections to specific networks and ports. Automatic instrumentation If your application is hosted in ASP.NET Core, the agent automatically creates and instruments transactions. The .NET agent will automatically instrument your application after install. If your app is not automatically instrumented, or if you want to add instrumentation, use custom instrumentation. App frameworks The .NET agent automatically instruments these application frameworks: ASP.NET Core MVC 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 3.0, 3.1, and 5.0 (includes Web API) Datastores The .NET agent automatically instruments the performance of .NET application calls to these datastores: Datastore Instance details Notes Microsoft SQL Server Use System.Data.SqlClient version 4.3.1 or Microsoft.Data.SqlClient. PostgresSQL Use Npgsql 4.0. Prior versions of Npgsql may also be instrumented, but duplicate and/or missing metrics are possible. MongoDB Use driver version 2.3.x, 2.4.x, 2.5.x, or 2.6.x. Driver version 2.7.x: The .NET agent will support pre-existing API methods, but not new methods introduced in 2.7.x. MySQL Use MySql.Data version 6.10.4. or the MySQL Connector StackExchange.Redis The .NET agent does not directly monitor datastore processes. Also, the .NET SQL parameter capture in a query trace does not list parameters for a parameterized query or a stored procedure. Collecting instance details for supported datastores is enabled by default. To request instance-level information from datastores not currently listed, get support at support.newrelic.com. External call libraries The .NET agent automatically instruments these external call libraries : Libraries Supported methods HttpClient The agent instruments these HttpClient methods: SendAsync GetAsync PostAsync PutAsync DeleteAsync GetStringAsync GetStreamAsync GetByteArrayAsync Messaging The agent automatically instruments these message systems: RabbitMQ 5.1.0 or higher: Puts and takes on messages and queue purge. When receiving messages using an IBasicConsumer, the EventingBasicConsumer is the only implementation that is instrumented by the .NET agent. BasicGet is instrumented, but the agent does not support distributed tracing for BasicGet. Unavailable features The following features are not available for the .NET agent: Memory usage on Linux due to an ongoing .NET Core issue (try using .NET performance metrics to get this information) Automatic brower monitoring script injection (API or manual instrumentation is required) The .NET agent does not support trim self-contained deployments and executables, because the compiler can potentially trim assemblies that the agent depends on. Infinite Tracing is not supported on Alpine Linux due to a GRPC compatibility issue. See this agent issue for more information. Connect the agent to other New Relic products In addition to APM, the .NET agent integrates with other New Relic products to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The browser monitoring JavaScript agent will not be injected by the .NET agent for ASP.NET core applications. However, you can inject the browser agent by using the .NET agent API or the browser agent's copy/paste method. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see browser monitoring and the .NET agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. Dashboards The .NET agent sends default events and attributes for NRQL queries. You can also record custom events for advanced analysis.",

      "body": "With the .NET agent, you can add browser monitoring instrumentation to your webpages. Before you use browser with your .NET agent, refer to the .NET agent release notes, and make sure you have the installed the latest .NET agent release. Follow the .NET agent requirements to install browser monitoring. Then follow the procedures in this document to manually instrument the .NET agent. Auto-instrumentation Important This feature is not available for asp.net core applications whether they are monitored by the .NET Framework or Core agent. Browser auto-instrumentation is enabled by default. With browser auto-instrumentation, the .NET Framework agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript header into any page that has a content-type of text/html and also has <head> tag within the page. The <head> tag search starts at the beginning of the DOM. The .NET agent injects the JavaScript header through the addition of an HttpModule that modifies the page using HTTP response filters before streaming the content to the user. The first time you enable auto-instrumentation, you may need to clean your asp.net cache directory so that aspx pages are recompiled. Use the following command: flush_dotnet_temp.cmd Copy With this injection, previously functioning pages may stop working if a content-type is not set correctly. To correct, review and update the content-types in your app or disable auto-instrumentation. Manual instrumentation via agent API If you cannot enable auto-instrumentation, you can still include the browser agent manually by using the New Relic .NET agent API and including appropriate code in your pages. To download the NewRelic.Api.agent.dll, re-run the installation and reference the .dll: From the New Relic .NET agent directory, select the New Relic.Net agent section, then select API Assembly. NuGet: Install and reference the .dll by running Install-package NewRelic.Agent.Api. To set up your web application to call the New Relic .NET agent API, add a reference to NewRelic.Api.Agent.dll to your project. Optional: If you are modifying the deployed application directory on the web server, copy NewRelic.Api.Agent.dll into the application's bin directory. Call the API in your <head> tag. If a meta-tag with the X-UA-COMPATIBLE http-equiv attribute exists, set it after that meta tag. .NET Web Forms view engine When using .NET Web Forms view engine, be sure to use = and not :. That way the view engine will recognize the string of HTML returned from the API as HTML / JavaScript and render it appropriately. If you are using .NET ASP Web Forms with master pages, add the header manually by calling GetBrowserTimingHeader() in your master page under the <head> tag: <%= NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.GetBrowserTimingHeader() %> Copy Import the namespace with: <%@ Import Namespace=\"NewRelic.Api.Agent\" %> Copy Other view engines such as Razor For other view engines such as Razor, you can use the GetBrowserTimingHeader() method to generate the header string. Here is a Razor-based view example: <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang=\"en\"> <head> @Html.Raw(NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.GetBrowserTimingHeader()) ... </head> </html> Copy .NET MVC When using .NET MVC, call the Html.Raw helper. That way, .NET MVC will recognize the string of HTML returned from the API as HTML / JavaScript and render it appropriately. Disable instrumentation To disable instrumentation: Disable auto-instrumentation To fully disable auto-instrumentation, edit newrelic.config and set the autoInstrument flag to false: <!-- disable auto instrumentation --> <browserMonitoring autoInstrument=\"false\"/> Copy Important If you change the flag or uninstall the .NET agent, be sure to flush your cache again so that references to the agent are removed from compiled files. Disable auto-instrumentation on a particular view To disable only auto-instrumentation on a particular view, use the agent API call DisableBrowserMonitoring(). Add this call in any view where browser scripts are not needed or wanted. Put this API call as close as possible to the top of the view where you want it disabled. Disable both automatic and manual instrumentation on a particular view To disable both auto-instrumentation and manual instrumentation for individual webpages, use the agent API call DisableBrowserMonitoring(true). Troubleshooting Follow the troubleshooting procedures if you are unable to view any browser timing data.",

      "body": "New Relic's .NET agent supports both .NET Framework and .NET Core. This document describes compatibility and support for .NET Core applications. See Compatibility and requirements for .NET Framework for .NET Framework applications. New Relic's .NET agent includes built-in instrumentation for some of the most popular parts of the .NET Core ecosystem, including frameworks, databases, and message queuing systems. After installation, the agent runs within the monitored process; there is not a separate process or service created by the agent. For frameworks and libraries that are not automatically instrumented out of the box, you can extend the agent with .NET custom instrumentation. Requirements Before you install the New Relic .NET agent on Windows or Linux, make sure your system meets these requirements: Microsoft .NET Core version The .NET agent supports .NET Core versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 3.0, 3.1, and .NET 5.0. Table of minimum agent versions required per .NET Core version .NET Core Version Minimum Required .NET Agent Version .NET Core 2.0 > = 8.19.353.0 .NET Core 2.1 > = 8.19.353.0 .NET Core 2.2 > = 8.19.353.0 .NET Core 3.0 > = 8.21.34.0 .NET Core 3.1 > = 8.21.34.0 .NET 5.0 > = 8.35.0 The agent is not compatible with .NET Core versions 1.0 or 1.1. For .NET Core 2.1 or higher applications with tiered compilation enabled, the agent will disable tiered compilation. .NET Core 2.1 support requires .NET Core runtime 2.1.3 and .NET Core SDK 2.1.401 or higher due to a bug in the .NET Core profiling API. Target framework version The .NET agent only supports applications targeting .NET Core 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 3.0, 3.1, and NET 5.0. You can find the target framework in your .csproj file: Supported: <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.0</TargetFramework> Copy <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework> Copy <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.2</TargetFramework> Copy <TargetFramework>netcoreapp3.0</TargetFramework> Copy <TargetFramework>netcoreapp3.1</TargetFramework> Copy <TargetFramework>net5.0</TargetFramework> Copy Unsupported: <TargetFramework>net452</TargetFramework> Copy Important If you want to monitor an ASP.NET Core application targeting .NET Framework, ensure your install of the .NET agent has .NET Framework support enabled. App/web servers Ensure you use one of these app/web servers: Kestrel Kestrel with IIS reverse proxy via AspNetCoreModule Kestrel with IIS reverse proxy via AspNetCoreModuleV2 Kestrel with Nginx reverse proxy Kestrel with Apache reverse proxy Operating system The agent has been verified to work with the following operating systems: Operating system Supported versions Windows (32- and 64-bit Intel compatible architectures) Server 2008 R2 SP1 Server 2012 Server 2012 R2 Server 2016 Server 2019 Windows containers running on Server 2016 (NanoServer based images are not supported) Linux (64-bit Intel compatible only) All x64 Linux distributions supported by the .NET Core 2.0+/.NET 5 runtime are supported by the .NET agent. For a full list, refer to Microsoft's documentation for the version of the runtime you are using. Microsoft Azure For Azure-specific installation instructions, see: Install on Azure Cloud Services Install on Azure Service Fabric Install on Azure Web Apps Processor architectures The agent is available in both 32-bit (x86) and 64-bit (x64) versions on Windows as well as 64-bit (x64) on Linux. Permissions Installing and running the .NET agent requires these permissions: Component Necessary permissions Install the agent The process or user that installs the agent must have sufficient permissions to set environment variables and write access to the directory where the agent is installed. Run the agent The monitored process must have read/write access to the directory in which you installed the agent. The agent runs as a part of the monitored process and relies on those permissions to function. For applications using IIS via reverse proxy, the group IIS_IUSRS is often used. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Network requirements The agent requires your firewall to allow outgoing connections to specific networks and ports. Automatic instrumentation If your application is hosted in ASP.NET Core, the agent automatically creates and instruments transactions. The .NET agent will automatically instrument your application after install. If your app is not automatically instrumented, or if you want to add instrumentation, use custom instrumentation. App frameworks The .NET agent automatically instruments these application frameworks: ASP.NET Core MVC 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 3.0, 3.1, and 5.0 (includes Web API) Datastores The .NET agent automatically instruments the performance of .NET application calls to these datastores: Datastore Instance details Notes Microsoft SQL Server Use System.Data.SqlClient version 4.3.1 or Microsoft.Data.SqlClient. PostgresSQL Use Npgsql 4.0. Prior versions of Npgsql may also be instrumented, but duplicate and/or missing metrics are possible. MongoDB Use driver version 2.3.x, 2.4.x, 2.5.x, or 2.6.x. Driver version 2.7.x: The .NET agent will support pre-existing API methods, but not new methods introduced in 2.7.x. MySQL Use MySql.Data version 6.10.4. or the MySQL Connector StackExchange.Redis The .NET agent does not directly monitor datastore processes. Also, the .NET SQL parameter capture in a query trace does not list parameters for a parameterized query or a stored procedure. Collecting instance details for supported datastores is enabled by default. To request instance-level information from datastores not currently listed, get support at support.newrelic.com. External call libraries The .NET agent automatically instruments these external call libraries : Libraries Supported methods HttpClient The agent instruments these HttpClient methods: SendAsync GetAsync PostAsync PutAsync DeleteAsync GetStringAsync GetStreamAsync GetByteArrayAsync Messaging The agent automatically instruments these message systems: RabbitMQ 5.1.0 or higher: Puts and takes on messages and queue purge. When receiving messages using an IBasicConsumer, the EventingBasicConsumer is the only implementation that is instrumented by the .NET agent. BasicGet is instrumented, but the agent does not support distributed tracing for BasicGet. Unavailable features The following features are not available for the .NET agent: Memory usage on Linux due to an ongoing .NET Core issue (try using .NET performance metrics to get this information) Automatic brower monitoring script injection (API or manual instrumentation is required) The .NET agent does not support trim self-contained deployments and executables, because the compiler can potentially trim assemblies that the agent depends on. Infinite Tracing is not supported on Alpine Linux due to a GRPC compatibility issue. See this agent issue for more information. Connect the agent to other New Relic products In addition to APM, the .NET agent integrates with other New Relic products to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The browser monitoring JavaScript agent will not be injected by the .NET agent for ASP.NET core applications. However, you can inject the browser agent by using the .NET agent API or the browser agent's copy/paste method. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see browser monitoring and the .NET agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. Dashboards The .NET agent sends default events and attributes for NRQL queries. You can also record custom events for advanced analysis.",

Description Tip This call only allows you to assign values to pre-existing keys. For a more flexible method to create key/value pairs, use AddCustomParameter(). Define user-related custom attributes to associate with a browser page view (user name, account name, and product name). The values are automatically associated with pre-existing keys (user, account, and product), then attached to the parent APM transaction. You can also attach (or \"forward\") these attributes to browser PageView events. Parameters Parameter Description $user_value string Required (can be null). Specify a name or username to associate with this page view. This value is assigned to the user key. $account_value string Required (can be null). Specify the name of a user account to associate with this page view. This value is assigned to the account key. $product_value string Required (can be null). Specify the name of a product to associate with this page view. This value is assigned to the product key.

Requirements Caution This API has been deprecated. Please use the AddCustomAttribute instead. Compatible with all agent versions. Must be called inside a transaction. Description Attaches a custom attribute (a key/value pair) to the current transaction. For the attribute value, you can report either a string or an IConvertible. (The call name is AddCustomParameter because \"custom attributes\" were previously called \"custom parameters.\") Custom attributes can be used to add more detail and context to errors and transaction traces that are being reported to New Relic.

Requirements Caution This API has been deprecated. Please use the AddCustomAttribute instead. Compatible with all agent versions. Must be called inside a transaction. Description Attaches a custom attribute (a key/value pair) to the current transaction. For the attribute value, you can report either a string or an IConvertible. (The call name is AddCustomParameter because \"custom attributes\" were previously called \"custom parameters.\") Custom attributes can be used to add more detail and context to errors and transaction traces that are being reported to New Relic.

(The call name is AddCustomParameter because \"custom attributes\" were previously called \"custom parameters.\") Custom attributes can be used to add more detail and context to errors and transaction traces that are being reported to New Relic. For example, you might add a user name attribute to a transaction to help you filter and analyze your data. You can attach up to 64 attributes per transaction. (Each call to this API method counts as one \"user\" attribute.) You can also attach (or \"forward\") these attributes to browser monitoring's PageView events. For more information, see .NET agent attributes. Important If you want to use your custom parameters or attributes, avoid using any of the reserved terms used by NRQL. Parameters Parameter Description AddCustomParameter(string $key, string $value) Copy $key string Required. The key name to add to the transaction attributes. Only the first 255 characters are retained. $value string Required. The string value to add to the current transaction. There is a 255 character limit. Values that exceed this limit will be discarded. AddCustomParameter(string $key, IConvertible $value) Copy $key string Required. The key name to add to the transaction attributes. Only the first 255 characters are retained. $value IConvertible Required. The numeric value to add to the current transaction. For NRQL functions that require a numeric value (such as min(), max(), or histogram()), you must convert values to singles. Other numeric values will be converted to strings. There is a 255 character limit. Values that exceed this limit will be discarded. Examples Record a numeric value NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.AddCustomParameter(\"UserGuid\", (Single)1234); Copy Record a string value NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.AddCustomParameter(\"UserName\", \"Data Nerd\"); Copy Record both numeric and string value To record attributes for a coupon code (string) and an item ID code (single), you could include this code in the parent method: NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.AddCustomParameter(\"Discount Code\", \"Summer Super Sale\"); NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.AddCustomParameter(\"Item Code\", (Single)31456); Copy",

      "body": "With the .NET agent, you can add browser monitoring instrumentation to your webpages. Before you use browser with your .NET agent, refer to the .NET agent release notes, and make sure you have the installed the latest .NET agent release. Follow the .NET agent requirements to install browser monitoring. Then follow the procedures in this document to manually instrument the .NET agent. Auto-instrumentation Important This feature is not available for asp.net core applications whether they are monitored by the .NET Framework or Core agent. Browser auto-instrumentation is enabled by default. With browser auto-instrumentation, the .NET Framework agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript header into any page that has a content-type of text/html and also has <head> tag within the page. The <head> tag search starts at the beginning of the DOM. The .NET agent injects the JavaScript header through the addition of an HttpModule that modifies the page using HTTP response filters before streaming the content to the user. The first time you enable auto-instrumentation, you may need to clean your asp.net cache directory so that aspx pages are recompiled. Use the following command: flush_dotnet_temp.cmd Copy With this injection, previously functioning pages may stop working if a content-type is not set correctly. To correct, review and update the content-types in your app or disable auto-instrumentation. Manual instrumentation via agent API If you cannot enable auto-instrumentation, you can still include the browser agent manually by using the New Relic .NET agent API and including appropriate code in your pages. To download the NewRelic.Api.agent.dll, re-run the installation and reference the .dll: From the New Relic .NET agent directory, select the New Relic.Net agent section, then select API Assembly. NuGet: Install and reference the .dll by running Install-package NewRelic.Agent.Api. To set up your web application to call the New Relic .NET agent API, add a reference to NewRelic.Api.Agent.dll to your project. Optional: If you are modifying the deployed application directory on the web server, copy NewRelic.Api.Agent.dll into the application's bin directory. Call the API in your <head> tag. If a meta-tag with the X-UA-COMPATIBLE http-equiv attribute exists, set it after that meta tag. .NET Web Forms view engine When using .NET Web Forms view engine, be sure to use = and not :. That way the view engine will recognize the string of HTML returned from the API as HTML / JavaScript and render it appropriately. If you are using .NET ASP Web Forms with master pages, add the header manually by calling GetBrowserTimingHeader() in your master page under the <head> tag: <%= NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.GetBrowserTimingHeader() %> Copy Import the namespace with: <%@ Import Namespace=\"NewRelic.Api.Agent\" %> Copy Other view engines such as Razor For other view engines such as Razor, you can use the GetBrowserTimingHeader() method to generate the header string. Here is a Razor-based view example: <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang=\"en\"> <head> @Html.Raw(NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.GetBrowserTimingHeader()) ... </head> </html> Copy .NET MVC When using .NET MVC, call the Html.Raw helper. That way, .NET MVC will recognize the string of HTML returned from the API as HTML / JavaScript and render it appropriately. Disable instrumentation To disable instrumentation: Disable auto-instrumentation To fully disable auto-instrumentation, edit newrelic.config and set the autoInstrument flag to false: <!-- disable auto instrumentation --> <browserMonitoring autoInstrument=\"false\"/> Copy Important If you change the flag or uninstall the .NET agent, be sure to flush your cache again so that references to the agent are removed from compiled files. Disable auto-instrumentation on a particular view To disable only auto-instrumentation on a particular view, use the agent API call DisableBrowserMonitoring(). Add this call in any view where browser scripts are not needed or wanted. Put this API call as close as possible to the top of the view where you want it disabled. Disable both automatic and manual instrumentation on a particular view To disable both auto-instrumentation and manual instrumentation for individual webpages, use the agent API call DisableBrowserMonitoring(true). Troubleshooting Follow the troubleshooting procedures if you are unable to view any browser timing data.",

The following metrics may be useful in identifying patterns of object allocation and potential over-allocation scenarios. This article further explains the fundamentals of garbage collection in .Net. Tip Garbage collection metrics are available for: All versions of the .Net Framework .Net Core 3.0 and above. Important For .Net Framework applications, the Windows User under which your application runs must have access to windows performance counter data. Usually this is accomplished by adding the user to \"Performance Monitor Users\" and \"Performance Log Users\" groups. Insufficient permissions will result in the agent not collecting garbage collection metrics. Overall Metrics Additionally, the following Garbage collection metrics are collected: GC/Handles The number of references to objects. GC/Induced Normally, the runtime performs garbage collection automatically. This metric identifies the number of times that Garbage Collection was manually invoked by an explicit call to GC.Collect from within application code. GC/PercentTimeInGC (.Net Framework only) The percentage of elapsed time that the .Net runtime has spent performing garbage collection since the last garbage collection cycle. Generation - 0 Heap The following GC Gen0 metrics are collected: GC/Gen0/Size The amount of memory (in MB) that is available to be allocated in Generation 0. This does not indicate the amount of memory that is being used by Generation 0, but the maximum available to be allocated. GC/Gen0/Promoted The amount of memory (in MB) that has survived garbage collection and has been promoted from Gen0 to Gen1. Memory survives garbage collection when there is an active reference to it. GC/Gen0/Collections The number of times Generation 0 Garbage Collection was executed by the garbage collector. Generation - 1 Heap The following GC Gen1 metrics are collected: GC/Gen1/Size The amount of memory (in MB) that is used in the Generation 1 heap. This differs from Gen0/Size which measure the maximum amount of memory available for the generation 0 heap. GC/Gen1/Promoted The amount of memory (in MB) that has survived garbage collection and has been promoted from Gen1 to Gen2. Memory survives garbage collection when there is an active reference to it. GC/Gen1/Collections The number of times Generation 1 Garbage Collection was executed by the garbage collector. Generation - 2 Heap The following GC Gen2 metrics are collected: GC/Gen2/Size The amount of memory (in MB) that is being used by the Gen2 Heap. GC/Gen2/Survived (.Net Core Only) The amount of memory (in MB) that has survived garbage collection. Memory survives garbage collection when there is an active reference to it. Unlike Gen0 and Gen1, memory that survives garbage collection is not promoted. GC/Gen2/Collections The number of times Generation 2 Garbage Collection was executed by the garbage collector. Large Object Heap (LOH) The following GC LOH metrics are collected: GC/LOH/Size The amount of memory (in MB) that is being used by the Large Object Heap (LOH). In .Net Core, the Large Object Heap is sometimes referred to as Gen3. GC/LOH/Survived (.Net Core Only) The amount of memory (in MB) that has survived garbage collection. Memory survives garbage collection when there is an active reference to it. Unlike Gen0 and Gen1, memory that survives garbage collection is not promoted. Managed Thread Pool Metrics The .Net runtime manages a pool of threads. The following metrics provide visibility into the performance of an application in terms of the thread pool and may help identify areas of thread pool starvation. Thread pool starvation/contention occurs when there are not enough threads available to process the requests made by an application. The following article describes the various features of the managed thread pool. Please note that these metrics do not include information about threads that are not managed by the thread pool. Worker Threads Worker threads are CPU-bound threads that are employed to perform work on behalf of a process. Threadpool/Worker/Available Identifies the number of managed threads available to the process. Consistently low numbers indicate a potential starvation scenario. Threadpool/Worker/InUse Identifies the number of worker threads that are currently in use by the process. Completion Threads Completion threads, sometimes referred to as I/O threads, are employed to monitor the completion of I/O operations. Threadpool/Completion/Available This metric identifies the number of threads that are currently available to the process. Consistently low numbers indicate a potential starvation scenario. Threadpool/Completion/InUse This metric identifies the number of completion threads currently in use by the process. Throughput Throughput metrics measure how much work has been requested to be performed on a different thread, the amount of work that has been started, and how much work is waiting for a thread pool resource to become available. Threadpool/Throughput/Requested Identifies the number of times that work has been requested to be run on a different thread pool managed thread. Threadpool/Throughput/Started Identifies the number of work items requested to be run on a separate thread that have started execution. Threadpool/Throughput/QueueLength Identifies the number of work items that have been requested, but are waiting to start. Numbers that consistently increase indicate a potential thread pool starvation situation. The following article describes how to modify the number of threads that are available to an application.",

      "body": "New Relic's .NET agent automatically includes asynchronous framework instrumentation as of agent version 6.0. With the standard async-await pattern, introduced in .NET 4.5, calls to async methods can return even though the work being done in the called method is still in progress. The .NET agent observes this in-progress asynchronous work and waits for it to complete before recording timings. Features supporting async instrumentation With the addition of async support, new features are available in New Relic's .NET agent. However, as part of this enhancement, a small number of features previously provided by the agent currently are not available. Except as noted, the agent does not instrument async methods for any of the other supported frameworks for the .NET agent. HttpClient async methods The agent instruments these HttpClient async methods: SendAsync GetAsync PostAsync PutAsync DeleteAsync GetStringAsync GetStreamAsync GetByteArrayAsync RestClient async methods The agent instruments these RestClient async methods: ExecuteTaskAsync ExecuteGetTaskAsync ExecutePostTaskAsync SqlCommand async methods The agent instruments these SqlCommand async methods: ExecuteReaderAsync ExecuteNonQueryAsync ExecuteScalarAsync ExecuteXmlReaderAsync SqlDataReader async methods The agent instruments these SqlDataReader async methods: NextResultAsync ReadAsync NpgsqlCommand async methods (Postgres) The agent instruments these NpgsqlCommand async methods (Postgres): ExecuteReaderAsync ExecuteNonQueryAsync ExecuteScalarAsync Custom instrumentation The .NET agent supports custom instrumentation of your own async methods. Known limitations Here is a summary of known limitations for async instrumentation with New Relic's .NET agent. Requires updated ASP pipeline The .NET agent will not instrument async methods if the legacy ASP pipeline is present. Since Microsoft replaced the legacy ASP pipeline well before async methods were introduced, this issue typically only affects applications created under .NET Framework 4.0 or lower, then migrated to .NET Framework 4.5 or higher. To see if this issue affects your application, and how to resolve it if it does, review the troubleshooting procedures. Instrumented async methods must have return type of Task or Task<T>, not void The .NET agent does not support instrumentation of async methods that have return type of anything other than Task or Task<T>. The agent does not support async void methods. For more information, refer to the Microsoft documentation about async return types: Task < TResult> return type Async void and generalized async return types No instrumentation for begin* and end* style The .NET agent does not instrument any .NET methods that use the begin* and end* style, except for WCF applications. Outside of this exception, if your application calls these types of methods, the agent will not create segments for them. However, the rest of your transactions and segments will be created correctly. No capture of scoped metrics/segments in manually created threads The .NET agent does not capture scoped metrics or segments within threads that are manually created by your application. For instrumented async methods, use await, not Task.Result() If your application calls instrumented async methods, use await rather than Task related methods like Task.Result() to wait for the results. Otherwise, instrumentation may not work properly. In general, avoid using Task.Result() when calling async methods. It can lead to deadlocks. ContinueWith({}) block may affect timing measurements If you add your own ContinueWith({}) block to the promise returned by an instrumented async method, it may affect timing measurements reported by the instrumentation. For example, the time may include the time your ContinueWith takes to execute. Problem with nesting in IIS-hosted WCF apps IIS-hosted WCF services do not properly nest the WCF segment under the ExecuteRequestHandler segment. The two segments will appear to be siblings within a transaction trace, even though their reported total time will be accurate. Segments don't auto-create stack traces Segments in a transaction trace will not generate stack traces automatically, even if they run longer than transaction_tracer.stack_trace_threshold.",

      "body": "With the .NET agent, you can add browser monitoring instrumentation to your webpages. Before you use browser with your .NET agent, refer to the .NET agent release notes, and make sure you have the installed the latest .NET agent release. Follow the .NET agent requirements to install browser monitoring. Then follow the procedures in this document to manually instrument the .NET agent. Auto-instrumentation Important This feature is not available for asp.net core applications whether they are monitored by the .NET Framework or Core agent. Browser auto-instrumentation is enabled by default. With browser auto-instrumentation, the .NET Framework agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript header into any page that has a content-type of text/html and also has <head> tag within the page. The <head> tag search starts at the beginning of the DOM. The .NET agent injects the JavaScript header through the addition of an HttpModule that modifies the page using HTTP response filters before streaming the content to the user. The first time you enable auto-instrumentation, you may need to clean your asp.net cache directory so that aspx pages are recompiled. Use the following command: flush_dotnet_temp.cmd Copy With this injection, previously functioning pages may stop working if a content-type is not set correctly. To correct, review and update the content-types in your app or disable auto-instrumentation. Manual instrumentation via agent API If you cannot enable auto-instrumentation, you can still include the browser agent manually by using the New Relic .NET agent API and including appropriate code in your pages. To download the NewRelic.Api.agent.dll, re-run the installation and reference the .dll: From the New Relic .NET agent directory, select the New Relic.Net agent section, then select API Assembly. NuGet: Install and reference the .dll by running Install-package NewRelic.Agent.Api. To set up your web application to call the New Relic .NET agent API, add a reference to NewRelic.Api.Agent.dll to your project. Optional: If you are modifying the deployed application directory on the web server, copy NewRelic.Api.Agent.dll into the application's bin directory. Call the API in your <head> tag. If a meta-tag with the X-UA-COMPATIBLE http-equiv attribute exists, set it after that meta tag. .NET Web Forms view engine When using .NET Web Forms view engine, be sure to use = and not :. That way the view engine will recognize the string of HTML returned from the API as HTML / JavaScript and render it appropriately. If you are using .NET ASP Web Forms with master pages, add the header manually by calling GetBrowserTimingHeader() in your master page under the <head> tag: <%= NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.GetBrowserTimingHeader() %> Copy Import the namespace with: <%@ Import Namespace=\"NewRelic.Api.Agent\" %> Copy Other view engines such as Razor For other view engines such as Razor, you can use the GetBrowserTimingHeader() method to generate the header string. Here is a Razor-based view example: <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang=\"en\"> <head> @Html.Raw(NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.GetBrowserTimingHeader()) ... </head> </html> Copy .NET MVC When using .NET MVC, call the Html.Raw helper. That way, .NET MVC will recognize the string of HTML returned from the API as HTML / JavaScript and render it appropriately. Disable instrumentation To disable instrumentation: Disable auto-instrumentation To fully disable auto-instrumentation, edit newrelic.config and set the autoInstrument flag to false: <!-- disable auto instrumentation --> <browserMonitoring autoInstrument=\"false\"/> Copy Important If you change the flag or uninstall the .NET agent, be sure to flush your cache again so that references to the agent are removed from compiled files. Disable auto-instrumentation on a particular view To disable only auto-instrumentation on a particular view, use the agent API call DisableBrowserMonitoring(). Add this call in any view where browser scripts are not needed or wanted. Put this API call as close as possible to the top of the view where you want it disabled. Disable both automatic and manual instrumentation on a particular view To disable both auto-instrumentation and manual instrumentation for individual webpages, use the agent API call DisableBrowserMonitoring(true).

Features supporting async instrumentation With the addition of async support, new features are available in New Relic's .NET agent.

Known limitations Here is a summary of known limitations for async instrumentation with New Relic's .NET agent. Requires updated ASP pipeline The .NET agent will not instrument async methods if the legacy ASP pipeline is present. Since Microsoft replaced the legacy ASP pipeline well before async methods were introduced, this issue typically only affects applications created under .NET Framework 4.0 or lower, then migrated to .NET Framework 4.5 or higher. To see if this issue affects your application, and how to resolve it if it does, review the troubleshooting procedures. Instrumented async methods must have return type of Task or Task<T>, not void The .NET agent does not support instrumentation of async methods that have return type of anything other than Task or Task<T>. The agent does not support async void methods. For more information, refer to the Microsoft documentation about async return types: Task < TResult> return type Async void and generalized async return types No instrumentation for begin* and end* style The .NET agent does not instrument any .NET methods that use the begin* and end* style, except for WCF applications. Outside of this exception, if your application calls these types of methods, the agent will not create segments for them. However, the rest of your transactions and segments will be created correctly. No capture of scoped metrics/segments in manually created threads The .NET agent does not capture scoped metrics or segments within threads that are manually created by your application. For instrumented async methods, use await, not Task.Result() If your application calls instrumented async methods, use await rather than Task related methods like Task.Result() to wait for the results. Otherwise, instrumentation may not work properly. In general, avoid using Task.Result() when calling async methods. It can lead to deadlocks. ContinueWith({}) block may affect timing measurements If you add your own ContinueWith({}) block to the promise returned by an instrumented async method, it may affect timing measurements reported by the instrumentation. For example, the time may include the time your ContinueWith takes to execute. Problem with nesting in IIS-hosted WCF apps IIS-hosted WCF services do not properly nest the WCF segment under the ExecuteRequestHandler segment. The two segments will appear to be siblings within a transaction trace, even though their reported total time will be accurate. Segments don't auto-create stack traces Segments in a transaction trace will not generate stack traces automatically, even if they run longer than transaction_tracer.stack_trace_threshold.",

      "body": "New Relic's .Net Agent collects metrics from the .Net runtime about the performance of your application. These metrics can provide insight into how much CPU and memory an application consumes as well as how the performance of an application may be impacted by garbage collection and thread pool resource contention. The full suite of .Net Performance Metrics is available .Net Agent versions 8.20 and higher. To view these metrics, create a custom dashboard. CPU Metrics The following CPU Metrics are collected: CPU/User/Utilization The percentage of CPU that is consumed by this process. CPU/User Time The amount of time the process has spent executing application code. Memory Metrics The following Memory Metrics are collected: Memory/Physical The amount of private (physical) memory, in MB, allocated to the process. Memory/WorkingSet Amount of physical memory allocated to the process. Garbage Collection Metrics The .Net Garbage collector runs in the background and is responsible for identifying and reclaiming memory tied to objects that are no longer referenced by an application. The following metrics may be useful in identifying patterns of object allocation and potential over-allocation scenarios. This article further explains the fundamentals of garbage collection in .Net. Tip Garbage collection metrics are available for: All versions of the .Net Framework .Net Core 3.0 and above. Important For .Net Framework applications, the Windows User under which your application runs must have access to windows performance counter data. Usually this is accomplished by adding the user to \"Performance Monitor Users\" and \"Performance Log Users\" groups. Insufficient permissions will result in the agent not collecting garbage collection metrics. Overall Metrics Additionally, the following Garbage collection metrics are collected: GC/Handles The number of references to objects. GC/Induced Normally, the runtime performs garbage collection automatically. This metric identifies the number of times that Garbage Collection was manually invoked by an explicit call to GC.Collect from within application code. GC/PercentTimeInGC (.Net Framework only) The percentage of elapsed time that the .Net runtime has spent performing garbage collection since the last garbage collection cycle. Generation - 0 Heap The following GC Gen0 metrics are collected: GC/Gen0/Size The amount of memory (in MB) that is available to be allocated in Generation 0. This does not indicate the amount of memory that is being used by Generation 0, but the maximum available to be allocated. GC/Gen0/Promoted The amount of memory (in MB) that has survived garbage collection and has been promoted from Gen0 to Gen1. Memory survives garbage collection when there is an active reference to it. GC/Gen0/Collections The number of times Generation 0 Garbage Collection was executed by the garbage collector. Generation - 1 Heap The following GC Gen1 metrics are collected: GC/Gen1/Size The amount of memory (in MB) that is used in the Generation 1 heap. This differs from Gen0/Size which measure the maximum amount of memory available for the generation 0 heap. GC/Gen1/Promoted The amount of memory (in MB) that has survived garbage collection and has been promoted from Gen1 to Gen2. Memory survives garbage collection when there is an active reference to it. GC/Gen1/Collections The number of times Generation 1 Garbage Collection was executed by the garbage collector. Generation - 2 Heap The following GC Gen2 metrics are collected: GC/Gen2/Size The amount of memory (in MB) that is being used by the Gen2 Heap. GC/Gen2/Survived (.Net Core Only) The amount of memory (in MB) that has survived garbage collection. Memory survives garbage collection when there is an active reference to it. Unlike Gen0 and Gen1, memory that survives garbage collection is not promoted. GC/Gen2/Collections The number of times Generation 2 Garbage Collection was executed by the garbage collector. Large Object Heap (LOH) The following GC LOH metrics are collected: GC/LOH/Size The amount of memory (in MB) that is being used by the Large Object Heap (LOH). In .Net Core, the Large Object Heap is sometimes referred to as Gen3. GC/LOH/Survived (.Net Core Only) The amount of memory (in MB) that has survived garbage collection. Memory survives garbage collection when there is an active reference to it. Unlike Gen0 and Gen1, memory that survives garbage collection is not promoted. Managed Thread Pool Metrics The .Net runtime manages a pool of threads. The following metrics provide visibility into the performance of an application in terms of the thread pool and may help identify areas of thread pool starvation. Thread pool starvation/contention occurs when there are not enough threads available to process the requests made by an application. The following article describes the various features of the managed thread pool. Please note that these metrics do not include information about threads that are not managed by the thread pool. Worker Threads Worker threads are CPU-bound threads that are employed to perform work on behalf of a process. Threadpool/Worker/Available Identifies the number of managed threads available to the process. Consistently low numbers indicate a potential starvation scenario. Threadpool/Worker/InUse Identifies the number of worker threads that are currently in use by the process. Completion Threads Completion threads, sometimes referred to as I/O threads, are employed to monitor the completion of I/O operations. Threadpool/Completion/Available This metric identifies the number of threads that are currently available to the process. Consistently low numbers indicate a potential starvation scenario. Threadpool/Completion/InUse This metric identifies the number of completion threads currently in use by the process. Throughput Throughput metrics measure how much work has been requested to be performed on a different thread, the amount of work that has been started, and how much work is waiting for a thread pool resource to become available. Threadpool/Throughput/Requested Identifies the number of times that work has been requested to be run on a different thread pool managed thread. Threadpool/Throughput/Started Identifies the number of work items requested to be run on a separate thread that have started execution. Threadpool/Throughput/QueueLength Identifies the number of work items that have been requested, but are waiting to start. Numbers that consistently increase indicate a potential thread pool starvation situation. The following article describes how to modify the number of threads that are available to an application.",

Instrumented async methods must have return type of Task or Task<T>, not void The .NET agent does not support instrumentation of async methods that have return type of anything other than Task or Task<T>. The agent does not support async void methods. For more information, refer to the Microsoft documentation about async return types: Task < TResult> return type Async void and generalized async return types No instrumentation for begin* and end* style The .NET agent does not instrument any .NET methods that use the begin* and end* style, except for WCF applications. Outside of this exception, if your application calls these types of methods, the agent will not create segments for them. However, the rest of your transactions and segments will be created correctly. No capture of scoped metrics/segments in manually created threads The .NET agent does not capture scoped metrics or segments within threads that are manually created by your application. For instrumented async methods, use await, not Task.Result() If your application calls instrumented async methods, use await rather than Task related methods like Task.Result() to wait for the results. Otherwise, instrumentation may not work properly. In general, avoid using Task.Result() when calling async methods. It can lead to deadlocks. ContinueWith({}) block may affect timing measurements If you add your own ContinueWith({}) block to the promise returned by an instrumented async method, it may affect timing measurements reported by the instrumentation. For example, the time may include the time your ContinueWith takes to execute. Problem with nesting in IIS-hosted WCF apps IIS-hosted WCF services do not properly nest the WCF segment under the ExecuteRequestHandler segment. The two segments will appear to be siblings within a transaction trace, even though their reported total time will be accurate. Segments don't auto-create stack traces Segments in a transaction trace will not generate stack traces automatically, even if they run longer than transaction_tracer.stack_trace_threshold.",

Requirements Caution This API has been deprecated. Please use the AddCustomAttribute instead. Compatible with all agent versions. Must be called inside a transaction. Description Attaches a custom attribute (a key/value pair) to the current transaction. For the attribute value, you can report either a string or an IConvertible. (The call name is AddCustomParameter because \"custom attributes\" were previously called \"custom parameters.\") Custom attributes can be used to add more detail and context to errors and transaction traces that are being reported to New Relic. For example, you might add a user name attribute to a transaction to help you filter and analyze your data. You can attach up to 64 attributes per transaction. (Each call to this API method counts as one \"user\" attribute.) You can also attach (or \"forward\") these attributes to browser monitoring's PageView events.

Only the first 255 characters are retained. $value IConvertible Required. The numeric value to add to the current transaction. For NRQL functions that require a numeric value (such as min(), max(), or histogram()), you must convert values to singles. Other numeric values will be converted to strings.

Requirements Caution This API has been deprecated. Please use the AddCustomAttribute instead. Compatible with all agent versions. Must be called inside a transaction. Description Attaches a custom attribute (a key/value pair) to the current transaction. For the attribute value, you can report either a string or an IConvertible. (The call name is AddCustomParameter because \"custom attributes\" were previously called \"custom parameters.\") Custom attributes can be used to add more detail and context to errors and transaction traces that are being reported to New Relic. For example, you might add a user name attribute to a transaction to help you filter and analyze your data. You can attach up to 64 attributes per transaction. (Each call to this API method counts as one \"user\" attribute.) You can also attach (or \"forward\") these attributes to browser monitoring's PageView events.

Only the first 255 characters are retained. $value IConvertible Required. The numeric value to add to the current transaction. For NRQL functions that require a numeric value (such as min(), max(), or histogram()), you must convert values to singles. Other numeric values will be converted to strings.

Follow the troubleshooting procedures for missing data as applicable. Verify whether your pages are rendered using ASPs. If you use another rendering technology, use manual instrumentation. Flush your .NET cache. Set the <head> tag of your pages to render on the server. Verify that your agent is configured to auto-instrument pages. Edit newrelic.config and verify that autoInstrument is set to true: <browserMonitoring autoInstrument=\"true\"/> Copy Check whether IIS page compression is disabled. If compressed before the .NET agent attempts browser instrumentation, the necessary <HEAD> tag won't be found. For instructions on how to check that, see Microsoft documentation. Look at the source of one of your pages through a browser. Look for a script with references to NREUMQ at the top and bottom of your pages. If you get support at support.newrelic.com, mention whether you are seeing this JavaScript in the page header or in some other location in the page, or you are not seeing it at all. Here are some additional troubleshooting tips: Browser problems Additional troubleshooting tips for .NET agent IIS exception error With IIS, you may receive an InvalidOperationException that states: Post cache substitution is not compatible with modules in the IIS integrated pipeline that modify the response buffers.

Auto-instrumentation Important This feature is not available for asp.net core applications whether they are monitored by the .NET Framework or Core agent.

Before you use browser with your .NET agent, refer to the .NET agent release notes, and make sure you have the installed the latest .NET agent release. Follow the .NET agent requirements to install browser monitoring. Then follow the procedures in this document to manually instrument the .NET agent. Auto-instrumentation Important This feature is not available for asp.net core applications whether they are monitored by the .NET Framework or Core agent. Browser auto-instrumentation is enabled by default. With browser auto-instrumentation, the .NET Framework agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript header into any page that has a content-type of text/html and also has <head> tag within the page. The <head> tag search starts at the beginning of the DOM. The .NET agent injects the JavaScript header through the addition of an HttpModule that modifies the page using HTTP response filters before streaming the content to the user. The first time you enable auto-instrumentation, you may need to clean your asp.net cache directory so that aspx pages are recompiled. Use the following command: flush_dotnet_temp.cmd Copy With this injection, previously functioning pages may stop working if a content-type is not set correctly. To correct, review and update the content-types in your app or disable auto-instrumentation. Manual instrumentation via agent API If you cannot enable auto-instrumentation, you can still include the browser agent manually by using the New Relic .NET agent API and including appropriate code in your pages. To download the NewRelic.Api.agent.dll, re-run the installation and reference the .dll: From the New Relic .NET agent directory, select the New Relic.Net agent section, then select API Assembly. NuGet: Install and reference the .dll by running Install-package NewRelic.Agent.Api. To set up your web application to call the New Relic .NET agent API, add a reference to NewRelic.Api.Agent.dll to your project. Optional: If you are modifying the deployed application directory on the web server, copy NewRelic.Api.Agent.dll into the application's bin directory. Call the API in your <head> tag. If a meta-tag with the X-UA-COMPATIBLE http-equiv attribute exists, set it after that meta tag. .NET Web Forms view engine When using .NET Web Forms view engine, be sure to use = and not :. That way the view engine will recognize the string of HTML returned from the API as HTML / JavaScript and render it appropriately.

That way, .NET MVC will recognize the string of HTML returned from the API as HTML / JavaScript and render it appropriately. Disable instrumentation To disable instrumentation: Disable auto-instrumentation To fully disable auto-instrumentation, edit newrelic.config and set the autoInstrument flag to false: <!-- disable auto instrumentation --> <browserMonitoring autoInstrument=\"false\"/> Copy Important If you change the flag or uninstall the .NET agent, be sure to flush your cache again so that references to the agent are removed from compiled files. Disable auto-instrumentation on a particular view To disable only auto-instrumentation on a particular view, use the agent API call DisableBrowserMonitoring().

Before you use browser with your .NET agent, refer to the .NET agent release notes, and make sure you have the installed the latest .NET agent release. Follow the .NET agent requirements to install browser monitoring. Then follow the procedures in this document to manually instrument the .NET agent. Auto-instrumentation Important This feature is not available for asp.net core applications whether they are monitored by the .NET Framework or Core agent. Browser auto-instrumentation is enabled by default. With browser auto-instrumentation, the .NET Framework agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript header into any page that has a content-type of text/html and also has <head> tag within the page. The <head> tag search starts at the beginning of the DOM. The .NET agent injects the JavaScript header through the addition of an HttpModule that modifies the page using HTTP response filters before streaming the content to the user. The first time you enable auto-instrumentation, you may need to clean your asp.net cache directory so that aspx pages are recompiled. Use the following command: flush_dotnet_temp.cmd Copy With this injection, previously functioning pages may stop working if a content-type is not set correctly. To correct, review and update the content-types in your app or disable auto-instrumentation. Manual instrumentation via agent API If you cannot enable auto-instrumentation, you can still include the browser agent manually by using the New Relic .NET agent API and including appropriate code in your pages. To download the NewRelic.Api.agent.dll, re-run the installation and reference the .dll: From the New Relic .NET agent directory, select the New Relic.Net agent section, then select API Assembly. NuGet: Install and reference the .dll by running Install-package NewRelic.Agent.Api. To set up your web application to call the New Relic .NET agent API, add a reference to NewRelic.Api.Agent.dll to your project. Optional: If you are modifying the deployed application directory on the web server, copy NewRelic.Api.Agent.dll into the application's bin directory. Call the API in your <head> tag. If a meta-tag with the X-UA-COMPATIBLE http-equiv attribute exists, set it after that meta tag. .NET Web Forms view engine When using .NET Web Forms view engine, be sure to use = and not :. That way the view engine will recognize the string of HTML returned from the API as HTML / JavaScript and render it appropriately. If you are using .NET ASP Web Forms with master pages, add the header manually by calling GetBrowserTimingHeader() in your master page under the <head> tag: <%= NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.GetBrowserTimingHeader() %> Copy Import the namespace with: <%@ Import Namespace=\"NewRelic.Api.Agent\" %> Copy Other view engines such as Razor For other view engines such as Razor, you can use the GetBrowserTimingHeader() method to generate the header string. Here is a Razor-based view example: <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang=\"en\"> <head> @Html.Raw(NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.GetBrowserTimingHeader()) ... </head> </html> Copy .NET MVC When using .NET MVC, call the Html.Raw helper. That way, .NET MVC will recognize the string of HTML returned from the API as HTML / JavaScript and render it appropriately. Disable instrumentation To disable instrumentation: Disable auto-instrumentation To fully disable auto-instrumentation, edit newrelic.config and set the autoInstrument flag to false: <!-- disable auto instrumentation --> <browserMonitoring autoInstrument=\"false\"/> Copy Important If you change the flag or uninstall the .NET agent, be sure to flush your cache again so that references to the agent are removed from compiled files. Disable auto-instrumentation on a particular view To disable only auto-instrumentation on a particular view, use the agent API call DisableBrowserMonitoring(). Add this call in any view where browser scripts are not needed or wanted. Put this API call as close as possible to the top of the view where you want it disabled.

To download the NewRelic.Api.agent.dll, re-run the installation and reference the .dll: From the New Relic .NET agent directory, select the New Relic.Net agent section, then select API Assembly. NuGet: Install and reference the .dll by running Install-package NewRelic.Agent.Api. To set up your web application to call the New Relic .NET agent API, add a reference to NewRelic.Api.Agent.dll to your project. Optional: If you are modifying the deployed application directory on the web server, copy NewRelic.Api.Agent.dll into the application's bin directory. Call the API in your <head> tag. If a meta-tag with the X-UA-COMPATIBLE http-equiv attribute exists, set it after that meta tag. .NET Web Forms view engine When using .NET Web Forms view engine, be sure to use = and not :. That way the view engine will recognize the string of HTML returned from the API as HTML / JavaScript and render it appropriately. If you are using .NET ASP Web Forms with master pages, add the header manually by calling GetBrowserTimingHeader() in your master page under the <head> tag: <%= NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.GetBrowserTimingHeader() %> Copy Import the namespace with: <%@ Import Namespace=\"NewRelic.Api.Agent\" %> Copy Other view engines such as Razor For other view engines such as Razor, you can use the GetBrowserTimingHeader() method to generate the header string. Here is a Razor-based view example: <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang=\"en\"> <head> @Html.Raw(NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.GetBrowserTimingHeader()) ... </head> </html> Copy .NET MVC When using .NET MVC, call the Html.Raw helper. That way, .NET MVC will recognize the string of HTML returned from the API as HTML / JavaScript and render it appropriately. Disable instrumentation To disable instrumentation: Disable auto-instrumentation To fully disable auto-instrumentation, edit newrelic.config and set the autoInstrument flag to false: <!-- disable auto instrumentation --> <browserMonitoring autoInstrument=\"false\"/> Copy Important If you change the flag or uninstall the .NET agent, be sure to flush your cache again so that references to the agent are removed from compiled files. Disable auto-instrumentation on a particular view To disable only auto-instrumentation on a particular view, use the agent API call DisableBrowserMonitoring(). Add this call in any view where browser scripts are not needed or wanted. Put this API call as close as possible to the top of the view where you want it disabled. Disable both automatic and manual instrumentation on a particular view To disable both auto-instrumentation and manual instrumentation for individual webpages, use the agent API call DisableBrowserMonitoring(true).

Before you use browser with your .NET agent, refer to the .NET agent release notes, and make sure you have the installed the latest .NET agent release. Follow the .NET agent requirements to install browser monitoring. Then follow the procedures in this document to manually instrument the .NET agent. Auto-instrumentation Important This feature is not available for asp.net core applications whether they are monitored by the .NET Framework or Core agent. Browser auto-instrumentation is enabled by default. With browser auto-instrumentation, the .NET Framework agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript header into any page that has a content-type of text/html and also has <head> tag within the page. The <head> tag search starts at the beginning of the DOM. The .NET agent injects the JavaScript header through the addition of an HttpModule that modifies the page using HTTP response filters before streaming the content to the user. The first time you enable auto-instrumentation, you may need to clean your asp.net cache directory so that aspx pages are recompiled. Use the following command: flush_dotnet_temp.cmd Copy With this injection, previously functioning pages may stop working if a content-type is not set correctly. To correct, review and update the content-types in your app or disable auto-instrumentation.

      "body": "With the .NET agent, you can add browser monitoring instrumentation to your webpages. Before you use browser with your .NET agent, refer to the .NET agent release notes, and make sure you have the installed the latest .NET agent release. Follow the .NET agent requirements to install browser monitoring. Then follow the procedures in this document to manually instrument the .NET agent. Auto-instrumentation Important This feature is not available for asp.net core applications whether they are monitored by the .NET Framework or Core agent. Browser auto-instrumentation is enabled by default. With browser auto-instrumentation, the .NET Framework agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript header into any page that has a content-type of text/html and also has <head> tag within the page. The <head> tag search starts at the beginning of the DOM. The .NET agent injects the JavaScript header through the addition of an HttpModule that modifies the page using HTTP response filters before streaming the content to the user. The first time you enable auto-instrumentation, you may need to clean your asp.net cache directory so that aspx pages are recompiled. Use the following command: flush_dotnet_temp.cmd Copy With this injection, previously functioning pages may stop working if a content-type is not set correctly. To correct, review and update the content-types in your app or disable auto-instrumentation. Manual instrumentation via agent API If you cannot enable auto-instrumentation, you can still include the browser agent manually by using the New Relic .NET agent API and including appropriate code in your pages. To download the NewRelic.Api.agent.dll, re-run the installation and reference the .dll: From the New Relic .NET agent directory, select the New Relic.Net agent section, then select API Assembly. NuGet: Install and reference the .dll by running Install-package NewRelic.Agent.Api. To set up your web application to call the New Relic .NET agent API, add a reference to NewRelic.Api.Agent.dll to your project. Optional: If you are modifying the deployed application directory on the web server, copy NewRelic.Api.Agent.dll into the application's bin directory. Call the API in your <head> tag. If a meta-tag with the X-UA-COMPATIBLE http-equiv attribute exists, set it after that meta tag. .NET Web Forms view engine When using .NET Web Forms view engine, be sure to use = and not :. That way the view engine will recognize the string of HTML returned from the API as HTML / JavaScript and render it appropriately. If you are using .NET ASP Web Forms with master pages, add the header manually by calling GetBrowserTimingHeader() in your master page under the <head> tag: <%= NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.GetBrowserTimingHeader() %> Copy Import the namespace with: <%@ Import Namespace=\"NewRelic.Api.Agent\" %> Copy Other view engines such as Razor For other view engines such as Razor, you can use the GetBrowserTimingHeader() method to generate the header string. Here is a Razor-based view example: <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang=\"en\"> <head> @Html.Raw(NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.GetBrowserTimingHeader()) ... </head> </html> Copy .NET MVC When using .NET MVC, call the Html.Raw helper. That way, .NET MVC will recognize the string of HTML returned from the API as HTML / JavaScript and render it appropriately. Disable instrumentation To disable instrumentation: Disable auto-instrumentation To fully disable auto-instrumentation, edit newrelic.config and set the autoInstrument flag to false: <!-- disable auto instrumentation --> <browserMonitoring autoInstrument=\"false\"/> Copy Important If you change the flag or uninstall the .NET agent, be sure to flush your cache again so that references to the agent are removed from compiled files. Disable auto-instrumentation on a particular view To disable only auto-instrumentation on a particular view, use the agent API call DisableBrowserMonitoring(). Add this call in any view where browser scripts are not needed or wanted. Put this API call as close as possible to the top of the view where you want it disabled. Disable both automatic and manual instrumentation on a particular view To disable both auto-instrumentation and manual instrumentation for individual webpages, use the agent API call DisableBrowserMonitoring(true).

      "body": "With the .NET agent, you can add browser monitoring instrumentation to your webpages. Before you use browser with your .NET agent, refer to the .NET agent release notes, and make sure you have the installed the latest .NET agent release. Follow the .NET agent requirements to install browser monitoring. Then follow the procedures in this document to manually instrument the .NET agent. Auto-instrumentation Important This feature is not available for asp.net core applications whether they are monitored by the .NET Framework or Core agent. Browser auto-instrumentation is enabled by default. With browser auto-instrumentation, the .NET Framework agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript header into any page that has a content-type of text/html and also has <head> tag within the page. The <head> tag search starts at the beginning of the DOM. The .NET agent injects the JavaScript header through the addition of an HttpModule that modifies the page using HTTP response filters before streaming the content to the user. The first time you enable auto-instrumentation, you may need to clean your asp.net cache directory so that aspx pages are recompiled. Use the following command: flush_dotnet_temp.cmd Copy With this injection, previously functioning pages may stop working if a content-type is not set correctly. To correct, review and update the content-types in your app or disable auto-instrumentation. Manual instrumentation via agent API If you cannot enable auto-instrumentation, you can still include the browser agent manually by using the New Relic .NET agent API and including appropriate code in your pages. To download the NewRelic.Api.agent.dll, re-run the installation and reference the .dll: From the New Relic .NET agent directory, select the New Relic.Net agent section, then select API Assembly. NuGet: Install and reference the .dll by running Install-package NewRelic.Agent.Api. To set up your web application to call the New Relic .NET agent API, add a reference to NewRelic.Api.Agent.dll to your project. Optional: If you are modifying the deployed application directory on the web server, copy NewRelic.Api.Agent.dll into the application's bin directory. Call the API in your <head> tag. If a meta-tag with the X-UA-COMPATIBLE http-equiv attribute exists, set it after that meta tag. .NET Web Forms view engine When using .NET Web Forms view engine, be sure to use = and not :. That way the view engine will recognize the string of HTML returned from the API as HTML / JavaScript and render it appropriately. If you are using .NET ASP Web Forms with master pages, add the header manually by calling GetBrowserTimingHeader() in your master page under the <head> tag: <%= NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.GetBrowserTimingHeader() %> Copy Import the namespace with: <%@ Import Namespace=\"NewRelic.Api.Agent\" %> Copy Other view engines such as Razor For other view engines such as Razor, you can use the GetBrowserTimingHeader() method to generate the header string. Here is a Razor-based view example: <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang=\"en\"> <head> @Html.Raw(NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.GetBrowserTimingHeader()) ... </head> </html> Copy .NET MVC When using .NET MVC, call the Html.Raw helper. That way, .NET MVC will recognize the string of HTML returned from the API as HTML / JavaScript and render it appropriately. Disable instrumentation To disable instrumentation: Disable auto-instrumentation To fully disable auto-instrumentation, edit newrelic.config and set the autoInstrument flag to false: <!-- disable auto instrumentation --> <browserMonitoring autoInstrument=\"false\"/> Copy Important If you change the flag or uninstall the .NET agent, be sure to flush your cache again so that references to the agent are removed from compiled files. Disable auto-instrumentation on a particular view To disable only auto-instrumentation on a particular view, use the agent API call DisableBrowserMonitoring(). Add this call in any view where browser scripts are not needed or wanted. Put this API call as close as possible to the top of the view where you want it disabled. Disable both automatic and manual instrumentation on a particular view To disable both auto-instrumentation and manual instrumentation for individual webpages, use the agent API call DisableBrowserMonitoring(true).

Microsoft Azure users: See the Azure troubleshooting solutions. No browser data appears: See the troubleshooting tips when using the browser agent. Basic solutions To troubleshoot the most common reasons for missing data, try these solutions as applicable. Basic solutions Comments Check app and framework for compatibility with agent .NET Framework compatibility and requirements or .NET Core compatibility and requirements Configure for short-lived .NET process If you have a short-lived (below 60 seconds) process, it may not report data. For more information, see Monitor short-lived processes. .NET Core: Check Kestrel requirements. Make sure you are using a Kestrel app/web server supported by New Relic. Otherwise, you may need to ensure your .NET agent has .NET Framework support enabled. .NET Core: Check environment variables. Make sure you have configured all the required environment variables, then restart the agent. .NET Framework: Restart IIS. If your app is not receiving traffic, no data will be reported to New Relic. To restart IIS: From a command line, run IISRESET. Verify that traffic is being sent to your application. Run New Relic Diagnostics. To try to automatically identify the issue, use New Relic Diagnostics. Check for profiler conflicts. If you are using Microsoft's System Center Operations Manager (SCOM), follow the troubleshooting procedures to resolve .NET and SCOM conflicts. Review log files. If log files exist, open them and review for errors. Advanced solutions To remedy more complex issues when no data appears, try these solutions as applicable: Advanced solutions Comments .NET Framework: Check Registry permissions. Check for a registry key permissions error. .NET Framework: Run Windows Event Viewer. If applicable: Run the Windows Event Viewer, and look for application events from the New Relic .NET Profiler. Search for messages whose source is the New Relic .NET Profiler or New Relic .NET agent. If there are no New Relic event messages, look for messages from the .NET Runtime. For more information, see No data or event log: CoCreate errors. Get debug logs. If your logs did not show errors, increase the logging level temporarily to collect debug logs. Check proxy settings.

      "body": "With the .NET agent, you can add browser monitoring instrumentation to your webpages. Before you use browser with your .NET agent, refer to the .NET agent release notes, and make sure you have the installed the latest .NET agent release. Follow the .NET agent requirements to install browser monitoring. Then follow the procedures in this document to manually instrument the .NET agent. Auto-instrumentation Important This feature is not available for asp.net core applications whether they are monitored by the .NET Framework or Core agent. Browser auto-instrumentation is enabled by default. With browser auto-instrumentation, the .NET Framework agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript header into any page that has a content-type of text/html and also has <head> tag within the page. The <head> tag search starts at the beginning of the DOM. The .NET agent injects the JavaScript header through the addition of an HttpModule that modifies the page using HTTP response filters before streaming the content to the user. The first time you enable auto-instrumentation, you may need to clean your asp.net cache directory so that aspx pages are recompiled. Use the following command: flush_dotnet_temp.cmd Copy With this injection, previously functioning pages may stop working if a content-type is not set correctly. To correct, review and update the content-types in your app or disable auto-instrumentation. Manual instrumentation via agent API If you cannot enable auto-instrumentation, you can still include the browser agent manually by using the New Relic .NET agent API and including appropriate code in your pages. To download the NewRelic.Api.agent.dll, re-run the installation and reference the .dll: From the New Relic .NET agent directory, select the New Relic.Net agent section, then select API Assembly. NuGet: Install and reference the .dll by running Install-package NewRelic.Agent.Api. To set up your web application to call the New Relic .NET agent API, add a reference to NewRelic.Api.Agent.dll to your project. Optional: If you are modifying the deployed application directory on the web server, copy NewRelic.Api.Agent.dll into the application's bin directory. Call the API in your <head> tag. If a meta-tag with the X-UA-COMPATIBLE http-equiv attribute exists, set it after that meta tag. .NET Web Forms view engine When using .NET Web Forms view engine, be sure to use = and not :. That way the view engine will recognize the string of HTML returned from the API as HTML / JavaScript and render it appropriately. If you are using .NET ASP Web Forms with master pages, add the header manually by calling GetBrowserTimingHeader() in your master page under the <head> tag: <%= NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.GetBrowserTimingHeader() %> Copy Import the namespace with: <%@ Import Namespace=\"NewRelic.Api.Agent\" %> Copy Other view engines such as Razor For other view engines such as Razor, you can use the GetBrowserTimingHeader() method to generate the header string. Here is a Razor-based view example: <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang=\"en\"> <head> @Html.Raw(NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.GetBrowserTimingHeader()) ... </head> </html> Copy .NET MVC When using .NET MVC, call the Html.Raw helper. That way, .NET MVC will recognize the string of HTML returned from the API as HTML / JavaScript and render it appropriately. Disable instrumentation To disable instrumentation: Disable auto-instrumentation To fully disable auto-instrumentation, edit newrelic.config and set the autoInstrument flag to false: <!-- disable auto instrumentation --> <browserMonitoring autoInstrument=\"false\"/> Copy Important If you change the flag or uninstall the .NET agent, be sure to flush your cache again so that references to the agent are removed from compiled files. Disable auto-instrumentation on a particular view To disable only auto-instrumentation on a particular view, use the agent API call DisableBrowserMonitoring(). Add this call in any view where browser scripts are not needed or wanted. Put this API call as close as possible to the top of the view where you want it disabled. Disable both automatic and manual instrumentation on a particular view To disable both auto-instrumentation and manual instrumentation for individual webpages, use the agent API call DisableBrowserMonitoring(true).

Follow the troubleshooting procedures for missing data as applicable. Verify whether your pages are rendered using ASPs. If you use another rendering technology, use manual instrumentation. Flush your .NET cache. Set the <head> tag of your pages to render on the server. Verify that your agent is configured to auto-instrument pages. Edit newrelic.config and verify that autoInstrument is set to true: <browserMonitoring autoInstrument=\"true\"/> Copy Check whether IIS page compression is disabled. If compressed before the .NET agent attempts browser instrumentation, the necessary <HEAD> tag won't be found. For instructions on how to check that, see Microsoft documentation. Look at the source of one of your pages through a browser. Look for a script with references to NREUMQ at the top and bottom of your pages. If you get support at support.newrelic.com, mention whether you are seeing this JavaScript in the page header or in some other location in the page, or you are not seeing it at all.

      "body": "With the .NET agent, you can add browser monitoring instrumentation to your webpages. Before you use browser with your .NET agent, refer to the .NET agent release notes, and make sure you have the installed the latest .NET agent release. Follow the .NET agent requirements to install browser monitoring. Then follow the procedures in this document to manually instrument the .NET agent. Auto-instrumentation Important This feature is not available for asp.net core applications whether they are monitored by the .NET Framework or Core agent. Browser auto-instrumentation is enabled by default. With browser auto-instrumentation, the .NET Framework agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript header into any page that has a content-type of text/html and also has <head> tag within the page. The <head> tag search starts at the beginning of the DOM. The .NET agent injects the JavaScript header through the addition of an HttpModule that modifies the page using HTTP response filters before streaming the content to the user. The first time you enable auto-instrumentation, you may need to clean your asp.net cache directory so that aspx pages are recompiled. Use the following command: flush_dotnet_temp.cmd Copy With this injection, previously functioning pages may stop working if a content-type is not set correctly. To correct, review and update the content-types in your app or disable auto-instrumentation. Manual instrumentation via agent API If you cannot enable auto-instrumentation, you can still include the browser agent manually by using the New Relic .NET agent API and including appropriate code in your pages. To download the NewRelic.Api.agent.dll, re-run the installation and reference the .dll: From the New Relic .NET agent directory, select the New Relic.Net agent section, then select API Assembly. NuGet: Install and reference the .dll by running Install-package NewRelic.Agent.Api. To set up your web application to call the New Relic .NET agent API, add a reference to NewRelic.Api.Agent.dll to your project. Optional: If you are modifying the deployed application directory on the web server, copy NewRelic.Api.Agent.dll into the application's bin directory. Call the API in your <head> tag. If a meta-tag with the X-UA-COMPATIBLE http-equiv attribute exists, set it after that meta tag. .NET Web Forms view engine When using .NET Web Forms view engine, be sure to use = and not :. That way the view engine will recognize the string of HTML returned from the API as HTML / JavaScript and render it appropriately. If you are using .NET ASP Web Forms with master pages, add the header manually by calling GetBrowserTimingHeader() in your master page under the <head> tag: <%= NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.GetBrowserTimingHeader() %> Copy Import the namespace with: <%@ Import Namespace=\"NewRelic.Api.Agent\" %> Copy Other view engines such as Razor For other view engines such as Razor, you can use the GetBrowserTimingHeader() method to generate the header string. Here is a Razor-based view example: <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang=\"en\"> <head> @Html.Raw(NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.GetBrowserTimingHeader()) ... </head> </html> Copy .NET MVC When using .NET MVC, call the Html.Raw helper. That way, .NET MVC will recognize the string of HTML returned from the API as HTML / JavaScript and render it appropriately. Disable instrumentation To disable instrumentation: Disable auto-instrumentation To fully disable auto-instrumentation, edit newrelic.config and set the autoInstrument flag to false: <!-- disable auto instrumentation --> <browserMonitoring autoInstrument=\"false\"/> Copy Important If you change the flag or uninstall the .NET agent, be sure to flush your cache again so that references to the agent are removed from compiled files. Disable auto-instrumentation on a particular view To disable only auto-instrumentation on a particular view, use the agent API call DisableBrowserMonitoring(). Add this call in any view where browser scripts are not needed or wanted. Put this API call as close as possible to the top of the view where you want it disabled. Disable both automatic and manual instrumentation on a particular view To disable both auto-instrumentation and manual instrumentation for individual webpages, use the agent API call DisableBrowserMonitoring(true). Troubleshooting Follow the troubleshooting procedures if you are unable to view any browser timing data.",

      "body": "Problem As a health check, your load balancer (such as an F5 load balancer) periodically pings a specified webpage. In some cases when automatic browser injection is enabled, the browser monitoring JavaScript snippet added to the page header causes that check to fail. Depending on how the load balancer is set up, this can cause traffic to be routed to other application instances. Solution To prevent this, add the requestPathsExcluded sub-element to your .NET agent's configuration. This is a reference to the virtual directory of the path in your application and not the full URL of the path you want to exclude. For example, if your load balancer is set to ping a webpage in https://www.mywebsite.com/healthmonitor/, insert /healthmonitor/ as the path regex value: // If you use both the Exclude and Attribute elements // the Exclude element must be listed first. <browserMonitoring autoInstrument=\"true\"> <requestPathsExcluded> <path regex=\"/healthmonitor/\"/> </requestPathsExcluded> </browserMonitoring> Copy Cause The browser agent is a JavaScript snippet injected into the header of a webpage. Sometimes it can prevent the health check monitor from seeing the information it needs to validate that the site is healthy. Excluding the path where the health check page is located will prevent the agent from injecting the snippet into the headers of specific pages.",

Follow the troubleshooting procedures for missing data as applicable. Verify whether your pages are rendered using ASPs. If you use another rendering technology, use manual instrumentation. Flush your .NET cache. Set the <head> tag of your pages to render on the server. Verify that your agent is configured to auto-instrument pages. Edit newrelic.config and verify that autoInstrument is set to true: <browserMonitoring autoInstrument=\"true\"/> Copy Check whether IIS page compression is disabled. If compressed before the .NET agent attempts browser instrumentation, the necessary <HEAD> tag won't be found. For instructions on how to check that, see Microsoft documentation. Look at the source of one of your pages through a browser. Look for a script with references to NREUMQ at the top and bottom of your pages.

      "body": "With the .NET agent, you can add browser monitoring instrumentation to your webpages. Before you use browser with your .NET agent, refer to the .NET agent release notes, and make sure you have the installed the latest .NET agent release. Follow the .NET agent requirements to install browser monitoring. Then follow the procedures in this document to manually instrument the .NET agent. Auto-instrumentation Important This feature is not available for asp.net core applications whether they are monitored by the .NET Framework or Core agent. Browser auto-instrumentation is enabled by default. With browser auto-instrumentation, the .NET Framework agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript header into any page that has a content-type of text/html and also has <head> tag within the page. The <head> tag search starts at the beginning of the DOM. The .NET agent injects the JavaScript header through the addition of an HttpModule that modifies the page using HTTP response filters before streaming the content to the user. The first time you enable auto-instrumentation, you may need to clean your asp.net cache directory so that aspx pages are recompiled. Use the following command: flush_dotnet_temp.cmd Copy With this injection, previously functioning pages may stop working if a content-type is not set correctly. To correct, review and update the content-types in your app or disable auto-instrumentation. Manual instrumentation via agent API If you cannot enable auto-instrumentation, you can still include the browser agent manually by using the New Relic .NET agent API and including appropriate code in your pages. To download the NewRelic.Api.agent.dll, re-run the installation and reference the .dll: From the New Relic .NET agent directory, select the New Relic.Net agent section, then select API Assembly. NuGet: Install and reference the .dll by running Install-package NewRelic.Agent.Api. To set up your web application to call the New Relic .NET agent API, add a reference to NewRelic.Api.Agent.dll to your project. Optional: If you are modifying the deployed application directory on the web server, copy NewRelic.Api.Agent.dll into the application's bin directory. Call the API in your <head> tag. If a meta-tag with the X-UA-COMPATIBLE http-equiv attribute exists, set it after that meta tag. .NET Web Forms view engine When using .NET Web Forms view engine, be sure to use = and not :. That way the view engine will recognize the string of HTML returned from the API as HTML / JavaScript and render it appropriately. If you are using .NET ASP Web Forms with master pages, add the header manually by calling GetBrowserTimingHeader() in your master page under the <head> tag: <%= NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.GetBrowserTimingHeader() %> Copy Import the namespace with: <%@ Import Namespace=\"NewRelic.Api.Agent\" %> Copy Other view engines such as Razor For other view engines such as Razor, you can use the GetBrowserTimingHeader() method to generate the header string. Here is a Razor-based view example: <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang=\"en\"> <head> @Html.Raw(NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.GetBrowserTimingHeader()) ... </head> </html> Copy .NET MVC When using .NET MVC, call the Html.Raw helper. That way, .NET MVC will recognize the string of HTML returned from the API as HTML / JavaScript and render it appropriately. Disable instrumentation To disable instrumentation: Disable auto-instrumentation To fully disable auto-instrumentation, edit newrelic.config and set the autoInstrument flag to false: <!-- disable auto instrumentation --> <browserMonitoring autoInstrument=\"false\"/> Copy Important If you change the flag or uninstall the .NET agent, be sure to flush your cache again so that references to the agent are removed from compiled files. Disable auto-instrumentation on a particular view To disable only auto-instrumentation on a particular view, use the agent API call DisableBrowserMonitoring(). Add this call in any view where browser scripts are not needed or wanted. Put this API call as close as possible to the top of the view where you want it disabled. Disable both automatic and manual instrumentation on a particular view To disable both auto-instrumentation and manual instrumentation for individual webpages, use the agent API call DisableBrowserMonitoring(true).

      "body": "Problem As a health check, your load balancer (such as an F5 load balancer) periodically pings a specified webpage. In some cases when automatic browser injection is enabled, the browser monitoring JavaScript snippet added to the page header causes that check to fail. Depending on how the load balancer is set up, this can cause traffic to be routed to other application instances. Solution To prevent this, add the requestPathsExcluded sub-element to your .NET agent's configuration. This is a reference to the virtual directory of the path in your application and not the full URL of the path you want to exclude. For example, if your load balancer is set to ping a webpage in https://www.mywebsite.com/healthmonitor/, insert /healthmonitor/ as the path regex value: // If you use both the Exclude and Attribute elements // the Exclude element must be listed first. <browserMonitoring autoInstrument=\"true\"> <requestPathsExcluded> <path regex=\"/healthmonitor/\"/> </requestPathsExcluded> </browserMonitoring> Copy Cause The browser agent is a JavaScript snippet injected into the header of a webpage. Sometimes it can prevent the health check monitor from seeing the information it needs to validate that the site is healthy. Excluding the path where the health check page is located will prevent the agent from injecting the snippet into the headers of specific pages.",

Auto-instrumentation Important This feature is not available for asp.net core applications whether they are monitored by the .NET Framework or Core agent.

Use the following command: flush_dotnet_temp.cmd Copy With this injection, previously functioning pages may stop working if a content-type is not set correctly. To correct, review and update the content-types in your app or disable auto-instrumentation.

      "body": "With the .NET agent, you can add browser monitoring instrumentation to your webpages. Before you use browser with your .NET agent, refer to the .NET agent release notes, and make sure you have the installed the latest .NET agent release. Follow the .NET agent requirements to install browser monitoring. Then follow the procedures in this document to manually instrument the .NET agent. Auto-instrumentation Important This feature is not available for asp.net core applications whether they are monitored by the .NET Framework or Core agent. Browser auto-instrumentation is enabled by default. With browser auto-instrumentation, the .NET Framework agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript header into any page that has a content-type of text/html and also has <head> tag within the page. The <head> tag search starts at the beginning of the DOM. The .NET agent injects the JavaScript header through the addition of an HttpModule that modifies the page using HTTP response filters before streaming the content to the user. The first time you enable auto-instrumentation, you may need to clean your asp.net cache directory so that aspx pages are recompiled. Use the following command: flush_dotnet_temp.cmd Copy With this injection, previously functioning pages may stop working if a content-type is not set correctly. To correct, review and update the content-types in your app or disable auto-instrumentation. Manual instrumentation via agent API If you cannot enable auto-instrumentation, you can still include the browser agent manually by using the New Relic .NET agent API and including appropriate code in your pages. To download the NewRelic.Api.agent.dll, re-run the installation and reference the .dll: From the New Relic .NET agent directory, select the New Relic.Net agent section, then select API Assembly. NuGet: Install and reference the .dll by running Install-package NewRelic.Agent.Api. To set up your web application to call the New Relic .NET agent API, add a reference to NewRelic.Api.Agent.dll to your project. Optional: If you are modifying the deployed application directory on the web server, copy NewRelic.Api.Agent.dll into the application's bin directory. Call the API in your <head> tag. If a meta-tag with the X-UA-COMPATIBLE http-equiv attribute exists, set it after that meta tag. .NET Web Forms view engine When using .NET Web Forms view engine, be sure to use = and not :. That way the view engine will recognize the string of HTML returned from the API as HTML / JavaScript and render it appropriately. If you are using .NET ASP Web Forms with master pages, add the header manually by calling GetBrowserTimingHeader() in your master page under the <head> tag: <%= NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.GetBrowserTimingHeader() %> Copy Import the namespace with: <%@ Import Namespace=\"NewRelic.Api.Agent\" %> Copy Other view engines such as Razor For other view engines such as Razor, you can use the GetBrowserTimingHeader() method to generate the header string. Here is a Razor-based view example: <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang=\"en\"> <head> @Html.Raw(NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.GetBrowserTimingHeader()) ... </head> </html> Copy .NET MVC When using .NET MVC, call the Html.Raw helper. That way, .NET MVC will recognize the string of HTML returned from the API as HTML / JavaScript and render it appropriately. Disable instrumentation To disable instrumentation: Disable auto-instrumentation To fully disable auto-instrumentation, edit newrelic.config and set the autoInstrument flag to false: <!-- disable auto instrumentation --> <browserMonitoring autoInstrument=\"false\"/> Copy Important If you change the flag or uninstall the .NET agent, be sure to flush your cache again so that references to the agent are removed from compiled files. Disable auto-instrumentation on a particular view To disable only auto-instrumentation on a particular view, use the agent API call DisableBrowserMonitoring(). Add this call in any view where browser scripts are not needed or wanted. Put this API call as close as possible to the top of the view where you want it disabled. Disable both automatic and manual instrumentation on a particular view To disable both auto-instrumentation and manual instrumentation for individual webpages, use the agent API call DisableBrowserMonitoring(true). Troubleshooting Follow the troubleshooting procedures if you are unable to view any browser timing data.",

      "body": "New Relic offers several tools to help obtain the information needed to provide useful metrics about your Node.js application. These include: Reading the route names (if used) from the Express and Restify routers Using the API to name the current request, either with simple names or groups of controllers with actions Support rules that are stored in your agent's configuration that can mark requests to be renamed or ignored based on regular expressions matched against the request's raw URLs (also available as API calls) The number of names that New Relic tracks needs to be small enough so that the user experience is robust. It also needs to be large enough to provide the right amount of information (without overwhelming you with data) so that you can identify problem spots in your applications more easily. For more information, see the Node.js agent configuration documentation and the Node.js agent API documentation on Github. Request names The Node.js agent captures the HTTP method along with a potentially parameterized path (such as /user/:id) or a regular expression (such as /^/user/([-0-9a-f]+)$/). These pieces of information become part of the request name. If you have support for slow transaction traces and have enabled capture_params in your config file, the transaction trace will also have the request's parameters and their values attached to it. If you are dissatisfied with the request names that the Node.js agent uses, you can use API calls to create more descriptive names. Tip If grouping your requests under the generic name, then /* is sufficient, and you do not need to customize your configuration file or API calls. Requirements New Relic uses request names to group requests for many charts and tables. The value of these visualizations will drop as the number of different request names increases. For example, do not include potentially dynamic data like GUIDs, numerical IDs, or timestamps in the request names you create. If your request is slow enough to generate a transaction trace, that trace will contain the original URL. If you enable parameter capture, the parameters will also be attached to the trace. Tip Avoid having more than 50 different transaction names. For example, if you have more than a couple hundred different request names, rethink your naming strategy. Avoid metric grouping issues The request naming API helps New Relic avoid problems with trying to handle too many metrics, which sometimes is referred to as \"metric explosion.\" New Relic has several strategies to deal with these issues; the most severe is simply to add offending applications to your deny list. The main reason for you to be careful in using these request-naming tools is to prevent that from happening to your applications. For more information, see Metric grouping issues. Guidelines Define your configuration rules from the most specific to the most general. The first rules listed in your config file or added with the Node.js transaction naming API will be applied first and should be narrowly targeted. More general \"fall-through\" rules should be added toward the end of the list, because they will be evaluated in the order they were configured or added using the Node.js transaction naming API. URL pattern matching An online retailer has a URL pattern like this: /user/customers/all/prospects /user/customers/all/current /user/customers/all/returning /user/customers/John /user/customers/Jane Copy The retailer could create rules like this: // newrelic.js exports.config={ //other configuration rules:{ name:[ { pattern: \"/user/customers/all/prospects/\", name: \"/user/customers/all/prospects\" }, { pattern: \"/user/customers/all/.*\", name: \"/user/customers/all\" }, { pattern: \"/user/customers/.*\", name: \"/user/customers/:customer\" } ] } } Copy With these rules, the retailer would create three transaction names: /user/customers/:customer /user/customers/all /user/customers/all/prospects If the retailer reversed the order, the rules would catch all transactions in :customer, which would not be as useful. Load the request naming API Make sure that loading the New Relic module is the first thing your application does, as it needs to bootstrap itself before the rest of your application loads: var newrelic = require('newrelic'); Copy This returns the request naming API. You can safely require the module from multiple modules in your application, as it only initializes itself once. Request API calls Here is a summary of the Request API calls for New Relic's Node.js agent. newrelic.setTransactionName(name) newrelic.setTransactionName(name) Copy Name the current request, following the request naming requirements. You can call this function anywhere within the context of an HTTP request handler, at any time after handling of the request has started, but before the request has finished. In general, if the request and response objects are in scope, you can set the name. Explicitly calling newrelic.setTransactionName() will override any names set by Express or Restify routes. Also, calls to newrelic.setTransactionName() and newrelic.setControllerName() will overwrite each other. The last one to run before the request ends wins. newrelic.setControllerName(name, \\[action]) newrelic.setControllerName(name, \\[action]) Copy Name the current request using a controller-style pattern, optionally including the current controller action. If the action is omitted, New Relic will include the HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.) as the action. The rules for when you can call newrelic.setControllerName() are the same as they are for newrelic.setTransactionName(), including the request naming requirements. Explicitly calling newrelic.setControllerName() will override any names set by Express or Restify routes. Also, calls to newrelic.setTransactionName() and newrelic.setControllerName() will overwrite each other. The last one to run before the request ends wins. Custom instrumentation API calls Use these API calls to expand your instrumentation with custom instrumentation. newrelic.instrument(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) newrelic.instrument(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) Copy Sets an instrumentation callback for a specific module. The provided onRequire callback will be fired when the given module is loaded with require. The moduleName parameter should be the string that will be passed to require; for example, 'express' or 'amqplib/callback_api'. The optional onError callback is called if the onRequire parameters throws an error. This is useful for debugging your instrumentation. Use this method to: Add instrumentation for modules not currently instrumented by New Relic. Instrument your own code. Replace the Node.js agent's built-in instrumentation with your own. For more information, see New Relic's Node.js instrumentation tutorial on Github. newrelic.instrumentDatastore(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) newrelic.instrumentDatastore(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) Copy Sets an instrumentation callback for a datastore module. This method is just like newrelic.instrument(), except it provides a datastore-specialized shim. For more information, see New Relic's Node.js datastore instrumentation tutorial on Github. newrelic.instrumentLoadedModule(moduleName, moduleInstance) newrelic.instrumentLoadedModule(moduleName, moduleInstance) Copy The instrumentLoadedModule method allows you to add stock instrumentation to specific modules in situations where it's impossible to have require('newrelic'); as the first line of your app's main module. // load the agent const newrelic = require('newrelic') // module loaded before newrelic const expressModule = require('express') // instrument express _after_ the agent has been loaded newrelic.instrumentLoadedModule( 'express', // the module's name, as a string expressModule // the module instance ); Copy Important This method cannot instrument any arbitrary module. Its purpose is to add modules that were missed because the agent was not loaded as the first thing in your program. The instrumentLoadedModule method can only instrument modules the agent would normally instrument. You can see a list of these modules in the agent's lib/instrumentations module. newrelic.instrumentMessages(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) newrelic.instrumentMessages(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) Copy Sets an instrumentation callback for a message service client module. This method is just like newrelic.instrument(), except it provides a message-service-specialized shim. For more information, see New Relic's Node.js message service instrumentation tutorial on Github. newrelic.instrumentWebframework(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) newrelic.instrumentWebframework(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) Copy Sets an instrumentation callback for a web framework module. This method is just like newrelic.instrument(), except it provides a web-framework-specialized shim. For more information, see New Relic's Node.js web framework instrumentation tutorial on Github. newrelic.startWebTransaction(url, handle) newrelic.startWebTransaction(url, handle) Copy Instrument the specified web transaction. Using this API call, you can instrument transactions that New Relic does not automatically detect. The url defines the transaction name and needs to be static. Do not include variable data such as user ID. The handle defines the function you want to instrument. New Relic will capture any metrics that would be captured by auto-instrumentation, as well as manual instrumentation via startSegment(). You must handle custom transactions manually by calling newrelic.getTransaction() at the start of your transaction, and then call transaction.end() when you are finished. New Relic begins timing the transaction when newrelic.startWebTransaction() is called and ends the transaction when transaction.end() is called. You can also return a promise to indicate the end of the transaction. Please note that if this promise rejects, it does not automatically hook into New Relic’s error tracking. This needs to be done manually with noticeError(). newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction(name, \\[group], handle) newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction(name, \\[group], handle) Copy Instrument the specified background transaction. Using this API call, you can expand New Relic's instrumentation to capture data from background transactions. The name defines the transaction name and needs to be static. Do not include variable data such as user ID. The group is optional, and it allows you to group similar jobs together via the transaction type in the user interface. Like name, the group needs to be static. The handle defines a function that includes the entire background job you want to instrument. New Relic will capture any metrics that would be captured by auto-instrumentation, as well as manual instrumentation via startSegment(). You must handle custom transactions manually by calling newrelic.getTransaction() at the start of your transaction, and then call transaction.end() when you are finished. New Relic begins timing the transaction when newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction() is called and ends the transaction when transaction.end() is called. You can also return a promise to indicate the end of the transaction. Please note that if this promise rejects, it does not automatically hook into New Relic’s error tracking. This needs to be done manually with noticeError(). newrelic.getTransaction() newrelic.getTransaction() Copy Returns a handle on the currently executing transaction. This handle can then be used to interact with a given transaction safely from any context. It is best used with newrelic.startWebTransaction() and newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction(). Please refer to the transaction handle section for more details. newrelic.endTransaction() newrelic.endTransaction() Copy End the current web or background custom transaction. This method requires being in the correct transaction context when called. This API call takes no arguments. newrelic.startSegment(name, record, handler, callback) newrelic.startSegment(name, record, handler, callback) Copy Instrument a particular method to improve visibility into a transaction, or optionally turn it into a metric. The name defines a name for the segment. This name will be visible in transaction traces and as a new metric in the New Relic UI. The record flag defines whether the segment should be recorded as a metric. The handler is the function you want to track as a segment. The optional callback is a function passed to the handler to fire after its work is done. The agent begins timing the segment when startSegment is called. The segment is ended when either the handler finishes executing, or callback is fired, if it is provided. Custom metrics API calls Use these API calls to record additional arbitrary metrics: newrelic.recordMetric(name, value) newrelic.recordMetric(name, value) Copy Use recordMetric to record an event-based metric, usually associated with a particular duration. The name must be a string following standard metric naming rules. The value will usually be a number, but it can also be an object. When value is a numeric value, it should represent the magnitude of a measurement associated with an event; for example, the duration for a particular method call. When value is an object, it must contain count, total, min, max, and sumOfSquares keys, all with number values. This form is useful to aggregate metrics on your own and report them periodically; for example, from a setInterval. These values will be aggregated with any previously collected values for the same metric. The names of these keys match the names of the keys used by the platform API. newrelic.incrementMetric(name, \\[amount]) newrelic.incrementMetric(name, \\[amount]) Copy Use incrementMetric to update a metric that acts as a simple counter. The count of the selected metric will be incremented by the specified amount, defaulting to 1. Custom events API calls Use these API calls to record additional events: newrelic.recordCustomEvent(eventType, attributes) newrelic.recordCustomEvent(eventType, attributes) Copy Use recordCustomEvent to record an event-based metric, usually associated with a particular duration. The eventType must be an alphanumeric string less than 255 characters. The attributes must be an object of key and value pairs. The keys must be shorter than 255 characters, and the values must be string, number, or boolean. Recording a custom event The following example demonstrates recording a custom event with multiple attributes. const attributes = { attribute1: 'value1', attribute2: 2 } newrelic.recordCustomEvent('MessagingEvent', attributes) Copy Transaction handle methods This section details the methods provided by the TransactionHandle class instance that can be obtained through newrelic.getTransaction(). Use these methods to interact directly with the current transaction: transactionHandle.end(\\[callback]) transactionHandle.end(\\[callback]) Copy Use transactionHandle.end to end the transaction referenced by the handle instance. The callback is invoked when the transaction has fully ended. The finished transaction passed to the callback as the first argument. transactionHandle.ignore() transactionHandle.ignore() Copy Use transactionHandle.ignore to ignore the transaction referenced by the handle instance. transactionHandle.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(headers) transactionHandle.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(headers) Copy Important This API requires distributed tracing to be enabled. For context on how to use this call and its partner call acceptDistributedTraceHeaders, first read Enable distributed tracing with agent APIs. transactionHandle.insertDistributedTraceHeaders is used to implement distributed tracing. It modifies the headers map that is passed in by adding W3C Trace Context headers and New Relic Distributed Trace headers. The New Relic headers can be disabled with distributed_tracing.exclude_newrelic_header: true in the config. This method replaces the deprecated createDistributedTracePayload method, which only creates New Relic Distributed Trace payloads. Generating distributed trace headers In the following example, by calling insertDistributedTraceHeaders with an empty object, the appropriate Distributed Trace headers and W3C Trace Context headers will be generated for the transaction. // Call newrelic.getTransaction to retrieve a handle on the current transaction. const transactionHandle = newrelic.getTransaction() // This could be a header object from an incoming request as well const headersObject = {} newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction('background task', function executeTransaction() { const transaction = newrelic.getTransaction() // generate the headers transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(headersObject) }) Copy transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(transportType, headers) transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(transportType, headers) Copy Important This API requires distributed tracing to be enabled. For context on how to use this call and its partner call insertDistributedTraceHeaders, first read Enable distributed tracing with agent APIs. transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders is used to instrument the called service for inclusion in a distributed trace. It links the spans in a trace by accepting a payload generated by insertDistributedTraceHeaders or generated by some other W3C Trace Context compliant tracer. This method accepts the headers of an incoming request, looks for W3C Trace Context headers, and if not found, falls back to New Relic distributed trace headers. This method replaces the deprecated (and now removed as of version 7.0.0) acceptDistributedTracePayload method, which only handles New Relic distributed trace payloads. transportType should be one of the following strings: AMQP HTTP HTTPS IronMQ JMS Kafka Other Queue Unknown headers should be an object containing all the headers in the incoming request. The keys must be lowercase. Accept incoming distributed trace headers The following example demonstrates adding distributed trace headers retrieved from a Kafka message. In this example, we assume that the incoming Kafka message has Distributed Trace headers inserted. // incoming Kafka message headers const headersObject = message.headers // Call newrelic.getTransaction to retrieve a handle on the current transaction. const transactionHandle = newrelic.getTransaction() newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction('background task', function executeTransaction() { const transaction = newrelic.getTransaction() // accept the headers transaction.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders('Kafka', headersObject) }) Copy transactionHandle.createDistributedTracePayload() transactionHandle.createDistributedTracePayload() Copy Caution This method is deprecated and was removed in version 7.0.0! Please use insertDistributedTraceHeaders. Important This API requires distributed tracing to be enabled. For instructions on how to use this call, along with its partner call acceptDistributedTracePayload, see Enable distributed tracing with agent APIs. This call is used to implement distributed tracing. It generates a payload that is read by the receiving application with acceptDistributedTracePayload. Important Note: In order to maintain proper ordering of spans in a trace, you must generate the payload in the context of the span that sends it. The DistributedTracePayload object has two available methods used for generating the payload in different formats: DistributedTracePayload#text: returns a JSON representation of the payload. Link a nested background transaction // Call newrelic.getTransaction to retrieve a handle on the current transaction. var transactionHandle = newrelic.getTransaction() var payload = transactionHandle.createDistributedTracePayload() var jsonPayload = payload.text() newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction('background task', function executeTransaction() { var backgroundHandle = newrelic.getTransaction() // Link the nested transaction by accepting the payload with the background transaction's handle backgroundHandle.acceptDistributedTracePayload(jsonPayload) }) Copy DistributedTracePayload#httpSafe: returns a base64 encoded JSON representation of the payload. Place payload on an outgoing request // Call newrelic.getTransaction to retrieve a handle on the current transaction. var transactionHandle = newrelic.getTransaction() var payload = transactionHandle.createDistributedTracePayload() // Place the base64 encoded value on an outbound request header. req.headers[myTracingHeader] = payload.httpSafe() Copy transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTracePayload(payload) transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTracePayload(payload) Copy Caution This method is deprecated and was removed in version 7.0.0! Please use acceptDistributedTraceHeaders. Important This API requires distributed tracing to be enabled. For context on how to use this call and its partner call createDistributedTracePayload, first read Enable distributed tracing with agent APIs. transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTracePayload is used to instrument the called service for inclusion in a distributed trace. It links the spans in a trace by accepting the payload generated by createDistributedTracePayload. transactionHandle.isSampled() transactionHandle.isSampled() Copy Returns whether this trace is being sampled. Other API calls New Relic's Node.js agent includes additional API calls. newrelic.addCustomAttribute(name, value) newrelic.addCustomAttribute(name, value) Copy Set a custom attribute value to be displayed along with the transaction trace in the New Relic UI. This must be called within the context of a transaction so it has a place to set the custom attributes. Custom attributes will appear in New Relic APM's transaction trace detail view and in errors for the transaction. Add custom attribute newrelic.addCustomAttribute('attribute1', 'value1') Copy Caution If you want to use your custom attributes, avoid using any of the reserved terms used by NRQL when naming them. newrelic.addCustomAttributes(attributes) newrelic.addCustomAttributes(attributes) Copy Set multiple custom attribute values to be displayed along with the transaction trace in the New Relic UI. The attributes should be passed as a single object. This must be called within the context of a transaction so it has a place to set the custom attributes. Custom attributes will appear in the transaction trace detail view and in errors for the transaction. Adding custom attributes const attributes = { attribute1: 'value1', attribute2: 2 } newrelic.addCustomAttributes(attributes) Copy Caution If you want to use your custom attributes, avoid using any of the reserved terms used by NRQL when naming them. newrelic.addCustomSpanAttribute(name, value) newrelic.addCustomSpanAttribute(name, value) Copy Set a custom span attribute value to be displayed along with a transaction trace span in the New Relic UI. This must be called within the context of an active segment/span so it has a place to set the custom span attributes. Custom span attributes will appear in the Attributes section of the span detail view. Add custom span attribute newrelic.addCustomSpanAttribute('attribute1', 'value') Copy Important This API requires distributed tracing and span events to be enabled. Caution If you want to use your custom span attributes, avoid using any of the reserved terms used by NRQL when naming them. newrelic.addCustomSpanAttributes(attributes) newrelic.addCustomSpanAttributes(attributes) Copy Set multiple custom span attribute values to be displayed along with the transaction trace spans in the New Relic UI. The attributes should be passed as a single object. This must be called within the context of an active segment/span so it has a place to set the custom span attributes. Custom span attributes will appear in the Attributes section of the span detail view. Add custom span attributes const attributes = { attribute1: 'value1', attribute2: 'value2' } newrelic.addCustomSpanAttributes(attributes) Copy Important This API requires distributed tracing and span events to be enabled. Caution If you want to use your custom span attributes, avoid using any of the reserved terms used by NRQL when naming them. newrelic.getBrowserTimingHeader() newrelic.getBrowserTimingHeader() Copy Returns the HTML snippet to be inserted into the header of HTML pages to enable browser monitoring. The HTML will instruct the browser to fetch a small JavaScript file and start the page timer. newrelic.setIgnoreTransaction(ignored) newrelic.setIgnoreTransaction(ignored) Copy Tell the module whether or not to ignore a given request. This allows you to explicitly filter long-polling, irrelevant routes or requests you know will be time-consuming. This also allows you to gather metrics for requests that otherwise would be ignored. To ignore the transaction, set the parameter to true will ignore the transaction. To prevent a transaction from being ignored with this function, pass the parameter false. Passing null or undefined will not change whether the transaction is ignored. Caution This method is deprecated and was removed in version 7.0.0. Please use transactionHandle.ignore() newrelic.noticeError(error, \\[customParameters]) newrelic.noticeError(error, \\[customParameters]) Copy Use this call if your app is doing its own error handling with domains or try/catch clauses, but you want all of the information about how many errors are coming out of the app to be centrally managed. Unlike other Node.js calls, this can be used outside of route handlers, but it will have additional context if called from within transaction scope. Caution Errors recorded using this method do not obey the ignore_status_codes configuration value. newrelic.shutdown(\\[options], callback) newrelic.shutdown(\\[options], callback) Copy Use this method to gracefully shut down the agent. options options.collectPendingData - type boolean - Tell the agent whether to send any pending data to the New Relic collector before shutting down. options.timeout - type number (ms) - The default time before forcing a shutdown. When collectPendingData is true, the agent will wait for a connection before shutting down. This timeout is useful for short lived processes, like AWS Lambda, in order to keep the process from staying open too long, while trying to connect. Example: newrelic.shutdown({collectPendingData: true, timeout: 3000}, (error) => { process.exit() }) Copy newrelic.getLinkingMetadata() newrelic.getLinkingMetadata() Copy Returns key/value pairs which can be used to link traces or entities. It will only contain items with meaningful values. For instance, if distributed tracing is disabled, trace.id will not be included. newrelic.getTraceMetadata() newrelic.getTraceMetadata() Copy Returns and object containing the current trace ID and span ID. Important This API requires distributed tracing to be enabled or an empty object will be returned. Rules for naming and ignoring requests If you do not want to put calls to the New Relic module directly into your application code, you can use pattern-based rules to name requests. There are two sets of rules: one for renaming requests, and one to mark requests to be ignored by New Relic's instrumentation. Here is the structure for rules in New Relic's Node.js agent. rules.name A list of rules of the format {pattern : \"pattern\", name : \"name\"} for matching incoming request URLs to pattern and naming the matching New Relic transaction's name. This acts as a regex replace, where you can set the pattern either as a string, or as a JavaScript regular expression literal, and both pattern and name are required. When passing a regex as a string, escape backslashes, as the agent does not keep them when given as a string in a pattern. Define your configuration rules from the most specific to the most general, as the patterns will be evaluated in order and are terminal in nature. For more information, see the naming guidelines. This can also be set with the environment variable NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES, with multiple rules passed in as a list of comma-delimited JSON object literals: NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES='{\"pattern\":\"^t\",\"name\":\"u\"},{\"pattern\":\"^u\",\"name\":\"t\"}' Copy Optional rules attributes [#optional-rules] Additional optional attributes are available: Optional rules attributes Description terminate_chain Default: true When set to true (default), no further rules will be evaluated if this rule is a match. Setting this to false is useful when multiple rules should be used together. For example, one rule could be replacing a common pattern in many different URLs, while subsequent rule(s) would be more specific. replace_all Default: false When set to true, all matches of the pattern will be replaced. Otherwise, only the first match will be replaced. Using the g flag with regular expression literal will have the same effect. For example: pattern: '[0-9]+', replace_all: true Copy This has the same effect as pattern: /[0-9]+/g. precedence By default the rules are evaluated in order, from first to last. If you prefer to have complete control over the order, you can give each rule a precedence attribute. The precedence is an integer number, and rules are evaluated in ascending order. If precedence is not explicitly defined, it will be set to 500 by default. Additional attributes are ignored. Testing your naming rules [#testing-rules] The Node.js agent comes with a command-line tool for testing naming rules. For more information, run the following command in terminal window in a directory where your app is installed: node node_modules/.bin/newrelic-naming-rules Copy Naming rule examples [#examples-rules] Here are some examples of naming rules and the results. Match full URL pattern: \"^/items/[0-9]+$\", name: \"/items/:id\" Copy will result in: /items/123 => /items/:id /orders/123 => /orders/123 (not replaced since the rule is a full match) Copy Replace first match in URL pattern: \"[0-9]+\", name: \":id\" Copy will result in: /orders/123 => /orders/:id /items/123 => /items/:id /orders/123/items/123 => /orders/:id/items/123 Copy Replace all matches in any URL pattern: \"[0-9]+\", name: \":id\", replace_all: true Copy will result in: /orders/123/items/123 => /orders/:id/items/:id Copy Match group references Using regular expression match group references: pattern: '^/(items|orders)/[0-9]+$', name: '/\\\\1/:id' Copy will result in: /orders/123 => /orders/:id /items/123 => /items/:id Copy rules.ignore This can also be set via the environment variable NEW_RELIC_IGNORING_RULES, with multiple rules passed in as a list of comma-delimited patterns. Currently there is no way to escape commas in patterns. NEW_RELIC_IGNORING_RULES='^/socket\\.io/\\*/xhr-polling,ignore_me' Copy Here are full examples of how rules are included in the configuration file: Naming rule example // newrelic.js exports.config = { // other configuration rules : { name : [ { pattern: \"/tables/name-here\", name: \"/name-hererule1\" } ] } Copy Ignoring rule example If you are using socket.io, you will have a use case for ignoring rules right out of the box. To keep socket.io long-polling from dominating your response-time metrics and affecting the Apdex metrics for your application, add a rule such as: // newrelic.js exports.config = { // other configuration rules : { ignore : [ '^\\/socket\\.io\\/.*\\/xhr-polling' ] } }; Copy API calls for rules Here are the API calls for naming and ignoring rules with New Relic's Node.js agent. newrelic.addNamingRule(pattern, name) Programmatic version of rules.name. Once naming rules are added, they cannot be removed until the Node process is restarted. They can also be added via the Node.js agent's configuration. Both parameters are required. newrelic.addIgnoringRule(pattern) Programmatic version of rules.ignore. Once ignoring rules are added, they cannot be removed until the Node process is restarted. They can also be added via the Node.js agent's configuration. This parameter is required.",

      "body": "To take full advantage of New Relic's latest features, enhancements, and important security patches, we recommend you update your Node.js agent to the latest version. For additional information about specific agent updates, refer to the Node.js agent release notes. The release notes include a download link when applicable, plus instructions to download and install the latest version. If the newrelic module is listed in your package.json, run npm install. If you want to target just the newrelic module, run npm update newrelic. Recommendation: Test your updated version before moving it into production. If you have problems, follow the Node.js agent troubleshooting procedures. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 7 Before upgrading to Node.js version 7, review this information for major changes. Major changes with Node.js agent v7 Comments BREAKING Removed deprecated httpResponseCode, response.status and httpResponseMessage http response attributes v6.4.2-v6.14.0: Starting in agent v6.4.2, these attributes were marked as deprecated but left in to give a transition period for the new attributes. v7: When http response attribute reporting is enabled, http.statusCode and http.statusText will be reported. BREAKING Removed deprecated setIgnoreTransaction API method v5 - v6: Starting in agent v5.0.0, this method was marked as deprecated but left in to give a transition period for the new methods. v7: Applications must use the API method transactionHandle.ignore(). BREAKING Removed the api.custom_parameters_enabled configuration item and associated environment variable NEW_RELIC_API_CUSTOM_PARAMETERS. Applications must use the configuration api.custom_attributes_enabled or the associated environment variable NEW_RELIC_API_CUSTOM_ATTRIBUTES to enable newrelic.addCustomAttribute and newrelic.addCustomAttributes. BREAKING Removed deprecated Distributed Tracing API methods, createDistributedTracePayload() and acceptDistributedTracePayload() v6.4.0-v6.14.0: Starting in agent v6.4.0, these method were marked as deprecated but left in to give a transition period for the new methods. v7: Applications must use the API methods transactionHandle.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(headers) and transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(transportType, headers) . With these methods, the Node agent will now accept W3C's traceparent and tracestate headers when calling transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(headers) and include the W3C headers along with the New Relic distributed tracing header when calling transactionHandle.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(headers), unless the New Relic trace header format is disabled using distributed_tracing.exclude_newrelic_header:true. Update New Relic Dependencies to versions with updated Node version support @newrelic/aws-sdk v3.0.0 @newrelic/koa v5.0.0 @newrelic/native-metrics v6.0.0 @newrelic/superagent v4.0.0 @newrelic/test-utilities v5.0.0 Node version support Node v10 is the earliest version supported by the New Relic Node.js v7 agent. Node 8 and 9 are not supported by v7. Customers running Node 9 and earlier have two options: Upgrade to a supported version of Node and take advantage of the New Relic Node.js v7 agent's new features. Remain on New Relic Node.js v6 agent without the ability to use new features only available with update agent versions. Node 10 no longer receive updates, but New Relic will continue to support these versions of Node for the time being. Tip Upgrade to a newer version of Node as soon as possible. The next major version of the New Relic Node.js agent will likely remove support for Node 10. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 6 Before upgrading to Node.js agent version 6, review this information for major changes. Major changes with Node.js agent v6 Comments Upgraded official Koa framework instrumentation module to v3.0.0 v6: Added support for @koa/router up to v8.0.2. @koa/router v8.0.3 and greater are currently unsupported. v6: Added support for Node v12 and removed support for Node v6, 7, and 9. The minimum supported version is Node v8. Also see New Relic's Koa Release Notes on Github.. Removed deprecated max_samples_per_minute configuration parameter, which is replaced by max_samples_stored behavior v1 - v5: max_samples_per_minute defined the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If your application previously used max_samples_per_minute as an upper bound, you may need to lower the threshold to a valid maximum to avoid data being dropped on the server. We recommend less than 10k. v5: In agent v5 and lower, max_samples_stored defined the maximum number of events the agent stores if it's unable to communicate with the New Relic collector. v6: The new behavior of max_samples_stored defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. This usage of the configuration is consistent with the other APM agents. Troubleshooting tips: If you're missing event data, increase the value of max_samples_stored or revert to the default value. The value of max_samples_stored should not be over 10,000. Node version support Node 8 is the earliest version supported by the New Relic Node.js v6 agent. Node 6, 7 and 9 are not supported by v6. Customers running Node 6, 7 and 9 have two options: Upgrade to a supported version of Node and take advantage of the New Relic Node.js v6 agent's new features. Remain on New Relic Node.js v5 agent without the ability to use new features only available with update agent versions. Node 8 no longer receive updates, but New Relic will continue to support these versions of Node for the time being. Tip Upgrade to a newer version of Node as soon as possible. The next major version of the New Relic Node.js agent will likely remove support for Node 8. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 5 Before upgrading to Node.js agent v5, review this information for major changes. Also see New Relic's Node.js v5 migration guide on GitHub. Major changes with Node.js v5 agent Comments Removed deprecated addCustomParameter methods. v2 - v4: Starting in agent v2.7.0, these methods were marked as deprecated but left in to give a transition period for the new methods. v5: Applications must use the API methods newrelic.addCustomAttribute() and newrelic.addCustomAttributes(). These are drop-in replacements for the old methods. Removed deprecated create*Transaction methods. v2 - v4: Starting in agent v2.0.2, these methods were marked as deprecated but left in to give a transition period to the new methods. v5: Applications must update to the API methods newrelic.startWebTransaction() and newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction(). Troubleshooting tips: These new methods are not drop-in replacements for the old ones. Before moving to these new methods, review our custom instrumentation guide. Removed deprecated createTracer method. v3 - v4: Starting in agent v3.3.0, this method was marked as deprecated in favor of newrelic.startSegment(). v5: Applications must update to newrelic.startSegment(). Removed node-cassandra-cql instrumentation. v4: Applications using the npm package node-cassandra-cql would get datastore metrics for Cassandra. v5: Applications must migrate to the cassandra-driver package to get Cassandra datastore metrics. This module is actively maintained by the same developers. The node-cassandra-cql package was abandoned in February of 2014 in favor of the cassandra-driver package. Removed deprecated capture_params and ignored_params configurations. v2 - v4: Starting in agent v2.7.0, these configuration parameters caused a warning to be logged, and the values were automatically upgraded to the new attributes configurations. v5: A warning will still be logged but the configuration is ignored, and no automatic upgrading happens any more. Troubleshooting tips: If your application had parameters listed in the ignored_params configuration, you will need to move them to attributes.exclude. Node version support Node 6 is the earliest version supported by the New Relic Node.js v5 agent. Node 4 and 5 are not supported by v5. Customers running Node 4 or 5 have two options: Upgrade to a supported version of Node and take advantage of the New Relic Node.js v5 agent's new features. Remain on New Relic Node.js v4 agent without the ability to use new features only available with update agent versions. Node 7 and 9 no longer receive updates, but New Relic will continue to support these versions of Node for the time being. Tip Upgrade to a newer version of Node as soon as possible. The next major version of the New Relic Node.js agent will likely remove support for Node 6 and 7. Feature flags as of v5 As of New Relic for Node.js v5: custom_instrumentation: This feature is no longer configurable. custom_metrics: This feature is no longer configurable. synthetics: This feature is no longer configurable. native_metrics: This feature is now controlled by the plugins.native_metrics.enabled configuration value. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 4 Before upgrading to Node.js agent v4, review this information for major changes. Also see New Relic's Node.js v4 migration guide on GitHub. Upgrade https-proxy-agent from v0 to v2 Major changes with Node.js v4 agent include an upgrade of the https-proxy-agent from v0 to v2. This dependency has been updated due to a security issue in the https-proxy-agent that the New Relic Node.js agent used. Because https-proxy v2 is incompatible with node v0.10 and v0.12, New Relic has deprecated those agent versions. There is no required action to migrate from v3 to v4 of New Relic's Node.js agent. Node version support Node 4 is the earliest version supported by the New Relic Node.js v4 agent. Node 0.10 and 0.12 are not supported by v4. Customers running Node 0.10 or 0.12 have two options: Upgrade to a supported version of Node and take advantage of the New Relic Node.js v4 agent's new features. Remain on the New Relic Node.js v3 agent without the ability to use new features only available with updated agent versions. Node 4, 5, and 7 also no longer receive updates, but New Relic will continue to support these versions of Node for the time being. Tip Upgrade to a newer version of Node as soon as possible. The next major version of the New Relic Node.js agent will likely remove support for Node 4 and 5. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 3 Before upgrading to Node.js agent agent v3, review this information for major changes. Also see New Relic's Node.js v3 migration guide on GitHub. Major changes with Node.js v3 agent Major changes with Node.js v3 agent Comments Removed SSL configuration v2: With the v2 agent, it was possible to configure the agent to connect to New Relic without encryption. v3: Node.js agent v3 always connects to New Relic servers using TLS encryption to protect communications. If the agent is configured to disable this, a warning is logged and the setting is ignored. Request parameters now prefixed with request.parameters. v2: The v2 agent collects request parameters, such as route parameters (/users/:userId) and query parameters (/users?userId=123), as the parameter name (userId). v3: The v3 agent prefixes all request parameters with the string request.parameters.. For example,userId appears as request.parameters.userId. Troubleshooting tips: If you have dashboards, alert policies, or other NRQL queries based on request parameters, update them with the new parameter names. Feature flags as of v3 As of New Relic Node.js agent v3, the send_request_uri_attribute feature is no longer configurable. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 2 Before upgrading to Node.js agent v2, review this information for major changes. Also see New Relic's Node.js v2 migration guide on GitHub. Major changes with Node.js v2 agent Major changes with Node.js v2 agent Comments Reversed naming and ignore rules v1: With the v1 agent, rules defined in the config properties rules.name and rules.ignore were applied in reverse order; the first rule in the list was applied last. v2: Node.js agent v2 applies rules in the order they are defined, so the first rule in the list is applied first. Troubleshooting tips: If you used naming rules in the v1 agent and notice problems, reverse the order of your rules in your configuration. De-duplicated HTTP request transactions v1: The v1 agent started a new transaction for each listener on an HTTP server's request event. In applications with multiple listeners on the request event, this resulted in extraneous transactions being created that almost always did not get named correctly. v2: The v2 agent only creates a single transaction for each request event emitted. Troubleshooting tips: If you used multiple request event listeners and added a call to newrelic.ignoreTransaction() to remove the extra transactions, remove those calls. Stopped swallowing outbound request errors v1: The v1 agent swallowed unhandled error events emitted by outbound HTTP request objects. v2: The v2 agent removes this behavior. Instead, the v2 agent does not change normal Node execution. This means the error event will always be emitted. Troubleshooting tips: If you are making outbound requests and currently do not listen for the error event, add a listener and handle the error as appropriate for your application. Updated configuration options as of v2 In newrelic.js, edit the Node.js agent configuration properties you use for compatiblity with the latest versions: Deprecated property New property capture_params attributes.enabled: false By default, request attributes are not sent to New Relic. Set attributes.enabled: true to include agent-defined or custom attributes in traces. The capture_params property has been deprecated. ignored_params attributes.exclude: [] Add any request attribute keys to the attributes.exclude list. Now, instead of having to be an exact match, wildcards (*) may be appended to each item for broader filtering. The ignored_params property has been deprecated. These Node.js agent configuration properties also have overrides for specific destinations, including: transaction_tracer transaction_events error_collector browser_monitoring For example, if the root attributes.enabled is true and you set transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled: false, this will restrict attributes from being collected in transaction traces, while still allowing them for all others. Deprecated API methods as of v2 The following methods from the Node.js agent have been deprecated, and New Relic has deleted them in v5 of the agent. Each has an easy replacement that accomplishes the same task in a more flexible and reliable way. newrelic.createWebTransaction() Replace with newrelic.startWebTransaction() and newrelic.getTransaction(). newrelic.createBackgroundTransaction() Replace with newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction() and newrelic.getTransaction(). newrelic.addCustomParameter() Replace with newrelic.addCustomAttribute(). newrelic.addCustomParameters() Replace with newrelic.addCustomAttributes(). New v2 agent API methods The following API methods are new with the New Relic Node.js v2 agent. newrelic.getTransaction() This method gets a reference to the currently running transaction. Use in conjunction with: newrelic.startWebTransaction newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction Callback-based message consumer services for troubleshooting message consumers newrelic.startWebTransaction()newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction() These new API methods replace the older create*Transaction methods. They are easier to use and seamlessly work with promises. Unlike the v1 method, the provided callback is invoked immediately. newrelic.instrument()newrelic.instrumentDatastore()newrelic.instrumentWebframework()newrelic.instrumentMessages() Use these methods to add custom instrumentation for third party modules, including those already instrumented by the New Relic Node.js agent. For more information, see New Relic's Node.js instrumentation tutorials on GitHub. newrelic.addCustomAttribute() Use this method to add a custom trace attribute. newrelic.addCustomAttributes() Use this method to add multiple custom trace attributes. Node version support for v2 The earliest version of Node supported by the New Relic Node.js v2 agent is 0.10. Node 0.8, which has not been updated since July of 2014, is not supported by v2. Customers running Node 0.8 have two options: Upgrade to a supported version of Node and take advantage of the New Relic Node.js v2 agent's new features. Remain on New Relic Node.js v1 agent without the ability to use new features only available with updated agent versions. Node 0.10 also no longer receives updates, but New Relic will continue to support this version of Node for the time being. Recommendation: Upgrade to a newer version of Node as soon as possible. npm version support as of v2 The New Relic Node.js agent now requires npm version 2.0.0 or higher. This version of npm comes packaged with Node 0.10.44 or higher. If you are using an earlier version of Node 0.10 you will need to first install npm 2.0.0 or higher, or upgrade to a newer version of Node. To install npm version 2: $ npm install --global npm@2 Copy Feature flags as of v2 As of New Relic Node.js agent v2: express_segments: This feature is no longer configurable. cat: This feature is now controlled by the cross_application_tracer.enabled configuration value.

With features like service maps and error analytics, our Node.js agent helps you get the full picture of your app environment. Tip To use Node.js or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Why it matters Many Node application requests are based on raw URLs. Our solution is different. New Relic for Node.js assumes it can group requests to your application into transactions instead of HTTP requests. Transactions are defined by giving one or more request paths a name. These names are used to: Visualize where your app is spending its time (in transaction breakdowns). Identify slow requests. Group metrics. Show you which portions of your application are suffering from slow database performance. Installation To install our agent, you need to sign up for New Relic first. Once you're logged in, follow the instructions or use our launcher to get data flowing in. Review the system requirements. Read the install docs. Go directly to the New Relic UI to add Node.js data. Extend your instrumentation After installing the Node.js agent, extend your instrumentation: Extend your instrumentation Comments Customization Implement Node.js custom instrumentation. Collect custom metrics via an API call. Use our Node.js agent API to control, customize, or extend the agent's functionality. Open source telemetry To create your own integrations, use our Node Telemetry SDK. To gain visibility into your GraphQL payloads, use our Apollo Server plugin. Traces Enable distributed tracing. VM measurements Collect key metric timeslice data from the Node.js virtual machine. View detailed VM statistics in the New Relic UI. End-user activity Integrate the Node.js agent with browser monitoring. Gain visibility into user activity with browser monitoring's page load timing process.

For additional information about specific agent updates, refer to the Node.js agent release notes. The release notes include a download link when applicable, plus instructions to download and install the latest version. If the newrelic module is listed in your package.json, run npm install. If you want to target just the newrelic module, run npm update newrelic. Recommendation: Test your updated version before moving it into production. If you have problems, follow the Node.js agent troubleshooting procedures. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 7 Before upgrading to Node.js version 7, review this information for major changes. Major changes with Node.js agent v7 Comments BREAKING Removed deprecated httpResponseCode, response.status and httpResponseMessage http response attributes v6.4.2-v6.14.0: Starting in agent v6.4.2, these attributes were marked as deprecated but left in to give a transition period for the new attributes. v7: When http response attribute reporting is enabled, http.statusCode and http.statusText will be reported. BREAKING Removed deprecated setIgnoreTransaction API method v5 - v6: Starting in agent v5.0.0, this method was marked as deprecated but left in to give a transition period for the new methods. v7: Applications must use the API method transactionHandle.ignore(). BREAKING Removed the api.custom_parameters_enabled configuration item and associated environment variable NEW_RELIC_API_CUSTOM_PARAMETERS. Applications must use the configuration api.custom_attributes_enabled or the associated environment variable NEW_RELIC_API_CUSTOM_ATTRIBUTES to enable newrelic.addCustomAttribute and newrelic.addCustomAttributes. BREAKING Removed deprecated Distributed Tracing API methods, createDistributedTracePayload() and acceptDistributedTracePayload() v6.4.0-v6.14.0: Starting in agent v6.4.0, these method were marked as deprecated but left in to give a transition period for the new methods. v7: Applications must use the API methods transactionHandle.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(headers) and transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(transportType, headers) . With these methods, the Node agent will now accept W3C's traceparent and tracestate headers when calling transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(headers) and include the W3C headers along with the New Relic distributed tracing header when calling transactionHandle.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(headers), unless the New Relic trace header format is disabled using distributed_tracing.exclude_newrelic_header:true. Update New Relic Dependencies to versions with updated Node version support @newrelic/aws-sdk v3.0.0 @newrelic/koa v5.0.0 @newrelic/native-metrics v6.0.0 @newrelic/superagent v4.0.0 @newrelic/test-utilities v5.0.0 Node version support Node v10 is the earliest version supported by the New Relic Node.js v7 agent. Node 8 and 9 are not supported by v7. Customers running Node 9 and earlier have two options: Upgrade to a supported version of Node and take advantage of the New Relic Node.js v7 agent's new features. Remain on New Relic Node.js v6 agent without the ability to use new features only available with update agent versions. Node 10 no longer receive updates, but New Relic will continue to support these versions of Node for the time being. Tip Upgrade to a newer version of Node as soon as possible. The next major version of the New Relic Node.js agent will likely remove support for Node 10. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 6 Before upgrading to Node.js agent version 6, review this information for major changes. Major changes with Node.js agent v6 Comments Upgraded official Koa framework instrumentation module to v3.0.0 v6: Added support for @koa/router up to v8.0.2. @koa/router v8.0.3 and greater are currently unsupported. v6: Added support for Node v12 and removed support for Node v6, 7, and 9. The minimum supported version is Node v8. Also see New Relic's Koa Release Notes on Github.. Removed deprecated max_samples_per_minute configuration parameter, which is replaced by max_samples_stored behavior v1 - v5: max_samples_per_minute defined the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If your application previously used max_samples_per_minute as an upper bound, you may need to lower the threshold to a valid maximum to avoid data being dropped on the server. We recommend less than 10k. v5: In agent v5 and lower, max_samples_stored defined the maximum number of events the agent stores if it's unable to communicate with the New Relic collector. v6: The new behavior of max_samples_stored defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. This usage of the configuration is consistent with the other APM agents. Troubleshooting tips: If you're missing event data, increase the value of max_samples_stored or revert to the default value. The value of max_samples_stored should not be over 10,000. Node version support Node 8 is the earliest version supported by the New Relic Node.js v6 agent. Node 6, 7 and 9 are not supported by v6. Customers running Node 6, 7 and 9 have two options: Upgrade to a supported version of Node and take advantage of the New Relic Node.js v6 agent's new features. Remain on New Relic Node.js v5 agent without the ability to use new features only available with update agent versions.

Upgrade to Node.js agent version 5 Before upgrading to Node.js agent v5, review this information for major changes. Also see New Relic's Node.js v5 migration guide on GitHub. Major changes with Node.js v5 agent Comments Removed deprecated addCustomParameter methods. v2 - v4: Starting in agent v2.7.0, these methods were marked as deprecated but left in to give a transition period for the new methods. v5: Applications must use the API methods newrelic.addCustomAttribute() and newrelic.addCustomAttributes(). These are drop-in replacements for the old methods. Removed deprecated create*Transaction methods. v2 - v4: Starting in agent v2.0.2, these methods were marked as deprecated but left in to give a transition period to the new methods. v5: Applications must update to the API methods newrelic.startWebTransaction() and newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction(). Troubleshooting tips: These new methods are not drop-in replacements for the old ones. Before moving to these new methods, review our custom instrumentation guide. Removed deprecated createTracer method. v3 - v4: Starting in agent v3.3.0, this method was marked as deprecated in favor of newrelic.startSegment(). v5: Applications must update to newrelic.startSegment(). Removed node-cassandra-cql instrumentation. v4: Applications using the npm package node-cassandra-cql would get datastore metrics for Cassandra. v5: Applications must migrate to the cassandra-driver package to get Cassandra datastore metrics.

Upgrade https-proxy-agent from v0 to v2 Major changes with Node.js v4 agent include an upgrade of the https-proxy-agent from v0 to v2. This dependency has been updated due to a security issue in the https-proxy-agent that the New Relic Node.js agent used. Because https-proxy v2 is incompatible with node v0.10 and v0.12, New Relic has deprecated those agent versions. There is no required action to migrate from v3 to v4 of New Relic's Node.js agent. Node version support Node 4 is the earliest version supported by the New Relic Node.js v4 agent. Node 0.10 and 0.12 are not supported by v4. Customers running Node 0.10 or 0.12 have two options: Upgrade to a supported version of Node and take advantage of the New Relic Node.js v4 agent's new features. Remain on the New Relic Node.js v3 agent without the ability to use new features only available with updated agent versions. Node 4, 5, and 7 also no longer receive updates, but New Relic will continue to support these versions of Node for the time being. Tip Upgrade to a newer version of Node as soon as possible. The next major version of the New Relic Node.js agent will likely remove support for Node 4 and 5. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 3 Before upgrading to Node.js agent agent v3, review this information for major changes. Also see New Relic's Node.js v3 migration guide on GitHub. Major changes with Node.js v3 agent Major changes with Node.js v3 agent Comments Removed SSL configuration v2: With the v2 agent, it was possible to configure the agent to connect to New Relic without encryption. v3: Node.js agent v3 always connects to New Relic servers using TLS encryption to protect communications. If the agent is configured to disable this, a warning is logged and the setting is ignored. Request parameters now prefixed with request.parameters. v2: The v2 agent collects request parameters, such as route parameters (/users/:userId) and query parameters (/users?userId=123), as the parameter name (userId). v3: The v3 agent prefixes all request parameters with the string request.parameters.. For example,userId appears as request.parameters.userId. Troubleshooting tips: If you have dashboards, alert policies, or other NRQL queries based on request parameters, update them with the new parameter names. Feature flags as of v3 As of New Relic Node.js agent v3, the send_request_uri_attribute feature is no longer configurable. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 2 Before upgrading to Node.js agent v2, review this information for major changes. Also see New Relic's Node.js v2 migration guide on GitHub. Major changes with Node.js v2 agent Major changes with Node.js v2 agent Comments Reversed naming and ignore rules v1: With the v1 agent, rules defined in the config properties rules.name and rules.ignore were applied in reverse order; the first rule in the list was applied last. v2: Node.js agent v2 applies rules in the order they are defined, so the first rule in the list is applied first. Troubleshooting tips: If you used naming rules in the v1 agent and notice problems, reverse the order of your rules in your configuration. De-duplicated HTTP request transactions v1: The v1 agent started a new transaction for each listener on an HTTP server's request event. In applications with multiple listeners on the request event, this resulted in extraneous transactions being created that almost always did not get named correctly. v2: The v2 agent only creates a single transaction for each request event emitted. Troubleshooting tips: If you used multiple request event listeners and added a call to newrelic.ignoreTransaction() to remove the extra transactions, remove those calls. Stopped swallowing outbound request errors v1: The v1 agent swallowed unhandled error events emitted by outbound HTTP request objects. v2: The v2 agent removes this behavior. Instead, the v2 agent does not change normal Node execution. This means the error event will always be emitted. Troubleshooting tips: If you are making outbound requests and currently do not listen for the error event, add a listener and handle the error as appropriate for your application. Updated configuration options as of v2 In newrelic.js, edit the Node.js agent configuration properties you use for compatiblity with the latest versions: Deprecated property New property capture_params attributes.enabled: false By default, request attributes are not sent to New Relic. Set attributes.enabled: true to include agent-defined or custom attributes in traces. The capture_params property has been deprecated. ignored_params attributes.exclude: [] Add any request attribute keys to the attributes.exclude list. Now, instead of having to be an exact match, wildcards (*) may be appended to each item for broader filtering. The ignored_params property has been deprecated. These Node.js agent configuration properties also have overrides for specific destinations, including: transaction_tracer transaction_events error_collector browser_monitoring For example, if the root attributes.enabled is true and you set transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled: false, this will restrict attributes from being collected in transaction traces, while still allowing them for all others. Deprecated API methods as of v2 The following methods from the Node.js agent have been deprecated, and New Relic has deleted them in v5 of the agent. Each has an easy replacement that accomplishes the same task in a more flexible and reliable way. newrelic.createWebTransaction() Replace with newrelic.startWebTransaction() and newrelic.getTransaction(). newrelic.createBackgroundTransaction() Replace with newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction() and newrelic.getTransaction(). newrelic.addCustomParameter() Replace with newrelic.addCustomAttribute(). newrelic.addCustomParameters() Replace with newrelic.addCustomAttributes(). New v2 agent API methods The following API methods are new with the New Relic Node.js v2 agent. newrelic.getTransaction() This method gets a reference to the currently running transaction. Use in conjunction with: newrelic.startWebTransaction newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction Callback-based message consumer services for troubleshooting message consumers newrelic.startWebTransaction()newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction() These new API methods replace the older create*Transaction methods. They are easier to use and seamlessly work with promises. Unlike the v1 method, the provided callback is invoked immediately. newrelic.instrument()newrelic.instrumentDatastore()newrelic.instrumentWebframework()newrelic.instrumentMessages() Use these methods to add custom instrumentation for third party modules, including those already instrumented by the New Relic Node.js agent. For more information, see New Relic's Node.js instrumentation tutorials on GitHub. newrelic.addCustomAttribute() Use this method to add a custom trace attribute. newrelic.addCustomAttributes() Use this method to add multiple custom trace attributes. Node version support for v2 The earliest version of Node supported by the New Relic Node.js v2 agent is 0.10. Node 0.8, which has not been updated since July of 2014, is not supported by v2. Customers running Node 0.8 have two options: Upgrade to a supported version of Node and take advantage of the New Relic Node.js v2 agent's new features. Remain on New Relic Node.js v1 agent without the ability to use new features only available with updated agent versions. Node 0.10 also no longer receives updates, but New Relic will continue to support this version of Node for the time being. Recommendation: Upgrade to a newer version of Node as soon as possible. npm version support as of v2 The New Relic Node.js agent now requires npm version 2.0.0 or higher. This version of npm comes packaged with Node 0.10.44 or higher. If you are using an earlier version of Node 0.10 you will need to first install npm 2.0.0 or higher, or upgrade to a newer version of Node. To install npm version 2: $ npm install --global npm@2 Copy Feature flags as of v2 As of New Relic Node.js agent v2: express_segments: This feature is no longer configurable. cat: This feature is now controlled by the cross_application_tracer.enabled configuration value. Framework minimum versions as of v2 As of New Relic Node.js agent v2: Module V2 minimum Minimum before v2 express 4.6.0 2.0.0 mysql 2.0.0 0.9.0",

Before you install the Node.js agent, make sure your application meets the following system requirements. Node.js version support Tip For best performance, use the latest active long term support (LTS) version of Node.js. Support for new Node.js releases We will support the latest even versions of Node.js releases by the beginning of the following active long term support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Node.js version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Node.js agent with support 16 October 2021 April-October 2021 End of support for Node.js releases reaching EOL When support for a new long term support agent version is made available, support for the Node.js agent version that reaches end-of-life during the same time period will simultaneously drop. The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Node.js version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Node.js agent dropping support 12 April 2022 April-October 2022 10 April 2021 As of July 31, 2021, we're discontinuing support for Node.js 10. For more details, including how you can easily prepare for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. Node.js 12 errors For Node.js 12, the following change affects the Node.js agent: Errors resulting in unhandled rejections are not scoped to the transaction that was active when the rejected promise was created. This is because the promise responsible for triggering the init async hook is no longer passed through on the promise wrap instance. This breaks the linkage that associates a given promise rejection with the transaction it was scheduled in. Supported Node.js frameworks Express 4.6.0 or higher Restify Connect v1 and v2 (router not supported) Hapi Koa 2.0.0 or higher (external module loaded with the agent) If you are using a supported framework with default routers, the Node.js agent can read these frameworks' route names as-is. However, if you want more specific names than are provided by your framework, you may want to use one or more of the tools New Relic provides with the Node.js transaction naming API. Operating systems Linux SmartOS macOS 10.7 and higher Windows Server 2008 and higher Datastores The Node.js agent monitors the performance of Node.js application calls to these datastores: Cassandra Memcached MongoDB MySQL (via mysql and mysql2 packages) Redis Postgres (including the native and pure JavaScript packages) Instance details We collect instance details for a variety of databases and database drivers. The ability to view specific instances and the types of database information in APM depends on your agent version. New Relic's Node.js agent version 1.31.0 or higher supports the following: Database npm module name Minimum module version Minimum agent version PostgreSQL pg 4.0.0 1.31.0 Redis redis 2.0.0 1.31.0 MongoDB mongodb 2.1.0 1.32.0 MySQL mysql 2.4.1 1.32.0 Memcached memcached 1.0.0 1.33.0 To request instance-level information from datastores currently not listed for your New Relic agent, get support at support.newrelic.com. Messages queues Message queue instrumentation is only available with the New Relic Node.js agent v2 or higher. Currently supported message queue instrumentation: amqplib For other message queue libraries, use custom instrumentation. Hosting services Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment AWS EC2 Microsoft Azure Heroku Process managers In general, process managers that handle starting, stopping, and restarting of Node.js (like Forever) should be compatible with the Node.js agent. If you are using PM2, the minimum supported version of PM2 is 2.0. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Connect the agent to other New Relic features The Node.js agent integrates with other features to give you full-stack observability: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Node.js agent automatically injects the browser monitoring agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser monitoring injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Node.js agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in infrastructure monitoring. New Relic dashboards The Node.js agent sends default events and attributes for NRQL queries. You can also record custom events for advanced analysis. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

      "body": "New Relic offers several tools to help obtain the information needed to provide useful metrics about your Node.js application. These include: Reading the route names (if used) from the Express and Restify routers Using the API to name the current request, either with simple names or groups of controllers with actions Support rules that are stored in your agent's configuration that can mark requests to be renamed or ignored based on regular expressions matched against the request's raw URLs (also available as API calls) The number of names that New Relic tracks needs to be small enough so that the user experience is robust. It also needs to be large enough to provide the right amount of information (without overwhelming you with data) so that you can identify problem spots in your applications more easily. For more information, see the Node.js agent configuration documentation and the Node.js agent API documentation on Github. Request names The Node.js agent captures the HTTP method along with a potentially parameterized path (such as /user/:id) or a regular expression (such as /^/user/([-0-9a-f]+)$/). These pieces of information become part of the request name. If you have support for slow transaction traces and have enabled capture_params in your config file, the transaction trace will also have the request's parameters and their values attached to it. If you are dissatisfied with the request names that the Node.js agent uses, you can use API calls to create more descriptive names. Tip If grouping your requests under the generic name, then /* is sufficient, and you do not need to customize your configuration file or API calls. Requirements New Relic uses request names to group requests for many charts and tables. The value of these visualizations will drop as the number of different request names increases. For example, do not include potentially dynamic data like GUIDs, numerical IDs, or timestamps in the request names you create. If your request is slow enough to generate a transaction trace, that trace will contain the original URL. If you enable parameter capture, the parameters will also be attached to the trace. Tip Avoid having more than 50 different transaction names. For example, if you have more than a couple hundred different request names, rethink your naming strategy. Avoid metric grouping issues The request naming API helps New Relic avoid problems with trying to handle too many metrics, which sometimes is referred to as \"metric explosion.\" New Relic has several strategies to deal with these issues; the most severe is simply to add offending applications to your deny list. The main reason for you to be careful in using these request-naming tools is to prevent that from happening to your applications. For more information, see Metric grouping issues. Guidelines Define your configuration rules from the most specific to the most general. The first rules listed in your config file or added with the Node.js transaction naming API will be applied first and should be narrowly targeted. More general \"fall-through\" rules should be added toward the end of the list, because they will be evaluated in the order they were configured or added using the Node.js transaction naming API. URL pattern matching An online retailer has a URL pattern like this: /user/customers/all/prospects /user/customers/all/current /user/customers/all/returning /user/customers/John /user/customers/Jane Copy The retailer could create rules like this: // newrelic.js exports.config={ //other configuration rules:{ name:[ { pattern: \"/user/customers/all/prospects/\", name: \"/user/customers/all/prospects\" }, { pattern: \"/user/customers/all/.*\", name: \"/user/customers/all\" }, { pattern: \"/user/customers/.*\", name: \"/user/customers/:customer\" } ] } } Copy With these rules, the retailer would create three transaction names: /user/customers/:customer /user/customers/all /user/customers/all/prospects If the retailer reversed the order, the rules would catch all transactions in :customer, which would not be as useful. Load the request naming API Make sure that loading the New Relic module is the first thing your application does, as it needs to bootstrap itself before the rest of your application loads: var newrelic = require('newrelic'); Copy This returns the request naming API. You can safely require the module from multiple modules in your application, as it only initializes itself once. Request API calls Here is a summary of the Request API calls for New Relic's Node.js agent. newrelic.setTransactionName(name) newrelic.setTransactionName(name) Copy Name the current request, following the request naming requirements. You can call this function anywhere within the context of an HTTP request handler, at any time after handling of the request has started, but before the request has finished. In general, if the request and response objects are in scope, you can set the name. Explicitly calling newrelic.setTransactionName() will override any names set by Express or Restify routes. Also, calls to newrelic.setTransactionName() and newrelic.setControllerName() will overwrite each other. The last one to run before the request ends wins. newrelic.setControllerName(name, \\[action]) newrelic.setControllerName(name, \\[action]) Copy Name the current request using a controller-style pattern, optionally including the current controller action. If the action is omitted, New Relic will include the HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.) as the action. The rules for when you can call newrelic.setControllerName() are the same as they are for newrelic.setTransactionName(), including the request naming requirements. Explicitly calling newrelic.setControllerName() will override any names set by Express or Restify routes. Also, calls to newrelic.setTransactionName() and newrelic.setControllerName() will overwrite each other. The last one to run before the request ends wins. Custom instrumentation API calls Use these API calls to expand your instrumentation with custom instrumentation. newrelic.instrument(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) newrelic.instrument(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) Copy Sets an instrumentation callback for a specific module. The provided onRequire callback will be fired when the given module is loaded with require. The moduleName parameter should be the string that will be passed to require; for example, 'express' or 'amqplib/callback_api'. The optional onError callback is called if the onRequire parameters throws an error. This is useful for debugging your instrumentation. Use this method to: Add instrumentation for modules not currently instrumented by New Relic. Instrument your own code. Replace the Node.js agent's built-in instrumentation with your own. For more information, see New Relic's Node.js instrumentation tutorial on Github. newrelic.instrumentDatastore(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) newrelic.instrumentDatastore(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) Copy Sets an instrumentation callback for a datastore module. This method is just like newrelic.instrument(), except it provides a datastore-specialized shim. For more information, see New Relic's Node.js datastore instrumentation tutorial on Github. newrelic.instrumentLoadedModule(moduleName, moduleInstance) newrelic.instrumentLoadedModule(moduleName, moduleInstance) Copy The instrumentLoadedModule method allows you to add stock instrumentation to specific modules in situations where it's impossible to have require('newrelic'); as the first line of your app's main module. // load the agent const newrelic = require('newrelic') // module loaded before newrelic const expressModule = require('express') // instrument express _after_ the agent has been loaded newrelic.instrumentLoadedModule( 'express', // the module's name, as a string expressModule // the module instance ); Copy Important This method cannot instrument any arbitrary module. Its purpose is to add modules that were missed because the agent was not loaded as the first thing in your program. The instrumentLoadedModule method can only instrument modules the agent would normally instrument. You can see a list of these modules in the agent's lib/instrumentations module. newrelic.instrumentMessages(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) newrelic.instrumentMessages(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) Copy Sets an instrumentation callback for a message service client module. This method is just like newrelic.instrument(), except it provides a message-service-specialized shim. For more information, see New Relic's Node.js message service instrumentation tutorial on Github. newrelic.instrumentWebframework(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) newrelic.instrumentWebframework(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) Copy Sets an instrumentation callback for a web framework module. This method is just like newrelic.instrument(), except it provides a web-framework-specialized shim. For more information, see New Relic's Node.js web framework instrumentation tutorial on Github. newrelic.startWebTransaction(url, handle) newrelic.startWebTransaction(url, handle) Copy Instrument the specified web transaction. Using this API call, you can instrument transactions that New Relic does not automatically detect. The url defines the transaction name and needs to be static. Do not include variable data such as user ID. The handle defines the function you want to instrument. New Relic will capture any metrics that would be captured by auto-instrumentation, as well as manual instrumentation via startSegment(). You must handle custom transactions manually by calling newrelic.getTransaction() at the start of your transaction, and then call transaction.end() when you are finished. New Relic begins timing the transaction when newrelic.startWebTransaction() is called and ends the transaction when transaction.end() is called. You can also return a promise to indicate the end of the transaction. Please note that if this promise rejects, it does not automatically hook into New Relic’s error tracking. This needs to be done manually with noticeError(). newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction(name, \\[group], handle) newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction(name, \\[group], handle) Copy Instrument the specified background transaction. Using this API call, you can expand New Relic's instrumentation to capture data from background transactions. The name defines the transaction name and needs to be static. Do not include variable data such as user ID. The group is optional, and it allows you to group similar jobs together via the transaction type in the user interface. Like name, the group needs to be static. The handle defines a function that includes the entire background job you want to instrument. New Relic will capture any metrics that would be captured by auto-instrumentation, as well as manual instrumentation via startSegment(). You must handle custom transactions manually by calling newrelic.getTransaction() at the start of your transaction, and then call transaction.end() when you are finished. New Relic begins timing the transaction when newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction() is called and ends the transaction when transaction.end() is called. You can also return a promise to indicate the end of the transaction. Please note that if this promise rejects, it does not automatically hook into New Relic’s error tracking. This needs to be done manually with noticeError(). newrelic.getTransaction() newrelic.getTransaction() Copy Returns a handle on the currently executing transaction. This handle can then be used to interact with a given transaction safely from any context. It is best used with newrelic.startWebTransaction() and newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction(). Please refer to the transaction handle section for more details. newrelic.endTransaction() newrelic.endTransaction() Copy End the current web or background custom transaction. This method requires being in the correct transaction context when called. This API call takes no arguments. newrelic.startSegment(name, record, handler, callback) newrelic.startSegment(name, record, handler, callback) Copy Instrument a particular method to improve visibility into a transaction, or optionally turn it into a metric. The name defines a name for the segment. This name will be visible in transaction traces and as a new metric in the New Relic UI. The record flag defines whether the segment should be recorded as a metric. The handler is the function you want to track as a segment. The optional callback is a function passed to the handler to fire after its work is done. The agent begins timing the segment when startSegment is called. The segment is ended when either the handler finishes executing, or callback is fired, if it is provided. Custom metrics API calls Use these API calls to record additional arbitrary metrics: newrelic.recordMetric(name, value) newrelic.recordMetric(name, value) Copy Use recordMetric to record an event-based metric, usually associated with a particular duration. The name must be a string following standard metric naming rules. The value will usually be a number, but it can also be an object. When value is a numeric value, it should represent the magnitude of a measurement associated with an event; for example, the duration for a particular method call. When value is an object, it must contain count, total, min, max, and sumOfSquares keys, all with number values. This form is useful to aggregate metrics on your own and report them periodically; for example, from a setInterval. These values will be aggregated with any previously collected values for the same metric. The names of these keys match the names of the keys used by the platform API. newrelic.incrementMetric(name, \\[amount]) newrelic.incrementMetric(name, \\[amount]) Copy Use incrementMetric to update a metric that acts as a simple counter. The count of the selected metric will be incremented by the specified amount, defaulting to 1. Custom events API calls Use these API calls to record additional events: newrelic.recordCustomEvent(eventType, attributes) newrelic.recordCustomEvent(eventType, attributes) Copy Use recordCustomEvent to record an event-based metric, usually associated with a particular duration. The eventType must be an alphanumeric string less than 255 characters. The attributes must be an object of key and value pairs. The keys must be shorter than 255 characters, and the values must be string, number, or boolean. Recording a custom event The following example demonstrates recording a custom event with multiple attributes. const attributes = { attribute1: 'value1', attribute2: 2 } newrelic.recordCustomEvent('MessagingEvent', attributes) Copy Transaction handle methods This section details the methods provided by the TransactionHandle class instance that can be obtained through newrelic.getTransaction(). Use these methods to interact directly with the current transaction: transactionHandle.end(\\[callback]) transactionHandle.end(\\[callback]) Copy Use transactionHandle.end to end the transaction referenced by the handle instance. The callback is invoked when the transaction has fully ended. The finished transaction passed to the callback as the first argument. transactionHandle.ignore() transactionHandle.ignore() Copy Use transactionHandle.ignore to ignore the transaction referenced by the handle instance. transactionHandle.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(headers) transactionHandle.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(headers) Copy Important This API requires distributed tracing to be enabled. For context on how to use this call and its partner call acceptDistributedTraceHeaders, first read Enable distributed tracing with agent APIs. transactionHandle.insertDistributedTraceHeaders is used to implement distributed tracing. It modifies the headers map that is passed in by adding W3C Trace Context headers and New Relic Distributed Trace headers. The New Relic headers can be disabled with distributed_tracing.exclude_newrelic_header: true in the config. This method replaces the deprecated createDistributedTracePayload method, which only creates New Relic Distributed Trace payloads. Generating distributed trace headers In the following example, by calling insertDistributedTraceHeaders with an empty object, the appropriate Distributed Trace headers and W3C Trace Context headers will be generated for the transaction. // Call newrelic.getTransaction to retrieve a handle on the current transaction. const transactionHandle = newrelic.getTransaction() // This could be a header object from an incoming request as well const headersObject = {} newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction('background task', function executeTransaction() { const transaction = newrelic.getTransaction() // generate the headers transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(headersObject) }) Copy transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(transportType, headers) transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(transportType, headers) Copy Important This API requires distributed tracing to be enabled. For context on how to use this call and its partner call insertDistributedTraceHeaders, first read Enable distributed tracing with agent APIs. transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders is used to instrument the called service for inclusion in a distributed trace. It links the spans in a trace by accepting a payload generated by insertDistributedTraceHeaders or generated by some other W3C Trace Context compliant tracer. This method accepts the headers of an incoming request, looks for W3C Trace Context headers, and if not found, falls back to New Relic distributed trace headers. This method replaces the deprecated (and now removed as of version 7.0.0) acceptDistributedTracePayload method, which only handles New Relic distributed trace payloads. transportType should be one of the following strings: AMQP HTTP HTTPS IronMQ JMS Kafka Other Queue Unknown headers should be an object containing all the headers in the incoming request. The keys must be lowercase. Accept incoming distributed trace headers The following example demonstrates adding distributed trace headers retrieved from a Kafka message. In this example, we assume that the incoming Kafka message has Distributed Trace headers inserted. // incoming Kafka message headers const headersObject = message.headers // Call newrelic.getTransaction to retrieve a handle on the current transaction. const transactionHandle = newrelic.getTransaction() newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction('background task', function executeTransaction() { const transaction = newrelic.getTransaction() // accept the headers transaction.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders('Kafka', headersObject) }) Copy transactionHandle.createDistributedTracePayload() transactionHandle.createDistributedTracePayload() Copy Caution This method is deprecated and was removed in version 7.0.0! Please use insertDistributedTraceHeaders. Important This API requires distributed tracing to be enabled. For instructions on how to use this call, along with its partner call acceptDistributedTracePayload, see Enable distributed tracing with agent APIs. This call is used to implement distributed tracing. It generates a payload that is read by the receiving application with acceptDistributedTracePayload. Important Note: In order to maintain proper ordering of spans in a trace, you must generate the payload in the context of the span that sends it. The DistributedTracePayload object has two available methods used for generating the payload in different formats: DistributedTracePayload#text: returns a JSON representation of the payload. Link a nested background transaction // Call newrelic.getTransaction to retrieve a handle on the current transaction. var transactionHandle = newrelic.getTransaction() var payload = transactionHandle.createDistributedTracePayload() var jsonPayload = payload.text() newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction('background task', function executeTransaction() { var backgroundHandle = newrelic.getTransaction() // Link the nested transaction by accepting the payload with the background transaction's handle backgroundHandle.acceptDistributedTracePayload(jsonPayload) }) Copy DistributedTracePayload#httpSafe: returns a base64 encoded JSON representation of the payload. Place payload on an outgoing request // Call newrelic.getTransaction to retrieve a handle on the current transaction. var transactionHandle = newrelic.getTransaction() var payload = transactionHandle.createDistributedTracePayload() // Place the base64 encoded value on an outbound request header. req.headers[myTracingHeader] = payload.httpSafe() Copy transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTracePayload(payload) transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTracePayload(payload) Copy Caution This method is deprecated and was removed in version 7.0.0! Please use acceptDistributedTraceHeaders. Important This API requires distributed tracing to be enabled. For context on how to use this call and its partner call createDistributedTracePayload, first read Enable distributed tracing with agent APIs. transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTracePayload is used to instrument the called service for inclusion in a distributed trace. It links the spans in a trace by accepting the payload generated by createDistributedTracePayload. transactionHandle.isSampled() transactionHandle.isSampled() Copy Returns whether this trace is being sampled. Other API calls New Relic's Node.js agent includes additional API calls. newrelic.addCustomAttribute(name, value) newrelic.addCustomAttribute(name, value) Copy Set a custom attribute value to be displayed along with the transaction trace in the New Relic UI. This must be called within the context of a transaction so it has a place to set the custom attributes. Custom attributes will appear in New Relic APM's transaction trace detail view and in errors for the transaction. Add custom attribute newrelic.addCustomAttribute('attribute1', 'value1') Copy Caution If you want to use your custom attributes, avoid using any of the reserved terms used by NRQL when naming them. newrelic.addCustomAttributes(attributes) newrelic.addCustomAttributes(attributes) Copy Set multiple custom attribute values to be displayed along with the transaction trace in the New Relic UI. The attributes should be passed as a single object. This must be called within the context of a transaction so it has a place to set the custom attributes. Custom attributes will appear in the transaction trace detail view and in errors for the transaction. Adding custom attributes const attributes = { attribute1: 'value1', attribute2: 2 } newrelic.addCustomAttributes(attributes) Copy Caution If you want to use your custom attributes, avoid using any of the reserved terms used by NRQL when naming them. newrelic.addCustomSpanAttribute(name, value) newrelic.addCustomSpanAttribute(name, value) Copy Set a custom span attribute value to be displayed along with a transaction trace span in the New Relic UI. This must be called within the context of an active segment/span so it has a place to set the custom span attributes. Custom span attributes will appear in the Attributes section of the span detail view. Add custom span attribute newrelic.addCustomSpanAttribute('attribute1', 'value') Copy Important This API requires distributed tracing and span events to be enabled. Caution If you want to use your custom span attributes, avoid using any of the reserved terms used by NRQL when naming them. newrelic.addCustomSpanAttributes(attributes) newrelic.addCustomSpanAttributes(attributes) Copy Set multiple custom span attribute values to be displayed along with the transaction trace spans in the New Relic UI. The attributes should be passed as a single object. This must be called within the context of an active segment/span so it has a place to set the custom span attributes. Custom span attributes will appear in the Attributes section of the span detail view. Add custom span attributes const attributes = { attribute1: 'value1', attribute2: 'value2' } newrelic.addCustomSpanAttributes(attributes) Copy Important This API requires distributed tracing and span events to be enabled. Caution If you want to use your custom span attributes, avoid using any of the reserved terms used by NRQL when naming them. newrelic.getBrowserTimingHeader() newrelic.getBrowserTimingHeader() Copy Returns the HTML snippet to be inserted into the header of HTML pages to enable browser monitoring. The HTML will instruct the browser to fetch a small JavaScript file and start the page timer. newrelic.setIgnoreTransaction(ignored) newrelic.setIgnoreTransaction(ignored) Copy Tell the module whether or not to ignore a given request. This allows you to explicitly filter long-polling, irrelevant routes or requests you know will be time-consuming. This also allows you to gather metrics for requests that otherwise would be ignored. To ignore the transaction, set the parameter to true will ignore the transaction. To prevent a transaction from being ignored with this function, pass the parameter false. Passing null or undefined will not change whether the transaction is ignored. Caution This method is deprecated and was removed in version 7.0.0. Please use transactionHandle.ignore() newrelic.noticeError(error, \\[customParameters]) newrelic.noticeError(error, \\[customParameters]) Copy Use this call if your app is doing its own error handling with domains or try/catch clauses, but you want all of the information about how many errors are coming out of the app to be centrally managed. Unlike other Node.js calls, this can be used outside of route handlers, but it will have additional context if called from within transaction scope. Caution Errors recorded using this method do not obey the ignore_status_codes configuration value. newrelic.shutdown(\\[options], callback) newrelic.shutdown(\\[options], callback) Copy Use this method to gracefully shut down the agent. options options.collectPendingData - type boolean - Tell the agent whether to send any pending data to the New Relic collector before shutting down. options.timeout - type number (ms) - The default time before forcing a shutdown. When collectPendingData is true, the agent will wait for a connection before shutting down. This timeout is useful for short lived processes, like AWS Lambda, in order to keep the process from staying open too long, while trying to connect. Example: newrelic.shutdown({collectPendingData: true, timeout: 3000}, (error) => { process.exit() }) Copy newrelic.getLinkingMetadata() newrelic.getLinkingMetadata() Copy Returns key/value pairs which can be used to link traces or entities. It will only contain items with meaningful values. For instance, if distributed tracing is disabled, trace.id will not be included. newrelic.getTraceMetadata() newrelic.getTraceMetadata() Copy Returns and object containing the current trace ID and span ID. Important This API requires distributed tracing to be enabled or an empty object will be returned. Rules for naming and ignoring requests If you do not want to put calls to the New Relic module directly into your application code, you can use pattern-based rules to name requests. There are two sets of rules: one for renaming requests, and one to mark requests to be ignored by New Relic's instrumentation. Here is the structure for rules in New Relic's Node.js agent. rules.name A list of rules of the format {pattern : \"pattern\", name : \"name\"} for matching incoming request URLs to pattern and naming the matching New Relic transaction's name. This acts as a regex replace, where you can set the pattern either as a string, or as a JavaScript regular expression literal, and both pattern and name are required. When passing a regex as a string, escape backslashes, as the agent does not keep them when given as a string in a pattern. Define your configuration rules from the most specific to the most general, as the patterns will be evaluated in order and are terminal in nature. For more information, see the naming guidelines. This can also be set with the environment variable NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES, with multiple rules passed in as a list of comma-delimited JSON object literals: NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES='{\"pattern\":\"^t\",\"name\":\"u\"},{\"pattern\":\"^u\",\"name\":\"t\"}' Copy Optional rules attributes [#optional-rules] Additional optional attributes are available: Optional rules attributes Description terminate_chain Default: true When set to true (default), no further rules will be evaluated if this rule is a match. Setting this to false is useful when multiple rules should be used together. For example, one rule could be replacing a common pattern in many different URLs, while subsequent rule(s) would be more specific. replace_all Default: false When set to true, all matches of the pattern will be replaced. Otherwise, only the first match will be replaced. Using the g flag with regular expression literal will have the same effect. For example: pattern: '[0-9]+', replace_all: true Copy This has the same effect as pattern: /[0-9]+/g. precedence By default the rules are evaluated in order, from first to last. If you prefer to have complete control over the order, you can give each rule a precedence attribute. The precedence is an integer number, and rules are evaluated in ascending order. If precedence is not explicitly defined, it will be set to 500 by default. Additional attributes are ignored. Testing your naming rules [#testing-rules] The Node.js agent comes with a command-line tool for testing naming rules. For more information, run the following command in terminal window in a directory where your app is installed: node node_modules/.bin/newrelic-naming-rules Copy Naming rule examples [#examples-rules] Here are some examples of naming rules and the results. Match full URL pattern: \"^/items/[0-9]+$\", name: \"/items/:id\" Copy will result in: /items/123 => /items/:id /orders/123 => /orders/123 (not replaced since the rule is a full match) Copy Replace first match in URL pattern: \"[0-9]+\", name: \":id\" Copy will result in: /orders/123 => /orders/:id /items/123 => /items/:id /orders/123/items/123 => /orders/:id/items/123 Copy Replace all matches in any URL pattern: \"[0-9]+\", name: \":id\", replace_all: true Copy will result in: /orders/123/items/123 => /orders/:id/items/:id Copy Match group references Using regular expression match group references: pattern: '^/(items|orders)/[0-9]+$', name: '/\\\\1/:id' Copy will result in: /orders/123 => /orders/:id /items/123 => /items/:id Copy rules.ignore This can also be set via the environment variable NEW_RELIC_IGNORING_RULES, with multiple rules passed in as a list of comma-delimited patterns. Currently there is no way to escape commas in patterns. NEW_RELIC_IGNORING_RULES='^/socket\\.io/\\*/xhr-polling,ignore_me' Copy Here are full examples of how rules are included in the configuration file: Naming rule example // newrelic.js exports.config = { // other configuration rules : { name : [ { pattern: \"/tables/name-here\", name: \"/name-hererule1\" } ] } Copy Ignoring rule example If you are using socket.io, you will have a use case for ignoring rules right out of the box. To keep socket.io long-polling from dominating your response-time metrics and affecting the Apdex metrics for your application, add a rule such as: // newrelic.js exports.config = { // other configuration rules : { ignore : [ '^\\/socket\\.io\\/.*\\/xhr-polling' ] } }; Copy API calls for rules Here are the API calls for naming and ignoring rules with New Relic's Node.js agent. newrelic.addNamingRule(pattern, name) Programmatic version of rules.name. Once naming rules are added, they cannot be removed until the Node process is restarted. They can also be added via the Node.js agent's configuration. Both parameters are required. newrelic.addIgnoringRule(pattern) Programmatic version of rules.ignore. Once ignoring rules are added, they cannot be removed until the Node process is restarted. They can also be added via the Node.js agent's configuration. This parameter is required.",

For additional information about specific agent updates, refer to the Node.js agent release notes. The release notes include a download link when applicable, plus instructions to download and install the latest version. If the newrelic module is listed in your package.json, run npm install. If you want to target just the newrelic module, run npm update newrelic. Recommendation: Test your updated version before moving it into production. If you have problems, follow the Node.js agent troubleshooting procedures. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 7 Before upgrading to Node.js version 7, review this information for major changes. Major changes with Node.js agent v7 Comments BREAKING Removed deprecated httpResponseCode, response.status and httpResponseMessage http response attributes v6.4.2-v6.14.0: Starting in agent v6.4.2, these attributes were marked as deprecated but left in to give a transition period for the new attributes. v7: When http response attribute reporting is enabled, http.statusCode and http.statusText will be reported. BREAKING Removed deprecated setIgnoreTransaction API method v5 - v6: Starting in agent v5.0.0, this method was marked as deprecated but left in to give a transition period for the new methods. v7: Applications must use the API method transactionHandle.ignore(). BREAKING Removed the api.custom_parameters_enabled configuration item and associated environment variable NEW_RELIC_API_CUSTOM_PARAMETERS. Applications must use the configuration api.custom_attributes_enabled or the associated environment variable NEW_RELIC_API_CUSTOM_ATTRIBUTES to enable newrelic.addCustomAttribute and newrelic.addCustomAttributes. BREAKING Removed deprecated Distributed Tracing API methods, createDistributedTracePayload() and acceptDistributedTracePayload() v6.4.0-v6.14.0: Starting in agent v6.4.0, these method were marked as deprecated but left in to give a transition period for the new methods. v7: Applications must use the API methods transactionHandle.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(headers) and transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(transportType, headers) . With these methods, the Node agent will now accept W3C's traceparent and tracestate headers when calling transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(headers) and include the W3C headers along with the New Relic distributed tracing header when calling transactionHandle.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(headers), unless the New Relic trace header format is disabled using distributed_tracing.exclude_newrelic_header:true. Update New Relic Dependencies to versions with updated Node version support @newrelic/aws-sdk v3.0.0 @newrelic/koa v5.0.0 @newrelic/native-metrics v6.0.0 @newrelic/superagent v4.0.0 @newrelic/test-utilities v5.0.0 Node version support Node v10 is the earliest version supported by the New Relic Node.js v7 agent. Node 8 and 9 are not supported by v7. Customers running Node 9 and earlier have two options: Upgrade to a supported version of Node and take advantage of the New Relic Node.js v7 agent's new features. Remain on New Relic Node.js v6 agent without the ability to use new features only available with update agent versions. Node 10 no longer receive updates, but New Relic will continue to support these versions of Node for the time being. Tip Upgrade to a newer version of Node as soon as possible. The next major version of the New Relic Node.js agent will likely remove support for Node 10. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 6 Before upgrading to Node.js agent version 6, review this information for major changes. Major changes with Node.js agent v6 Comments Upgraded official Koa framework instrumentation module to v3.0.0 v6: Added support for @koa/router up to v8.0.2. @koa/router v8.0.3 and greater are currently unsupported. v6: Added support for Node v12 and removed support for Node v6, 7, and 9. The minimum supported version is Node v8. Also see New Relic's Koa Release Notes on Github.. Removed deprecated max_samples_per_minute configuration parameter, which is replaced by max_samples_stored behavior v1 - v5: max_samples_per_minute defined the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If your application previously used max_samples_per_minute as an upper bound, you may need to lower the threshold to a valid maximum to avoid data being dropped on the server. We recommend less than 10k. v5: In agent v5 and lower, max_samples_stored defined the maximum number of events the agent stores if it's unable to communicate with the New Relic collector. v6: The new behavior of max_samples_stored defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. This usage of the configuration is consistent with the other APM agents. Troubleshooting tips: If you're missing event data, increase the value of max_samples_stored or revert to the default value. The value of max_samples_stored should not be over 10,000. Node version support Node 8 is the earliest version supported by the New Relic Node.js v6 agent. Node 6, 7 and 9 are not supported by v6. Customers running Node 6, 7 and 9 have two options: Upgrade to a supported version of Node and take advantage of the New Relic Node.js v6 agent's new features. Remain on New Relic Node.js v5 agent without the ability to use new features only available with update agent versions. Node 8 no longer receive updates, but New Relic will continue to support these versions of Node for the time being. Tip Upgrade to a newer version of Node as soon as possible. The next major version of the New Relic Node.js agent will likely remove support for Node 8. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 5 Before upgrading to Node.js agent v5, review this information for major changes. Also see New Relic's Node.js v5 migration guide on GitHub. Major changes with Node.js v5 agent Comments Removed deprecated addCustomParameter methods. v2 - v4: Starting in agent v2.7.0, these methods were marked as deprecated but left in to give a transition period for the new methods. v5: Applications must use the API methods newrelic.addCustomAttribute() and newrelic.addCustomAttributes(). These are drop-in replacements for the old methods. Removed deprecated create*Transaction methods. v2 - v4: Starting in agent v2.0.2, these methods were marked as deprecated but left in to give a transition period to the new methods. v5: Applications must update to the API methods newrelic.startWebTransaction() and newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction(). Troubleshooting tips: These new methods are not drop-in replacements for the old ones. Before moving to these new methods, review our custom instrumentation guide. Removed deprecated createTracer method. v3 - v4: Starting in agent v3.3.0, this method was marked as deprecated in favor of newrelic.startSegment(). v5: Applications must update to newrelic.startSegment(). Removed node-cassandra-cql instrumentation. v4: Applications using the npm package node-cassandra-cql would get datastore metrics for Cassandra. v5: Applications must migrate to the cassandra-driver package to get Cassandra datastore metrics. This module is actively maintained by the same developers. The node-cassandra-cql package was abandoned in February of 2014 in favor of the cassandra-driver package. Removed deprecated capture_params and ignored_params configurations. v2 - v4: Starting in agent v2.7.0, these configuration parameters caused a warning to be logged, and the values were automatically upgraded to the new attributes configurations. v5: A warning will still be logged but the configuration is ignored, and no automatic upgrading happens any more. Troubleshooting tips: If your application had parameters listed in the ignored_params configuration, you will need to move them to attributes.exclude. Node version support Node 6 is the earliest version supported by the New Relic Node.js v5 agent. Node 4 and 5 are not supported by v5. Customers running Node 4 or 5 have two options: Upgrade to a supported version of Node and take advantage of the New Relic Node.js v5 agent's new features. Remain on New Relic Node.js v4 agent without the ability to use new features only available with update agent versions. Node 7 and 9 no longer receive updates, but New Relic will continue to support these versions of Node for the time being. Tip Upgrade to a newer version of Node as soon as possible. The next major version of the New Relic Node.js agent will likely remove support for Node 6 and 7. Feature flags as of v5 As of New Relic for Node.js v5: custom_instrumentation: This feature is no longer configurable. custom_metrics: This feature is no longer configurable. synthetics: This feature is no longer configurable. native_metrics: This feature is now controlled by the plugins.native_metrics.enabled configuration value. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 4 Before upgrading to Node.js agent v4, review this information for major changes. Also see New Relic's Node.js v4 migration guide on GitHub. Upgrade https-proxy-agent from v0 to v2 Major changes with Node.js v4 agent include an upgrade of the https-proxy-agent from v0 to v2. This dependency has been updated due to a security issue in the https-proxy-agent that the New Relic Node.js agent used. Because https-proxy v2 is incompatible with node v0.10 and v0.12, New Relic has deprecated those agent versions. There is no required action to migrate from v3 to v4 of New Relic's Node.js agent. Node version support Node 4 is the earliest version supported by the New Relic Node.js v4 agent. Node 0.10 and 0.12 are not supported by v4. Customers running Node 0.10 or 0.12 have two options: Upgrade to a supported version of Node and take advantage of the New Relic Node.js v4 agent's new features. Remain on the New Relic Node.js v3 agent without the ability to use new features only available with updated agent versions. Node 4, 5, and 7 also no longer receive updates, but New Relic will continue to support these versions of Node for the time being. Tip Upgrade to a newer version of Node as soon as possible. The next major version of the New Relic Node.js agent will likely remove support for Node 4 and 5. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 3 Before upgrading to Node.js agent agent v3, review this information for major changes. Also see New Relic's Node.js v3 migration guide on GitHub. Major changes with Node.js v3 agent Major changes with Node.js v3 agent Comments Removed SSL configuration v2: With the v2 agent, it was possible to configure the agent to connect to New Relic without encryption. v3: Node.js agent v3 always connects to New Relic servers using TLS encryption to protect communications. If the agent is configured to disable this, a warning is logged and the setting is ignored. Request parameters now prefixed with request.parameters. v2: The v2 agent collects request parameters, such as route parameters (/users/:userId) and query parameters (/users?userId=123), as the parameter name (userId). v3: The v3 agent prefixes all request parameters with the string request.parameters.. For example,userId appears as request.parameters.userId. Troubleshooting tips: If you have dashboards, alert policies, or other NRQL queries based on request parameters, update them with the new parameter names. Feature flags as of v3 As of New Relic Node.js agent v3, the send_request_uri_attribute feature is no longer configurable. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 2 Before upgrading to Node.js agent v2, review this information for major changes. Also see New Relic's Node.js v2 migration guide on GitHub. Major changes with Node.js v2 agent Major changes with Node.js v2 agent Comments Reversed naming and ignore rules v1: With the v1 agent, rules defined in the config properties rules.name and rules.ignore were applied in reverse order; the first rule in the list was applied last. v2: Node.js agent v2 applies rules in the order they are defined, so the first rule in the list is applied first. Troubleshooting tips: If you used naming rules in the v1 agent and notice problems, reverse the order of your rules in your configuration. De-duplicated HTTP request transactions v1: The v1 agent started a new transaction for each listener on an HTTP server's request event. In applications with multiple listeners on the request event, this resulted in extraneous transactions being created that almost always did not get named correctly. v2: The v2 agent only creates a single transaction for each request event emitted. Troubleshooting tips: If you used multiple request event listeners and added a call to newrelic.ignoreTransaction() to remove the extra transactions, remove those calls. Stopped swallowing outbound request errors v1: The v1 agent swallowed unhandled error events emitted by outbound HTTP request objects. v2: The v2 agent removes this behavior. Instead, the v2 agent does not change normal Node execution. This means the error event will always be emitted. Troubleshooting tips: If you are making outbound requests and currently do not listen for the error event, add a listener and handle the error as appropriate for your application. Updated configuration options as of v2 In newrelic.js, edit the Node.js agent configuration properties you use for compatiblity with the latest versions: Deprecated property New property capture_params attributes.enabled: false By default, request attributes are not sent to New Relic. Set attributes.enabled: true to include agent-defined or custom attributes in traces. The capture_params property has been deprecated. ignored_params attributes.exclude: [] Add any request attribute keys to the attributes.exclude list. Now, instead of having to be an exact match, wildcards (*) may be appended to each item for broader filtering. The ignored_params property has been deprecated. These Node.js agent configuration properties also have overrides for specific destinations, including: transaction_tracer transaction_events error_collector browser_monitoring For example, if the root attributes.enabled is true and you set transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled: false, this will restrict attributes from being collected in transaction traces, while still allowing them for all others. Deprecated API methods as of v2 The following methods from the Node.js agent have been deprecated, and New Relic has deleted them in v5 of the agent. Each has an easy replacement that accomplishes the same task in a more flexible and reliable way. newrelic.createWebTransaction() Replace with newrelic.startWebTransaction() and newrelic.getTransaction(). newrelic.createBackgroundTransaction() Replace with newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction() and newrelic.getTransaction(). newrelic.addCustomParameter() Replace with newrelic.addCustomAttribute(). newrelic.addCustomParameters() Replace with newrelic.addCustomAttributes(). New v2 agent API methods The following API methods are new with the New Relic Node.js v2 agent. newrelic.getTransaction() This method gets a reference to the currently running transaction. Use in conjunction with: newrelic.startWebTransaction newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction Callback-based message consumer services for troubleshooting message consumers newrelic.startWebTransaction()newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction() These new API methods replace the older create*Transaction methods. They are easier to use and seamlessly work with promises. Unlike the v1 method, the provided callback is invoked immediately. newrelic.instrument()newrelic.instrumentDatastore()newrelic.instrumentWebframework()newrelic.instrumentMessages() Use these methods to add custom instrumentation for third party modules, including those already instrumented by the New Relic Node.js agent. For more information, see New Relic's Node.js instrumentation tutorials on GitHub. newrelic.addCustomAttribute() Use this method to add a custom trace attribute. newrelic.addCustomAttributes() Use this method to add multiple custom trace attributes. Node version support for v2 The earliest version of Node supported by the New Relic Node.js v2 agent is 0.10. Node 0.8, which has not been updated since July of 2014, is not supported by v2. Customers running Node 0.8 have two options: Upgrade to a supported version of Node and take advantage of the New Relic Node.js v2 agent's new features. Remain on New Relic Node.js v1 agent without the ability to use new features only available with updated agent versions. Node 0.10 also no longer receives updates, but New Relic will continue to support this version of Node for the time being. Recommendation: Upgrade to a newer version of Node as soon as possible. npm version support as of v2 The New Relic Node.js agent now requires npm version 2.0.0 or higher. This version of npm comes packaged with Node 0.10.44 or higher. If you are using an earlier version of Node 0.10 you will need to first install npm 2.0.0 or higher, or upgrade to a newer version of Node. To install npm version 2: $ npm install --global npm@2 Copy Feature flags as of v2 As of New Relic Node.js agent v2: express_segments: This feature is no longer configurable. cat: This feature is now controlled by the cross_application_tracer.enabled configuration value. Framework minimum versions as of v2 As of New Relic Node.js agent v2: Module V2 minimum Minimum before v2 express 4.6.0 2.0.0 mysql 2.0.0 0.9.0",

      "body": "Our Node.js agent is publicly available on the Node Package Manager (npm) repository as well as on GitHub. Before you install the Node.js agent, make sure your application meets the following system requirements. Node.js version support Tip For best performance, use the latest active long term support (LTS) version of Node.js. Support for new Node.js releases We will support the latest even versions of Node.js releases by the beginning of the following active long term support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Node.js version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Node.js agent with support 16 October 2021 April-October 2021 End of support for Node.js releases reaching EOL When support for a new long term support agent version is made available, support for the Node.js agent version that reaches end-of-life during the same time period will simultaneously drop. The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Node.js version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Node.js agent dropping support 12 April 2022 April-October 2022 10 April 2021 As of July 31, 2021, we're discontinuing support for Node.js 10. For more details, including how you can easily prepare for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. Node.js 12 errors For Node.js 12, the following change affects the Node.js agent: Errors resulting in unhandled rejections are not scoped to the transaction that was active when the rejected promise was created. This is because the promise responsible for triggering the init async hook is no longer passed through on the promise wrap instance. This breaks the linkage that associates a given promise rejection with the transaction it was scheduled in. Supported Node.js frameworks Express 4.6.0 or higher Restify Connect v1 and v2 (router not supported) Hapi Koa 2.0.0 or higher (external module loaded with the agent) If you are using a supported framework with default routers, the Node.js agent can read these frameworks' route names as-is. However, if you want more specific names than are provided by your framework, you may want to use one or more of the tools New Relic provides with the Node.js transaction naming API. Operating systems Linux SmartOS macOS 10.7 and higher Windows Server 2008 and higher Datastores The Node.js agent monitors the performance of Node.js application calls to these datastores: Cassandra Memcached MongoDB MySQL (via mysql and mysql2 packages) Redis Postgres (including the native and pure JavaScript packages) Instance details We collect instance details for a variety of databases and database drivers. The ability to view specific instances and the types of database information in APM depends on your agent version. New Relic's Node.js agent version 1.31.0 or higher supports the following: Database npm module name Minimum module version Minimum agent version PostgreSQL pg 4.0.0 1.31.0 Redis redis 2.0.0 1.31.0 MongoDB mongodb 2.1.0 1.32.0 MySQL mysql 2.4.1 1.32.0 Memcached memcached 1.0.0 1.33.0 To request instance-level information from datastores currently not listed for your New Relic agent, get support at support.newrelic.com. Messages queues Message queue instrumentation is only available with the New Relic Node.js agent v2 or higher. Currently supported message queue instrumentation: amqplib For other message queue libraries, use custom instrumentation. Hosting services Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment AWS EC2 Microsoft Azure Heroku Process managers In general, process managers that handle starting, stopping, and restarting of Node.js (like Forever) should be compatible with the Node.js agent. If you are using PM2, the minimum supported version of PM2 is 2.0. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Connect the agent to other New Relic features The Node.js agent integrates with other features to give you full-stack observability: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Node.js agent automatically injects the browser monitoring agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser monitoring injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Node.js agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in infrastructure monitoring. New Relic dashboards The Node.js agent sends default events and attributes for NRQL queries. You can also record custom events for advanced analysis. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

With features like service maps and error analytics, our Node.js agent helps you get the full picture of your app environment. Tip To use Node.js or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Why it matters Many Node application requests are based on raw URLs. Our solution is different. New Relic for Node.js assumes it can group requests to your application into transactions instead of HTTP requests. Transactions are defined by giving one or more request paths a name. These names are used to: Visualize where your app is spending its time (in transaction breakdowns). Identify slow requests. Group metrics. Show you which portions of your application are suffering from slow database performance. Installation To install our agent, you need to sign up for New Relic first. Once you're logged in, follow the instructions or use our launcher to get data flowing in. Review the system requirements. Read the install docs. Go directly to the New Relic UI to add Node.js data. Extend your instrumentation After installing the Node.js agent, extend your instrumentation: Extend your instrumentation Comments Customization Implement Node.js custom instrumentation. Collect custom metrics via an API call. Use our Node.js agent API to control, customize, or extend the agent's functionality. Open source telemetry To create your own integrations, use our Node Telemetry SDK. To gain visibility into your GraphQL payloads, use our Apollo Server plugin. Traces Enable distributed tracing.

      "body": "In New Relic's APM, the Node VMs page provides useful runtime data for troubleshooting performance issues and monitoring the health of your application. What you need Some of the charts on the Node VMs page require you to install the New Relic Native Metrics Module in addition to the Node.js agent. For installation instructions, see Node VM Measurements. View Node VM statistics one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Node VMs: When multiple servers are reporting to the same application, the page breaks charts down by server. You can view data for an individual server and obtain additional details by selecting a server from the Servers filter at the top of the page. To correlate spikes or upward trends in any of these measurements with specific transactions: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Node VMs. Select the time period by clicking and dragging within any of the charts. Navigate to the Transactions page or any other page. As you go to other pages, the time picker selection will remain the same. Analyze performance issues Here is a summary of the data available on individual Node VM charts. By using all of the charts together, you can troubleshoot performance issues. For example: When the application starts using more objects, memory usage will increase, and garbage collection (GC) will run more frequently. CPU utilization will increase due to time spent in GC. Abnormally long synchronous code execution can increase CPU utilization. This will show spikes in the Event loop max CPU time per tick chart. GC pause time The amount of time spent in garbage collection. For a single server, the chart shows average, max, and total time per minute. For multiple servers, the chart shows total time grouped by server. Typically, spikes in GC time or frequency indicate a potential issue. GC pause frequency The number of times GC runs were executed per minute. For a single server, the chart is broken down by the type of GC. For multiple servers, the chart shows total number of GC calls (all types combined) grouped by server. GC pause time by type This chart shows the total time spent in garbage collection per minute, broken down by GC type. It is only shown when viewing a single server. You might see the following types depending on your version of Node.js and app activity: Value Description Scavenge The most common garbage collection method. Node.js will typically trigger one of these every time the VM is idle. MarkSweepCompact The heaviest type of garbage collection V8 may do. If you see many of these happening you will need to either keep fewer objects around in your process or increase V8's heap limit. IncrementalMarking A phased garbage collection that interleaves collection with application logic to reduce the amount of time the application is paused. Only in Node.js v6 or higher. ProcessWeakCallbacks After a garbage collection occurs, V8 will call any weak reference callbacks registered for objects that have been freed. This measurement is from the start of the first weak callback to the end of the last for a given garbage collection. Only in Node.js v6 or higher. Memory usage This chart shows the amount of memory consumed by the Node.js process. For multiple servers, the chart shows total memory grouped by server. For a single server, the chart is segmented by the following types of memory: Value Description Non-heap The memory allocated to data outside V8's heap (for example, buffers, sockets). V8 heap (used) The amount of memory being used by V8 (for example, JavaScript objects). V8 heap (free) The amount of memory set aside by V8 for memory pooling. This memory isn't being actively used, but is set aside for V8 to freely allocate more as needed. CPU utilization This chart shows the CPU utilization of the Node process. For multiple servers, the chart shows total CPU utilization grouped by server. For a single server, the chart is segmented by the following: Value Description User The time spent executing the user code, divided by wall-clock time. System The time spent in the system kernel on behalf of the Node process, divided by wall-clock time. Event loop — ticks per minute This chart shows the number of event loop ticks per minute. A tick is a single turn of the event loop, in which functions that are ready to be executed are run. As a part of each event loop turn, Node waits for pending I/O to complete. Once any I/O events are received, the event loop executes callbacks associated with it. Therefore, the number of ticks per minute corresponds to how frequently I/O events occur. Event loop — max CPU time per tick This chart shows the maximum time spent in a single tick per minute. This is useful with detecting an abnormally long event loop tick, which indicates long synchronous code execution. View clusters of multiple processes When multiple Node.js processes on the same server report to the same New Relic application, these charts will show aggregated data. This is because each worker process in a cluster has its own separate Node.js runtime and collects separate data. Clusters Comments Sum across all workers The following charts show a sum across all workers: GC pause time - Total time per minute GC pause frequency GC pause time by type CPU utilization Event loop ticks per minute Average from all workers The following charts show an average from all workers: Memory usage GC pause time — average Max across all workers The following charts show max across all workers: GC pause time — max Event loop — max CPU time per tick",

      "body": "New Relic for Node.js automatically instruments most standard web requests, but sometimes you want expanded instrumentation. With the agent's custom instrumentation API, you can create instrumentation for otherwise unsupported web frameworks, datastores, and message service clients. The Node.js agent's custom instrumentation API also allows you to: Create web transactions (useful for things like web sockets, where transactions can't be automatically created). Create non-web background transactions (useful for recording background jobs). Target specific sections of your code for deeper analysis. Agent version requirements The custom instrumentation methods in this document are available as of Node.js agent version 2.0.0. For information on instrumentation using the custom instrumentation API v1.x, see the documentation for legacy Node.js custom instrumentation. Instrument unsupported web frameworks Beginning with Node.js agent version 2.0.0, New Relic provides an API to expand instrumentation for additional web frameworks. For more information, including a tutorial, see the documentation for Node.js web framework instrumentation on GitHub. Instrument unsupported message service clients Beginning with Node.js agent version 2.0.0, New Relic provides an API to expand instrumentation for additional message service libraries. For more information, including a tutorial, see the documentation for Node.js message service client instrumentation on GitHub. Instrument unsupported datastores Beginning with Node.js agent version 2.0.0, New Relic provides an API to expand instrumentation for additional datastore libraries. For more information, including a tutorial, see the documentation for Node.js datastore instrumentation on GitHub. Instrument web transactions In order to create custom web transactions, call startWebTransaction to start the transaction. To end the transaction, use any of these options: Ending the transaction Comments Promise If the handler passed to startWebTransaction returns a promise, the agent will end the transaction when the returned promise resolves or rejects. Manual If you call getTransaction in the context of the new transaction, this notifies the agent that the transaction will be handled manually. If getTransaction is called in the handler, then you must end the transaction by calling transaction.end(). Synchronous If neither of these options are fulfilled, the transaction will be ended when the handler returns synchronously. Custom web transaction example: Instrument three transactions in socket.io This example instruments a /websocket/ping transaction, a /websocket/update transaction, and a /websocket/new-message transaction within socket.io. The /ping example is synchronous, while the /new-message and /update examples are asynchronous. var nr = require('newrelic') var app = require('http').createServer() var io = require('socket.io')(app) io.on('connection', function (socket) { socket.on('ping', function (data) { nr.startWebTransaction('/websocket/ping', function transactionHandler() { // Ended automatically after synchronously returning socket.emit('pong') }) }) socket.on('update', function (data) { nr.startWebTransaction('/websocket/update', function transactionHandler() { // Using API#getTransaction var transaction = nr.getTransaction() updateChatWindow(data, function transactionHandler() { socket.emit('update-done') transaction.end() }) }) }) socket.on('new-message', function (data) { nr.startWebTransaction('/websocket/new-message', function transactionHandler() { // Returning a promise return new Promise(function (resolve, reject) { addMessageToChat(data, function () { socket.emit('message-received') resolve() }) }) }) }) }) Copy This method only gives basic timing data for the transaction created. To create more intricate timing data and transaction naming for a particular framework, see the Node.js API documentation and the related tutorial on GitHub. Instrument background transactions You can use custom transactions to instrument non-web transactions (background tasks); for example: Periodic jobs within your app Work that continues after a request completes To instrument background tasks, call startBackgroundTransaction in your handler to start a background transaction. To end the transaction, use any of these options: Ending the transaction Comments Promise If the handler passed to startBackgroundTransaction returns a promise, the agent will end the transaction when the returned promise resolves or rejects. Manual If you call getTransaction in the context of the new transaction, this notifies the agent that the transaction will be handled manually. If getTransaction is called in the handler, then you must end the transaction by calling transaction.end(). Synchronous If neither of these options are fulfilled, the transaction will be ended when the handler returns synchronously. Custom background transaction example: Instrument within setInterval This example instruments update:cache within setInterval: var nr = require('newrelic') var redis = require('redis').createClient() // Using API#getTransaction to manage ending the transaction setInterval(function () { nr.startBackgroundTransaction('update:cache', function transactionHandler() { var newValue = someDataGenerator() var transaction = nr.getTransaction() redis.set('some:cache:key', newValue, function () { transaction.end() }) }) }, 30000) // Every 30s //Using a promise to manage ending the transaction setInterval(function () { nr.startBackgroundTransaction('flush:cache', function transactionHandler() { return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) { flushCache(redis, function afterFlush(err) { if (err) { return reject(err) } resolve() }) }) }) }, 60*60*1000) Copy Expand instrumentation within transactions You can create instrumentation using the instrumentation registration methods on the API. Writing instrumentation using the instrumentation API allows you to specify metrics and naming in greater detail by \"monkey patching\" methods (replacing functions) on relevant objects. Other options can offer visibility into web transactions that are already instrumented, or gain insight into databases and other in-transaction work that is not automatically instrumented. To do this, wrap your callbacks in custom tracers. Custom tracers create and collect specific metrics for an additional segment within an existing transaction, such as a particular function or a database call. To instrument individual callbacks, call startSegment() inside the callback, and move the main callback logic to the handler function. To instrument a function that is called inside an asynchronous function, wrap both the target function and its parent asynchronous function with startSegment(). Important These examples must be placed in code that is running under a transaction. The origin of the transaction, custom or automatically created, does not matter. Example: Instrument a callback This example tracks a single callback: // Wrap the method in a segment. nr.startSegment('db:createObject', true, function(cb) { // This is recorded as the `db:createObject` segment. db.createObject(cb) }, function(err, result) { // This is recorded as the callback to the `db:createObject` segment. if (util.handleError(err, res)) { return } res.write(JSON.stringify(result.rows[0].id)) res.write('\\n') res.end() }) Copy Example: Instrument asynchronous functions using callbacks This example tracks both pg.connect and client.query. This is because client.query is called by an asynchronous parent function (pg.connect). Otherwise, you would not get any data from client.query. This allows startSegment() to propagate the active transaction across those asynchronous boundaries. nr.startSegment('pg:connect', true, function(cb) { pg.connect(config.db_string, cb) }, function(err, client, done) { if (util.handleError(err, '500', res)) { return done() } nr.startSegment('pg:query', true, function(cb) { client.query('SELECT count(*) FROM test_count'), cb) }, function(err, result) { if (util.handleError(err, '500', res)) { return done() } res.write(result.rows[0].count) res.write('\\n') }) }) Copy Example: Instrument asynchronous functions using promises This example is the same as the callback one, but for interacting with a promise-based API. For promises, simply return the promise and call then after startSegment to continue your execution. nr.startSegment('pg:connect', true, function() { // This `pg:connect` segment will time until the returned promise // either resolves or rejects. return pg.connect(config.db_string) }).then(function(client) { // The transaction context is propagated into following promises. return nr.startSegment('pg:query', true, function() { return client.query('SELECT count(*) FROM test_count')) }).then(function(result) { res.write(result.rows[0].count) res.write('\\n') res.end() }, function(err) { // Error from querying. util.handleError(err, '500', res) }).finally(function() { return client.release() }) }, function(err) { // Error from connecting. util.handleError(err, '500', res) }) Copy Example: Instrument async functions This example shows how to instrument code using async/await to control asynchronous work. This requires using Node 8 or higher, as well as the New Relic for Node.js agent v2.3.0 or higher. try { const client = await nr.startSegment('pg:connect', true, async () => { // Async functions simply return promises, so this example is // very similar to the promise one. return await pg.connect(config.db_string) }) // The transaction context is propagated into the code following `await`. try { const result = await nr.startSegment('pg:query', true, async () => { return await client.query('SELECT count(*) FROM test_count')) }) res.write(result.rows[0].count) res.write('\\n') res.end() } catch(err) { // Error from querying. util.handleError(err, '500', res) } finally { await client.release() } } catch(err) { // Error from connecting. util.handleError(err, '500', res) } Copy Example: Instrument a synchronous function This example shows how startSegment can be used to record a synchronous function that is responsible for assigning its return value to a variable. var result = nr.startSegment('calculateTotal', true, function() { return calculateTotal(outerVar1, outerVar2) }) Copy Important The startSegment function is available of the Node Agent 3.3.0 release.",

      "body": "In New Relic's APM, the Node VMs page provides useful runtime data for troubleshooting performance issues and monitoring the health of your application. What you need Some of the charts on the Node VMs page require you to install the New Relic Native Metrics Module in addition to the Node.js agent. For installation instructions, see Node VM Measurements. View Node VM statistics one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Node VMs: When multiple servers are reporting to the same application, the page breaks charts down by server. You can view data for an individual server and obtain additional details by selecting a server from the Servers filter at the top of the page. To correlate spikes or upward trends in any of these measurements with specific transactions: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Node VMs. Select the time period by clicking and dragging within any of the charts. Navigate to the Transactions page or any other page. As you go to other pages, the time picker selection will remain the same. Analyze performance issues Here is a summary of the data available on individual Node VM charts. By using all of the charts together, you can troubleshoot performance issues. For example: When the application starts using more objects, memory usage will increase, and garbage collection (GC) will run more frequently. CPU utilization will increase due to time spent in GC. Abnormally long synchronous code execution can increase CPU utilization. This will show spikes in the Event loop max CPU time per tick chart. GC pause time The amount of time spent in garbage collection. For a single server, the chart shows average, max, and total time per minute. For multiple servers, the chart shows total time grouped by server. Typically, spikes in GC time or frequency indicate a potential issue. GC pause frequency The number of times GC runs were executed per minute. For a single server, the chart is broken down by the type of GC. For multiple servers, the chart shows total number of GC calls (all types combined) grouped by server. GC pause time by type This chart shows the total time spent in garbage collection per minute, broken down by GC type. It is only shown when viewing a single server. You might see the following types depending on your version of Node.js and app activity: Value Description Scavenge The most common garbage collection method. Node.js will typically trigger one of these every time the VM is idle. MarkSweepCompact The heaviest type of garbage collection V8 may do. If you see many of these happening you will need to either keep fewer objects around in your process or increase V8's heap limit. IncrementalMarking A phased garbage collection that interleaves collection with application logic to reduce the amount of time the application is paused. Only in Node.js v6 or higher. ProcessWeakCallbacks After a garbage collection occurs, V8 will call any weak reference callbacks registered for objects that have been freed. This measurement is from the start of the first weak callback to the end of the last for a given garbage collection. Only in Node.js v6 or higher. Memory usage This chart shows the amount of memory consumed by the Node.js process. For multiple servers, the chart shows total memory grouped by server. For a single server, the chart is segmented by the following types of memory: Value Description Non-heap The memory allocated to data outside V8's heap (for example, buffers, sockets). V8 heap (used) The amount of memory being used by V8 (for example, JavaScript objects). V8 heap (free) The amount of memory set aside by V8 for memory pooling. This memory isn't being actively used, but is set aside for V8 to freely allocate more as needed. CPU utilization This chart shows the CPU utilization of the Node process. For multiple servers, the chart shows total CPU utilization grouped by server. For a single server, the chart is segmented by the following: Value Description User The time spent executing the user code, divided by wall-clock time. System The time spent in the system kernel on behalf of the Node process, divided by wall-clock time. Event loop — ticks per minute This chart shows the number of event loop ticks per minute. A tick is a single turn of the event loop, in which functions that are ready to be executed are run. As a part of each event loop turn, Node waits for pending I/O to complete. Once any I/O events are received, the event loop executes callbacks associated with it. Therefore, the number of ticks per minute corresponds to how frequently I/O events occur. Event loop — max CPU time per tick This chart shows the maximum time spent in a single tick per minute. This is useful with detecting an abnormally long event loop tick, which indicates long synchronous code execution. View clusters of multiple processes When multiple Node.js processes on the same server report to the same New Relic application, these charts will show aggregated data. This is because each worker process in a cluster has its own separate Node.js runtime and collects separate data. Clusters Comments Sum across all workers The following charts show a sum across all workers: GC pause time - Total time per minute GC pause frequency GC pause time by type CPU utilization Event loop ticks per minute Average from all workers The following charts show an average from all workers: Memory usage GC pause time — average Max across all workers The following charts show max across all workers: GC pause time — max Event loop — max CPU time per tick",

For more information, including a tutorial, see the documentation for Node.js datastore instrumentation on GitHub. Instrument web transactions In order to create custom web transactions, call startWebTransaction to start the transaction. To end the transaction, use any of these options: Ending the transaction Comments Promise If the handler passed to startWebTransaction returns a promise, the agent will end the transaction when the returned promise resolves or rejects. Manual If you call getTransaction in the context of the new transaction, this notifies the agent that the transaction will be handled manually. If getTransaction is called in the handler, then you must end the transaction by calling transaction.end(). Synchronous If neither of these options are fulfilled, the transaction will be ended when the handler returns synchronously. Custom web transaction example: Instrument three transactions in socket.io This example instruments a /websocket/ping transaction, a /websocket/update transaction, and a /websocket/new-message transaction within socket.io. The /ping example is synchronous, while the /new-message and /update examples are asynchronous. var nr = require('newrelic') var app = require('http').createServer() var io = require('socket.io')(app) io.on('connection', function (socket) { socket.on('ping', function (data) { nr.startWebTransaction('/websocket/ping', function transactionHandler() { // Ended automatically after synchronously returning socket.emit('pong') }) }) socket.on('update', function (data) { nr.startWebTransaction('/websocket/update', function transactionHandler() { // Using API#getTransaction var transaction = nr.getTransaction() updateChatWindow(data, function transactionHandler() { socket.emit('update-done') transaction.end() }) }) }) socket.on('new-message', function (data) { nr.startWebTransaction('/websocket/new-message', function transactionHandler() { // Returning a promise return new Promise(function (resolve, reject) { addMessageToChat(data, function () { socket.emit('message-received') resolve() }) }) }) }) }) Copy This method only gives basic timing data for the transaction created. To create more intricate timing data and transaction naming for a particular framework, see the Node.js API documentation and the related tutorial on GitHub. Instrument background transactions You can use custom transactions to instrument non-web transactions (background tasks); for example: Periodic jobs within your app Work that continues after a request completes To instrument background tasks, call startBackgroundTransaction in your handler to start a background transaction. To end the transaction, use any of these options: Ending the transaction Comments Promise If the handler passed to startBackgroundTransaction returns a promise, the agent will end the transaction when the returned promise resolves or rejects. Manual If you call getTransaction in the context of the new transaction, this notifies the agent that the transaction will be handled manually. If getTransaction is called in the handler, then you must end the transaction by calling transaction.end(). Synchronous If neither of these options are fulfilled, the transaction will be ended when the handler returns synchronously. Custom background transaction example: Instrument within setInterval This example instruments update:cache within setInterval: var nr = require('newrelic') var redis = require('redis').createClient() // Using API#getTransaction to manage ending the transaction setInterval(function () { nr.startBackgroundTransaction('update:cache', function transactionHandler() { var newValue = someDataGenerator() var transaction = nr.getTransaction() redis.set('some:cache:key', newValue, function () { transaction.end() }) }) }, 30000) // Every 30s //Using a promise to manage ending the transaction setInterval(function () { nr.startBackgroundTransaction('flush:cache', function transactionHandler() { return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) { flushCache(redis, function afterFlush(err) { if (err) { return reject(err) } resolve() }) }) }) }, 60*60*1000) Copy Expand instrumentation within transactions You can create instrumentation using the instrumentation registration methods on the API. Writing instrumentation using the instrumentation API allows you to specify metrics and naming in greater detail by \"monkey patching\" methods (replacing functions) on relevant objects. Other options can offer visibility into web transactions that are already instrumented, or gain insight into databases and other in-transaction work that is not automatically instrumented. To do this, wrap your callbacks in custom tracers. Custom tracers create and collect specific metrics for an additional segment within an existing transaction, such as a particular function or a database call. To instrument individual callbacks, call startSegment() inside the callback, and move the main callback logic to the handler function. To instrument a function that is called inside an asynchronous function, wrap both the target function and its parent asynchronous function with startSegment(). Important These examples must be placed in code that is running under a transaction. The origin of the transaction, custom or automatically created, does not matter. Example: Instrument a callback This example tracks a single callback: // Wrap the method in a segment. nr.startSegment('db:createObject', true, function(cb) { // This is recorded as the `db:createObject` segment. db.createObject(cb) }, function(err, result) { // This is recorded as the callback to the `db:createObject` segment. if (util.handleError(err, res)) { return } res.write(JSON.stringify(result.rows[0].id)) res.write('\\n') res.end() }) Copy Example: Instrument asynchronous functions using callbacks This example tracks both pg.connect and client.query. This is because client.query is called by an asynchronous parent function (pg.connect). Otherwise, you would not get any data from client.query. This allows startSegment() to propagate the active transaction across those asynchronous boundaries. nr.startSegment('pg:connect', true, function(cb) { pg.connect(config.db_string, cb) }, function(err, client, done) { if (util.handleError(err, '500', res)) { return done() } nr.startSegment('pg:query', true, function(cb) { client.query('SELECT count(*) FROM test_count'), cb) }, function(err, result) { if (util.handleError(err, '500', res)) { return done() } res.write(result.rows[0].count) res.write('\\n') }) }) Copy Example: Instrument asynchronous functions using promises This example is the same as the callback one, but for interacting with a promise-based API. For promises, simply return the promise and call then after startSegment to continue your execution. nr.startSegment('pg:connect', true, function() { // This `pg:connect` segment will time until the returned promise // either resolves or rejects. return pg.connect(config.db_string) }).then(function(client) { // The transaction context is propagated into following promises. return nr.startSegment('pg:query', true, function() { return client.query('SELECT count(*) FROM test_count')) }).then(function(result) { res.write(result.rows[0].count) res.write('\\n') res.end() }, function(err) { // Error from querying. util.handleError(err, '500', res) }).finally(function() { return client.release() }) }, function(err) { // Error from connecting. util.handleError(err, '500', res) }) Copy Example: Instrument async functions This example shows how to instrument code using async/await to control asynchronous work. This requires using Node 8 or higher, as well as the New Relic for Node.js agent v2.3.0 or higher. try { const client = await nr.startSegment('pg:connect', true, async () => { // Async functions simply return promises, so this example is // very similar to the promise one. return await pg.connect(config.db_string) }) // The transaction context is propagated into the code following `await`. try { const result = await nr.startSegment('pg:query', true, async () => { return await client.query('SELECT count(*) FROM test_count')) }) res.write(result.rows[0].count) res.write('\\n') res.end() } catch(err) { // Error from querying. util.handleError(err, '500', res) } finally { await client.release() } } catch(err) { // Error from connecting. util.handleError(err, '500', res) } Copy Example: Instrument a synchronous function This example shows how startSegment can be used to record a synchronous function that is responsible for assigning its return value to a variable. var result = nr.startSegment('calculateTotal', true, function() { return calculateTotal(outerVar1, outerVar2) }) Copy Important The startSegment function is available of the Node Agent 3.3.0 release.",

      "body": "In New Relic's APM, the Node VMs page provides useful runtime data for troubleshooting performance issues and monitoring the health of your application. What you need Some of the charts on the Node VMs page require you to install the New Relic Native Metrics Module in addition to the Node.js agent. For installation instructions, see Node VM Measurements. View Node VM statistics one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Node VMs: When multiple servers are reporting to the same application, the page breaks charts down by server. You can view data for an individual server and obtain additional details by selecting a server from the Servers filter at the top of the page. To correlate spikes or upward trends in any of these measurements with specific transactions: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Node VMs. Select the time period by clicking and dragging within any of the charts. Navigate to the Transactions page or any other page. As you go to other pages, the time picker selection will remain the same. Analyze performance issues Here is a summary of the data available on individual Node VM charts. By using all of the charts together, you can troubleshoot performance issues. For example: When the application starts using more objects, memory usage will increase, and garbage collection (GC) will run more frequently. CPU utilization will increase due to time spent in GC. Abnormally long synchronous code execution can increase CPU utilization. This will show spikes in the Event loop max CPU time per tick chart. GC pause time The amount of time spent in garbage collection. For a single server, the chart shows average, max, and total time per minute. For multiple servers, the chart shows total time grouped by server. Typically, spikes in GC time or frequency indicate a potential issue. GC pause frequency The number of times GC runs were executed per minute. For a single server, the chart is broken down by the type of GC. For multiple servers, the chart shows total number of GC calls (all types combined) grouped by server. GC pause time by type This chart shows the total time spent in garbage collection per minute, broken down by GC type. It is only shown when viewing a single server. You might see the following types depending on your version of Node.js and app activity: Value Description Scavenge The most common garbage collection method. Node.js will typically trigger one of these every time the VM is idle. MarkSweepCompact The heaviest type of garbage collection V8 may do. If you see many of these happening you will need to either keep fewer objects around in your process or increase V8's heap limit. IncrementalMarking A phased garbage collection that interleaves collection with application logic to reduce the amount of time the application is paused. Only in Node.js v6 or higher. ProcessWeakCallbacks After a garbage collection occurs, V8 will call any weak reference callbacks registered for objects that have been freed. This measurement is from the start of the first weak callback to the end of the last for a given garbage collection. Only in Node.js v6 or higher. Memory usage This chart shows the amount of memory consumed by the Node.js process. For multiple servers, the chart shows total memory grouped by server. For a single server, the chart is segmented by the following types of memory: Value Description Non-heap The memory allocated to data outside V8's heap (for example, buffers, sockets). V8 heap (used) The amount of memory being used by V8 (for example, JavaScript objects). V8 heap (free) The amount of memory set aside by V8 for memory pooling. This memory isn't being actively used, but is set aside for V8 to freely allocate more as needed. CPU utilization This chart shows the CPU utilization of the Node process. For multiple servers, the chart shows total CPU utilization grouped by server. For a single server, the chart is segmented by the following: Value Description User The time spent executing the user code, divided by wall-clock time. System The time spent in the system kernel on behalf of the Node process, divided by wall-clock time. Event loop — ticks per minute This chart shows the number of event loop ticks per minute. A tick is a single turn of the event loop, in which functions that are ready to be executed are run. As a part of each event loop turn, Node waits for pending I/O to complete. Once any I/O events are received, the event loop executes callbacks associated with it. Therefore, the number of ticks per minute corresponds to how frequently I/O events occur. Event loop — max CPU time per tick This chart shows the maximum time spent in a single tick per minute. This is useful with detecting an abnormally long event loop tick, which indicates long synchronous code execution. View clusters of multiple processes When multiple Node.js processes on the same server report to the same New Relic application, these charts will show aggregated data. This is because each worker process in a cluster has its own separate Node.js runtime and collects separate data. Clusters Comments Sum across all workers The following charts show a sum across all workers: GC pause time - Total time per minute GC pause frequency GC pause time by type CPU utilization Event loop ticks per minute Average from all workers The following charts show an average from all workers: Memory usage GC pause time — average Max across all workers The following charts show max across all workers: GC pause time — max Event loop — max CPU time per tick",

For promises, simply return the promise and call then after startSegment to continue your execution. nr.startSegment('pg:connect', true, function() { // This `pg:connect` segment will time until the returned promise // either resolves or rejects. return pg.connect(config.db_string) }).then(function(client) { // The transaction context is propagated into following promises. return nr.startSegment('pg:query', true, function() { return client.query('SELECT count(*) FROM test_count')) }).then(function(result) { res.write(result.rows[0].count) res.write('\\n') res.end() }, function(err) { // Error from querying. util.handleError(err, '500', res) }).finally(function() { return client.release() }) }, function(err) { // Error from connecting. util.handleError(err, '500', res) }) Copy Example: Instrument async functions This example shows how to instrument code using async/await to control asynchronous work. This requires using Node 8 or higher, as well as the New Relic for Node.js agent v2.3.0 or higher. try { const client = await nr.startSegment('pg:connect', true, async () => { // Async functions simply return promises, so this example is // very similar to the promise one. return await pg.connect(config.db_string) }) // The transaction context is propagated into the code following `await`. try { const result = await nr.startSegment('pg:query', true, async () => { return await client.query('SELECT count(*) FROM test_count')) }) res.write(result.rows[0].count) res.write('\\n') res.end() } catch(err) { // Error from querying. util.handleError(err, '500', res) } finally { await client.release() } } catch(err) { // Error from connecting. util.handleError(err, '500', res) } Copy Example: Instrument a synchronous function This example shows how startSegment can be used to record a synchronous function that is responsible for assigning its return value to a variable. var result = nr.startSegment('calculateTotal', true, function() { return calculateTotal(outerVar1, outerVar2) }) Copy Important The startSegment function is available of the Node Agent 3.3.0 release.",

      "body": "In New Relic's APM, the Node VMs page provides useful runtime data for troubleshooting performance issues and monitoring the health of your application. What you need Some of the charts on the Node VMs page require you to install the New Relic Native Metrics Module in addition to the Node.js agent. For installation instructions, see Node VM Measurements. View Node VM statistics one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Node VMs: When multiple servers are reporting to the same application, the page breaks charts down by server. You can view data for an individual server and obtain additional details by selecting a server from the Servers filter at the top of the page. To correlate spikes or upward trends in any of these measurements with specific transactions: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Node VMs. Select the time period by clicking and dragging within any of the charts. Navigate to the Transactions page or any other page. As you go to other pages, the time picker selection will remain the same. Analyze performance issues Here is a summary of the data available on individual Node VM charts. By using all of the charts together, you can troubleshoot performance issues. For example: When the application starts using more objects, memory usage will increase, and garbage collection (GC) will run more frequently. CPU utilization will increase due to time spent in GC. Abnormally long synchronous code execution can increase CPU utilization. This will show spikes in the Event loop max CPU time per tick chart. GC pause time The amount of time spent in garbage collection. For a single server, the chart shows average, max, and total time per minute. For multiple servers, the chart shows total time grouped by server. Typically, spikes in GC time or frequency indicate a potential issue. GC pause frequency The number of times GC runs were executed per minute. For a single server, the chart is broken down by the type of GC. For multiple servers, the chart shows total number of GC calls (all types combined) grouped by server. GC pause time by type This chart shows the total time spent in garbage collection per minute, broken down by GC type. It is only shown when viewing a single server. You might see the following types depending on your version of Node.js and app activity: Value Description Scavenge The most common garbage collection method. Node.js will typically trigger one of these every time the VM is idle. MarkSweepCompact The heaviest type of garbage collection V8 may do. If you see many of these happening you will need to either keep fewer objects around in your process or increase V8's heap limit. IncrementalMarking A phased garbage collection that interleaves collection with application logic to reduce the amount of time the application is paused. Only in Node.js v6 or higher. ProcessWeakCallbacks After a garbage collection occurs, V8 will call any weak reference callbacks registered for objects that have been freed. This measurement is from the start of the first weak callback to the end of the last for a given garbage collection. Only in Node.js v6 or higher. Memory usage This chart shows the amount of memory consumed by the Node.js process. For multiple servers, the chart shows total memory grouped by server. For a single server, the chart is segmented by the following types of memory: Value Description Non-heap The memory allocated to data outside V8's heap (for example, buffers, sockets). V8 heap (used) The amount of memory being used by V8 (for example, JavaScript objects). V8 heap (free) The amount of memory set aside by V8 for memory pooling. This memory isn't being actively used, but is set aside for V8 to freely allocate more as needed. CPU utilization This chart shows the CPU utilization of the Node process. For multiple servers, the chart shows total CPU utilization grouped by server. For a single server, the chart is segmented by the following: Value Description User The time spent executing the user code, divided by wall-clock time. System The time spent in the system kernel on behalf of the Node process, divided by wall-clock time. Event loop — ticks per minute This chart shows the number of event loop ticks per minute. A tick is a single turn of the event loop, in which functions that are ready to be executed are run. As a part of each event loop turn, Node waits for pending I/O to complete. Once any I/O events are received, the event loop executes callbacks associated with it. Therefore, the number of ticks per minute corresponds to how frequently I/O events occur. Event loop — max CPU time per tick This chart shows the maximum time spent in a single tick per minute. This is useful with detecting an abnormally long event loop tick, which indicates long synchronous code execution. View clusters of multiple processes When multiple Node.js processes on the same server report to the same New Relic application, these charts will show aggregated data. This is because each worker process in a cluster has its own separate Node.js runtime and collects separate data. Clusters Comments Sum across all workers The following charts show a sum across all workers: GC pause time - Total time per minute GC pause frequency GC pause time by type CPU utilization Event loop ticks per minute Average from all workers The following charts show an average from all workers: Memory usage GC pause time — average Max across all workers The following charts show max across all workers: GC pause time — max Event loop — max CPU time per tick",

      "body": "With the Node.js agent, you can add browser instrumentation to your web pages. To use browser monitoring with your Node.js agent, ensure you have the latest release of the Node.js agent. To enable browser monitoring in the user interface, follow the procedures to install the browser agent. Then follow the procedures in this section to set up the Node.js agent. Insert the JavaScript header Instrumentation for the Node.js agent can continue beyond your application into end users' browsers. The newrelic module can generate script headers which, when inserted into your HTML templates, will capture the end users' page load times. The headers must be manually injected, but no extra configuration is necessary. At the beginning of your html page's head tag, insert the results of newrelic.getBrowserTimingHeader() after any CHARSET meta tags. Exception: For maximum Internet Explorer compatibility, insert the results of newrelic.getBrowserTimingHeader() after any X-UA-COMPATIBLE HTTP-EQUIV meta tags. Call the header once for every request. Do not cache the header. Generating headers is fast, and it does not require your application to make extra requests to New Relic. Framework examples Here are some examples of how to set up browser monitoring with different frameworks and templates. Express and jade This example uses Express, a web application framework, and jade, a template module. Although the specifics are different with other frameworks, this general approach should work in most cases. The simplest way to insert browser timing headings is to pass the newrelic module into your template, and then call newrelic.getBrowsertimingHeader() from within the template. In your app.js: var newrelic = require('newrelic'); var app = require('express')(); // in express, this lets you call newrelic from within a template app.locals.newrelic = newrelic; app.get('/user/:id', function (req, res) { res.render('user'); }); app.listen(process.env.PORT); Copy In your layout.jade: doctype html html head != newrelic.getBrowserTimingHeader() title= title link(rel='stylesheet', href='stylesheets/style.css') body block content Copy Express and Swig This example uses Express with Swig. In your app.js: var newrelic = require('newrelic'); var http = require('http') var path = require('path') var swig = require('swig') var app = require('express')(); app.locals.newrelic = newrelic; //taken from http://paularmstrong.github.io/swig/docs/#express app.engine('html', swig.renderFile); app.set('view engine', 'html'); app.set('views', __dirname + '/views'); app.get('/user/:id', function (req, res) { res.render('user'); }); app.listen(process.env.PORT); Copy In your views/user.html: <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> {{ newrelic.getBrowserTimingHeader() }} <title>Hello</title> </head> <body> <h1>Hello World</h1> </body> </html> Copy Hapi.js and handlebars This example uses hapi.js and handlebars. Other similar templating languages typically require triple brackets; for example, using mustache with hogan-express. This helps prevent escaping of the script content. Using hapi, in your app.js: var newrelic = require('newrelic'); var Hapi = require('hapi'); var server = new Hapi.Server(parseInt(PORT), '0.0.0.0', { views: { engines : {html: 'handlebars' }, path : __dirname + '/templates' } }); function homepage(request, reply) { var context = { // pass in the header each request nreum : newrelic.getBrowserTimingHeader(), content : ... }; reply.view('homepage', context); }; server.route({ method : 'GET', path : '/', handler : homepage }); server.start(); Copy In your templates/homepage.html: <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> {{{ nreum }}} <title>Hello</title> </head> <body> {{ content }} </body> </html> Copy Disable header generation By default, calls to newrelic.getBrowserTimingHeader() should return valid headers. To disable header generation without removing your template code: In your newrelic.js file, add: browser_monitoring : { enable : false } Copy You can also set the environment variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITOR_ENABLE=false. Caution Always leave ssl between the agent and the New Relic collector when using browser monitoring. You can safely leave the API calls in place even if you are not using browser monitoring or the newrelic module. If browser monitoring is disabled, or if there is an error so that working headers cannot be generated, the newrelic module generates an innocuous HTML comment. If you disable the newrelic module completely, no content will be generated.",

What you need Some of the charts on the Node VMs page require you to install the New Relic Native Metrics Module in addition to the Node.js agent. For installation instructions, see Node VM Measurements. View Node VM statistics one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Node VMs: When multiple servers are reporting to the same application, the page breaks charts down by server. You can view data for an individual server and obtain additional details by selecting a server from the Servers filter at the top of the page. To correlate spikes or upward trends in any of these measurements with specific transactions: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Node VMs. Select the time period by clicking and dragging within any of the charts. Navigate to the Transactions page or any other page. As you go to other pages, the time picker selection will remain the same. Analyze performance issues Here is a summary of the data available on individual Node VM charts. By using all of the charts together, you can troubleshoot performance issues. For example: When the application starts using more objects, memory usage will increase, and garbage collection (GC) will run more frequently. CPU utilization will increase due to time spent in GC. Abnormally long synchronous code execution can increase CPU utilization. This will show spikes in the Event loop max CPU time per tick chart. GC pause time The amount of time spent in garbage collection. For a single server, the chart shows average, max, and total time per minute. For multiple servers, the chart shows total time grouped by server. Typically, spikes in GC time or frequency indicate a potential issue. GC pause frequency The number of times GC runs were executed per minute. For a single server, the chart is broken down by the type of GC. For multiple servers, the chart shows total number of GC calls (all types combined) grouped by server. GC pause time by type This chart shows the total time spent in garbage collection per minute, broken down by GC type. It is only shown when viewing a single server. You might see the following types depending on your version of Node.js and app activity: Value Description Scavenge The most common garbage collection method. Node.js will typically trigger one of these every time the VM is idle. MarkSweepCompact The heaviest type of garbage collection V8 may do. If you see many of these happening you will need to either keep fewer objects around in your process or increase V8's heap limit. IncrementalMarking A phased garbage collection that interleaves collection with application logic to reduce the amount of time the application is paused. Only in Node.js v6 or higher. ProcessWeakCallbacks After a garbage collection occurs, V8 will call any weak reference callbacks registered for objects that have been freed. This measurement is from the start of the first weak callback to the end of the last for a given garbage collection. Only in Node.js v6 or higher. Memory usage This chart shows the amount of memory consumed by the Node.js process. For multiple servers, the chart shows total memory grouped by server. For a single server, the chart is segmented by the following types of memory: Value Description Non-heap The memory allocated to data outside V8's heap (for example, buffers, sockets). V8 heap (used) The amount of memory being used by V8 (for example, JavaScript objects). V8 heap (free) The amount of memory set aside by V8 for memory pooling. This memory isn't being actively used, but is set aside for V8 to freely allocate more as needed. CPU utilization This chart shows the CPU utilization of the Node process. For multiple servers, the chart shows total CPU utilization grouped by server. For a single server, the chart is segmented by the following: Value Description User The time spent executing the user code, divided by wall-clock time. System The time spent in the system kernel on behalf of the Node process, divided by wall-clock time. Event loop — ticks per minute This chart shows the number of event loop ticks per minute. A tick is a single turn of the event loop, in which functions that are ready to be executed are run. As a part of each event loop turn, Node waits for pending I/O to complete. Once any I/O events are received, the event loop executes callbacks associated with it. Therefore, the number of ticks per minute corresponds to how frequently I/O events occur. Event loop — max CPU time per tick This chart shows the maximum time spent in a single tick per minute. This is useful with detecting an abnormally long event loop tick, which indicates long synchronous code execution. View clusters of multiple processes When multiple Node.js processes on the same server report to the same New Relic application, these charts will show aggregated data. This is because each worker process in a cluster has its own separate Node.js runtime and collects separate data. Clusters Comments Sum across all workers The following charts show a sum across all workers: GC pause time - Total time per minute GC pause frequency GC pause time by type CPU utilization Event loop ticks per minute Average from all workers The following charts show an average from all workers: Memory usage GC pause time — average Max across all workers The following charts show max across all workers: GC pause time — max Event loop — max CPU time per tick",

      "body": "New Relic for Node.js automatically instruments most standard web requests, but sometimes you want expanded instrumentation. With the agent's custom instrumentation API, you can create instrumentation for otherwise unsupported web frameworks, datastores, and message service clients. The Node.js agent's custom instrumentation API also allows you to: Create web transactions (useful for things like web sockets, where transactions can't be automatically created). Create non-web background transactions (useful for recording background jobs). Target specific sections of your code for deeper analysis. Agent version requirements The custom instrumentation methods in this document are available as of Node.js agent version 2.0.0. For information on instrumentation using the custom instrumentation API v1.x, see the documentation for legacy Node.js custom instrumentation. Instrument unsupported web frameworks Beginning with Node.js agent version 2.0.0, New Relic provides an API to expand instrumentation for additional web frameworks. For more information, including a tutorial, see the documentation for Node.js web framework instrumentation on GitHub. Instrument unsupported message service clients Beginning with Node.js agent version 2.0.0, New Relic provides an API to expand instrumentation for additional message service libraries. For more information, including a tutorial, see the documentation for Node.js message service client instrumentation on GitHub. Instrument unsupported datastores Beginning with Node.js agent version 2.0.0, New Relic provides an API to expand instrumentation for additional datastore libraries. For more information, including a tutorial, see the documentation for Node.js datastore instrumentation on GitHub. Instrument web transactions In order to create custom web transactions, call startWebTransaction to start the transaction. To end the transaction, use any of these options: Ending the transaction Comments Promise If the handler passed to startWebTransaction returns a promise, the agent will end the transaction when the returned promise resolves or rejects. Manual If you call getTransaction in the context of the new transaction, this notifies the agent that the transaction will be handled manually. If getTransaction is called in the handler, then you must end the transaction by calling transaction.end(). Synchronous If neither of these options are fulfilled, the transaction will be ended when the handler returns synchronously. Custom web transaction example: Instrument three transactions in socket.io This example instruments a /websocket/ping transaction, a /websocket/update transaction, and a /websocket/new-message transaction within socket.io. The /ping example is synchronous, while the /new-message and /update examples are asynchronous. var nr = require('newrelic') var app = require('http').createServer() var io = require('socket.io')(app) io.on('connection', function (socket) { socket.on('ping', function (data) { nr.startWebTransaction('/websocket/ping', function transactionHandler() { // Ended automatically after synchronously returning socket.emit('pong') }) }) socket.on('update', function (data) { nr.startWebTransaction('/websocket/update', function transactionHandler() { // Using API#getTransaction var transaction = nr.getTransaction() updateChatWindow(data, function transactionHandler() { socket.emit('update-done') transaction.end() }) }) }) socket.on('new-message', function (data) { nr.startWebTransaction('/websocket/new-message', function transactionHandler() { // Returning a promise return new Promise(function (resolve, reject) { addMessageToChat(data, function () { socket.emit('message-received') resolve() }) }) }) }) }) Copy This method only gives basic timing data for the transaction created. To create more intricate timing data and transaction naming for a particular framework, see the Node.js API documentation and the related tutorial on GitHub. Instrument background transactions You can use custom transactions to instrument non-web transactions (background tasks); for example: Periodic jobs within your app Work that continues after a request completes To instrument background tasks, call startBackgroundTransaction in your handler to start a background transaction. To end the transaction, use any of these options: Ending the transaction Comments Promise If the handler passed to startBackgroundTransaction returns a promise, the agent will end the transaction when the returned promise resolves or rejects. Manual If you call getTransaction in the context of the new transaction, this notifies the agent that the transaction will be handled manually. If getTransaction is called in the handler, then you must end the transaction by calling transaction.end(). Synchronous If neither of these options are fulfilled, the transaction will be ended when the handler returns synchronously. Custom background transaction example: Instrument within setInterval This example instruments update:cache within setInterval: var nr = require('newrelic') var redis = require('redis').createClient() // Using API#getTransaction to manage ending the transaction setInterval(function () { nr.startBackgroundTransaction('update:cache', function transactionHandler() { var newValue = someDataGenerator() var transaction = nr.getTransaction() redis.set('some:cache:key', newValue, function () { transaction.end() }) }) }, 30000) // Every 30s //Using a promise to manage ending the transaction setInterval(function () { nr.startBackgroundTransaction('flush:cache', function transactionHandler() { return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) { flushCache(redis, function afterFlush(err) { if (err) { return reject(err) } resolve() }) }) }) }, 60*60*1000) Copy Expand instrumentation within transactions You can create instrumentation using the instrumentation registration methods on the API. Writing instrumentation using the instrumentation API allows you to specify metrics and naming in greater detail by \"monkey patching\" methods (replacing functions) on relevant objects. Other options can offer visibility into web transactions that are already instrumented, or gain insight into databases and other in-transaction work that is not automatically instrumented. To do this, wrap your callbacks in custom tracers. Custom tracers create and collect specific metrics for an additional segment within an existing transaction, such as a particular function or a database call. To instrument individual callbacks, call startSegment() inside the callback, and move the main callback logic to the handler function. To instrument a function that is called inside an asynchronous function, wrap both the target function and its parent asynchronous function with startSegment(). Important These examples must be placed in code that is running under a transaction. The origin of the transaction, custom or automatically created, does not matter. Example: Instrument a callback This example tracks a single callback: // Wrap the method in a segment. nr.startSegment('db:createObject', true, function(cb) { // This is recorded as the `db:createObject` segment. db.createObject(cb) }, function(err, result) { // This is recorded as the callback to the `db:createObject` segment. if (util.handleError(err, res)) { return } res.write(JSON.stringify(result.rows[0].id)) res.write('\\n') res.end() }) Copy Example: Instrument asynchronous functions using callbacks This example tracks both pg.connect and client.query. This is because client.query is called by an asynchronous parent function (pg.connect). Otherwise, you would not get any data from client.query. This allows startSegment() to propagate the active transaction across those asynchronous boundaries. nr.startSegment('pg:connect', true, function(cb) { pg.connect(config.db_string, cb) }, function(err, client, done) { if (util.handleError(err, '500', res)) { return done() } nr.startSegment('pg:query', true, function(cb) { client.query('SELECT count(*) FROM test_count'), cb) }, function(err, result) { if (util.handleError(err, '500', res)) { return done() } res.write(result.rows[0].count) res.write('\\n') }) }) Copy Example: Instrument asynchronous functions using promises This example is the same as the callback one, but for interacting with a promise-based API. For promises, simply return the promise and call then after startSegment to continue your execution. nr.startSegment('pg:connect', true, function() { // This `pg:connect` segment will time until the returned promise // either resolves or rejects. return pg.connect(config.db_string) }).then(function(client) { // The transaction context is propagated into following promises. return nr.startSegment('pg:query', true, function() { return client.query('SELECT count(*) FROM test_count')) }).then(function(result) { res.write(result.rows[0].count) res.write('\\n') res.end() }, function(err) { // Error from querying. util.handleError(err, '500', res) }).finally(function() { return client.release() }) }, function(err) { // Error from connecting. util.handleError(err, '500', res) }) Copy Example: Instrument async functions This example shows how to instrument code using async/await to control asynchronous work. This requires using Node 8 or higher, as well as the New Relic for Node.js agent v2.3.0 or higher. try { const client = await nr.startSegment('pg:connect', true, async () => { // Async functions simply return promises, so this example is // very similar to the promise one. return await pg.connect(config.db_string) }) // The transaction context is propagated into the code following `await`. try { const result = await nr.startSegment('pg:query', true, async () => { return await client.query('SELECT count(*) FROM test_count')) }) res.write(result.rows[0].count) res.write('\\n') res.end() } catch(err) { // Error from querying. util.handleError(err, '500', res) } finally { await client.release() } } catch(err) { // Error from connecting. util.handleError(err, '500', res) } Copy Example: Instrument a synchronous function This example shows how startSegment can be used to record a synchronous function that is responsible for assigning its return value to a variable. var result = nr.startSegment('calculateTotal', true, function() { return calculateTotal(outerVar1, outerVar2) }) Copy Important The startSegment function is available of the Node Agent 3.3.0 release.",

      "body": "New Relic for Node.js automatically instruments most standard web requests, but sometimes you want expanded instrumentation. With the agent's custom instrumentation API, you can create instrumentation for otherwise unsupported web frameworks, datastores, and message service clients. The Node.js agent's custom instrumentation API also allows you to: Create web transactions (useful for things like web sockets, where transactions can't be automatically created). Create non-web background transactions (useful for recording background jobs). Target specific sections of your code for deeper analysis.

For information on instrumentation using the custom instrumentation API v1.x, see the documentation for legacy Node.js custom instrumentation. Instrument unsupported web frameworks Beginning with Node.js agent version 2.0.0, New Relic provides an API to expand instrumentation for additional web frameworks. For more information, including a tutorial, see the documentation for Node.js web framework instrumentation on GitHub. Instrument unsupported message service clients Beginning with Node.js agent version 2.0.0, New Relic provides an API to expand instrumentation for additional message service libraries.

Instrument unsupported datastores Beginning with Node.js agent version 2.0.0, New Relic provides an API to expand instrumentation for additional datastore libraries. For more information, including a tutorial, see the documentation for Node.js datastore instrumentation on GitHub. Instrument web transactions In order to create custom web transactions, call startWebTransaction to start the transaction. To end the transaction, use any of these options: Ending the transaction Comments Promise If the handler passed to startWebTransaction returns a promise, the agent will end the transaction when the returned promise resolves or rejects. Manual If you call getTransaction in the context of the new transaction, this notifies the agent that the transaction will be handled manually. If getTransaction is called in the handler, then you must end the transaction by calling transaction.end(). Synchronous If neither of these options are fulfilled, the transaction will be ended when the handler returns synchronously. Custom web transaction example: Instrument three transactions in socket.io This example instruments a /websocket/ping transaction, a /websocket/update transaction, and a /websocket/new-message transaction within socket.io. The /ping example is synchronous, while the /new-message and /update examples are asynchronous. var nr = require('newrelic') var app = require('http').createServer() var io = require('socket.io')(app) io.on('connection', function (socket) { socket.on('ping', function (data) { nr.startWebTransaction('/websocket/ping', function transactionHandler() { // Ended automatically after synchronously returning socket.emit('pong') }) }) socket.on('update', function (data) { nr.startWebTransaction('/websocket/update', function transactionHandler() { // Using API#getTransaction var transaction = nr.getTransaction() updateChatWindow(data, function transactionHandler() { socket.emit('update-done') transaction.end() }) }) }) socket.on('new-message', function (data) { nr.startWebTransaction('/websocket/new-message', function transactionHandler() { // Returning a promise return new Promise(function (resolve, reject) { addMessageToChat(data, function () { socket.emit('message-received') resolve() }) }) }) }) }) Copy This method only gives basic timing data for the transaction created. To create more intricate timing data and transaction naming for a particular framework, see the Node.js API documentation and the related tutorial on GitHub. Instrument background transactions You can use custom transactions to instrument non-web transactions (background tasks); for example: Periodic jobs within your app Work that continues after a request completes To instrument background tasks, call startBackgroundTransaction in your handler to start a background transaction. To end the transaction, use any of these options: Ending the transaction Comments Promise If the handler passed to startBackgroundTransaction returns a promise, the agent will end the transaction when the returned promise resolves or rejects. Manual If you call getTransaction in the context of the new transaction, this notifies the agent that the transaction will be handled manually. If getTransaction is called in the handler, then you must end the transaction by calling transaction.end(). Synchronous If neither of these options are fulfilled, the transaction will be ended when the handler returns synchronously. Custom background transaction example: Instrument within setInterval This example instruments update:cache within setInterval: var nr = require('newrelic') var redis = require('redis').createClient() // Using API#getTransaction to manage ending the transaction setInterval(function () { nr.startBackgroundTransaction('update:cache', function transactionHandler() { var newValue = someDataGenerator() var transaction = nr.getTransaction() redis.set('some:cache:key', newValue, function () { transaction.end() }) }) }, 30000) // Every 30s //Using a promise to manage ending the transaction setInterval(function () { nr.startBackgroundTransaction('flush:cache', function transactionHandler() { return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) { flushCache(redis, function afterFlush(err) { if (err) { return reject(err) } resolve() }) }) }) }, 60*60*1000) Copy Expand instrumentation within transactions You can create instrumentation using the instrumentation registration methods on the API. Writing instrumentation using the instrumentation API allows you to specify metrics and naming in greater detail by \"monkey patching\" methods (replacing functions) on relevant objects. Other options can offer visibility into web transactions that are already instrumented, or gain insight into databases and other in-transaction work that is not automatically instrumented. To do this, wrap your callbacks in custom tracers. Custom tracers create and collect specific metrics for an additional segment within an existing transaction, such as a particular function or a database call. To instrument individual callbacks, call startSegment() inside the callback, and move the main callback logic to the handler function. To instrument a function that is called inside an asynchronous function, wrap both the target function and its parent asynchronous function with startSegment(). Important These examples must be placed in code that is running under a transaction. The origin of the transaction, custom or automatically created, does not matter. Example: Instrument a callback This example tracks a single callback: // Wrap the method in a segment. nr.startSegment('db:createObject', true, function(cb) { // This is recorded as the `db:createObject` segment. db.createObject(cb) }, function(err, result) { // This is recorded as the callback to the `db:createObject` segment. if (util.handleError(err, res)) { return } res.write(JSON.stringify(result.rows[0].id)) res.write('\\n') res.end() }) Copy Example: Instrument asynchronous functions using callbacks This example tracks both pg.connect and client.query. This is because client.query is called by an asynchronous parent function (pg.connect). Otherwise, you would not get any data from client.query. This allows startSegment() to propagate the active transaction across those asynchronous boundaries. nr.startSegment('pg:connect', true, function(cb) { pg.connect(config.db_string, cb) }, function(err, client, done) { if (util.handleError(err, '500', res)) { return done() } nr.startSegment('pg:query', true, function(cb) { client.query('SELECT count(*) FROM test_count'), cb) }, function(err, result) { if (util.handleError(err, '500', res)) { return done() } res.write(result.rows[0].count) res.write('\\n') }) }) Copy Example: Instrument asynchronous functions using promises This example is the same as the callback one, but for interacting with a promise-based API. For promises, simply return the promise and call then after startSegment to continue your execution. nr.startSegment('pg:connect', true, function() { // This `pg:connect` segment will time until the returned promise // either resolves or rejects. return pg.connect(config.db_string) }).then(function(client) { // The transaction context is propagated into following promises. return nr.startSegment('pg:query', true, function() { return client.query('SELECT count(*) FROM test_count')) }).then(function(result) { res.write(result.rows[0].count) res.write('\\n') res.end() }, function(err) { // Error from querying. util.handleError(err, '500', res) }).finally(function() { return client.release() }) }, function(err) { // Error from connecting. util.handleError(err, '500', res) }) Copy Example: Instrument async functions This example shows how to instrument code using async/await to control asynchronous work. This requires using Node 8 or higher, as well as the New Relic for Node.js agent v2.3.0 or higher. try { const client = await nr.startSegment('pg:connect', true, async () => { // Async functions simply return promises, so this example is // very similar to the promise one. return await pg.connect(config.db_string) }) // The transaction context is propagated into the code following `await`. try { const result = await nr.startSegment('pg:query', true, async () => { return await client.query('SELECT count(*) FROM test_count')) }) res.write(result.rows[0].count) res.write('\\n') res.end() } catch(err) { // Error from querying. util.handleError(err, '500', res) } finally { await client.release() } } catch(err) { // Error from connecting. util.handleError(err, '500', res) } Copy Example: Instrument a synchronous function This example shows how startSegment can be used to record a synchronous function that is responsible for assigning its return value to a variable. var result = nr.startSegment('calculateTotal', true, function() { return calculateTotal(outerVar1, outerVar2) }) Copy Important The startSegment function is available of the Node Agent 3.3.0 release.",

      "body": "In New Relic's APM, the Node VMs page provides useful runtime data for troubleshooting performance issues and monitoring the health of your application. What you need Some of the charts on the Node VMs page require you to install the New Relic Native Metrics Module in addition to the Node.js agent. For installation instructions, see Node VM Measurements. View Node VM statistics one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Node VMs: When multiple servers are reporting to the same application, the page breaks charts down by server. You can view data for an individual server and obtain additional details by selecting a server from the Servers filter at the top of the page. To correlate spikes or upward trends in any of these measurements with specific transactions: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Node VMs. Select the time period by clicking and dragging within any of the charts. Navigate to the Transactions page or any other page. As you go to other pages, the time picker selection will remain the same. Analyze performance issues Here is a summary of the data available on individual Node VM charts. By using all of the charts together, you can troubleshoot performance issues. For example: When the application starts using more objects, memory usage will increase, and garbage collection (GC) will run more frequently. CPU utilization will increase due to time spent in GC. Abnormally long synchronous code execution can increase CPU utilization. This will show spikes in the Event loop max CPU time per tick chart. GC pause time The amount of time spent in garbage collection. For a single server, the chart shows average, max, and total time per minute. For multiple servers, the chart shows total time grouped by server. Typically, spikes in GC time or frequency indicate a potential issue. GC pause frequency The number of times GC runs were executed per minute. For a single server, the chart is broken down by the type of GC. For multiple servers, the chart shows total number of GC calls (all types combined) grouped by server. GC pause time by type This chart shows the total time spent in garbage collection per minute, broken down by GC type. It is only shown when viewing a single server. You might see the following types depending on your version of Node.js and app activity: Value Description Scavenge The most common garbage collection method. Node.js will typically trigger one of these every time the VM is idle. MarkSweepCompact The heaviest type of garbage collection V8 may do. If you see many of these happening you will need to either keep fewer objects around in your process or increase V8's heap limit. IncrementalMarking A phased garbage collection that interleaves collection with application logic to reduce the amount of time the application is paused. Only in Node.js v6 or higher. ProcessWeakCallbacks After a garbage collection occurs, V8 will call any weak reference callbacks registered for objects that have been freed. This measurement is from the start of the first weak callback to the end of the last for a given garbage collection. Only in Node.js v6 or higher. Memory usage This chart shows the amount of memory consumed by the Node.js process. For multiple servers, the chart shows total memory grouped by server. For a single server, the chart is segmented by the following types of memory: Value Description Non-heap The memory allocated to data outside V8's heap (for example, buffers, sockets). V8 heap (used) The amount of memory being used by V8 (for example, JavaScript objects). V8 heap (free) The amount of memory set aside by V8 for memory pooling. This memory isn't being actively used, but is set aside for V8 to freely allocate more as needed. CPU utilization This chart shows the CPU utilization of the Node process. For multiple servers, the chart shows total CPU utilization grouped by server. For a single server, the chart is segmented by the following: Value Description User The time spent executing the user code, divided by wall-clock time. System The time spent in the system kernel on behalf of the Node process, divided by wall-clock time. Event loop — ticks per minute This chart shows the number of event loop ticks per minute. A tick is a single turn of the event loop, in which functions that are ready to be executed are run. As a part of each event loop turn, Node waits for pending I/O to complete. Once any I/O events are received, the event loop executes callbacks associated with it. Therefore, the number of ticks per minute corresponds to how frequently I/O events occur. Event loop — max CPU time per tick This chart shows the maximum time spent in a single tick per minute. This is useful with detecting an abnormally long event loop tick, which indicates long synchronous code execution. View clusters of multiple processes When multiple Node.js processes on the same server report to the same New Relic application, these charts will show aggregated data. This is because each worker process in a cluster has its own separate Node.js runtime and collects separate data. Clusters Comments Sum across all workers The following charts show a sum across all workers: GC pause time - Total time per minute GC pause frequency GC pause time by type CPU utilization Event loop ticks per minute Average from all workers The following charts show an average from all workers: Memory usage GC pause time — average Max across all workers The following charts show max across all workers: GC pause time — max Event loop — max CPU time per tick",

Synchronous If neither of these options are fulfilled, the transaction will be ended when the handler returns synchronously. Custom web transaction example: Instrument three transactions in socket.io This example instruments a /websocket/ping transaction, a /websocket/update transaction, and a /websocket/new-message transaction within socket.io. The /ping example is synchronous, while the /new-message and /update examples are asynchronous. var nr = require('newrelic') var app = require('http').createServer() var io = require('socket.io')(app) io.on('connection', function (socket) { socket.on('ping', function (data) { nr.startWebTransaction('/websocket/ping', function transactionHandler() { // Ended automatically after synchronously returning socket.emit('pong') }) }) socket.on('update', function (data) { nr.startWebTransaction('/websocket/update', function transactionHandler() { // Using API#getTransaction var transaction = nr.getTransaction() updateChatWindow(data, function transactionHandler() { socket.emit('update-done') transaction.end() }) }) }) socket.on('new-message', function (data) { nr.startWebTransaction('/websocket/new-message', function transactionHandler() { // Returning a promise return new Promise(function (resolve, reject) { addMessageToChat(data, function () { socket.emit('message-received') resolve() }) }) }) }) }) Copy This method only gives basic timing data for the transaction created. To create more intricate timing data and transaction naming for a particular framework, see the Node.js API documentation and the related tutorial on GitHub. Instrument background transactions You can use custom transactions to instrument non-web transactions (background tasks); for example: Periodic jobs within your app Work that continues after a request completes To instrument background tasks, call startBackgroundTransaction in your handler to start a background transaction. To end the transaction, use any of these options: Ending the transaction Comments Promise If the handler passed to startBackgroundTransaction returns a promise, the agent will end the transaction when the returned promise resolves or rejects. Manual If you call getTransaction in the context of the new transaction, this notifies the agent that the transaction will be handled manually. If getTransaction is called in the handler, then you must end the transaction by calling transaction.end(). Synchronous If neither of these options are fulfilled, the transaction will be ended when the handler returns synchronously. Custom background transaction example: Instrument within setInterval This example instruments update:cache within setInterval: var nr = require('newrelic') var redis = require('redis').createClient() // Using API#getTransaction to manage ending the transaction setInterval(function () { nr.startBackgroundTransaction('update:cache', function transactionHandler() { var newValue = someDataGenerator() var transaction = nr.getTransaction() redis.set('some:cache:key', newValue, function () { transaction.end() }) }) }, 30000) // Every 30s //Using a promise to manage ending the transaction setInterval(function () { nr.startBackgroundTransaction('flush:cache', function transactionHandler() { return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) { flushCache(redis, function afterFlush(err) { if (err) { return reject(err) } resolve() }) }) }) }, 60*60*1000) Copy Expand instrumentation within transactions You can create instrumentation using the instrumentation registration methods on the API. Writing instrumentation using the instrumentation API allows you to specify metrics and naming in greater detail by \"monkey patching\" methods (replacing functions) on relevant objects. Other options can offer visibility into web transactions that are already instrumented, or gain insight into databases and other in-transaction work that is not automatically instrumented. To do this, wrap your callbacks in custom tracers. Custom tracers create and collect specific metrics for an additional segment within an existing transaction, such as a particular function or a database call. To instrument individual callbacks, call startSegment() inside the callback, and move the main callback logic to the handler function. To instrument a function that is called inside an asynchronous function, wrap both the target function and its parent asynchronous function with startSegment(). Important These examples must be placed in code that is running under a transaction. The origin of the transaction, custom or automatically created, does not matter. Example: Instrument a callback This example tracks a single callback: // Wrap the method in a segment. nr.startSegment('db:createObject', true, function(cb) { // This is recorded as the `db:createObject` segment. db.createObject(cb) }, function(err, result) { // This is recorded as the callback to the `db:createObject` segment. if (util.handleError(err, res)) { return } res.write(JSON.stringify(result.rows[0].id)) res.write('\\n') res.end() }) Copy Example: Instrument asynchronous functions using callbacks This example tracks both pg.connect and client.query. This is because client.query is called by an asynchronous parent function (pg.connect). Otherwise, you would not get any data from client.query. This allows startSegment() to propagate the active transaction across those asynchronous boundaries. nr.startSegment('pg:connect', true, function(cb) { pg.connect(config.db_string, cb) }, function(err, client, done) { if (util.handleError(err, '500', res)) { return done() } nr.startSegment('pg:query', true, function(cb) { client.query('SELECT count(*) FROM test_count'), cb) }, function(err, result) { if (util.handleError(err, '500', res)) { return done() } res.write(result.rows[0].count) res.write('\\n') }) }) Copy Example: Instrument asynchronous functions using promises This example is the same as the callback one, but for interacting with a promise-based API. For promises, simply return the promise and call then after startSegment to continue your execution. nr.startSegment('pg:connect', true, function() { // This `pg:connect` segment will time until the returned promise // either resolves or rejects. return pg.connect(config.db_string) }).then(function(client) { // The transaction context is propagated into following promises. return nr.startSegment('pg:query', true, function() { return client.query('SELECT count(*) FROM test_count')) }).then(function(result) { res.write(result.rows[0].count) res.write('\\n') res.end() }, function(err) { // Error from querying. util.handleError(err, '500', res) }).finally(function() { return client.release() }) }, function(err) { // Error from connecting. util.handleError(err, '500', res) }) Copy Example: Instrument async functions This example shows how to instrument code using async/await to control asynchronous work. This requires using Node 8 or higher, as well as the New Relic for Node.js agent v2.3.0 or higher. try { const client = await nr.startSegment('pg:connect', true, async () => { // Async functions simply return promises, so this example is // very similar to the promise one. return await pg.connect(config.db_string) }) // The transaction context is propagated into the code following `await`. try { const result = await nr.startSegment('pg:query', true, async () => { return await client.query('SELECT count(*) FROM test_count')) }) res.write(result.rows[0].count) res.write('\\n') res.end() } catch(err) { // Error from querying. util.handleError(err, '500', res) } finally { await client.release() } } catch(err) { // Error from connecting. util.handleError(err, '500', res) } Copy Example: Instrument a synchronous function This example shows how startSegment can be used to record a synchronous function that is responsible for assigning its return value to a variable. var result = nr.startSegment('calculateTotal', true, function() { return calculateTotal(outerVar1, outerVar2) }) Copy Important The startSegment function is available of the Node Agent 3.3.0 release.",

      "body": "New Relic for Node.js automatically instruments most standard web requests, but sometimes you want expanded instrumentation. With the agent's custom instrumentation API, you can create instrumentation for otherwise unsupported web frameworks, datastores, and message service clients. The Node.js agent's custom instrumentation API also allows you to: Create web transactions (useful for things like web sockets, where transactions can't be automatically created).

      "body": "With the Node.js agent, you can add browser instrumentation to your web pages. To use browser monitoring with your Node.js agent, ensure you have the latest release of the Node.js agent. To enable browser monitoring in the user interface, follow the procedures to install the browser agent. Then follow the procedures in this section to set up the Node.js agent. Insert the JavaScript header Instrumentation for the Node.js agent can continue beyond your application into end users' browsers. The newrelic module can generate script headers which, when inserted into your HTML templates, will capture the end users' page load times. The headers must be manually injected, but no extra configuration is necessary. At the beginning of your html page's head tag, insert the results of newrelic.getBrowserTimingHeader() after any CHARSET meta tags. Exception: For maximum Internet Explorer compatibility, insert the results of newrelic.getBrowserTimingHeader() after any X-UA-COMPATIBLE HTTP-EQUIV meta tags. Call the header once for every request. Do not cache the header. Generating headers is fast, and it does not require your application to make extra requests to New Relic. Framework examples Here are some examples of how to set up browser monitoring with different frameworks and templates. Express and jade This example uses Express, a web application framework, and jade, a template module. Although the specifics are different with other frameworks, this general approach should work in most cases. The simplest way to insert browser timing headings is to pass the newrelic module into your template, and then call newrelic.getBrowsertimingHeader() from within the template. In your app.js: var newrelic = require('newrelic'); var app = require('express')(); // in express, this lets you call newrelic from within a template app.locals.newrelic = newrelic; app.get('/user/:id', function (req, res) { res.render('user'); }); app.listen(process.env.PORT); Copy In your layout.jade: doctype html html head != newrelic.getBrowserTimingHeader() title= title link(rel='stylesheet', href='stylesheets/style.css') body block content Copy Express and Swig This example uses Express with Swig. In your app.js: var newrelic = require('newrelic'); var http = require('http') var path = require('path') var swig = require('swig') var app = require('express')(); app.locals.newrelic = newrelic; //taken from http://paularmstrong.github.io/swig/docs/#express app.engine('html', swig.renderFile); app.set('view engine', 'html'); app.set('views', __dirname + '/views'); app.get('/user/:id', function (req, res) { res.render('user'); }); app.listen(process.env.PORT); Copy In your views/user.html: <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> {{ newrelic.getBrowserTimingHeader() }} <title>Hello</title> </head> <body> <h1>Hello World</h1> </body> </html> Copy Hapi.js and handlebars This example uses hapi.js and handlebars. Other similar templating languages typically require triple brackets; for example, using mustache with hogan-express. This helps prevent escaping of the script content. Using hapi, in your app.js: var newrelic = require('newrelic'); var Hapi = require('hapi'); var server = new Hapi.Server(parseInt(PORT), '0.0.0.0', { views: { engines : {html: 'handlebars' }, path : __dirname + '/templates' } }); function homepage(request, reply) { var context = { // pass in the header each request nreum : newrelic.getBrowserTimingHeader(), content : ... }; reply.view('homepage', context); }; server.route({ method : 'GET', path : '/', handler : homepage }); server.start(); Copy In your templates/homepage.html: <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> {{{ nreum }}} <title>Hello</title> </head> <body> {{ content }} </body> </html> Copy Disable header generation By default, calls to newrelic.getBrowserTimingHeader() should return valid headers. To disable header generation without removing your template code: In your newrelic.js file, add: browser_monitoring : { enable : false } Copy You can also set the environment variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITOR_ENABLE=false. Caution Always leave ssl between the agent and the New Relic collector when using browser monitoring. You can safely leave the API calls in place even if you are not using browser monitoring or the newrelic module. If browser monitoring is disabled, or if there is an error so that working headers cannot be generated, the newrelic module generates an innocuous HTML comment. If you disable the newrelic module completely, no content will be generated.",

      "body": "Our Node.js agent is publicly available on the Node Package Manager (npm) repository as well as on GitHub. Before you install the Node.js agent, make sure your application meets the following system requirements. Node.js version support Tip For best performance, use the latest active long term support (LTS) version of Node.js. Support for new Node.js releases We will support the latest even versions of Node.js releases by the beginning of the following active long term support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Node.js version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Node.js agent with support 16 October 2021 April-October 2021 End of support for Node.js releases reaching EOL When support for a new long term support agent version is made available, support for the Node.js agent version that reaches end-of-life during the same time period will simultaneously drop. The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Node.js version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Node.js agent dropping support 12 April 2022 April-October 2022 10 April 2021 As of July 31, 2021, we're discontinuing support for Node.js 10. For more details, including how you can easily prepare for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. Node.js 12 errors For Node.js 12, the following change affects the Node.js agent: Errors resulting in unhandled rejections are not scoped to the transaction that was active when the rejected promise was created. This is because the promise responsible for triggering the init async hook is no longer passed through on the promise wrap instance. This breaks the linkage that associates a given promise rejection with the transaction it was scheduled in. Supported Node.js frameworks Express 4.6.0 or higher Restify Connect v1 and v2 (router not supported) Hapi Koa 2.0.0 or higher (external module loaded with the agent) If you are using a supported framework with default routers, the Node.js agent can read these frameworks' route names as-is. However, if you want more specific names than are provided by your framework, you may want to use one or more of the tools New Relic provides with the Node.js transaction naming API. Operating systems Linux SmartOS macOS 10.7 and higher Windows Server 2008 and higher Datastores The Node.js agent monitors the performance of Node.js application calls to these datastores: Cassandra Memcached MongoDB MySQL (via mysql and mysql2 packages) Redis Postgres (including the native and pure JavaScript packages) Instance details We collect instance details for a variety of databases and database drivers. The ability to view specific instances and the types of database information in APM depends on your agent version. New Relic's Node.js agent version 1.31.0 or higher supports the following: Database npm module name Minimum module version Minimum agent version PostgreSQL pg 4.0.0 1.31.0 Redis redis 2.0.0 1.31.0 MongoDB mongodb 2.1.0 1.32.0 MySQL mysql 2.4.1 1.32.0 Memcached memcached 1.0.0 1.33.0 To request instance-level information from datastores currently not listed for your New Relic agent, get support at support.newrelic.com. Messages queues Message queue instrumentation is only available with the New Relic Node.js agent v2 or higher. Currently supported message queue instrumentation: amqplib For other message queue libraries, use custom instrumentation. Hosting services Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment AWS EC2 Microsoft Azure Heroku Process managers In general, process managers that handle starting, stopping, and restarting of Node.js (like Forever) should be compatible with the Node.js agent. If you are using PM2, the minimum supported version of PM2 is 2.0. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Connect the agent to other New Relic features The Node.js agent integrates with other features to give you full-stack observability: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Node.js agent automatically injects the browser monitoring agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser monitoring injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Node.js agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in infrastructure monitoring. New Relic dashboards The Node.js agent sends default events and attributes for NRQL queries. You can also record custom events for advanced analysis. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

With features like service maps and error analytics, our Node.js agent helps you get the full picture of your app environment. Tip To use Node.js or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Why it matters Many Node application requests are based on raw URLs. Our solution is different. New Relic for Node.js assumes it can group requests to your application into transactions instead of HTTP requests. Transactions are defined by giving one or more request paths a name. These names are used to: Visualize where your app is spending its time (in transaction breakdowns). Identify slow requests. Group metrics. Show you which portions of your application are suffering from slow database performance. Installation To install our agent, you need to sign up for New Relic first. Once you're logged in, follow the instructions or use our launcher to get data flowing in. Review the system requirements. Read the install docs. Go directly to the New Relic UI to add Node.js data. Extend your instrumentation After installing the Node.js agent, extend your instrumentation: Extend your instrumentation Comments Customization Implement Node.js custom instrumentation. Collect custom metrics via an API call. Use our Node.js agent API to control, customize, or extend the agent's functionality. Open source telemetry To create your own integrations, use our Node Telemetry SDK. To gain visibility into your GraphQL payloads, use our Apollo Server plugin. Traces Enable distributed tracing. VM measurements Collect key metric timeslice data from the Node.js virtual machine. View detailed VM statistics in the New Relic UI. End-user activity Integrate the Node.js agent with browser monitoring. Gain visibility into user activity with browser monitoring's page load timing process. Troubleshoot your installation If you encounter issues with your Node.js agent, see our troubleshooting information: Large memory usage: If you've installed the Node.js agent and your memory usage has increased, check out these possible solutions.

      "body": "To take full advantage of New Relic's latest features, enhancements, and important security patches, we recommend you update your Node.js agent to the latest version. For additional information about specific agent updates, refer to the Node.js agent release notes. The release notes include a download link when applicable, plus instructions to download and install the latest version. If the newrelic module is listed in your package.json, run npm install. If you want to target just the newrelic module, run npm update newrelic. Recommendation: Test your updated version before moving it into production. If you have problems, follow the Node.js agent troubleshooting procedures. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 7 Before upgrading to Node.js version 7, review this information for major changes. Major changes with Node.js agent v7 Comments BREAKING Removed deprecated httpResponseCode, response.status and httpResponseMessage http response attributes v6.4.2-v6.14.0: Starting in agent v6.4.2, these attributes were marked as deprecated but left in to give a transition period for the new attributes. v7: When http response attribute reporting is enabled, http.statusCode and http.statusText will be reported. BREAKING Removed deprecated setIgnoreTransaction API method v5 - v6: Starting in agent v5.0.0, this method was marked as deprecated but left in to give a transition period for the new methods. v7: Applications must use the API method transactionHandle.ignore(). BREAKING Removed the api.custom_parameters_enabled configuration item and associated environment variable NEW_RELIC_API_CUSTOM_PARAMETERS. Applications must use the configuration api.custom_attributes_enabled or the associated environment variable NEW_RELIC_API_CUSTOM_ATTRIBUTES to enable newrelic.addCustomAttribute and newrelic.addCustomAttributes. BREAKING Removed deprecated Distributed Tracing API methods, createDistributedTracePayload() and acceptDistributedTracePayload() v6.4.0-v6.14.0: Starting in agent v6.4.0, these method were marked as deprecated but left in to give a transition period for the new methods. v7: Applications must use the API methods transactionHandle.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(headers) and transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(transportType, headers) . With these methods, the Node agent will now accept W3C's traceparent and tracestate headers when calling transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(headers) and include the W3C headers along with the New Relic distributed tracing header when calling transactionHandle.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(headers), unless the New Relic trace header format is disabled using distributed_tracing.exclude_newrelic_header:true. Update New Relic Dependencies to versions with updated Node version support @newrelic/aws-sdk v3.0.0 @newrelic/koa v5.0.0 @newrelic/native-metrics v6.0.0 @newrelic/superagent v4.0.0 @newrelic/test-utilities v5.0.0 Node version support Node v10 is the earliest version supported by the New Relic Node.js v7 agent. Node 8 and 9 are not supported by v7. Customers running Node 9 and earlier have two options: Upgrade to a supported version of Node and take advantage of the New Relic Node.js v7 agent's new features. Remain on New Relic Node.js v6 agent without the ability to use new features only available with update agent versions. Node 10 no longer receive updates, but New Relic will continue to support these versions of Node for the time being. Tip Upgrade to a newer version of Node as soon as possible. The next major version of the New Relic Node.js agent will likely remove support for Node 10. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 6 Before upgrading to Node.js agent version 6, review this information for major changes. Major changes with Node.js agent v6 Comments Upgraded official Koa framework instrumentation module to v3.0.0 v6: Added support for @koa/router up to v8.0.2. @koa/router v8.0.3 and greater are currently unsupported. v6: Added support for Node v12 and removed support for Node v6, 7, and 9. The minimum supported version is Node v8. Also see New Relic's Koa Release Notes on Github.. Removed deprecated max_samples_per_minute configuration parameter, which is replaced by max_samples_stored behavior v1 - v5: max_samples_per_minute defined the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If your application previously used max_samples_per_minute as an upper bound, you may need to lower the threshold to a valid maximum to avoid data being dropped on the server. We recommend less than 10k. v5: In agent v5 and lower, max_samples_stored defined the maximum number of events the agent stores if it's unable to communicate with the New Relic collector. v6: The new behavior of max_samples_stored defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. This usage of the configuration is consistent with the other APM agents. Troubleshooting tips: If you're missing event data, increase the value of max_samples_stored or revert to the default value. The value of max_samples_stored should not be over 10,000. Node version support Node 8 is the earliest version supported by the New Relic Node.js v6 agent. Node 6, 7 and 9 are not supported by v6. Customers running Node 6, 7 and 9 have two options: Upgrade to a supported version of Node and take advantage of the New Relic Node.js v6 agent's new features. Remain on New Relic Node.js v5 agent without the ability to use new features only available with update agent versions. Node 8 no longer receive updates, but New Relic will continue to support these versions of Node for the time being. Tip Upgrade to a newer version of Node as soon as possible. The next major version of the New Relic Node.js agent will likely remove support for Node 8. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 5 Before upgrading to Node.js agent v5, review this information for major changes. Also see New Relic's Node.js v5 migration guide on GitHub. Major changes with Node.js v5 agent Comments Removed deprecated addCustomParameter methods. v2 - v4: Starting in agent v2.7.0, these methods were marked as deprecated but left in to give a transition period for the new methods. v5: Applications must use the API methods newrelic.addCustomAttribute() and newrelic.addCustomAttributes(). These are drop-in replacements for the old methods. Removed deprecated create*Transaction methods. v2 - v4: Starting in agent v2.0.2, these methods were marked as deprecated but left in to give a transition period to the new methods. v5: Applications must update to the API methods newrelic.startWebTransaction() and newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction(). Troubleshooting tips: These new methods are not drop-in replacements for the old ones. Before moving to these new methods, review our custom instrumentation guide. Removed deprecated createTracer method. v3 - v4: Starting in agent v3.3.0, this method was marked as deprecated in favor of newrelic.startSegment(). v5: Applications must update to newrelic.startSegment(). Removed node-cassandra-cql instrumentation. v4: Applications using the npm package node-cassandra-cql would get datastore metrics for Cassandra. v5: Applications must migrate to the cassandra-driver package to get Cassandra datastore metrics. This module is actively maintained by the same developers. The node-cassandra-cql package was abandoned in February of 2014 in favor of the cassandra-driver package. Removed deprecated capture_params and ignored_params configurations. v2 - v4: Starting in agent v2.7.0, these configuration parameters caused a warning to be logged, and the values were automatically upgraded to the new attributes configurations. v5: A warning will still be logged but the configuration is ignored, and no automatic upgrading happens any more. Troubleshooting tips: If your application had parameters listed in the ignored_params configuration, you will need to move them to attributes.exclude. Node version support Node 6 is the earliest version supported by the New Relic Node.js v5 agent. Node 4 and 5 are not supported by v5. Customers running Node 4 or 5 have two options: Upgrade to a supported version of Node and take advantage of the New Relic Node.js v5 agent's new features. Remain on New Relic Node.js v4 agent without the ability to use new features only available with update agent versions. Node 7 and 9 no longer receive updates, but New Relic will continue to support these versions of Node for the time being. Tip Upgrade to a newer version of Node as soon as possible. The next major version of the New Relic Node.js agent will likely remove support for Node 6 and 7. Feature flags as of v5 As of New Relic for Node.js v5: custom_instrumentation: This feature is no longer configurable. custom_metrics: This feature is no longer configurable. synthetics: This feature is no longer configurable. native_metrics: This feature is now controlled by the plugins.native_metrics.enabled configuration value. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 4 Before upgrading to Node.js agent v4, review this information for major changes. Also see New Relic's Node.js v4 migration guide on GitHub. Upgrade https-proxy-agent from v0 to v2 Major changes with Node.js v4 agent include an upgrade of the https-proxy-agent from v0 to v2. This dependency has been updated due to a security issue in the https-proxy-agent that the New Relic Node.js agent used. Because https-proxy v2 is incompatible with node v0.10 and v0.12, New Relic has deprecated those agent versions. There is no required action to migrate from v3 to v4 of New Relic's Node.js agent. Node version support Node 4 is the earliest version supported by the New Relic Node.js v4 agent. Node 0.10 and 0.12 are not supported by v4. Customers running Node 0.10 or 0.12 have two options: Upgrade to a supported version of Node and take advantage of the New Relic Node.js v4 agent's new features. Remain on the New Relic Node.js v3 agent without the ability to use new features only available with updated agent versions. Node 4, 5, and 7 also no longer receive updates, but New Relic will continue to support these versions of Node for the time being. Tip Upgrade to a newer version of Node as soon as possible. The next major version of the New Relic Node.js agent will likely remove support for Node 4 and 5. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 3 Before upgrading to Node.js agent agent v3, review this information for major changes. Also see New Relic's Node.js v3 migration guide on GitHub. Major changes with Node.js v3 agent Major changes with Node.js v3 agent Comments Removed SSL configuration v2: With the v2 agent, it was possible to configure the agent to connect to New Relic without encryption. v3: Node.js agent v3 always connects to New Relic servers using TLS encryption to protect communications. If the agent is configured to disable this, a warning is logged and the setting is ignored. Request parameters now prefixed with request.parameters. v2: The v2 agent collects request parameters, such as route parameters (/users/:userId) and query parameters (/users?userId=123), as the parameter name (userId). v3: The v3 agent prefixes all request parameters with the string request.parameters.. For example,userId appears as request.parameters.userId. Troubleshooting tips: If you have dashboards, alert policies, or other NRQL queries based on request parameters, update them with the new parameter names. Feature flags as of v3 As of New Relic Node.js agent v3, the send_request_uri_attribute feature is no longer configurable. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 2 Before upgrading to Node.js agent v2, review this information for major changes. Also see New Relic's Node.js v2 migration guide on GitHub. Major changes with Node.js v2 agent Major changes with Node.js v2 agent Comments Reversed naming and ignore rules v1: With the v1 agent, rules defined in the config properties rules.name and rules.ignore were applied in reverse order; the first rule in the list was applied last. v2: Node.js agent v2 applies rules in the order they are defined, so the first rule in the list is applied first. Troubleshooting tips: If you used naming rules in the v1 agent and notice problems, reverse the order of your rules in your configuration. De-duplicated HTTP request transactions v1: The v1 agent started a new transaction for each listener on an HTTP server's request event. In applications with multiple listeners on the request event, this resulted in extraneous transactions being created that almost always did not get named correctly. v2: The v2 agent only creates a single transaction for each request event emitted. Troubleshooting tips: If you used multiple request event listeners and added a call to newrelic.ignoreTransaction() to remove the extra transactions, remove those calls. Stopped swallowing outbound request errors v1: The v1 agent swallowed unhandled error events emitted by outbound HTTP request objects. v2: The v2 agent removes this behavior. Instead, the v2 agent does not change normal Node execution. This means the error event will always be emitted. Troubleshooting tips: If you are making outbound requests and currently do not listen for the error event, add a listener and handle the error as appropriate for your application. Updated configuration options as of v2 In newrelic.js, edit the Node.js agent configuration properties you use for compatiblity with the latest versions: Deprecated property New property capture_params attributes.enabled: false By default, request attributes are not sent to New Relic. Set attributes.enabled: true to include agent-defined or custom attributes in traces. The capture_params property has been deprecated. ignored_params attributes.exclude: [] Add any request attribute keys to the attributes.exclude list. Now, instead of having to be an exact match, wildcards (*) may be appended to each item for broader filtering. The ignored_params property has been deprecated. These Node.js agent configuration properties also have overrides for specific destinations, including: transaction_tracer transaction_events error_collector browser_monitoring For example, if the root attributes.enabled is true and you set transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled: false, this will restrict attributes from being collected in transaction traces, while still allowing them for all others. Deprecated API methods as of v2 The following methods from the Node.js agent have been deprecated, and New Relic has deleted them in v5 of the agent. Each has an easy replacement that accomplishes the same task in a more flexible and reliable way. newrelic.createWebTransaction() Replace with newrelic.startWebTransaction() and newrelic.getTransaction(). newrelic.createBackgroundTransaction() Replace with newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction() and newrelic.getTransaction(). newrelic.addCustomParameter() Replace with newrelic.addCustomAttribute(). newrelic.addCustomParameters() Replace with newrelic.addCustomAttributes(). New v2 agent API methods The following API methods are new with the New Relic Node.js v2 agent. newrelic.getTransaction() This method gets a reference to the currently running transaction. Use in conjunction with: newrelic.startWebTransaction newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction Callback-based message consumer services for troubleshooting message consumers newrelic.startWebTransaction()newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction() These new API methods replace the older create*Transaction methods. They are easier to use and seamlessly work with promises. Unlike the v1 method, the provided callback is invoked immediately. newrelic.instrument()newrelic.instrumentDatastore()newrelic.instrumentWebframework()newrelic.instrumentMessages() Use these methods to add custom instrumentation for third party modules, including those already instrumented by the New Relic Node.js agent. For more information, see New Relic's Node.js instrumentation tutorials on GitHub. newrelic.addCustomAttribute() Use this method to add a custom trace attribute. newrelic.addCustomAttributes() Use this method to add multiple custom trace attributes. Node version support for v2 The earliest version of Node supported by the New Relic Node.js v2 agent is 0.10. Node 0.8, which has not been updated since July of 2014, is not supported by v2. Customers running Node 0.8 have two options: Upgrade to a supported version of Node and take advantage of the New Relic Node.js v2 agent's new features. Remain on New Relic Node.js v1 agent without the ability to use new features only available with updated agent versions. Node 0.10 also no longer receives updates, but New Relic will continue to support this version of Node for the time being. Recommendation: Upgrade to a newer version of Node as soon as possible. npm version support as of v2 The New Relic Node.js agent now requires npm version 2.0.0 or higher. This version of npm comes packaged with Node 0.10.44 or higher. If you are using an earlier version of Node 0.10 you will need to first install npm 2.0.0 or higher, or upgrade to a newer version of Node. To install npm version 2: $ npm install --global npm@2 Copy Feature flags as of v2 As of New Relic Node.js agent v2: express_segments: This feature is no longer configurable. cat: This feature is now controlled by the cross_application_tracer.enabled configuration value.

Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Why it matters Many Node application requests are based on raw URLs. Our solution is different. New Relic for Node.js assumes it can group requests to your application into transactions instead of HTTP requests. Transactions are defined by giving one or more request paths a name. These names are used to: Visualize where your app is spending its time (in transaction breakdowns). Identify slow requests. Group metrics. Show you which portions of your application are suffering from slow database performance. Installation To install our agent, you need to sign up for New Relic first. Once you're logged in, follow the instructions or use our launcher to get data flowing in. Review the system requirements. Read the install docs. Go directly to the New Relic UI to add Node.js data. Extend your instrumentation After installing the Node.js agent, extend your instrumentation: Extend your instrumentation Comments Customization Implement Node.js custom instrumentation. Collect custom metrics via an API call. Use our Node.js agent API to control, customize, or extend the agent's functionality. Open source telemetry To create your own integrations, use our Node Telemetry SDK. To gain visibility into your GraphQL payloads, use our Apollo Server plugin. Traces Enable distributed tracing. VM measurements Collect key metric timeslice data from the Node.js virtual machine. View detailed VM statistics in the New Relic UI. End-user activity Integrate the Node.js agent with browser monitoring. Gain visibility into user activity with browser monitoring's page load timing process.

      "body": "To take full advantage of New Relic's latest features, enhancements, and important security patches, we recommend you update your Node.js agent to the latest version. For additional information about specific agent updates, refer to the Node.js agent release notes. The release notes include a download link when applicable, plus instructions to download and install the latest version. If the newrelic module is listed in your package.json, run npm install. If you want to target just the newrelic module, run npm update newrelic. Recommendation: Test your updated version before moving it into production. If you have problems, follow the Node.js agent troubleshooting procedures. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 7 Before upgrading to Node.js version 7, review this information for major changes. Major changes with Node.js agent v7 Comments BREAKING Removed deprecated httpResponseCode, response.status and httpResponseMessage http response attributes v6.4.2-v6.14.0: Starting in agent v6.4.2, these attributes were marked as deprecated but left in to give a transition period for the new attributes. v7: When http response attribute reporting is enabled, http.statusCode and http.statusText will be reported. BREAKING Removed deprecated setIgnoreTransaction API method v5 - v6: Starting in agent v5.0.0, this method was marked as deprecated but left in to give a transition period for the new methods. v7: Applications must use the API method transactionHandle.ignore(). BREAKING Removed the api.custom_parameters_enabled configuration item and associated environment variable NEW_RELIC_API_CUSTOM_PARAMETERS. Applications must use the configuration api.custom_attributes_enabled or the associated environment variable NEW_RELIC_API_CUSTOM_ATTRIBUTES to enable newrelic.addCustomAttribute and newrelic.addCustomAttributes. BREAKING Removed deprecated Distributed Tracing API methods, createDistributedTracePayload() and acceptDistributedTracePayload() v6.4.0-v6.14.0: Starting in agent v6.4.0, these method were marked as deprecated but left in to give a transition period for the new methods. v7: Applications must use the API methods transactionHandle.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(headers) and transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(transportType, headers) . With these methods, the Node agent will now accept W3C's traceparent and tracestate headers when calling transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(headers) and include the W3C headers along with the New Relic distributed tracing header when calling transactionHandle.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(headers), unless the New Relic trace header format is disabled using distributed_tracing.exclude_newrelic_header:true. Update New Relic Dependencies to versions with updated Node version support @newrelic/aws-sdk v3.0.0 @newrelic/koa v5.0.0 @newrelic/native-metrics v6.0.0 @newrelic/superagent v4.0.0 @newrelic/test-utilities v5.0.0 Node version support Node v10 is the earliest version supported by the New Relic Node.js v7 agent. Node 8 and 9 are not supported by v7. Customers running Node 9 and earlier have two options: Upgrade to a supported version of Node and take advantage of the New Relic Node.js v7 agent's new features. Remain on New Relic Node.js v6 agent without the ability to use new features only available with update agent versions. Node 10 no longer receive updates, but New Relic will continue to support these versions of Node for the time being. Tip Upgrade to a newer version of Node as soon as possible. The next major version of the New Relic Node.js agent will likely remove support for Node 10. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 6 Before upgrading to Node.js agent version 6, review this information for major changes. Major changes with Node.js agent v6 Comments Upgraded official Koa framework instrumentation module to v3.0.0 v6: Added support for @koa/router up to v8.0.2. @koa/router v8.0.3 and greater are currently unsupported. v6: Added support for Node v12 and removed support for Node v6, 7, and 9. The minimum supported version is Node v8. Also see New Relic's Koa Release Notes on Github.. Removed deprecated max_samples_per_minute configuration parameter, which is replaced by max_samples_stored behavior v1 - v5: max_samples_per_minute defined the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If your application previously used max_samples_per_minute as an upper bound, you may need to lower the threshold to a valid maximum to avoid data being dropped on the server. We recommend less than 10k. v5: In agent v5 and lower, max_samples_stored defined the maximum number of events the agent stores if it's unable to communicate with the New Relic collector. v6: The new behavior of max_samples_stored defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. This usage of the configuration is consistent with the other APM agents. Troubleshooting tips: If you're missing event data, increase the value of max_samples_stored or revert to the default value. The value of max_samples_stored should not be over 10,000. Node version support Node 8 is the earliest version supported by the New Relic Node.js v6 agent. Node 6, 7 and 9 are not supported by v6. Customers running Node 6, 7 and 9 have two options: Upgrade to a supported version of Node and take advantage of the New Relic Node.js v6 agent's new features. Remain on New Relic Node.js v5 agent without the ability to use new features only available with update agent versions. Node 8 no longer receive updates, but New Relic will continue to support these versions of Node for the time being. Tip Upgrade to a newer version of Node as soon as possible. The next major version of the New Relic Node.js agent will likely remove support for Node 8. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 5 Before upgrading to Node.js agent v5, review this information for major changes. Also see New Relic's Node.js v5 migration guide on GitHub. Major changes with Node.js v5 agent Comments Removed deprecated addCustomParameter methods. v2 - v4: Starting in agent v2.7.0, these methods were marked as deprecated but left in to give a transition period for the new methods. v5: Applications must use the API methods newrelic.addCustomAttribute() and newrelic.addCustomAttributes(). These are drop-in replacements for the old methods. Removed deprecated create*Transaction methods. v2 - v4: Starting in agent v2.0.2, these methods were marked as deprecated but left in to give a transition period to the new methods. v5: Applications must update to the API methods newrelic.startWebTransaction() and newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction(). Troubleshooting tips: These new methods are not drop-in replacements for the old ones. Before moving to these new methods, review our custom instrumentation guide. Removed deprecated createTracer method. v3 - v4: Starting in agent v3.3.0, this method was marked as deprecated in favor of newrelic.startSegment(). v5: Applications must update to newrelic.startSegment(). Removed node-cassandra-cql instrumentation. v4: Applications using the npm package node-cassandra-cql would get datastore metrics for Cassandra. v5: Applications must migrate to the cassandra-driver package to get Cassandra datastore metrics. This module is actively maintained by the same developers. The node-cassandra-cql package was abandoned in February of 2014 in favor of the cassandra-driver package. Removed deprecated capture_params and ignored_params configurations. v2 - v4: Starting in agent v2.7.0, these configuration parameters caused a warning to be logged, and the values were automatically upgraded to the new attributes configurations. v5: A warning will still be logged but the configuration is ignored, and no automatic upgrading happens any more. Troubleshooting tips: If your application had parameters listed in the ignored_params configuration, you will need to move them to attributes.exclude. Node version support Node 6 is the earliest version supported by the New Relic Node.js v5 agent. Node 4 and 5 are not supported by v5. Customers running Node 4 or 5 have two options: Upgrade to a supported version of Node and take advantage of the New Relic Node.js v5 agent's new features. Remain on New Relic Node.js v4 agent without the ability to use new features only available with update agent versions. Node 7 and 9 no longer receive updates, but New Relic will continue to support these versions of Node for the time being. Tip Upgrade to a newer version of Node as soon as possible. The next major version of the New Relic Node.js agent will likely remove support for Node 6 and 7. Feature flags as of v5 As of New Relic for Node.js v5: custom_instrumentation: This feature is no longer configurable. custom_metrics: This feature is no longer configurable. synthetics: This feature is no longer configurable. native_metrics: This feature is now controlled by the plugins.native_metrics.enabled configuration value. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 4 Before upgrading to Node.js agent v4, review this information for major changes. Also see New Relic's Node.js v4 migration guide on GitHub. Upgrade https-proxy-agent from v0 to v2 Major changes with Node.js v4 agent include an upgrade of the https-proxy-agent from v0 to v2. This dependency has been updated due to a security issue in the https-proxy-agent that the New Relic Node.js agent used. Because https-proxy v2 is incompatible with node v0.10 and v0.12, New Relic has deprecated those agent versions. There is no required action to migrate from v3 to v4 of New Relic's Node.js agent. Node version support Node 4 is the earliest version supported by the New Relic Node.js v4 agent. Node 0.10 and 0.12 are not supported by v4. Customers running Node 0.10 or 0.12 have two options: Upgrade to a supported version of Node and take advantage of the New Relic Node.js v4 agent's new features. Remain on the New Relic Node.js v3 agent without the ability to use new features only available with updated agent versions. Node 4, 5, and 7 also no longer receive updates, but New Relic will continue to support these versions of Node for the time being. Tip Upgrade to a newer version of Node as soon as possible. The next major version of the New Relic Node.js agent will likely remove support for Node 4 and 5. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 3 Before upgrading to Node.js agent agent v3, review this information for major changes. Also see New Relic's Node.js v3 migration guide on GitHub. Major changes with Node.js v3 agent Major changes with Node.js v3 agent Comments Removed SSL configuration v2: With the v2 agent, it was possible to configure the agent to connect to New Relic without encryption. v3: Node.js agent v3 always connects to New Relic servers using TLS encryption to protect communications. If the agent is configured to disable this, a warning is logged and the setting is ignored. Request parameters now prefixed with request.parameters. v2: The v2 agent collects request parameters, such as route parameters (/users/:userId) and query parameters (/users?userId=123), as the parameter name (userId). v3: The v3 agent prefixes all request parameters with the string request.parameters.. For example,userId appears as request.parameters.userId. Troubleshooting tips: If you have dashboards, alert policies, or other NRQL queries based on request parameters, update them with the new parameter names. Feature flags as of v3 As of New Relic Node.js agent v3, the send_request_uri_attribute feature is no longer configurable. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 2 Before upgrading to Node.js agent v2, review this information for major changes. Also see New Relic's Node.js v2 migration guide on GitHub. Major changes with Node.js v2 agent Major changes with Node.js v2 agent Comments Reversed naming and ignore rules v1: With the v1 agent, rules defined in the config properties rules.name and rules.ignore were applied in reverse order; the first rule in the list was applied last. v2: Node.js agent v2 applies rules in the order they are defined, so the first rule in the list is applied first. Troubleshooting tips: If you used naming rules in the v1 agent and notice problems, reverse the order of your rules in your configuration. De-duplicated HTTP request transactions v1: The v1 agent started a new transaction for each listener on an HTTP server's request event. In applications with multiple listeners on the request event, this resulted in extraneous transactions being created that almost always did not get named correctly. v2: The v2 agent only creates a single transaction for each request event emitted. Troubleshooting tips: If you used multiple request event listeners and added a call to newrelic.ignoreTransaction() to remove the extra transactions, remove those calls. Stopped swallowing outbound request errors v1: The v1 agent swallowed unhandled error events emitted by outbound HTTP request objects. v2: The v2 agent removes this behavior. Instead, the v2 agent does not change normal Node execution. This means the error event will always be emitted. Troubleshooting tips: If you are making outbound requests and currently do not listen for the error event, add a listener and handle the error as appropriate for your application. Updated configuration options as of v2 In newrelic.js, edit the Node.js agent configuration properties you use for compatiblity with the latest versions: Deprecated property New property capture_params attributes.enabled: false By default, request attributes are not sent to New Relic. Set attributes.enabled: true to include agent-defined or custom attributes in traces. The capture_params property has been deprecated. ignored_params attributes.exclude: [] Add any request attribute keys to the attributes.exclude list. Now, instead of having to be an exact match, wildcards (*) may be appended to each item for broader filtering. The ignored_params property has been deprecated. These Node.js agent configuration properties also have overrides for specific destinations, including: transaction_tracer transaction_events error_collector browser_monitoring For example, if the root attributes.enabled is true and you set transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled: false, this will restrict attributes from being collected in transaction traces, while still allowing them for all others. Deprecated API methods as of v2 The following methods from the Node.js agent have been deprecated, and New Relic has deleted them in v5 of the agent. Each has an easy replacement that accomplishes the same task in a more flexible and reliable way. newrelic.createWebTransaction() Replace with newrelic.startWebTransaction() and newrelic.getTransaction(). newrelic.createBackgroundTransaction() Replace with newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction() and newrelic.getTransaction(). newrelic.addCustomParameter() Replace with newrelic.addCustomAttribute(). newrelic.addCustomParameters() Replace with newrelic.addCustomAttributes(). New v2 agent API methods The following API methods are new with the New Relic Node.js v2 agent. newrelic.getTransaction() This method gets a reference to the currently running transaction. Use in conjunction with: newrelic.startWebTransaction newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction Callback-based message consumer services for troubleshooting message consumers newrelic.startWebTransaction()newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction() These new API methods replace the older create*Transaction methods. They are easier to use and seamlessly work with promises.

For more information, see New Relic's Node.js instrumentation tutorials on GitHub. newrelic.addCustomAttribute() Use this method to add a custom trace attribute. newrelic.addCustomAttributes() Use this method to add multiple custom trace attributes. Node version support for v2 The earliest version of Node supported by the New Relic Node.js v2 agent is 0.10. Node 0.8, which has not been updated since July of 2014, is not supported by v2. Customers running Node 0.8 have two options: Upgrade to a supported version of Node and take advantage of the New Relic Node.js v2 agent's new features. Remain on New Relic Node.js v1 agent without the ability to use new features only available with updated agent versions. Node 0.10 also no longer receives updates, but New Relic will continue to support this version of Node for the time being. Recommendation: Upgrade to a newer version of Node as soon as possible. npm version support as of v2 The New Relic Node.js agent now requires npm version 2.0.0 or higher. This version of npm comes packaged with Node 0.10.44 or higher. If you are using an earlier version of Node 0.10 you will need to first install npm 2.0.0 or higher, or upgrade to a newer version of Node.

      "body": "New Relic offers several tools to help obtain the information needed to provide useful metrics about your Node.js application. These include: Reading the route names (if used) from the Express and Restify routers Using the API to name the current request, either with simple names or groups of controllers with actions Support rules that are stored in your agent's configuration that can mark requests to be renamed or ignored based on regular expressions matched against the request's raw URLs (also available as API calls) The number of names that New Relic tracks needs to be small enough so that the user experience is robust. It also needs to be large enough to provide the right amount of information (without overwhelming you with data) so that you can identify problem spots in your applications more easily. For more information, see the Node.js agent configuration documentation and the Node.js agent API documentation on Github. Request names The Node.js agent captures the HTTP method along with a potentially parameterized path (such as /user/:id) or a regular expression (such as /^/user/([-0-9a-f]+)$/). These pieces of information become part of the request name. If you have support for slow transaction traces and have enabled capture_params in your config file, the transaction trace will also have the request's parameters and their values attached to it. If you are dissatisfied with the request names that the Node.js agent uses, you can use API calls to create more descriptive names. Tip If grouping your requests under the generic name, then /* is sufficient, and you do not need to customize your configuration file or API calls. Requirements New Relic uses request names to group requests for many charts and tables. The value of these visualizations will drop as the number of different request names increases. For example, do not include potentially dynamic data like GUIDs, numerical IDs, or timestamps in the request names you create. If your request is slow enough to generate a transaction trace, that trace will contain the original URL. If you enable parameter capture, the parameters will also be attached to the trace. Tip Avoid having more than 50 different transaction names. For example, if you have more than a couple hundred different request names, rethink your naming strategy. Avoid metric grouping issues The request naming API helps New Relic avoid problems with trying to handle too many metrics, which sometimes is referred to as \"metric explosion.\" New Relic has several strategies to deal with these issues; the most severe is simply to add offending applications to your deny list. The main reason for you to be careful in using these request-naming tools is to prevent that from happening to your applications. For more information, see Metric grouping issues. Guidelines Define your configuration rules from the most specific to the most general. The first rules listed in your config file or added with the Node.js transaction naming API will be applied first and should be narrowly targeted. More general \"fall-through\" rules should be added toward the end of the list, because they will be evaluated in the order they were configured or added using the Node.js transaction naming API. URL pattern matching An online retailer has a URL pattern like this: /user/customers/all/prospects /user/customers/all/current /user/customers/all/returning /user/customers/John /user/customers/Jane Copy The retailer could create rules like this: // newrelic.js exports.config={ //other configuration rules:{ name:[ { pattern: \"/user/customers/all/prospects/\", name: \"/user/customers/all/prospects\" }, { pattern: \"/user/customers/all/.*\", name: \"/user/customers/all\" }, { pattern: \"/user/customers/.*\", name: \"/user/customers/:customer\" } ] } } Copy With these rules, the retailer would create three transaction names: /user/customers/:customer /user/customers/all /user/customers/all/prospects If the retailer reversed the order, the rules would catch all transactions in :customer, which would not be as useful. Load the request naming API Make sure that loading the New Relic module is the first thing your application does, as it needs to bootstrap itself before the rest of your application loads: var newrelic = require('newrelic'); Copy This returns the request naming API. You can safely require the module from multiple modules in your application, as it only initializes itself once. Request API calls Here is a summary of the Request API calls for New Relic's Node.js agent. newrelic.setTransactionName(name) newrelic.setTransactionName(name) Copy Name the current request, following the request naming requirements. You can call this function anywhere within the context of an HTTP request handler, at any time after handling of the request has started, but before the request has finished. In general, if the request and response objects are in scope, you can set the name. Explicitly calling newrelic.setTransactionName() will override any names set by Express or Restify routes. Also, calls to newrelic.setTransactionName() and newrelic.setControllerName() will overwrite each other. The last one to run before the request ends wins. newrelic.setControllerName(name, \\[action]) newrelic.setControllerName(name, \\[action]) Copy Name the current request using a controller-style pattern, optionally including the current controller action. If the action is omitted, New Relic will include the HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.) as the action. The rules for when you can call newrelic.setControllerName() are the same as they are for newrelic.setTransactionName(), including the request naming requirements. Explicitly calling newrelic.setControllerName() will override any names set by Express or Restify routes. Also, calls to newrelic.setTransactionName() and newrelic.setControllerName() will overwrite each other. The last one to run before the request ends wins. Custom instrumentation API calls Use these API calls to expand your instrumentation with custom instrumentation. newrelic.instrument(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) newrelic.instrument(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) Copy Sets an instrumentation callback for a specific module. The provided onRequire callback will be fired when the given module is loaded with require. The moduleName parameter should be the string that will be passed to require; for example, 'express' or 'amqplib/callback_api'. The optional onError callback is called if the onRequire parameters throws an error. This is useful for debugging your instrumentation. Use this method to: Add instrumentation for modules not currently instrumented by New Relic. Instrument your own code. Replace the Node.js agent's built-in instrumentation with your own. For more information, see New Relic's Node.js instrumentation tutorial on Github. newrelic.instrumentDatastore(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) newrelic.instrumentDatastore(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) Copy Sets an instrumentation callback for a datastore module. This method is just like newrelic.instrument(), except it provides a datastore-specialized shim. For more information, see New Relic's Node.js datastore instrumentation tutorial on Github. newrelic.instrumentLoadedModule(moduleName, moduleInstance) newrelic.instrumentLoadedModule(moduleName, moduleInstance) Copy The instrumentLoadedModule method allows you to add stock instrumentation to specific modules in situations where it's impossible to have require('newrelic'); as the first line of your app's main module. // load the agent const newrelic = require('newrelic') // module loaded before newrelic const expressModule = require('express') // instrument express _after_ the agent has been loaded newrelic.instrumentLoadedModule( 'express', // the module's name, as a string expressModule // the module instance ); Copy Important This method cannot instrument any arbitrary module. Its purpose is to add modules that were missed because the agent was not loaded as the first thing in your program. The instrumentLoadedModule method can only instrument modules the agent would normally instrument. You can see a list of these modules in the agent's lib/instrumentations module. newrelic.instrumentMessages(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) newrelic.instrumentMessages(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) Copy Sets an instrumentation callback for a message service client module. This method is just like newrelic.instrument(), except it provides a message-service-specialized shim. For more information, see New Relic's Node.js message service instrumentation tutorial on Github. newrelic.instrumentWebframework(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) newrelic.instrumentWebframework(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) Copy Sets an instrumentation callback for a web framework module. This method is just like newrelic.instrument(), except it provides a web-framework-specialized shim. For more information, see New Relic's Node.js web framework instrumentation tutorial on Github. newrelic.startWebTransaction(url, handle) newrelic.startWebTransaction(url, handle) Copy Instrument the specified web transaction. Using this API call, you can instrument transactions that New Relic does not automatically detect. The url defines the transaction name and needs to be static. Do not include variable data such as user ID. The handle defines the function you want to instrument. New Relic will capture any metrics that would be captured by auto-instrumentation, as well as manual instrumentation via startSegment(). You must handle custom transactions manually by calling newrelic.getTransaction() at the start of your transaction, and then call transaction.end() when you are finished. New Relic begins timing the transaction when newrelic.startWebTransaction() is called and ends the transaction when transaction.end() is called. You can also return a promise to indicate the end of the transaction. Please note that if this promise rejects, it does not automatically hook into New Relic’s error tracking. This needs to be done manually with noticeError(). newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction(name, \\[group], handle) newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction(name, \\[group], handle) Copy Instrument the specified background transaction. Using this API call, you can expand New Relic's instrumentation to capture data from background transactions. The name defines the transaction name and needs to be static. Do not include variable data such as user ID. The group is optional, and it allows you to group similar jobs together via the transaction type in the user interface. Like name, the group needs to be static. The handle defines a function that includes the entire background job you want to instrument. New Relic will capture any metrics that would be captured by auto-instrumentation, as well as manual instrumentation via startSegment(). You must handle custom transactions manually by calling newrelic.getTransaction() at the start of your transaction, and then call transaction.end() when you are finished. New Relic begins timing the transaction when newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction() is called and ends the transaction when transaction.end() is called. You can also return a promise to indicate the end of the transaction. Please note that if this promise rejects, it does not automatically hook into New Relic’s error tracking. This needs to be done manually with noticeError(). newrelic.getTransaction() newrelic.getTransaction() Copy Returns a handle on the currently executing transaction. This handle can then be used to interact with a given transaction safely from any context. It is best used with newrelic.startWebTransaction() and newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction(). Please refer to the transaction handle section for more details. newrelic.endTransaction() newrelic.endTransaction() Copy End the current web or background custom transaction. This method requires being in the correct transaction context when called. This API call takes no arguments. newrelic.startSegment(name, record, handler, callback) newrelic.startSegment(name, record, handler, callback) Copy Instrument a particular method to improve visibility into a transaction, or optionally turn it into a metric. The name defines a name for the segment. This name will be visible in transaction traces and as a new metric in the New Relic UI. The record flag defines whether the segment should be recorded as a metric. The handler is the function you want to track as a segment. The optional callback is a function passed to the handler to fire after its work is done. The agent begins timing the segment when startSegment is called. The segment is ended when either the handler finishes executing, or callback is fired, if it is provided. Custom metrics API calls Use these API calls to record additional arbitrary metrics: newrelic.recordMetric(name, value) newrelic.recordMetric(name, value) Copy Use recordMetric to record an event-based metric, usually associated with a particular duration. The name must be a string following standard metric naming rules. The value will usually be a number, but it can also be an object. When value is a numeric value, it should represent the magnitude of a measurement associated with an event; for example, the duration for a particular method call. When value is an object, it must contain count, total, min, max, and sumOfSquares keys, all with number values. This form is useful to aggregate metrics on your own and report them periodically; for example, from a setInterval. These values will be aggregated with any previously collected values for the same metric. The names of these keys match the names of the keys used by the platform API. newrelic.incrementMetric(name, \\[amount]) newrelic.incrementMetric(name, \\[amount]) Copy Use incrementMetric to update a metric that acts as a simple counter. The count of the selected metric will be incremented by the specified amount, defaulting to 1. Custom events API calls Use these API calls to record additional events: newrelic.recordCustomEvent(eventType, attributes) newrelic.recordCustomEvent(eventType, attributes) Copy Use recordCustomEvent to record an event-based metric, usually associated with a particular duration. The eventType must be an alphanumeric string less than 255 characters. The attributes must be an object of key and value pairs. The keys must be shorter than 255 characters, and the values must be string, number, or boolean. Recording a custom event The following example demonstrates recording a custom event with multiple attributes. const attributes = { attribute1: 'value1', attribute2: 2 } newrelic.recordCustomEvent('MessagingEvent', attributes) Copy Transaction handle methods This section details the methods provided by the TransactionHandle class instance that can be obtained through newrelic.getTransaction(). Use these methods to interact directly with the current transaction: transactionHandle.end(\\[callback]) transactionHandle.end(\\[callback]) Copy Use transactionHandle.end to end the transaction referenced by the handle instance. The callback is invoked when the transaction has fully ended. The finished transaction passed to the callback as the first argument. transactionHandle.ignore() transactionHandle.ignore() Copy Use transactionHandle.ignore to ignore the transaction referenced by the handle instance. transactionHandle.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(headers) transactionHandle.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(headers) Copy Important This API requires distributed tracing to be enabled. For context on how to use this call and its partner call acceptDistributedTraceHeaders, first read Enable distributed tracing with agent APIs. transactionHandle.insertDistributedTraceHeaders is used to implement distributed tracing. It modifies the headers map that is passed in by adding W3C Trace Context headers and New Relic Distributed Trace headers. The New Relic headers can be disabled with distributed_tracing.exclude_newrelic_header: true in the config. This method replaces the deprecated createDistributedTracePayload method, which only creates New Relic Distributed Trace payloads. Generating distributed trace headers In the following example, by calling insertDistributedTraceHeaders with an empty object, the appropriate Distributed Trace headers and W3C Trace Context headers will be generated for the transaction. // Call newrelic.getTransaction to retrieve a handle on the current transaction. const transactionHandle = newrelic.getTransaction() // This could be a header object from an incoming request as well const headersObject = {} newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction('background task', function executeTransaction() { const transaction = newrelic.getTransaction() // generate the headers transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(headersObject) }) Copy transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(transportType, headers) transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(transportType, headers) Copy Important This API requires distributed tracing to be enabled. For context on how to use this call and its partner call insertDistributedTraceHeaders, first read Enable distributed tracing with agent APIs. transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders is used to instrument the called service for inclusion in a distributed trace. It links the spans in a trace by accepting a payload generated by insertDistributedTraceHeaders or generated by some other W3C Trace Context compliant tracer. This method accepts the headers of an incoming request, looks for W3C Trace Context headers, and if not found, falls back to New Relic distributed trace headers. This method replaces the deprecated (and now removed as of version 7.0.0) acceptDistributedTracePayload method, which only handles New Relic distributed trace payloads. transportType should be one of the following strings: AMQP HTTP HTTPS IronMQ JMS Kafka Other Queue Unknown headers should be an object containing all the headers in the incoming request. The keys must be lowercase. Accept incoming distributed trace headers The following example demonstrates adding distributed trace headers retrieved from a Kafka message. In this example, we assume that the incoming Kafka message has Distributed Trace headers inserted. // incoming Kafka message headers const headersObject = message.headers // Call newrelic.getTransaction to retrieve a handle on the current transaction. const transactionHandle = newrelic.getTransaction() newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction('background task', function executeTransaction() { const transaction = newrelic.getTransaction() // accept the headers transaction.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders('Kafka', headersObject) }) Copy transactionHandle.createDistributedTracePayload() transactionHandle.createDistributedTracePayload() Copy Caution This method is deprecated and was removed in version 7.0.0! Please use insertDistributedTraceHeaders. Important This API requires distributed tracing to be enabled. For instructions on how to use this call, along with its partner call acceptDistributedTracePayload, see Enable distributed tracing with agent APIs. This call is used to implement distributed tracing. It generates a payload that is read by the receiving application with acceptDistributedTracePayload. Important Note: In order to maintain proper ordering of spans in a trace, you must generate the payload in the context of the span that sends it. The DistributedTracePayload object has two available methods used for generating the payload in different formats: DistributedTracePayload#text: returns a JSON representation of the payload. Link a nested background transaction // Call newrelic.getTransaction to retrieve a handle on the current transaction. var transactionHandle = newrelic.getTransaction() var payload = transactionHandle.createDistributedTracePayload() var jsonPayload = payload.text() newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction('background task', function executeTransaction() { var backgroundHandle = newrelic.getTransaction() // Link the nested transaction by accepting the payload with the background transaction's handle backgroundHandle.acceptDistributedTracePayload(jsonPayload) }) Copy DistributedTracePayload#httpSafe: returns a base64 encoded JSON representation of the payload. Place payload on an outgoing request // Call newrelic.getTransaction to retrieve a handle on the current transaction. var transactionHandle = newrelic.getTransaction() var payload = transactionHandle.createDistributedTracePayload() // Place the base64 encoded value on an outbound request header. req.headers[myTracingHeader] = payload.httpSafe() Copy transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTracePayload(payload) transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTracePayload(payload) Copy Caution This method is deprecated and was removed in version 7.0.0! Please use acceptDistributedTraceHeaders. Important This API requires distributed tracing to be enabled. For context on how to use this call and its partner call createDistributedTracePayload, first read Enable distributed tracing with agent APIs. transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTracePayload is used to instrument the called service for inclusion in a distributed trace. It links the spans in a trace by accepting the payload generated by createDistributedTracePayload. transactionHandle.isSampled() transactionHandle.isSampled() Copy Returns whether this trace is being sampled. Other API calls New Relic's Node.js agent includes additional API calls. newrelic.addCustomAttribute(name, value) newrelic.addCustomAttribute(name, value) Copy Set a custom attribute value to be displayed along with the transaction trace in the New Relic UI. This must be called within the context of a transaction so it has a place to set the custom attributes. Custom attributes will appear in New Relic APM's transaction trace detail view and in errors for the transaction. Add custom attribute newrelic.addCustomAttribute('attribute1', 'value1') Copy Caution If you want to use your custom attributes, avoid using any of the reserved terms used by NRQL when naming them. newrelic.addCustomAttributes(attributes) newrelic.addCustomAttributes(attributes) Copy Set multiple custom attribute values to be displayed along with the transaction trace in the New Relic UI. The attributes should be passed as a single object. This must be called within the context of a transaction so it has a place to set the custom attributes. Custom attributes will appear in the transaction trace detail view and in errors for the transaction. Adding custom attributes const attributes = { attribute1: 'value1', attribute2: 2 } newrelic.addCustomAttributes(attributes) Copy Caution If you want to use your custom attributes, avoid using any of the reserved terms used by NRQL when naming them. newrelic.addCustomSpanAttribute(name, value) newrelic.addCustomSpanAttribute(name, value) Copy Set a custom span attribute value to be displayed along with a transaction trace span in the New Relic UI. This must be called within the context of an active segment/span so it has a place to set the custom span attributes. Custom span attributes will appear in the Attributes section of the span detail view. Add custom span attribute newrelic.addCustomSpanAttribute('attribute1', 'value') Copy Important This API requires distributed tracing and span events to be enabled. Caution If you want to use your custom span attributes, avoid using any of the reserved terms used by NRQL when naming them. newrelic.addCustomSpanAttributes(attributes) newrelic.addCustomSpanAttributes(attributes) Copy Set multiple custom span attribute values to be displayed along with the transaction trace spans in the New Relic UI. The attributes should be passed as a single object. This must be called within the context of an active segment/span so it has a place to set the custom span attributes. Custom span attributes will appear in the Attributes section of the span detail view. Add custom span attributes const attributes = { attribute1: 'value1', attribute2: 'value2' } newrelic.addCustomSpanAttributes(attributes) Copy Important This API requires distributed tracing and span events to be enabled. Caution If you want to use your custom span attributes, avoid using any of the reserved terms used by NRQL when naming them. newrelic.getBrowserTimingHeader() newrelic.getBrowserTimingHeader() Copy Returns the HTML snippet to be inserted into the header of HTML pages to enable browser monitoring. The HTML will instruct the browser to fetch a small JavaScript file and start the page timer. newrelic.setIgnoreTransaction(ignored) newrelic.setIgnoreTransaction(ignored) Copy Tell the module whether or not to ignore a given request. This allows you to explicitly filter long-polling, irrelevant routes or requests you know will be time-consuming. This also allows you to gather metrics for requests that otherwise would be ignored. To ignore the transaction, set the parameter to true will ignore the transaction. To prevent a transaction from being ignored with this function, pass the parameter false. Passing null or undefined will not change whether the transaction is ignored. Caution This method is deprecated and was removed in version 7.0.0. Please use transactionHandle.ignore() newrelic.noticeError(error, \\[customParameters]) newrelic.noticeError(error, \\[customParameters]) Copy Use this call if your app is doing its own error handling with domains or try/catch clauses, but you want all of the information about how many errors are coming out of the app to be centrally managed. Unlike other Node.js calls, this can be used outside of route handlers, but it will have additional context if called from within transaction scope. Caution Errors recorded using this method do not obey the ignore_status_codes configuration value. newrelic.shutdown(\\[options], callback) newrelic.shutdown(\\[options], callback) Copy Use this method to gracefully shut down the agent. options options.collectPendingData - type boolean - Tell the agent whether to send any pending data to the New Relic collector before shutting down. options.timeout - type number (ms) - The default time before forcing a shutdown. When collectPendingData is true, the agent will wait for a connection before shutting down. This timeout is useful for short lived processes, like AWS Lambda, in order to keep the process from staying open too long, while trying to connect. Example: newrelic.shutdown({collectPendingData: true, timeout: 3000}, (error) => { process.exit() }) Copy newrelic.getLinkingMetadata() newrelic.getLinkingMetadata() Copy Returns key/value pairs which can be used to link traces or entities. It will only contain items with meaningful values. For instance, if distributed tracing is disabled, trace.id will not be included. newrelic.getTraceMetadata() newrelic.getTraceMetadata() Copy Returns and object containing the current trace ID and span ID. Important This API requires distributed tracing to be enabled or an empty object will be returned. Rules for naming and ignoring requests If you do not want to put calls to the New Relic module directly into your application code, you can use pattern-based rules to name requests. There are two sets of rules: one for renaming requests, and one to mark requests to be ignored by New Relic's instrumentation. Here is the structure for rules in New Relic's Node.js agent. rules.name A list of rules of the format {pattern : \"pattern\", name : \"name\"} for matching incoming request URLs to pattern and naming the matching New Relic transaction's name. This acts as a regex replace, where you can set the pattern either as a string, or as a JavaScript regular expression literal, and both pattern and name are required. When passing a regex as a string, escape backslashes, as the agent does not keep them when given as a string in a pattern. Define your configuration rules from the most specific to the most general, as the patterns will be evaluated in order and are terminal in nature. For more information, see the naming guidelines. This can also be set with the environment variable NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES, with multiple rules passed in as a list of comma-delimited JSON object literals: NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES='{\"pattern\":\"^t\",\"name\":\"u\"},{\"pattern\":\"^u\",\"name\":\"t\"}' Copy Optional rules attributes [#optional-rules] Additional optional attributes are available: Optional rules attributes Description terminate_chain Default: true When set to true (default), no further rules will be evaluated if this rule is a match. Setting this to false is useful when multiple rules should be used together. For example, one rule could be replacing a common pattern in many different URLs, while subsequent rule(s) would be more specific. replace_all Default: false When set to true, all matches of the pattern will be replaced. Otherwise, only the first match will be replaced. Using the g flag with regular expression literal will have the same effect. For example: pattern: '[0-9]+', replace_all: true Copy This has the same effect as pattern: /[0-9]+/g. precedence By default the rules are evaluated in order, from first to last. If you prefer to have complete control over the order, you can give each rule a precedence attribute. The precedence is an integer number, and rules are evaluated in ascending order. If precedence is not explicitly defined, it will be set to 500 by default. Additional attributes are ignored. Testing your naming rules [#testing-rules] The Node.js agent comes with a command-line tool for testing naming rules. For more information, run the following command in terminal window in a directory where your app is installed: node node_modules/.bin/newrelic-naming-rules Copy Naming rule examples [#examples-rules] Here are some examples of naming rules and the results. Match full URL pattern: \"^/items/[0-9]+$\", name: \"/items/:id\" Copy will result in: /items/123 => /items/:id /orders/123 => /orders/123 (not replaced since the rule is a full match) Copy Replace first match in URL pattern: \"[0-9]+\", name: \":id\" Copy will result in: /orders/123 => /orders/:id /items/123 => /items/:id /orders/123/items/123 => /orders/:id/items/123 Copy Replace all matches in any URL pattern: \"[0-9]+\", name: \":id\", replace_all: true Copy will result in: /orders/123/items/123 => /orders/:id/items/:id Copy Match group references Using regular expression match group references: pattern: '^/(items|orders)/[0-9]+$', name: '/\\\\1/:id' Copy will result in: /orders/123 => /orders/:id /items/123 => /items/:id Copy rules.ignore This can also be set via the environment variable NEW_RELIC_IGNORING_RULES, with multiple rules passed in as a list of comma-delimited patterns. Currently there is no way to escape commas in patterns. NEW_RELIC_IGNORING_RULES='^/socket\\.io/\\*/xhr-polling,ignore_me' Copy Here are full examples of how rules are included in the configuration file: Naming rule example // newrelic.js exports.config = { // other configuration rules : { name : [ { pattern: \"/tables/name-here\", name: \"/name-hererule1\" } ] } Copy Ignoring rule example If you are using socket.io, you will have a use case for ignoring rules right out of the box. To keep socket.io long-polling from dominating your response-time metrics and affecting the Apdex metrics for your application, add a rule such as: // newrelic.js exports.config = { // other configuration rules : { ignore : [ '^\\/socket\\.io\\/.*\\/xhr-polling' ] } }; Copy API calls for rules Here are the API calls for naming and ignoring rules with New Relic's Node.js agent. newrelic.addNamingRule(pattern, name) Programmatic version of rules.name. Once naming rules are added, they cannot be removed until the Node process is restarted. They can also be added via the Node.js agent's configuration. Both parameters are required. newrelic.addIgnoringRule(pattern) Programmatic version of rules.ignore. Once ignoring rules are added, they cannot be removed until the Node process is restarted. They can also be added via the Node.js agent's configuration. This parameter is required.",

      "body": "Our Node.js agent is publicly available on the Node Package Manager (npm) repository as well as on GitHub. Before you install the Node.js agent, make sure your application meets the following system requirements. Node.js version support Tip For best performance, use the latest active long term support (LTS) version of Node.js. Support for new Node.js releases We will support the latest even versions of Node.js releases by the beginning of the following active long term support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Node.js version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Node.js agent with support 16 October 2021 April-October 2021 End of support for Node.js releases reaching EOL When support for a new long term support agent version is made available, support for the Node.js agent version that reaches end-of-life during the same time period will simultaneously drop. The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Node.js version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Node.js agent dropping support 12 April 2022 April-October 2022 10 April 2021 As of July 31, 2021, we're discontinuing support for Node.js 10. For more details, including how you can easily prepare for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. Node.js 12 errors For Node.js 12, the following change affects the Node.js agent: Errors resulting in unhandled rejections are not scoped to the transaction that was active when the rejected promise was created. This is because the promise responsible for triggering the init async hook is no longer passed through on the promise wrap instance. This breaks the linkage that associates a given promise rejection with the transaction it was scheduled in. Supported Node.js frameworks Express 4.6.0 or higher Restify Connect v1 and v2 (router not supported) Hapi Koa 2.0.0 or higher (external module loaded with the agent) If you are using a supported framework with default routers, the Node.js agent can read these frameworks' route names as-is. However, if you want more specific names than are provided by your framework, you may want to use one or more of the tools New Relic provides with the Node.js transaction naming API. Operating systems Linux SmartOS macOS 10.7 and higher Windows Server 2008 and higher Datastores The Node.js agent monitors the performance of Node.js application calls to these datastores: Cassandra Memcached MongoDB MySQL (via mysql and mysql2 packages) Redis Postgres (including the native and pure JavaScript packages) Instance details We collect instance details for a variety of databases and database drivers. The ability to view specific instances and the types of database information in APM depends on your agent version. New Relic's Node.js agent version 1.31.0 or higher supports the following: Database npm module name Minimum module version Minimum agent version PostgreSQL pg 4.0.0 1.31.0 Redis redis 2.0.0 1.31.0 MongoDB mongodb 2.1.0 1.32.0 MySQL mysql 2.4.1 1.32.0 Memcached memcached 1.0.0 1.33.0 To request instance-level information from datastores currently not listed for your New Relic agent, get support at support.newrelic.com. Messages queues Message queue instrumentation is only available with the New Relic Node.js agent v2 or higher. Currently supported message queue instrumentation: amqplib For other message queue libraries, use custom instrumentation. Hosting services Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment AWS EC2 Microsoft Azure Heroku Process managers In general, process managers that handle starting, stopping, and restarting of Node.js (like Forever) should be compatible with the Node.js agent. If you are using PM2, the minimum supported version of PM2 is 2.0. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Connect the agent to other New Relic features The Node.js agent integrates with other features to give you full-stack observability: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Node.js agent automatically injects the browser monitoring agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser monitoring injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Node.js agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in infrastructure monitoring. New Relic dashboards The Node.js agent sends default events and attributes for NRQL queries. You can also record custom events for advanced analysis. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

      "body": "To take full advantage of New Relic's latest features, enhancements, and important security patches, we recommend you update your Node.js agent to the latest version. For additional information about specific agent updates, refer to the Node.js agent release notes. The release notes include a download link when applicable, plus instructions to download and install the latest version. If the newrelic module is listed in your package.json, run npm install. If you want to target just the newrelic module, run npm update newrelic. Recommendation: Test your updated version before moving it into production. If you have problems, follow the Node.js agent troubleshooting procedures. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 7 Before upgrading to Node.js version 7, review this information for major changes. Major changes with Node.js agent v7 Comments BREAKING Removed deprecated httpResponseCode, response.status and httpResponseMessage http response attributes v6.4.2-v6.14.0: Starting in agent v6.4.2, these attributes were marked as deprecated but left in to give a transition period for the new attributes. v7: When http response attribute reporting is enabled, http.statusCode and http.statusText will be reported. BREAKING Removed deprecated setIgnoreTransaction API method v5 - v6: Starting in agent v5.0.0, this method was marked as deprecated but left in to give a transition period for the new methods. v7: Applications must use the API method transactionHandle.ignore(). BREAKING Removed the api.custom_parameters_enabled configuration item and associated environment variable NEW_RELIC_API_CUSTOM_PARAMETERS. Applications must use the configuration api.custom_attributes_enabled or the associated environment variable NEW_RELIC_API_CUSTOM_ATTRIBUTES to enable newrelic.addCustomAttribute and newrelic.addCustomAttributes. BREAKING Removed deprecated Distributed Tracing API methods, createDistributedTracePayload() and acceptDistributedTracePayload() v6.4.0-v6.14.0: Starting in agent v6.4.0, these method were marked as deprecated but left in to give a transition period for the new methods. v7: Applications must use the API methods transactionHandle.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(headers) and transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(transportType, headers) . With these methods, the Node agent will now accept W3C's traceparent and tracestate headers when calling transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(headers) and include the W3C headers along with the New Relic distributed tracing header when calling transactionHandle.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(headers), unless the New Relic trace header format is disabled using distributed_tracing.exclude_newrelic_header:true. Update New Relic Dependencies to versions with updated Node version support @newrelic/aws-sdk v3.0.0 @newrelic/koa v5.0.0 @newrelic/native-metrics v6.0.0 @newrelic/superagent v4.0.0 @newrelic/test-utilities v5.0.0 Node version support Node v10 is the earliest version supported by the New Relic Node.js v7 agent. Node 8 and 9 are not supported by v7. Customers running Node 9 and earlier have two options: Upgrade to a supported version of Node and take advantage of the New Relic Node.js v7 agent's new features. Remain on New Relic Node.js v6 agent without the ability to use new features only available with update agent versions. Node 10 no longer receive updates, but New Relic will continue to support these versions of Node for the time being. Tip Upgrade to a newer version of Node as soon as possible. The next major version of the New Relic Node.js agent will likely remove support for Node 10. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 6 Before upgrading to Node.js agent version 6, review this information for major changes. Major changes with Node.js agent v6 Comments Upgraded official Koa framework instrumentation module to v3.0.0 v6: Added support for @koa/router up to v8.0.2. @koa/router v8.0.3 and greater are currently unsupported. v6: Added support for Node v12 and removed support for Node v6, 7, and 9. The minimum supported version is Node v8. Also see New Relic's Koa Release Notes on Github.. Removed deprecated max_samples_per_minute configuration parameter, which is replaced by max_samples_stored behavior v1 - v5: max_samples_per_minute defined the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If your application previously used max_samples_per_minute as an upper bound, you may need to lower the threshold to a valid maximum to avoid data being dropped on the server. We recommend less than 10k. v5: In agent v5 and lower, max_samples_stored defined the maximum number of events the agent stores if it's unable to communicate with the New Relic collector. v6: The new behavior of max_samples_stored defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. This usage of the configuration is consistent with the other APM agents. Troubleshooting tips: If you're missing event data, increase the value of max_samples_stored or revert to the default value. The value of max_samples_stored should not be over 10,000. Node version support Node 8 is the earliest version supported by the New Relic Node.js v6 agent. Node 6, 7 and 9 are not supported by v6. Customers running Node 6, 7 and 9 have two options: Upgrade to a supported version of Node and take advantage of the New Relic Node.js v6 agent's new features. Remain on New Relic Node.js v5 agent without the ability to use new features only available with update agent versions. Node 8 no longer receive updates, but New Relic will continue to support these versions of Node for the time being. Tip Upgrade to a newer version of Node as soon as possible. The next major version of the New Relic Node.js agent will likely remove support for Node 8. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 5 Before upgrading to Node.js agent v5, review this information for major changes. Also see New Relic's Node.js v5 migration guide on GitHub. Major changes with Node.js v5 agent Comments Removed deprecated addCustomParameter methods. v2 - v4: Starting in agent v2.7.0, these methods were marked as deprecated but left in to give a transition period for the new methods. v5: Applications must use the API methods newrelic.addCustomAttribute() and newrelic.addCustomAttributes(). These are drop-in replacements for the old methods. Removed deprecated create*Transaction methods. v2 - v4: Starting in agent v2.0.2, these methods were marked as deprecated but left in to give a transition period to the new methods. v5: Applications must update to the API methods newrelic.startWebTransaction() and newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction(). Troubleshooting tips: These new methods are not drop-in replacements for the old ones. Before moving to these new methods, review our custom instrumentation guide. Removed deprecated createTracer method. v3 - v4: Starting in agent v3.3.0, this method was marked as deprecated in favor of newrelic.startSegment(). v5: Applications must update to newrelic.startSegment(). Removed node-cassandra-cql instrumentation. v4: Applications using the npm package node-cassandra-cql would get datastore metrics for Cassandra. v5: Applications must migrate to the cassandra-driver package to get Cassandra datastore metrics. This module is actively maintained by the same developers. The node-cassandra-cql package was abandoned in February of 2014 in favor of the cassandra-driver package. Removed deprecated capture_params and ignored_params configurations. v2 - v4: Starting in agent v2.7.0, these configuration parameters caused a warning to be logged, and the values were automatically upgraded to the new attributes configurations. v5: A warning will still be logged but the configuration is ignored, and no automatic upgrading happens any more. Troubleshooting tips: If your application had parameters listed in the ignored_params configuration, you will need to move them to attributes.exclude. Node version support Node 6 is the earliest version supported by the New Relic Node.js v5 agent. Node 4 and 5 are not supported by v5. Customers running Node 4 or 5 have two options: Upgrade to a supported version of Node and take advantage of the New Relic Node.js v5 agent's new features. Remain on New Relic Node.js v4 agent without the ability to use new features only available with update agent versions. Node 7 and 9 no longer receive updates, but New Relic will continue to support these versions of Node for the time being. Tip Upgrade to a newer version of Node as soon as possible. The next major version of the New Relic Node.js agent will likely remove support for Node 6 and 7. Feature flags as of v5 As of New Relic for Node.js v5: custom_instrumentation: This feature is no longer configurable. custom_metrics: This feature is no longer configurable. synthetics: This feature is no longer configurable. native_metrics: This feature is now controlled by the plugins.native_metrics.enabled configuration value. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 4 Before upgrading to Node.js agent v4, review this information for major changes. Also see New Relic's Node.js v4 migration guide on GitHub. Upgrade https-proxy-agent from v0 to v2 Major changes with Node.js v4 agent include an upgrade of the https-proxy-agent from v0 to v2. This dependency has been updated due to a security issue in the https-proxy-agent that the New Relic Node.js agent used. Because https-proxy v2 is incompatible with node v0.10 and v0.12, New Relic has deprecated those agent versions. There is no required action to migrate from v3 to v4 of New Relic's Node.js agent. Node version support Node 4 is the earliest version supported by the New Relic Node.js v4 agent. Node 0.10 and 0.12 are not supported by v4. Customers running Node 0.10 or 0.12 have two options: Upgrade to a supported version of Node and take advantage of the New Relic Node.js v4 agent's new features. Remain on the New Relic Node.js v3 agent without the ability to use new features only available with updated agent versions. Node 4, 5, and 7 also no longer receive updates, but New Relic will continue to support these versions of Node for the time being. Tip Upgrade to a newer version of Node as soon as possible. The next major version of the New Relic Node.js agent will likely remove support for Node 4 and 5. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 3 Before upgrading to Node.js agent agent v3, review this information for major changes. Also see New Relic's Node.js v3 migration guide on GitHub. Major changes with Node.js v3 agent Major changes with Node.js v3 agent Comments Removed SSL configuration v2: With the v2 agent, it was possible to configure the agent to connect to New Relic without encryption. v3: Node.js agent v3 always connects to New Relic servers using TLS encryption to protect communications. If the agent is configured to disable this, a warning is logged and the setting is ignored. Request parameters now prefixed with request.parameters. v2: The v2 agent collects request parameters, such as route parameters (/users/:userId) and query parameters (/users?userId=123), as the parameter name (userId). v3: The v3 agent prefixes all request parameters with the string request.parameters.. For example,userId appears as request.parameters.userId. Troubleshooting tips: If you have dashboards, alert policies, or other NRQL queries based on request parameters, update them with the new parameter names. Feature flags as of v3 As of New Relic Node.js agent v3, the send_request_uri_attribute feature is no longer configurable. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 2 Before upgrading to Node.js agent v2, review this information for major changes. Also see New Relic's Node.js v2 migration guide on GitHub. Major changes with Node.js v2 agent Major changes with Node.js v2 agent Comments Reversed naming and ignore rules v1: With the v1 agent, rules defined in the config properties rules.name and rules.ignore were applied in reverse order; the first rule in the list was applied last. v2: Node.js agent v2 applies rules in the order they are defined, so the first rule in the list is applied first. Troubleshooting tips: If you used naming rules in the v1 agent and notice problems, reverse the order of your rules in your configuration. De-duplicated HTTP request transactions v1: The v1 agent started a new transaction for each listener on an HTTP server's request event. In applications with multiple listeners on the request event, this resulted in extraneous transactions being created that almost always did not get named correctly. v2: The v2 agent only creates a single transaction for each request event emitted. Troubleshooting tips: If you used multiple request event listeners and added a call to newrelic.ignoreTransaction() to remove the extra transactions, remove those calls. Stopped swallowing outbound request errors v1: The v1 agent swallowed unhandled error events emitted by outbound HTTP request objects. v2: The v2 agent removes this behavior. Instead, the v2 agent does not change normal Node execution. This means the error event will always be emitted. Troubleshooting tips: If you are making outbound requests and currently do not listen for the error event, add a listener and handle the error as appropriate for your application. Updated configuration options as of v2 In newrelic.js, edit the Node.js agent configuration properties you use for compatiblity with the latest versions: Deprecated property New property capture_params attributes.enabled: false By default, request attributes are not sent to New Relic. Set attributes.enabled: true to include agent-defined or custom attributes in traces. The capture_params property has been deprecated. ignored_params attributes.exclude: [] Add any request attribute keys to the attributes.exclude list. Now, instead of having to be an exact match, wildcards (*) may be appended to each item for broader filtering. The ignored_params property has been deprecated. These Node.js agent configuration properties also have overrides for specific destinations, including: transaction_tracer transaction_events error_collector browser_monitoring For example, if the root attributes.enabled is true and you set transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled: false, this will restrict attributes from being collected in transaction traces, while still allowing them for all others. Deprecated API methods as of v2 The following methods from the Node.js agent have been deprecated, and New Relic has deleted them in v5 of the agent. Each has an easy replacement that accomplishes the same task in a more flexible and reliable way. newrelic.createWebTransaction() Replace with newrelic.startWebTransaction() and newrelic.getTransaction(). newrelic.createBackgroundTransaction() Replace with newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction() and newrelic.getTransaction(). newrelic.addCustomParameter() Replace with newrelic.addCustomAttribute(). newrelic.addCustomParameters() Replace with newrelic.addCustomAttributes(). New v2 agent API methods The following API methods are new with the New Relic Node.js v2 agent. newrelic.getTransaction() This method gets a reference to the currently running transaction. Use in conjunction with: newrelic.startWebTransaction newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction Callback-based message consumer services for troubleshooting message consumers newrelic.startWebTransaction()newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction() These new API methods replace the older create*Transaction methods. They are easier to use and seamlessly work with promises. Unlike the v1 method, the provided callback is invoked immediately. newrelic.instrument()newrelic.instrumentDatastore()newrelic.instrumentWebframework()newrelic.instrumentMessages() Use these methods to add custom instrumentation for third party modules, including those already instrumented by the New Relic Node.js agent. For more information, see New Relic's Node.js instrumentation tutorials on GitHub. newrelic.addCustomAttribute() Use this method to add a custom trace attribute. newrelic.addCustomAttributes() Use this method to add multiple custom trace attributes. Node version support for v2 The earliest version of Node supported by the New Relic Node.js v2 agent is 0.10. Node 0.8, which has not been updated since July of 2014, is not supported by v2. Customers running Node 0.8 have two options: Upgrade to a supported version of Node and take advantage of the New Relic Node.js v2 agent's new features. Remain on New Relic Node.js v1 agent without the ability to use new features only available with updated agent versions. Node 0.10 also no longer receives updates, but New Relic will continue to support this version of Node for the time being. Recommendation: Upgrade to a newer version of Node as soon as possible. npm version support as of v2 The New Relic Node.js agent now requires npm version 2.0.0 or higher. This version of npm comes packaged with Node 0.10.44 or higher.

      "body": "New Relic offers several tools to help obtain the information needed to provide useful metrics about your Node.js application. These include: Reading the route names (if used) from the Express and Restify routers Using the API to name the current request, either with simple names or groups of controllers with actions Support rules that are stored in your agent's configuration that can mark requests to be renamed or ignored based on regular expressions matched against the request's raw URLs (also available as API calls) The number of names that New Relic tracks needs to be small enough so that the user experience is robust. It also needs to be large enough to provide the right amount of information (without overwhelming you with data) so that you can identify problem spots in your applications more easily. For more information, see the Node.js agent configuration documentation and the Node.js agent API documentation on Github. Request names The Node.js agent captures the HTTP method along with a potentially parameterized path (such as /user/:id) or a regular expression (such as /^/user/([-0-9a-f]+)$/). These pieces of information become part of the request name. If you have support for slow transaction traces and have enabled capture_params in your config file, the transaction trace will also have the request's parameters and their values attached to it. If you are dissatisfied with the request names that the Node.js agent uses, you can use API calls to create more descriptive names. Tip If grouping your requests under the generic name, then /* is sufficient, and you do not need to customize your configuration file or API calls. Requirements New Relic uses request names to group requests for many charts and tables. The value of these visualizations will drop as the number of different request names increases. For example, do not include potentially dynamic data like GUIDs, numerical IDs, or timestamps in the request names you create. If your request is slow enough to generate a transaction trace, that trace will contain the original URL. If you enable parameter capture, the parameters will also be attached to the trace. Tip Avoid having more than 50 different transaction names. For example, if you have more than a couple hundred different request names, rethink your naming strategy. Avoid metric grouping issues The request naming API helps New Relic avoid problems with trying to handle too many metrics, which sometimes is referred to as \"metric explosion.\" New Relic has several strategies to deal with these issues; the most severe is simply to add offending applications to your deny list. The main reason for you to be careful in using these request-naming tools is to prevent that from happening to your applications. For more information, see Metric grouping issues. Guidelines Define your configuration rules from the most specific to the most general. The first rules listed in your config file or added with the Node.js transaction naming API will be applied first and should be narrowly targeted. More general \"fall-through\" rules should be added toward the end of the list, because they will be evaluated in the order they were configured or added using the Node.js transaction naming API. URL pattern matching An online retailer has a URL pattern like this: /user/customers/all/prospects /user/customers/all/current /user/customers/all/returning /user/customers/John /user/customers/Jane Copy The retailer could create rules like this: // newrelic.js exports.config={ //other configuration rules:{ name:[ { pattern: \"/user/customers/all/prospects/\", name: \"/user/customers/all/prospects\" }, { pattern: \"/user/customers/all/.*\", name: \"/user/customers/all\" }, { pattern: \"/user/customers/.*\", name: \"/user/customers/:customer\" } ] } } Copy With these rules, the retailer would create three transaction names: /user/customers/:customer /user/customers/all /user/customers/all/prospects If the retailer reversed the order, the rules would catch all transactions in :customer, which would not be as useful. Load the request naming API Make sure that loading the New Relic module is the first thing your application does, as it needs to bootstrap itself before the rest of your application loads: var newrelic = require('newrelic'); Copy This returns the request naming API. You can safely require the module from multiple modules in your application, as it only initializes itself once. Request API calls Here is a summary of the Request API calls for New Relic's Node.js agent. newrelic.setTransactionName(name) newrelic.setTransactionName(name) Copy Name the current request, following the request naming requirements. You can call this function anywhere within the context of an HTTP request handler, at any time after handling of the request has started, but before the request has finished. In general, if the request and response objects are in scope, you can set the name. Explicitly calling newrelic.setTransactionName() will override any names set by Express or Restify routes. Also, calls to newrelic.setTransactionName() and newrelic.setControllerName() will overwrite each other. The last one to run before the request ends wins. newrelic.setControllerName(name, \\[action]) newrelic.setControllerName(name, \\[action]) Copy Name the current request using a controller-style pattern, optionally including the current controller action. If the action is omitted, New Relic will include the HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.) as the action. The rules for when you can call newrelic.setControllerName() are the same as they are for newrelic.setTransactionName(), including the request naming requirements. Explicitly calling newrelic.setControllerName() will override any names set by Express or Restify routes. Also, calls to newrelic.setTransactionName() and newrelic.setControllerName() will overwrite each other. The last one to run before the request ends wins. Custom instrumentation API calls Use these API calls to expand your instrumentation with custom instrumentation. newrelic.instrument(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) newrelic.instrument(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) Copy Sets an instrumentation callback for a specific module. The provided onRequire callback will be fired when the given module is loaded with require. The moduleName parameter should be the string that will be passed to require; for example, 'express' or 'amqplib/callback_api'. The optional onError callback is called if the onRequire parameters throws an error. This is useful for debugging your instrumentation. Use this method to: Add instrumentation for modules not currently instrumented by New Relic. Instrument your own code. Replace the Node.js agent's built-in instrumentation with your own. For more information, see New Relic's Node.js instrumentation tutorial on Github. newrelic.instrumentDatastore(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) newrelic.instrumentDatastore(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) Copy Sets an instrumentation callback for a datastore module. This method is just like newrelic.instrument(), except it provides a datastore-specialized shim. For more information, see New Relic's Node.js datastore instrumentation tutorial on Github. newrelic.instrumentLoadedModule(moduleName, moduleInstance) newrelic.instrumentLoadedModule(moduleName, moduleInstance) Copy The instrumentLoadedModule method allows you to add stock instrumentation to specific modules in situations where it's impossible to have require('newrelic'); as the first line of your app's main module. // load the agent const newrelic = require('newrelic') // module loaded before newrelic const expressModule = require('express') // instrument express _after_ the agent has been loaded newrelic.instrumentLoadedModule( 'express', // the module's name, as a string expressModule // the module instance ); Copy Important This method cannot instrument any arbitrary module. Its purpose is to add modules that were missed because the agent was not loaded as the first thing in your program. The instrumentLoadedModule method can only instrument modules the agent would normally instrument. You can see a list of these modules in the agent's lib/instrumentations module. newrelic.instrumentMessages(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) newrelic.instrumentMessages(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) Copy Sets an instrumentation callback for a message service client module. This method is just like newrelic.instrument(), except it provides a message-service-specialized shim. For more information, see New Relic's Node.js message service instrumentation tutorial on Github. newrelic.instrumentWebframework(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) newrelic.instrumentWebframework(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) Copy Sets an instrumentation callback for a web framework module. This method is just like newrelic.instrument(), except it provides a web-framework-specialized shim. For more information, see New Relic's Node.js web framework instrumentation tutorial on Github. newrelic.startWebTransaction(url, handle) newrelic.startWebTransaction(url, handle) Copy Instrument the specified web transaction. Using this API call, you can instrument transactions that New Relic does not automatically detect. The url defines the transaction name and needs to be static. Do not include variable data such as user ID. The handle defines the function you want to instrument. New Relic will capture any metrics that would be captured by auto-instrumentation, as well as manual instrumentation via startSegment(). You must handle custom transactions manually by calling newrelic.getTransaction() at the start of your transaction, and then call transaction.end() when you are finished. New Relic begins timing the transaction when newrelic.startWebTransaction() is called and ends the transaction when transaction.end() is called. You can also return a promise to indicate the end of the transaction. Please note that if this promise rejects, it does not automatically hook into New Relic’s error tracking. This needs to be done manually with noticeError(). newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction(name, \\[group], handle) newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction(name, \\[group], handle) Copy Instrument the specified background transaction. Using this API call, you can expand New Relic's instrumentation to capture data from background transactions. The name defines the transaction name and needs to be static. Do not include variable data such as user ID. The group is optional, and it allows you to group similar jobs together via the transaction type in the user interface. Like name, the group needs to be static. The handle defines a function that includes the entire background job you want to instrument. New Relic will capture any metrics that would be captured by auto-instrumentation, as well as manual instrumentation via startSegment(). You must handle custom transactions manually by calling newrelic.getTransaction() at the start of your transaction, and then call transaction.end() when you are finished. New Relic begins timing the transaction when newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction() is called and ends the transaction when transaction.end() is called. You can also return a promise to indicate the end of the transaction. Please note that if this promise rejects, it does not automatically hook into New Relic’s error tracking. This needs to be done manually with noticeError(). newrelic.getTransaction() newrelic.getTransaction() Copy Returns a handle on the currently executing transaction. This handle can then be used to interact with a given transaction safely from any context. It is best used with newrelic.startWebTransaction() and newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction(). Please refer to the transaction handle section for more details. newrelic.endTransaction() newrelic.endTransaction() Copy End the current web or background custom transaction. This method requires being in the correct transaction context when called. This API call takes no arguments. newrelic.startSegment(name, record, handler, callback) newrelic.startSegment(name, record, handler, callback) Copy Instrument a particular method to improve visibility into a transaction, or optionally turn it into a metric. The name defines a name for the segment. This name will be visible in transaction traces and as a new metric in the New Relic UI. The record flag defines whether the segment should be recorded as a metric. The handler is the function you want to track as a segment. The optional callback is a function passed to the handler to fire after its work is done. The agent begins timing the segment when startSegment is called. The segment is ended when either the handler finishes executing, or callback is fired, if it is provided. Custom metrics API calls Use these API calls to record additional arbitrary metrics: newrelic.recordMetric(name, value) newrelic.recordMetric(name, value) Copy Use recordMetric to record an event-based metric, usually associated with a particular duration. The name must be a string following standard metric naming rules. The value will usually be a number, but it can also be an object. When value is a numeric value, it should represent the magnitude of a measurement associated with an event; for example, the duration for a particular method call. When value is an object, it must contain count, total, min, max, and sumOfSquares keys, all with number values. This form is useful to aggregate metrics on your own and report them periodically; for example, from a setInterval. These values will be aggregated with any previously collected values for the same metric. The names of these keys match the names of the keys used by the platform API. newrelic.incrementMetric(name, \\[amount]) newrelic.incrementMetric(name, \\[amount]) Copy Use incrementMetric to update a metric that acts as a simple counter. The count of the selected metric will be incremented by the specified amount, defaulting to 1. Custom events API calls Use these API calls to record additional events: newrelic.recordCustomEvent(eventType, attributes) newrelic.recordCustomEvent(eventType, attributes) Copy Use recordCustomEvent to record an event-based metric, usually associated with a particular duration. The eventType must be an alphanumeric string less than 255 characters. The attributes must be an object of key and value pairs. The keys must be shorter than 255 characters, and the values must be string, number, or boolean. Recording a custom event The following example demonstrates recording a custom event with multiple attributes. const attributes = { attribute1: 'value1', attribute2: 2 } newrelic.recordCustomEvent('MessagingEvent', attributes) Copy Transaction handle methods This section details the methods provided by the TransactionHandle class instance that can be obtained through newrelic.getTransaction(). Use these methods to interact directly with the current transaction: transactionHandle.end(\\[callback]) transactionHandle.end(\\[callback]) Copy Use transactionHandle.end to end the transaction referenced by the handle instance. The callback is invoked when the transaction has fully ended. The finished transaction passed to the callback as the first argument. transactionHandle.ignore() transactionHandle.ignore() Copy Use transactionHandle.ignore to ignore the transaction referenced by the handle instance. transactionHandle.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(headers) transactionHandle.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(headers) Copy Important This API requires distributed tracing to be enabled. For context on how to use this call and its partner call acceptDistributedTraceHeaders, first read Enable distributed tracing with agent APIs. transactionHandle.insertDistributedTraceHeaders is used to implement distributed tracing. It modifies the headers map that is passed in by adding W3C Trace Context headers and New Relic Distributed Trace headers. The New Relic headers can be disabled with distributed_tracing.exclude_newrelic_header: true in the config. This method replaces the deprecated createDistributedTracePayload method, which only creates New Relic Distributed Trace payloads. Generating distributed trace headers In the following example, by calling insertDistributedTraceHeaders with an empty object, the appropriate Distributed Trace headers and W3C Trace Context headers will be generated for the transaction. // Call newrelic.getTransaction to retrieve a handle on the current transaction. const transactionHandle = newrelic.getTransaction() // This could be a header object from an incoming request as well const headersObject = {} newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction('background task', function executeTransaction() { const transaction = newrelic.getTransaction() // generate the headers transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(headersObject) }) Copy transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(transportType, headers) transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(transportType, headers) Copy Important This API requires distributed tracing to be enabled. For context on how to use this call and its partner call insertDistributedTraceHeaders, first read Enable distributed tracing with agent APIs. transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders is used to instrument the called service for inclusion in a distributed trace. It links the spans in a trace by accepting a payload generated by insertDistributedTraceHeaders or generated by some other W3C Trace Context compliant tracer. This method accepts the headers of an incoming request, looks for W3C Trace Context headers, and if not found, falls back to New Relic distributed trace headers. This method replaces the deprecated (and now removed as of version 7.0.0) acceptDistributedTracePayload method, which only handles New Relic distributed trace payloads. transportType should be one of the following strings: AMQP HTTP HTTPS IronMQ JMS Kafka Other Queue Unknown headers should be an object containing all the headers in the incoming request. The keys must be lowercase. Accept incoming distributed trace headers The following example demonstrates adding distributed trace headers retrieved from a Kafka message. In this example, we assume that the incoming Kafka message has Distributed Trace headers inserted. // incoming Kafka message headers const headersObject = message.headers // Call newrelic.getTransaction to retrieve a handle on the current transaction. const transactionHandle = newrelic.getTransaction() newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction('background task', function executeTransaction() { const transaction = newrelic.getTransaction() // accept the headers transaction.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders('Kafka', headersObject) }) Copy transactionHandle.createDistributedTracePayload() transactionHandle.createDistributedTracePayload() Copy Caution This method is deprecated and was removed in version 7.0.0! Please use insertDistributedTraceHeaders. Important This API requires distributed tracing to be enabled. For instructions on how to use this call, along with its partner call acceptDistributedTracePayload, see Enable distributed tracing with agent APIs. This call is used to implement distributed tracing. It generates a payload that is read by the receiving application with acceptDistributedTracePayload. Important Note: In order to maintain proper ordering of spans in a trace, you must generate the payload in the context of the span that sends it. The DistributedTracePayload object has two available methods used for generating the payload in different formats: DistributedTracePayload#text: returns a JSON representation of the payload. Link a nested background transaction // Call newrelic.getTransaction to retrieve a handle on the current transaction. var transactionHandle = newrelic.getTransaction() var payload = transactionHandle.createDistributedTracePayload() var jsonPayload = payload.text() newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction('background task', function executeTransaction() { var backgroundHandle = newrelic.getTransaction() // Link the nested transaction by accepting the payload with the background transaction's handle backgroundHandle.acceptDistributedTracePayload(jsonPayload) }) Copy DistributedTracePayload#httpSafe: returns a base64 encoded JSON representation of the payload. Place payload on an outgoing request // Call newrelic.getTransaction to retrieve a handle on the current transaction. var transactionHandle = newrelic.getTransaction() var payload = transactionHandle.createDistributedTracePayload() // Place the base64 encoded value on an outbound request header. req.headers[myTracingHeader] = payload.httpSafe() Copy transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTracePayload(payload) transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTracePayload(payload) Copy Caution This method is deprecated and was removed in version 7.0.0! Please use acceptDistributedTraceHeaders. Important This API requires distributed tracing to be enabled. For context on how to use this call and its partner call createDistributedTracePayload, first read Enable distributed tracing with agent APIs. transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTracePayload is used to instrument the called service for inclusion in a distributed trace. It links the spans in a trace by accepting the payload generated by createDistributedTracePayload. transactionHandle.isSampled() transactionHandle.isSampled() Copy Returns whether this trace is being sampled. Other API calls New Relic's Node.js agent includes additional API calls. newrelic.addCustomAttribute(name, value) newrelic.addCustomAttribute(name, value) Copy Set a custom attribute value to be displayed along with the transaction trace in the New Relic UI. This must be called within the context of a transaction so it has a place to set the custom attributes. Custom attributes will appear in New Relic APM's transaction trace detail view and in errors for the transaction. Add custom attribute newrelic.addCustomAttribute('attribute1', 'value1') Copy Caution If you want to use your custom attributes, avoid using any of the reserved terms used by NRQL when naming them. newrelic.addCustomAttributes(attributes) newrelic.addCustomAttributes(attributes) Copy Set multiple custom attribute values to be displayed along with the transaction trace in the New Relic UI. The attributes should be passed as a single object. This must be called within the context of a transaction so it has a place to set the custom attributes. Custom attributes will appear in the transaction trace detail view and in errors for the transaction. Adding custom attributes const attributes = { attribute1: 'value1', attribute2: 2 } newrelic.addCustomAttributes(attributes) Copy Caution If you want to use your custom attributes, avoid using any of the reserved terms used by NRQL when naming them. newrelic.addCustomSpanAttribute(name, value) newrelic.addCustomSpanAttribute(name, value) Copy Set a custom span attribute value to be displayed along with a transaction trace span in the New Relic UI. This must be called within the context of an active segment/span so it has a place to set the custom span attributes. Custom span attributes will appear in the Attributes section of the span detail view. Add custom span attribute newrelic.addCustomSpanAttribute('attribute1', 'value') Copy Important This API requires distributed tracing and span events to be enabled. Caution If you want to use your custom span attributes, avoid using any of the reserved terms used by NRQL when naming them. newrelic.addCustomSpanAttributes(attributes) newrelic.addCustomSpanAttributes(attributes) Copy Set multiple custom span attribute values to be displayed along with the transaction trace spans in the New Relic UI. The attributes should be passed as a single object. This must be called within the context of an active segment/span so it has a place to set the custom span attributes. Custom span attributes will appear in the Attributes section of the span detail view. Add custom span attributes const attributes = { attribute1: 'value1', attribute2: 'value2' } newrelic.addCustomSpanAttributes(attributes) Copy Important This API requires distributed tracing and span events to be enabled. Caution If you want to use your custom span attributes, avoid using any of the reserved terms used by NRQL when naming them. newrelic.getBrowserTimingHeader() newrelic.getBrowserTimingHeader() Copy Returns the HTML snippet to be inserted into the header of HTML pages to enable browser monitoring. The HTML will instruct the browser to fetch a small JavaScript file and start the page timer. newrelic.setIgnoreTransaction(ignored) newrelic.setIgnoreTransaction(ignored) Copy Tell the module whether or not to ignore a given request. This allows you to explicitly filter long-polling, irrelevant routes or requests you know will be time-consuming. This also allows you to gather metrics for requests that otherwise would be ignored. To ignore the transaction, set the parameter to true will ignore the transaction. To prevent a transaction from being ignored with this function, pass the parameter false. Passing null or undefined will not change whether the transaction is ignored. Caution This method is deprecated and was removed in version 7.0.0. Please use transactionHandle.ignore() newrelic.noticeError(error, \\[customParameters]) newrelic.noticeError(error, \\[customParameters]) Copy Use this call if your app is doing its own error handling with domains or try/catch clauses, but you want all of the information about how many errors are coming out of the app to be centrally managed. Unlike other Node.js calls, this can be used outside of route handlers, but it will have additional context if called from within transaction scope. Caution Errors recorded using this method do not obey the ignore_status_codes configuration value. newrelic.shutdown(\\[options], callback) newrelic.shutdown(\\[options], callback) Copy Use this method to gracefully shut down the agent. options options.collectPendingData - type boolean - Tell the agent whether to send any pending data to the New Relic collector before shutting down. options.timeout - type number (ms) - The default time before forcing a shutdown. When collectPendingData is true, the agent will wait for a connection before shutting down. This timeout is useful for short lived processes, like AWS Lambda, in order to keep the process from staying open too long, while trying to connect. Example: newrelic.shutdown({collectPendingData: true, timeout: 3000}, (error) => { process.exit() }) Copy newrelic.getLinkingMetadata() newrelic.getLinkingMetadata() Copy Returns key/value pairs which can be used to link traces or entities. It will only contain items with meaningful values. For instance, if distributed tracing is disabled, trace.id will not be included. newrelic.getTraceMetadata() newrelic.getTraceMetadata() Copy Returns and object containing the current trace ID and span ID. Important This API requires distributed tracing to be enabled or an empty object will be returned. Rules for naming and ignoring requests If you do not want to put calls to the New Relic module directly into your application code, you can use pattern-based rules to name requests. There are two sets of rules: one for renaming requests, and one to mark requests to be ignored by New Relic's instrumentation. Here is the structure for rules in New Relic's Node.js agent. rules.name A list of rules of the format {pattern : \"pattern\", name : \"name\"} for matching incoming request URLs to pattern and naming the matching New Relic transaction's name. This acts as a regex replace, where you can set the pattern either as a string, or as a JavaScript regular expression literal, and both pattern and name are required. When passing a regex as a string, escape backslashes, as the agent does not keep them when given as a string in a pattern. Define your configuration rules from the most specific to the most general, as the patterns will be evaluated in order and are terminal in nature. For more information, see the naming guidelines. This can also be set with the environment variable NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES, with multiple rules passed in as a list of comma-delimited JSON object literals: NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES='{\"pattern\":\"^t\",\"name\":\"u\"},{\"pattern\":\"^u\",\"name\":\"t\"}' Copy Optional rules attributes [#optional-rules] Additional optional attributes are available: Optional rules attributes Description terminate_chain Default: true When set to true (default), no further rules will be evaluated if this rule is a match. Setting this to false is useful when multiple rules should be used together. For example, one rule could be replacing a common pattern in many different URLs, while subsequent rule(s) would be more specific. replace_all Default: false When set to true, all matches of the pattern will be replaced. Otherwise, only the first match will be replaced. Using the g flag with regular expression literal will have the same effect. For example: pattern: '[0-9]+', replace_all: true Copy This has the same effect as pattern: /[0-9]+/g. precedence By default the rules are evaluated in order, from first to last. If you prefer to have complete control over the order, you can give each rule a precedence attribute. The precedence is an integer number, and rules are evaluated in ascending order. If precedence is not explicitly defined, it will be set to 500 by default. Additional attributes are ignored. Testing your naming rules [#testing-rules] The Node.js agent comes with a command-line tool for testing naming rules. For more information, run the following command in terminal window in a directory where your app is installed: node node_modules/.bin/newrelic-naming-rules Copy Naming rule examples [#examples-rules] Here are some examples of naming rules and the results. Match full URL pattern: \"^/items/[0-9]+$\", name: \"/items/:id\" Copy will result in: /items/123 => /items/:id /orders/123 => /orders/123 (not replaced since the rule is a full match) Copy Replace first match in URL pattern: \"[0-9]+\", name: \":id\" Copy will result in: /orders/123 => /orders/:id /items/123 => /items/:id /orders/123/items/123 => /orders/:id/items/123 Copy Replace all matches in any URL pattern: \"[0-9]+\", name: \":id\", replace_all: true Copy will result in: /orders/123/items/123 => /orders/:id/items/:id Copy Match group references Using regular expression match group references: pattern: '^/(items|orders)/[0-9]+$', name: '/\\\\1/:id' Copy will result in: /orders/123 => /orders/:id /items/123 => /items/:id Copy rules.ignore This can also be set via the environment variable NEW_RELIC_IGNORING_RULES, with multiple rules passed in as a list of comma-delimited patterns. Currently there is no way to escape commas in patterns. NEW_RELIC_IGNORING_RULES='^/socket\\.io/\\*/xhr-polling,ignore_me' Copy Here are full examples of how rules are included in the configuration file: Naming rule example // newrelic.js exports.config = { // other configuration rules : { name : [ { pattern: \"/tables/name-here\", name: \"/name-hererule1\" } ] } Copy Ignoring rule example If you are using socket.io, you will have a use case for ignoring rules right out of the box. To keep socket.io long-polling from dominating your response-time metrics and affecting the Apdex metrics for your application, add a rule such as: // newrelic.js exports.config = { // other configuration rules : { ignore : [ '^\\/socket\\.io\\/.*\\/xhr-polling' ] } }; Copy API calls for rules Here are the API calls for naming and ignoring rules with New Relic's Node.js agent. newrelic.addNamingRule(pattern, name) Programmatic version of rules.name. Once naming rules are added, they cannot be removed until the Node process is restarted. They can also be added via the Node.js agent's configuration. Both parameters are required. newrelic.addIgnoringRule(pattern) Programmatic version of rules.ignore. Once ignoring rules are added, they cannot be removed until the Node process is restarted. They can also be added via the Node.js agent's configuration. This parameter is required.",

Before you install the Node.js agent, make sure your application meets the following system requirements. Node.js version support Tip For best performance, use the latest active long term support (LTS) version of Node.js. Support for new Node.js releases We will support the latest even versions of Node.js releases by the beginning of the following active long term support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Node.js version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Node.js agent with support 16 October 2021 April-October 2021 End of support for Node.js releases reaching EOL When support for a new long term support agent version is made available, support for the Node.js agent version that reaches end-of-life during the same time period will simultaneously drop. The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Node.js version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Node.js agent dropping support 12 April 2022 April-October 2022 10 April 2021 As of July 31, 2021, we're discontinuing support for Node.js 10. For more details, including how you can easily prepare for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. Node.js 12 errors For Node.js 12, the following change affects the Node.js agent: Errors resulting in unhandled rejections are not scoped to the transaction that was active when the rejected promise was created. This is because the promise responsible for triggering the init async hook is no longer passed through on the promise wrap instance. This breaks the linkage that associates a given promise rejection with the transaction it was scheduled in. Supported Node.js frameworks Express 4.6.0 or higher Restify Connect v1 and v2 (router not supported) Hapi Koa 2.0.0 or higher (external module loaded with the agent) If you are using a supported framework with default routers, the Node.js agent can read these frameworks' route names as-is. However, if you want more specific names than are provided by your framework, you may want to use one or more of the tools New Relic provides with the Node.js transaction naming API. Operating systems Linux SmartOS macOS 10.7 and higher Windows Server 2008 and higher Datastores The Node.js agent monitors the performance of Node.js application calls to these datastores: Cassandra Memcached MongoDB MySQL (via mysql and mysql2 packages) Redis Postgres (including the native and pure JavaScript packages) Instance details We collect instance details for a variety of databases and database drivers. The ability to view specific instances and the types of database information in APM depends on your agent version. New Relic's Node.js agent version 1.31.0 or higher supports the following: Database npm module name Minimum module version Minimum agent version PostgreSQL pg 4.0.0 1.31.0 Redis redis 2.0.0 1.31.0 MongoDB mongodb 2.1.0 1.32.0 MySQL mysql 2.4.1 1.32.0 Memcached memcached 1.0.0 1.33.0 To request instance-level information from datastores currently not listed for your New Relic agent, get support at support.newrelic.com. Messages queues Message queue instrumentation is only available with the New Relic Node.js agent v2 or higher. Currently supported message queue instrumentation: amqplib For other message queue libraries, use custom instrumentation. Hosting services Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment AWS EC2 Microsoft Azure Heroku Process managers In general, process managers that handle starting, stopping, and restarting of Node.js (like Forever) should be compatible with the Node.js agent. If you are using PM2, the minimum supported version of PM2 is 2.0. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Connect the agent to other New Relic features The Node.js agent integrates with other features to give you full-stack observability: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Node.js agent automatically injects the browser monitoring agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser monitoring injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Node.js agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in infrastructure monitoring. New Relic dashboards The Node.js agent sends default events and attributes for NRQL queries. You can also record custom events for advanced analysis.

What you need In addition to the Compatibility and requirements for the Node.js agent, this tutorial assumes you have a working installation of Node.js and the Windows Azure SDK for Node.js for your platform: Install the Azure SDK for Node.js. Ensure Git is installed. Installing the Node.js agent To add the New Relic Node.js agent to your Azure application: In your app's root, verify that there is a package.json file. If there is not, create one via the command line: touch package.json Copy Add the following to your package.json file: { \"name\": \"node\", \"version\": \"0.0.1\", \"dependencies\" : { \"newrelic\" : \"*\" }, \"engine\": { \"node\": \"10.18\" } } Copy Add require('newrelic'); to the top of the server.js file. For example: require('newrelic'); var http = require('http') var port = process.env.PORT || 1337; http.createServer(function(req, res) { res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' }); res.end('Hello New Relic Node.js agent!\\n'); }).listen(port); Copy Adding app settings in Azure After installation, you must configure your app in Azure Web Apps: Sign in to portal.azure.com. Select App Services > (select a Node.js app) > Configure. Add the following to the app settings: new_relic_app_name: Your Windows Azure website name new_relic_license_key: Your New Relic license key Save your settings. Restart your Node.js app. Generate some traffic to your app and wait a few minutes. After waiting, see your data by going to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select your app). Optional: Adding app settings with the CLI Optional: Here is an example of how to add the app settings by using the CLI (Node SDK): azure account download \"YOUR_SUBSCRIPTION_NAME\" azure account import \"PATH_TO_PUBLISH_SETTINGS_FILE\" azure site config add \"new_relic_app_name=REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_APP_NAME\" azure site config add \"new_relic_license_key=REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" azure site restart AZURE_WEB_APP_NAME Copy Using environment variables If your agent runs in PaaS environments such as Heroku or Azure Web Apps, all of the configuration variables in newrelic.js have counterparts that can be set as environment variables. You can freely mix and match variables in the configuration file. Environment variables override your configuration file settings. For example, as a convenience to Azure users, the agent will use APP_POOL_ID as the application name (NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME) if it's set, so you can use the name you chose without setting it twice. For more information, see Configuring Node.js with environment variables.

What you need In addition to the Compatibility and requirements for the Node.js agent, this tutorial assumes you have a working installation of Node.js and the Windows Azure SDK for Node.js for your platform: Install the Azure SDK for Node.js. Ensure Git is installed. Installing the Node.js agent To add the New Relic Node.js agent to your Azure application: In your app's root, verify that there is a package.json file. If there is not, create one via the command line: touch package.json Copy Add the following to your package.json file: { \"name\": \"node\", \"version\": \"0.0.1\", \"dependencies\" : { \"newrelic\" : \"*\" }, \"engine\": { \"node\": \"10.18\" } } Copy Add require('newrelic'); to the top of the server.js file. For example: require('newrelic'); var http = require('http') var port = process.env.PORT || 1337; http.createServer(function(req, res) { res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' }); res.end('Hello New Relic Node.js agent!\\n'); }).listen(port); Copy Adding app settings in Azure After installation, you must configure your app in Azure Web Apps: Sign in to portal.azure.com. Select App Services > (select a Node.js app) > Configure. Add the following to the app settings: new_relic_app_name: Your Windows Azure website name new_relic_license_key: Your New Relic license key Save your settings. Restart your Node.js app. Generate some traffic to your app and wait a few minutes. After waiting, see your data by going to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select your app). Optional: Adding app settings with the CLI Optional: Here is an example of how to add the app settings by using the CLI (Node SDK): azure account download \"YOUR_SUBSCRIPTION_NAME\" azure account import \"PATH_TO_PUBLISH_SETTINGS_FILE\" azure site config add \"new_relic_app_name=REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_APP_NAME\" azure site config add \"new_relic_license_key=REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" azure site restart AZURE_WEB_APP_NAME Copy Using environment variables If your agent runs in PaaS environments such as Heroku or Azure Web Apps, all of the configuration variables in newrelic.js have counterparts that can be set as environment variables. You can freely mix and match variables in the configuration file. Environment variables override your configuration file settings. For example, as a convenience to Azure users, the agent will use APP_POOL_ID as the application name (NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME) if it's set, so you can use the name you chose without setting it twice. For more information, see Configuring Node.js with environment variables.

      "body": "With New Relic's Node.js agent, you can monitor applications that reside in the Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment. Adding New Relic to your GAE flex app gives you insight into the health and performance of your app and extends GAE with metrics you can view in APM and browser monitoring. This document explains how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app using either of these methods: Google App Engine's \"native mode\" installation with a standard GAE runtime Docker installation using a custom runtime Use native deploy To use Google App Engine's \"native mode\" installation with your Node.js app: Follow standard procedures to install New Relic's Node.js agent, including your license key. Be sure to save the newrelic module to the package.json file. Follow Google App Engine procedures for Node.js to create a new Cloud Platform project, create an App Engine application, and complete other prerequisites for the Google Cloud SDK. Optional: Set environment variables to configure the Node.js agent's GAE app.yaml file. Use the Google Cloud SDK's gcloud command line tool to deploy GAE apps. To deploy your Node.js app to your initialized GAE flexible environment, run the following command: gcloud --project new-relic-apm-nodejs app deploy Copy Google App Engine automatically includes your Node.js app's newrelic.js configuration file in the deployed package. Wait until the deployment completes, then view your GAE flex app data in the APM Summary page. Build a custom runtime See Google's documentation for building custom runtimes. This example describes how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app by building a custom runtime for Docker. You can deploy the app without any special configuration. For more information about deploying and configuring your Node.js app in the GAE flexible environment, see: Google App Engine's documentation for Node.js Google App Engine's tutorial to deploy a Node.js app 1. Set up the GAE project and install dependencies Follow standard procedures to install New Relic's Node.js agent, including your license key. Be sure to save the newrelic module to the package.json file. Follow Google App Engine procedures for Node.js to create a new Cloud Platform project, create an App Engine application, and complete other prerequisites for the Google Cloud SDK. The Google Cloud SDK provides the gcloud command line tool to manage and deploy GAE apps. 2. Configure your app.yaml The app.yaml configuration file is required for a GAE flexible environment app with a custom runtime. At a minimum, make sure it contains: runtime: custom env: flex Copy Optional: Set environment variables. 3. Configure and deploy The Dockerfile defines the Docker image to be built and is required for a GAE flexible environment app. To create the Dockerfile, build the container, and deploy your app, follow the GAE procedures for Node.js. Wait until the deployment completes. To view your GAE flex app data in New Relic, go to the APM Summary page. Optional: Disable health checks Google App Engine sends periodic health check requests to confirm that an instance has been successfully deployed, and to check that a running instance maintains a healthy status. A health check is an HTTP request to the URL /_ah/health. If you create a custom runtime, your app must be able to handle a large number of health check requests. Otherwise, your app data may not display correctly in New Relic APM. If you notice performance issues, disable GAE health checks. In your app.yaml, add: health_check: enable_health_check: False Copy Get New Relic agent troubleshooting logs from GAE Use these resources to troubleshoot your GAE flex environment app: To connect to the GAE instance and start a shell in the Docker container running your code, see Debugging an instance. To redirect New Relic Node.js agent logs to Stackdriver in the Cloud Platform Console, change the newrelic.js configuration file to: log_file_name: STDOUT Copy To view the logs, use the Cloud Platform Console's Log Viewer.",

Before you install the Node.js agent, make sure your application meets the following system requirements. Node.js version support Tip For best performance, use the latest active long term support (LTS) version of Node.js. Support for new Node.js releases We will support the latest even versions of Node.js releases by the beginning of the following active long term support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Node.js version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Node.js agent with support 16 October 2021 April-October 2021 End of support for Node.js releases reaching EOL When support for a new long term support agent version is made available, support for the Node.js agent version that reaches end-of-life during the same time period will simultaneously drop. The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Node.js version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Node.js agent dropping support 12 April 2022 April-October 2022 10 April 2021 As of July 31, 2021, we're discontinuing support for Node.js 10. For more details, including how you can easily prepare for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. Node.js 12 errors For Node.js 12, the following change affects the Node.js agent: Errors resulting in unhandled rejections are not scoped to the transaction that was active when the rejected promise was created. This is because the promise responsible for triggering the init async hook is no longer passed through on the promise wrap instance. This breaks the linkage that associates a given promise rejection with the transaction it was scheduled in. Supported Node.js frameworks Express 4.6.0 or higher Restify Connect v1 and v2 (router not supported) Hapi Koa 2.0.0 or higher (external module loaded with the agent) If you are using a supported framework with default routers, the Node.js agent can read these frameworks' route names as-is. However, if you want more specific names than are provided by your framework, you may want to use one or more of the tools New Relic provides with the Node.js transaction naming API. Operating systems Linux SmartOS macOS 10.7 and higher Windows Server 2008 and higher Datastores The Node.js agent monitors the performance of Node.js application calls to these datastores: Cassandra Memcached MongoDB MySQL (via mysql and mysql2 packages) Redis Postgres (including the native and pure JavaScript packages) Instance details We collect instance details for a variety of databases and database drivers. The ability to view specific instances and the types of database information in APM depends on your agent version. New Relic's Node.js agent version 1.31.0 or higher supports the following: Database npm module name Minimum module version Minimum agent version PostgreSQL pg 4.0.0 1.31.0 Redis redis 2.0.0 1.31.0 MongoDB mongodb 2.1.0 1.32.0 MySQL mysql 2.4.1 1.32.0 Memcached memcached 1.0.0 1.33.0 To request instance-level information from datastores currently not listed for your New Relic agent, get support at support.newrelic.com. Messages queues Message queue instrumentation is only available with the New Relic Node.js agent v2 or higher. Currently supported message queue instrumentation: amqplib For other message queue libraries, use custom instrumentation. Hosting services Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment AWS EC2 Microsoft Azure Heroku Process managers In general, process managers that handle starting, stopping, and restarting of Node.js (like Forever) should be compatible with the Node.js agent. If you are using PM2, the minimum supported version of PM2 is 2.0. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Connect the agent to other New Relic features The Node.js agent integrates with other features to give you full-stack observability: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Node.js agent automatically injects the browser monitoring agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser monitoring injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Node.js agent.

Wait until the deployment completes, then view your GAE flex app data in the APM Summary page. Build a custom runtime See Google's documentation for building custom runtimes. This example describes how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app by building a custom runtime for Docker. You can deploy the app without any special configuration. For more information about deploying and configuring your Node.js app in the GAE flexible environment, see: Google App Engine's documentation for Node.js Google App Engine's tutorial to deploy a Node.js app 1. Set up the GAE project and install dependencies Follow standard procedures to install New Relic's Node.js agent, including your license key. Be sure to save the newrelic module to the package.json file. Follow Google App Engine procedures for Node.js to create a new Cloud Platform project, create an App Engine application, and complete other prerequisites for the Google Cloud SDK. The Google Cloud SDK provides the gcloud command line tool to manage and deploy GAE apps. 2. Configure your app.yaml The app.yaml configuration file is required for a GAE flexible environment app with a custom runtime. At a minimum, make sure it contains: runtime: custom env: flex Copy Optional: Set environment variables. 3. Configure and deploy The Dockerfile defines the Docker image to be built and is required for a GAE flexible environment app. To create the Dockerfile, build the container, and deploy your app, follow the GAE procedures for Node.js. Wait until the deployment completes. To view your GAE flex app data in New Relic, go to the APM Summary page. Optional: Disable health checks Google App Engine sends periodic health check requests to confirm that an instance has been successfully deployed, and to check that a running instance maintains a healthy status. A health check is an HTTP request to the URL /_ah/health. If you create a custom runtime, your app must be able to handle a large number of health check requests. Otherwise, your app data may not display correctly in New Relic APM. If you notice performance issues, disable GAE health checks. In your app.yaml, add: health_check: enable_health_check: False Copy Get New Relic agent troubleshooting logs from GAE Use these resources to troubleshoot your GAE flex environment app: To connect to the GAE instance and start a shell in the Docker container running your code, see Debugging an instance. To redirect New Relic Node.js agent logs to Stackdriver in the Cloud Platform Console, change the newrelic.js configuration file to: log_file_name: STDOUT Copy To view the logs, use the Cloud Platform Console's Log Viewer.",

      "body": "To take full advantage of New Relic's latest features, enhancements, and important security patches, we recommend you update your Node.js agent to the latest version. For additional information about specific agent updates, refer to the Node.js agent release notes. The release notes include a download link when applicable, plus instructions to download and install the latest version. If the newrelic module is listed in your package.json, run npm install. If you want to target just the newrelic module, run npm update newrelic. Recommendation: Test your updated version before moving it into production. If you have problems, follow the Node.js agent troubleshooting procedures. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 7 Before upgrading to Node.js version 7, review this information for major changes. Major changes with Node.js agent v7 Comments BREAKING Removed deprecated httpResponseCode, response.status and httpResponseMessage http response attributes v6.4.2-v6.14.0: Starting in agent v6.4.2, these attributes were marked as deprecated but left in to give a transition period for the new attributes. v7: When http response attribute reporting is enabled, http.statusCode and http.statusText will be reported. BREAKING Removed deprecated setIgnoreTransaction API method v5 - v6: Starting in agent v5.0.0, this method was marked as deprecated but left in to give a transition period for the new methods. v7: Applications must use the API method transactionHandle.ignore(). BREAKING Removed the api.custom_parameters_enabled configuration item and associated environment variable NEW_RELIC_API_CUSTOM_PARAMETERS. Applications must use the configuration api.custom_attributes_enabled or the associated environment variable NEW_RELIC_API_CUSTOM_ATTRIBUTES to enable newrelic.addCustomAttribute and newrelic.addCustomAttributes. BREAKING Removed deprecated Distributed Tracing API methods, createDistributedTracePayload() and acceptDistributedTracePayload() v6.4.0-v6.14.0: Starting in agent v6.4.0, these method were marked as deprecated but left in to give a transition period for the new methods. v7: Applications must use the API methods transactionHandle.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(headers) and transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(transportType, headers) . With these methods, the Node agent will now accept W3C's traceparent and tracestate headers when calling transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(headers) and include the W3C headers along with the New Relic distributed tracing header when calling transactionHandle.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(headers), unless the New Relic trace header format is disabled using distributed_tracing.exclude_newrelic_header:true. Update New Relic Dependencies to versions with updated Node version support @newrelic/aws-sdk v3.0.0 @newrelic/koa v5.0.0 @newrelic/native-metrics v6.0.0 @newrelic/superagent v4.0.0 @newrelic/test-utilities v5.0.0 Node version support Node v10 is the earliest version supported by the New Relic Node.js v7 agent. Node 8 and 9 are not supported by v7. Customers running Node 9 and earlier have two options: Upgrade to a supported version of Node and take advantage of the New Relic Node.js v7 agent's new features. Remain on New Relic Node.js v6 agent without the ability to use new features only available with update agent versions. Node 10 no longer receive updates, but New Relic will continue to support these versions of Node for the time being. Tip Upgrade to a newer version of Node as soon as possible. The next major version of the New Relic Node.js agent will likely remove support for Node 10. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 6 Before upgrading to Node.js agent version 6, review this information for major changes. Major changes with Node.js agent v6 Comments Upgraded official Koa framework instrumentation module to v3.0.0 v6: Added support for @koa/router up to v8.0.2. @koa/router v8.0.3 and greater are currently unsupported. v6: Added support for Node v12 and removed support for Node v6, 7, and 9. The minimum supported version is Node v8. Also see New Relic's Koa Release Notes on Github.. Removed deprecated max_samples_per_minute configuration parameter, which is replaced by max_samples_stored behavior v1 - v5: max_samples_per_minute defined the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If your application previously used max_samples_per_minute as an upper bound, you may need to lower the threshold to a valid maximum to avoid data being dropped on the server. We recommend less than 10k. v5: In agent v5 and lower, max_samples_stored defined the maximum number of events the agent stores if it's unable to communicate with the New Relic collector. v6: The new behavior of max_samples_stored defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. This usage of the configuration is consistent with the other APM agents. Troubleshooting tips: If you're missing event data, increase the value of max_samples_stored or revert to the default value. The value of max_samples_stored should not be over 10,000. Node version support Node 8 is the earliest version supported by the New Relic Node.js v6 agent. Node 6, 7 and 9 are not supported by v6. Customers running Node 6, 7 and 9 have two options: Upgrade to a supported version of Node and take advantage of the New Relic Node.js v6 agent's new features. Remain on New Relic Node.js v5 agent without the ability to use new features only available with update agent versions. Node 8 no longer receive updates, but New Relic will continue to support these versions of Node for the time being. Tip Upgrade to a newer version of Node as soon as possible. The next major version of the New Relic Node.js agent will likely remove support for Node 8. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 5 Before upgrading to Node.js agent v5, review this information for major changes. Also see New Relic's Node.js v5 migration guide on GitHub. Major changes with Node.js v5 agent Comments Removed deprecated addCustomParameter methods. v2 - v4: Starting in agent v2.7.0, these methods were marked as deprecated but left in to give a transition period for the new methods. v5: Applications must use the API methods newrelic.addCustomAttribute() and newrelic.addCustomAttributes(). These are drop-in replacements for the old methods. Removed deprecated create*Transaction methods. v2 - v4: Starting in agent v2.0.2, these methods were marked as deprecated but left in to give a transition period to the new methods. v5: Applications must update to the API methods newrelic.startWebTransaction() and newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction(). Troubleshooting tips: These new methods are not drop-in replacements for the old ones. Before moving to these new methods, review our custom instrumentation guide. Removed deprecated createTracer method. v3 - v4: Starting in agent v3.3.0, this method was marked as deprecated in favor of newrelic.startSegment(). v5: Applications must update to newrelic.startSegment(). Removed node-cassandra-cql instrumentation. v4: Applications using the npm package node-cassandra-cql would get datastore metrics for Cassandra. v5: Applications must migrate to the cassandra-driver package to get Cassandra datastore metrics. This module is actively maintained by the same developers. The node-cassandra-cql package was abandoned in February of 2014 in favor of the cassandra-driver package. Removed deprecated capture_params and ignored_params configurations. v2 - v4: Starting in agent v2.7.0, these configuration parameters caused a warning to be logged, and the values were automatically upgraded to the new attributes configurations. v5: A warning will still be logged but the configuration is ignored, and no automatic upgrading happens any more. Troubleshooting tips: If your application had parameters listed in the ignored_params configuration, you will need to move them to attributes.exclude. Node version support Node 6 is the earliest version supported by the New Relic Node.js v5 agent. Node 4 and 5 are not supported by v5. Customers running Node 4 or 5 have two options: Upgrade to a supported version of Node and take advantage of the New Relic Node.js v5 agent's new features. Remain on New Relic Node.js v4 agent without the ability to use new features only available with update agent versions. Node 7 and 9 no longer receive updates, but New Relic will continue to support these versions of Node for the time being. Tip Upgrade to a newer version of Node as soon as possible. The next major version of the New Relic Node.js agent will likely remove support for Node 6 and 7. Feature flags as of v5 As of New Relic for Node.js v5: custom_instrumentation: This feature is no longer configurable. custom_metrics: This feature is no longer configurable. synthetics: This feature is no longer configurable. native_metrics: This feature is now controlled by the plugins.native_metrics.enabled configuration value. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 4 Before upgrading to Node.js agent v4, review this information for major changes. Also see New Relic's Node.js v4 migration guide on GitHub. Upgrade https-proxy-agent from v0 to v2 Major changes with Node.js v4 agent include an upgrade of the https-proxy-agent from v0 to v2. This dependency has been updated due to a security issue in the https-proxy-agent that the New Relic Node.js agent used. Because https-proxy v2 is incompatible with node v0.10 and v0.12, New Relic has deprecated those agent versions. There is no required action to migrate from v3 to v4 of New Relic's Node.js agent. Node version support Node 4 is the earliest version supported by the New Relic Node.js v4 agent. Node 0.10 and 0.12 are not supported by v4. Customers running Node 0.10 or 0.12 have two options: Upgrade to a supported version of Node and take advantage of the New Relic Node.js v4 agent's new features. Remain on the New Relic Node.js v3 agent without the ability to use new features only available with updated agent versions. Node 4, 5, and 7 also no longer receive updates, but New Relic will continue to support these versions of Node for the time being. Tip Upgrade to a newer version of Node as soon as possible. The next major version of the New Relic Node.js agent will likely remove support for Node 4 and 5. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 3 Before upgrading to Node.js agent agent v3, review this information for major changes. Also see New Relic's Node.js v3 migration guide on GitHub. Major changes with Node.js v3 agent Major changes with Node.js v3 agent Comments Removed SSL configuration v2: With the v2 agent, it was possible to configure the agent to connect to New Relic without encryption. v3: Node.js agent v3 always connects to New Relic servers using TLS encryption to protect communications. If the agent is configured to disable this, a warning is logged and the setting is ignored. Request parameters now prefixed with request.parameters. v2: The v2 agent collects request parameters, such as route parameters (/users/:userId) and query parameters (/users?userId=123), as the parameter name (userId). v3: The v3 agent prefixes all request parameters with the string request.parameters.. For example,userId appears as request.parameters.userId. Troubleshooting tips: If you have dashboards, alert policies, or other NRQL queries based on request parameters, update them with the new parameter names. Feature flags as of v3 As of New Relic Node.js agent v3, the send_request_uri_attribute feature is no longer configurable. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 2 Before upgrading to Node.js agent v2, review this information for major changes. Also see New Relic's Node.js v2 migration guide on GitHub. Major changes with Node.js v2 agent Major changes with Node.js v2 agent Comments Reversed naming and ignore rules v1: With the v1 agent, rules defined in the config properties rules.name and rules.ignore were applied in reverse order; the first rule in the list was applied last. v2: Node.js agent v2 applies rules in the order they are defined, so the first rule in the list is applied first. Troubleshooting tips: If you used naming rules in the v1 agent and notice problems, reverse the order of your rules in your configuration. De-duplicated HTTP request transactions v1: The v1 agent started a new transaction for each listener on an HTTP server's request event. In applications with multiple listeners on the request event, this resulted in extraneous transactions being created that almost always did not get named correctly. v2: The v2 agent only creates a single transaction for each request event emitted. Troubleshooting tips: If you used multiple request event listeners and added a call to newrelic.ignoreTransaction() to remove the extra transactions, remove those calls. Stopped swallowing outbound request errors v1: The v1 agent swallowed unhandled error events emitted by outbound HTTP request objects. v2: The v2 agent removes this behavior. Instead, the v2 agent does not change normal Node execution. This means the error event will always be emitted. Troubleshooting tips: If you are making outbound requests and currently do not listen for the error event, add a listener and handle the error as appropriate for your application. Updated configuration options as of v2 In newrelic.js, edit the Node.js agent configuration properties you use for compatiblity with the latest versions: Deprecated property New property capture_params attributes.enabled: false By default, request attributes are not sent to New Relic. Set attributes.enabled: true to include agent-defined or custom attributes in traces. The capture_params property has been deprecated. ignored_params attributes.exclude: [] Add any request attribute keys to the attributes.exclude list. Now, instead of having to be an exact match, wildcards (*) may be appended to each item for broader filtering. The ignored_params property has been deprecated. These Node.js agent configuration properties also have overrides for specific destinations, including: transaction_tracer transaction_events error_collector browser_monitoring For example, if the root attributes.enabled is true and you set transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled: false, this will restrict attributes from being collected in transaction traces, while still allowing them for all others. Deprecated API methods as of v2 The following methods from the Node.js agent have been deprecated, and New Relic has deleted them in v5 of the agent. Each has an easy replacement that accomplishes the same task in a more flexible and reliable way. newrelic.createWebTransaction() Replace with newrelic.startWebTransaction() and newrelic.getTransaction(). newrelic.createBackgroundTransaction() Replace with newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction() and newrelic.getTransaction(). newrelic.addCustomParameter() Replace with newrelic.addCustomAttribute(). newrelic.addCustomParameters() Replace with newrelic.addCustomAttributes(). New v2 agent API methods The following API methods are new with the New Relic Node.js v2 agent. newrelic.getTransaction() This method gets a reference to the currently running transaction. Use in conjunction with: newrelic.startWebTransaction newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction Callback-based message consumer services for troubleshooting message consumers newrelic.startWebTransaction()newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction() These new API methods replace the older create*Transaction methods. They are easier to use and seamlessly work with promises. Unlike the v1 method, the provided callback is invoked immediately. newrelic.instrument()newrelic.instrumentDatastore()newrelic.instrumentWebframework()newrelic.instrumentMessages() Use these methods to add custom instrumentation for third party modules, including those already instrumented by the New Relic Node.js agent. For more information, see New Relic's Node.js instrumentation tutorials on GitHub. newrelic.addCustomAttribute() Use this method to add a custom trace attribute. newrelic.addCustomAttributes() Use this method to add multiple custom trace attributes. Node version support for v2 The earliest version of Node supported by the New Relic Node.js v2 agent is 0.10. Node 0.8, which has not been updated since July of 2014, is not supported by v2. Customers running Node 0.8 have two options: Upgrade to a supported version of Node and take advantage of the New Relic Node.js v2 agent's new features. Remain on New Relic Node.js v1 agent without the ability to use new features only available with updated agent versions. Node 0.10 also no longer receives updates, but New Relic will continue to support this version of Node for the time being. Recommendation: Upgrade to a newer version of Node as soon as possible. npm version support as of v2 The New Relic Node.js agent now requires npm version 2.0.0 or higher. This version of npm comes packaged with Node 0.10.44 or higher. If you are using an earlier version of Node 0.10 you will need to first install npm 2.0.0 or higher, or upgrade to a newer version of Node. To install npm version 2: $ npm install --global npm@2 Copy Feature flags as of v2 As of New Relic Node.js agent v2: express_segments: This feature is no longer configurable. cat: This feature is now controlled by the cross_application_tracer.enabled configuration value. Framework minimum versions as of v2 As of New Relic Node.js agent v2: Module V2 minimum Minimum before v2 express 4.6.0 2.0.0 mysql 2.0.0 0.9.0",

Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Why it matters Many Node application requests are based on raw URLs. Our solution is different. New Relic for Node.js assumes it can group requests to your application into transactions instead of HTTP requests. Transactions are defined by giving one or more request paths a name. These names are used to: Visualize where your app is spending its time (in transaction breakdowns). Identify slow requests. Group metrics. Show you which portions of your application are suffering from slow database performance. Installation To install our agent, you need to sign up for New Relic first. Once you're logged in, follow the instructions or use our launcher to get data flowing in. Review the system requirements. Read the install docs. Go directly to the New Relic UI to add Node.js data. Extend your instrumentation After installing the Node.js agent, extend your instrumentation: Extend your instrumentation Comments Customization Implement Node.js custom instrumentation. Collect custom metrics via an API call. Use our Node.js agent API to control, customize, or extend the agent's functionality. Open source telemetry To create your own integrations, use our Node Telemetry SDK. To gain visibility into your GraphQL payloads, use our Apollo Server plugin. Traces Enable distributed tracing. VM measurements Collect key metric timeslice data from the Node.js virtual machine. View detailed VM statistics in the New Relic UI.

      "body": "Our Node.js agent is publicly available on the Node Package Manager (npm) repository as well as on GitHub. Before you install the Node.js agent, make sure your application meets the following system requirements. Node.js version support Tip For best performance, use the latest active long term support (LTS) version of Node.js. Support for new Node.js releases We will support the latest even versions of Node.js releases by the beginning of the following active long term support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Node.js version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Node.js agent with support 16 October 2021 April-October 2021 End of support for Node.js releases reaching EOL When support for a new long term support agent version is made available, support for the Node.js agent version that reaches end-of-life during the same time period will simultaneously drop. The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Node.js version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Node.js agent dropping support 12 April 2022 April-October 2022 10 April 2021 As of July 31, 2021, we're discontinuing support for Node.js 10. For more details, including how you can easily prepare for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. Node.js 12 errors For Node.js 12, the following change affects the Node.js agent: Errors resulting in unhandled rejections are not scoped to the transaction that was active when the rejected promise was created. This is because the promise responsible for triggering the init async hook is no longer passed through on the promise wrap instance. This breaks the linkage that associates a given promise rejection with the transaction it was scheduled in. Supported Node.js frameworks Express 4.6.0 or higher Restify Connect v1 and v2 (router not supported) Hapi Koa 2.0.0 or higher (external module loaded with the agent) If you are using a supported framework with default routers, the Node.js agent can read these frameworks' route names as-is. However, if you want more specific names than are provided by your framework, you may want to use one or more of the tools New Relic provides with the Node.js transaction naming API. Operating systems Linux SmartOS macOS 10.7 and higher Windows Server 2008 and higher Datastores The Node.js agent monitors the performance of Node.js application calls to these datastores: Cassandra Memcached MongoDB MySQL (via mysql and mysql2 packages) Redis Postgres (including the native and pure JavaScript packages) Instance details We collect instance details for a variety of databases and database drivers. The ability to view specific instances and the types of database information in APM depends on your agent version. New Relic's Node.js agent version 1.31.0 or higher supports the following: Database npm module name Minimum module version Minimum agent version PostgreSQL pg 4.0.0 1.31.0 Redis redis 2.0.0 1.31.0 MongoDB mongodb 2.1.0 1.32.0 MySQL mysql 2.4.1 1.32.0 Memcached memcached 1.0.0 1.33.0 To request instance-level information from datastores currently not listed for your New Relic agent, get support at support.newrelic.com. Messages queues Message queue instrumentation is only available with the New Relic Node.js agent v2 or higher. Currently supported message queue instrumentation: amqplib For other message queue libraries, use custom instrumentation. Hosting services Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment AWS EC2 Microsoft Azure Heroku Process managers In general, process managers that handle starting, stopping, and restarting of Node.js (like Forever) should be compatible with the Node.js agent. If you are using PM2, the minimum supported version of PM2 is 2.0. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Connect the agent to other New Relic features The Node.js agent integrates with other features to give you full-stack observability: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Node.js agent automatically injects the browser monitoring agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser monitoring injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Node.js agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in infrastructure monitoring. New Relic dashboards The Node.js agent sends default events and attributes for NRQL queries. You can also record custom events for advanced analysis. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

      "body": "To take full advantage of New Relic's latest features, enhancements, and important security patches, we recommend you update your Node.js agent to the latest version. For additional information about specific agent updates, refer to the Node.js agent release notes. The release notes include a download link when applicable, plus instructions to download and install the latest version. If the newrelic module is listed in your package.json, run npm install. If you want to target just the newrelic module, run npm update newrelic. Recommendation: Test your updated version before moving it into production. If you have problems, follow the Node.js agent troubleshooting procedures. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 7 Before upgrading to Node.js version 7, review this information for major changes. Major changes with Node.js agent v7 Comments BREAKING Removed deprecated httpResponseCode, response.status and httpResponseMessage http response attributes v6.4.2-v6.14.0: Starting in agent v6.4.2, these attributes were marked as deprecated but left in to give a transition period for the new attributes. v7: When http response attribute reporting is enabled, http.statusCode and http.statusText will be reported. BREAKING Removed deprecated setIgnoreTransaction API method v5 - v6: Starting in agent v5.0.0, this method was marked as deprecated but left in to give a transition period for the new methods. v7: Applications must use the API method transactionHandle.ignore(). BREAKING Removed the api.custom_parameters_enabled configuration item and associated environment variable NEW_RELIC_API_CUSTOM_PARAMETERS. Applications must use the configuration api.custom_attributes_enabled or the associated environment variable NEW_RELIC_API_CUSTOM_ATTRIBUTES to enable newrelic.addCustomAttribute and newrelic.addCustomAttributes. BREAKING Removed deprecated Distributed Tracing API methods, createDistributedTracePayload() and acceptDistributedTracePayload() v6.4.0-v6.14.0: Starting in agent v6.4.0, these method were marked as deprecated but left in to give a transition period for the new methods. v7: Applications must use the API methods transactionHandle.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(headers) and transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(transportType, headers) . With these methods, the Node agent will now accept W3C's traceparent and tracestate headers when calling transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(headers) and include the W3C headers along with the New Relic distributed tracing header when calling transactionHandle.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(headers), unless the New Relic trace header format is disabled using distributed_tracing.exclude_newrelic_header:true. Update New Relic Dependencies to versions with updated Node version support @newrelic/aws-sdk v3.0.0 @newrelic/koa v5.0.0 @newrelic/native-metrics v6.0.0 @newrelic/superagent v4.0.0 @newrelic/test-utilities v5.0.0 Node version support Node v10 is the earliest version supported by the New Relic Node.js v7 agent. Node 8 and 9 are not supported by v7. Customers running Node 9 and earlier have two options: Upgrade to a supported version of Node and take advantage of the New Relic Node.js v7 agent's new features. Remain on New Relic Node.js v6 agent without the ability to use new features only available with update agent versions. Node 10 no longer receive updates, but New Relic will continue to support these versions of Node for the time being. Tip Upgrade to a newer version of Node as soon as possible. The next major version of the New Relic Node.js agent will likely remove support for Node 10. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 6 Before upgrading to Node.js agent version 6, review this information for major changes. Major changes with Node.js agent v6 Comments Upgraded official Koa framework instrumentation module to v3.0.0 v6: Added support for @koa/router up to v8.0.2. @koa/router v8.0.3 and greater are currently unsupported. v6: Added support for Node v12 and removed support for Node v6, 7, and 9. The minimum supported version is Node v8. Also see New Relic's Koa Release Notes on Github.. Removed deprecated max_samples_per_minute configuration parameter, which is replaced by max_samples_stored behavior v1 - v5: max_samples_per_minute defined the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If your application previously used max_samples_per_minute as an upper bound, you may need to lower the threshold to a valid maximum to avoid data being dropped on the server. We recommend less than 10k. v5: In agent v5 and lower, max_samples_stored defined the maximum number of events the agent stores if it's unable to communicate with the New Relic collector. v6: The new behavior of max_samples_stored defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. This usage of the configuration is consistent with the other APM agents. Troubleshooting tips: If you're missing event data, increase the value of max_samples_stored or revert to the default value. The value of max_samples_stored should not be over 10,000. Node version support Node 8 is the earliest version supported by the New Relic Node.js v6 agent. Node 6, 7 and 9 are not supported by v6. Customers running Node 6, 7 and 9 have two options: Upgrade to a supported version of Node and take advantage of the New Relic Node.js v6 agent's new features. Remain on New Relic Node.js v5 agent without the ability to use new features only available with update agent versions. Node 8 no longer receive updates, but New Relic will continue to support these versions of Node for the time being. Tip Upgrade to a newer version of Node as soon as possible. The next major version of the New Relic Node.js agent will likely remove support for Node 8. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 5 Before upgrading to Node.js agent v5, review this information for major changes. Also see New Relic's Node.js v5 migration guide on GitHub. Major changes with Node.js v5 agent Comments Removed deprecated addCustomParameter methods. v2 - v4: Starting in agent v2.7.0, these methods were marked as deprecated but left in to give a transition period for the new methods. v5: Applications must use the API methods newrelic.addCustomAttribute() and newrelic.addCustomAttributes(). These are drop-in replacements for the old methods. Removed deprecated create*Transaction methods. v2 - v4: Starting in agent v2.0.2, these methods were marked as deprecated but left in to give a transition period to the new methods. v5: Applications must update to the API methods newrelic.startWebTransaction() and newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction(). Troubleshooting tips: These new methods are not drop-in replacements for the old ones. Before moving to these new methods, review our custom instrumentation guide. Removed deprecated createTracer method. v3 - v4: Starting in agent v3.3.0, this method was marked as deprecated in favor of newrelic.startSegment(). v5: Applications must update to newrelic.startSegment(). Removed node-cassandra-cql instrumentation. v4: Applications using the npm package node-cassandra-cql would get datastore metrics for Cassandra. v5: Applications must migrate to the cassandra-driver package to get Cassandra datastore metrics. This module is actively maintained by the same developers. The node-cassandra-cql package was abandoned in February of 2014 in favor of the cassandra-driver package. Removed deprecated capture_params and ignored_params configurations. v2 - v4: Starting in agent v2.7.0, these configuration parameters caused a warning to be logged, and the values were automatically upgraded to the new attributes configurations. v5: A warning will still be logged but the configuration is ignored, and no automatic upgrading happens any more. Troubleshooting tips: If your application had parameters listed in the ignored_params configuration, you will need to move them to attributes.exclude. Node version support Node 6 is the earliest version supported by the New Relic Node.js v5 agent. Node 4 and 5 are not supported by v5. Customers running Node 4 or 5 have two options: Upgrade to a supported version of Node and take advantage of the New Relic Node.js v5 agent's new features. Remain on New Relic Node.js v4 agent without the ability to use new features only available with update agent versions. Node 7 and 9 no longer receive updates, but New Relic will continue to support these versions of Node for the time being. Tip Upgrade to a newer version of Node as soon as possible. The next major version of the New Relic Node.js agent will likely remove support for Node 6 and 7. Feature flags as of v5 As of New Relic for Node.js v5: custom_instrumentation: This feature is no longer configurable. custom_metrics: This feature is no longer configurable. synthetics: This feature is no longer configurable. native_metrics: This feature is now controlled by the plugins.native_metrics.enabled configuration value. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 4 Before upgrading to Node.js agent v4, review this information for major changes. Also see New Relic's Node.js v4 migration guide on GitHub. Upgrade https-proxy-agent from v0 to v2 Major changes with Node.js v4 agent include an upgrade of the https-proxy-agent from v0 to v2. This dependency has been updated due to a security issue in the https-proxy-agent that the New Relic Node.js agent used. Because https-proxy v2 is incompatible with node v0.10 and v0.12, New Relic has deprecated those agent versions. There is no required action to migrate from v3 to v4 of New Relic's Node.js agent. Node version support Node 4 is the earliest version supported by the New Relic Node.js v4 agent. Node 0.10 and 0.12 are not supported by v4. Customers running Node 0.10 or 0.12 have two options: Upgrade to a supported version of Node and take advantage of the New Relic Node.js v4 agent's new features. Remain on the New Relic Node.js v3 agent without the ability to use new features only available with updated agent versions. Node 4, 5, and 7 also no longer receive updates, but New Relic will continue to support these versions of Node for the time being. Tip Upgrade to a newer version of Node as soon as possible. The next major version of the New Relic Node.js agent will likely remove support for Node 4 and 5. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 3 Before upgrading to Node.js agent agent v3, review this information for major changes. Also see New Relic's Node.js v3 migration guide on GitHub. Major changes with Node.js v3 agent Major changes with Node.js v3 agent Comments Removed SSL configuration v2: With the v2 agent, it was possible to configure the agent to connect to New Relic without encryption. v3: Node.js agent v3 always connects to New Relic servers using TLS encryption to protect communications. If the agent is configured to disable this, a warning is logged and the setting is ignored. Request parameters now prefixed with request.parameters. v2: The v2 agent collects request parameters, such as route parameters (/users/:userId) and query parameters (/users?userId=123), as the parameter name (userId). v3: The v3 agent prefixes all request parameters with the string request.parameters.. For example,userId appears as request.parameters.userId. Troubleshooting tips: If you have dashboards, alert policies, or other NRQL queries based on request parameters, update them with the new parameter names. Feature flags as of v3 As of New Relic Node.js agent v3, the send_request_uri_attribute feature is no longer configurable. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 2 Before upgrading to Node.js agent v2, review this information for major changes. Also see New Relic's Node.js v2 migration guide on GitHub. Major changes with Node.js v2 agent Major changes with Node.js v2 agent Comments Reversed naming and ignore rules v1: With the v1 agent, rules defined in the config properties rules.name and rules.ignore were applied in reverse order; the first rule in the list was applied last. v2: Node.js agent v2 applies rules in the order they are defined, so the first rule in the list is applied first. Troubleshooting tips: If you used naming rules in the v1 agent and notice problems, reverse the order of your rules in your configuration. De-duplicated HTTP request transactions v1: The v1 agent started a new transaction for each listener on an HTTP server's request event. In applications with multiple listeners on the request event, this resulted in extraneous transactions being created that almost always did not get named correctly. v2: The v2 agent only creates a single transaction for each request event emitted. Troubleshooting tips: If you used multiple request event listeners and added a call to newrelic.ignoreTransaction() to remove the extra transactions, remove those calls. Stopped swallowing outbound request errors v1: The v1 agent swallowed unhandled error events emitted by outbound HTTP request objects. v2: The v2 agent removes this behavior. Instead, the v2 agent does not change normal Node execution. This means the error event will always be emitted. Troubleshooting tips: If you are making outbound requests and currently do not listen for the error event, add a listener and handle the error as appropriate for your application. Updated configuration options as of v2 In newrelic.js, edit the Node.js agent configuration properties you use for compatiblity with the latest versions: Deprecated property New property capture_params attributes.enabled: false By default, request attributes are not sent to New Relic. Set attributes.enabled: true to include agent-defined or custom attributes in traces. The capture_params property has been deprecated. ignored_params attributes.exclude: [] Add any request attribute keys to the attributes.exclude list. Now, instead of having to be an exact match, wildcards (*) may be appended to each item for broader filtering. The ignored_params property has been deprecated. These Node.js agent configuration properties also have overrides for specific destinations, including: transaction_tracer transaction_events error_collector browser_monitoring For example, if the root attributes.enabled is true and you set transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled: false, this will restrict attributes from being collected in transaction traces, while still allowing them for all others. Deprecated API methods as of v2 The following methods from the Node.js agent have been deprecated, and New Relic has deleted them in v5 of the agent. Each has an easy replacement that accomplishes the same task in a more flexible and reliable way. newrelic.createWebTransaction() Replace with newrelic.startWebTransaction() and newrelic.getTransaction(). newrelic.createBackgroundTransaction() Replace with newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction() and newrelic.getTransaction(). newrelic.addCustomParameter() Replace with newrelic.addCustomAttribute(). newrelic.addCustomParameters() Replace with newrelic.addCustomAttributes(). New v2 agent API methods The following API methods are new with the New Relic Node.js v2 agent. newrelic.getTransaction() This method gets a reference to the currently running transaction. Use in conjunction with: newrelic.startWebTransaction newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction Callback-based message consumer services for troubleshooting message consumers newrelic.startWebTransaction()newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction() These new API methods replace the older create*Transaction methods. They are easier to use and seamlessly work with promises. Unlike the v1 method, the provided callback is invoked immediately. newrelic.instrument()newrelic.instrumentDatastore()newrelic.instrumentWebframework()newrelic.instrumentMessages() Use these methods to add custom instrumentation for third party modules, including those already instrumented by the New Relic Node.js agent. For more information, see New Relic's Node.js instrumentation tutorials on GitHub. newrelic.addCustomAttribute() Use this method to add a custom trace attribute. newrelic.addCustomAttributes() Use this method to add multiple custom trace attributes. Node version support for v2 The earliest version of Node supported by the New Relic Node.js v2 agent is 0.10. Node 0.8, which has not been updated since July of 2014, is not supported by v2. Customers running Node 0.8 have two options: Upgrade to a supported version of Node and take advantage of the New Relic Node.js v2 agent's new features. Remain on New Relic Node.js v1 agent without the ability to use new features only available with updated agent versions. Node 0.10 also no longer receives updates, but New Relic will continue to support this version of Node for the time being. Recommendation: Upgrade to a newer version of Node as soon as possible. npm version support as of v2 The New Relic Node.js agent now requires npm version 2.0.0 or higher. This version of npm comes packaged with Node 0.10.44 or higher. If you are using an earlier version of Node 0.10 you will need to first install npm 2.0.0 or higher, or upgrade to a newer version of Node. To install npm version 2: $ npm install --global npm@2 Copy Feature flags as of v2 As of New Relic Node.js agent v2: express_segments: This feature is no longer configurable. cat: This feature is now controlled by the cross_application_tracer.enabled configuration value.

      "body": "You can tailor the Node.js agent to your app's requirements by editing your newrelic.js config file or by setting an environment variable. The config file resides in the root directory of your app. You can also configure a few options from New Relic, or use the Node.js agent API. Important The license_key setting is required. We highly recommend setting the app_name so that your app has a meaningful name instead of the default My Application. Configuration methods and precedence The primary method to configure the Node.js agent is the agent configuration file (newrelic.js). You can also configure most settings with environment variables. You can also adjust some settings with server-side configuration. The Node.js agent uses this order of precedence for configuration methods: Node.js configuration hierarchy: Server-side configuration settings override environment variables. Environment variables override the agent config file. The config file overrides the agent defaults. Here are detailed descriptions of each configuration method: Agent configuration file The config file (newrelic.js) contains every Node.js agent setting. When you install the Node.js agent, you must copy newrelic.js into your app's root directory. Most settings are empty by default; they inherit their values from config/default.js. Environment variables Most configuration settings in newrelic.js have equivalent environment variables. These are useful, for example, if your agent runs in a PaaS environment such as Heroku or Microsoft Azure. Node.js agent environment variables always start with NEW_RELIC_. Where available, these environment variables are documented below under individual config options as the Environ variable. There are also two rarely used settings that can only be configured via environment variables. Server-side configuration Owners and Admins can view and configure a few settings directly in New Relic. Where available, the UI labels for server-side config are listed in this document under individual config options as the Server-side label. Exports variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the exports.config = { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. app_name (REQUIRED) Type String Default \"My Application\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME The name New Relic uses to identify your app. For example, app_name: ['MyNodeApp']. To use multiple names for your app, specify a comma-delimited list of names. Data for all applications with the same name will be merged in the New Relic UI, so set this carefully. We highly recommend that you replace the default name with a descriptive name to avoid confusion and unintended aggregation of data. Tip For Azure users, the Node.js agent will use APP_POOL_ID if it is set, so you can use the name you chose for your Azure Web Server without setting it twice. license_key (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY This setting is required. Your New Relic license key. For example, license_key: '40HexadecimalCharacters'. agent_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ENABLED Set to false to stop the agent from starting up. This is useful when debugging your code requires temporarily disabling the agent. It prevents the agent from bootstrapping its instrumentation or setting up all its pieces, which prevents the agent from starting up and connecting to New Relic's servers. allow_all_headers If true, enables capture of all HTTP headers, except for those filtered by exclude rules. If false, collected headers are limited to those defined in Node.js agent attributes. Type Boolean Default false Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. apdex_t (DEPRECATED) Type Number Default 0.100 Server-side label Apdex T Set your Apdex T via the New Relic UI. certificates Type Array of strings Default (none) Additional certificates to trust for SSL connections, specified as an array of strings in PEM format. This affects both connections to an HTTPS proxy and connections to New Relic. Tip You can also configure the agent to read its certificates from a file: certificates: [ fs.readFileSync('myca.crt', {encoding: 'utf8'}) ] Copy high_security Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HIGH_SECURITY When set to true, enables high security v2. You must also enable the ssl setting and enable high security in the UI. host Type String Default collector.newrelic.com Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HOST Important Do not edit this value unless New Relic Support asks you to change it. Hostname for the New Relic collector to connect to the Internet; for example, host: 'collector.newrelic.com'. labels Adds tags. Specify your tags as objects or a semicolon-delimited string of colon-separated pairs (for example, Server:One;Data Center:Primary). Type Object or string Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LABELS port Type Integer Default 443 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PORT Important Do not edit this value unless New Relic Support asks you to change it. Port number to connect to the New Relic collector; for example, port: 443. proxy Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_URL A URL specifying the proxy server to connect to the Internet. For example, proxy: 'http://user:pass@10.0.0.1:8000/'. Important The proxy config file setting overrides the other config file proxy settings (proxy_host, proxy_port, proxy_user, proxy_pass) if used. Similarly, the NEW_RELIC_PROXY_URL environment variable overrides the other environment variable proxy settings (NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST, NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT, NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER, and NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS) if used. proxy_host Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST Hostname or IP address of the proxy server to connect to the Internet. proxy_pass Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS Password for authenticating to the proxy server. The agent supports only basic HTTP authentication. proxy_port Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT Port number of the proxy server to connect to the Internet. proxy_user Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER User name for authenticating to the proxy server. The agent supports only basic HTTP authentication. Logging variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the logging: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enabled Type String Default true (false in serverless_mode) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_ENABLED Enables or disables agent specific logging. level Type String Default info Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Defines the level of detail recorded in the agent logs. From least detail to most detail, possible values are fatal, error, warn, info, debug, or trace. Caution Do not use debug or trace logging unless New Relic Support asks you to use them. These levels of logging can generate excessive overhead. For most situations, use info. filepath Type String Default process.cwd() plus newrelic_agent.log Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG Complete path to the New Relic agent log, including the filename. Defaults to filepath: require('path').join(process.cwd(), 'newrelic_agent.log'). The agent will shut down the process if it cannot create this file. The agent creates a log file with the same permissions as the parent Node.js agent process. To write all logging to stdout, set this to stdout. To write all logging to stderr, set this to stderr. Audit logging This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the audit_log: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enabled Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_AUDIT_LOG_ENABLED When enabled, the agent logs the payloads it sends to the collector. This data is included in the main log file even when logging level is set to the lowest level. endpoints Type Array Default Empty array (include all types) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_AUDIT_LOG_ENDPOINTS The agent sends several different types of data to the collector in separate payloads. By default, all of them are included in the log file. This option makes it possible to limit logging only to specific types of data. Valid values include: agent_settings analytic_event_data connect custom_event_data error_data error_event_data metric_data preconnect shutdown span_event_data sql_trace_data transaction_sample_data API configuration This section allows you to choose which API methods are enabled. Each configuration option allows you to modularly enable API methods that are responsible for sending custom information to New Relic. Important All of these are set to false when the agent is in high security mode. custom_attributes_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_API_CUSTOM_ATTRIBUTES This option enables newrelic.addCustomAttribute and newrelic.addCustomAttributes. custom_events_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_API_CUSTOM_EVENTS This option enables recordCustomEvent. notice_error_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_API_NOTICE_ERROR This option enables newrelic.noticeError. Attributes This section defines the variables for Node.js agent attributes in the order they typically appear in the attributes: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, enables capture of attributes for all destinations. exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from all destinations. Allows * as wildcard at end. include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include from all destinations. Allows * as wildcard at end. include_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE_ENABLED When true, patterns may be added to the attributes.include list. Error collector variables You can manage how error are handled in New Relic. This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the error_collector: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ENABLED Server-side label Enable error collection? When enabled, the agent collects error traces from your app. ignore_status_codes Type Array Default 404 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_ERROR_CODES Server-side label Ignore these status codes Comma-delimited list of HTTP status codes for the error collector to ignore. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. ignore_classes Type Array|Object Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_ERRORS Comma-delimited list of javascript error types/classes for the error collector to ignore. The following configuration /* ... */ error_collector: { ignore_classes: [\"ReferenceError\"] } /* ... */ Copy Would ignore all reference errors. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. ignore_messages Type Object Default {} A javascript object describing a list of javascript classes tied to javascript error messages for the collector to ignore. The following configuration. /* ... */ error_collector: { /* ... */ ignore_messages: {\"Error\":[\"Undefined\", \"Out of time\"]} /* ... */ } /* ... */ Copy Would ignore all errors of type Error, with the exact (case-sensitive) message strings of Undefined and Out of time. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. expected_status_codes Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_EXPECTED_ERROR_CODES Comma-delimited list of HTTP status codes for the error collector to mark as expected. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. expected_classes Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_EXPECTED_ERRORS The following configuration /* ... */ error_collector: { expected_classes: [\"ReferenceError\"] } /* ... */ Copy Would mark all reference errors as expected. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. expected_messages Type Object Default {} A javascript object describing a list of javascript classes tied to javascript error messages for the collector to ignore. The following configuration. /* ... */ error_collector: { /* ... */ expected_messages: {\"Error\":[\"Undefined\", \"Out of time\"]} /* ... */ } /* ... */ Copy Would mark all errors of type Error, with the exact (case-sensitive) message strings of Undefined and Out of time. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent captures attributes from error collection. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from error collection. Allows * as wildcard at end. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include in error collection. Allows * as wildcard at end. Transaction tracer variables The agent groups your requests into transactions, which are used to: Visualize where your app spends its time (in transaction breakdowns). Identify slow requests. Group metrics. Isolate other issues, such as slow database performance. This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the transaction_tracer: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. Important Do not use brackets [suffix] at the end of your transaction name. New Relic automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRACER_ENABLED Server-side label Enable transaction tracing? When enabled, the agent collects slow transaction traces. explain_threshold Type Integer Default 500 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_EXPLAIN_THRESHOLD Minimum query duration (in milliseconds) for a transaction to be eligible for slow queries in transaction traces. record_sql Type String (off, obfuscated, or raw) Default off Environ variable NEW_RELIC_RECORD_SQL This option affects both slow queries and record_sql for transaction traces. It can have one of three values: off, obfuscated, or raw. When set to off no slow queries will be captured, and backtraces and SQL will not be included in transaction traces. If set to raw or obfuscated, the agent sends raw or obfuscated SQL and a slow query sample to the collector. The agent may also send SQL when other criteria are met, such as when slow_sql.enabled is set. top_n Type Integer Default 20 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRACER_TOP_N Defines the maximum number of requests eligible for transaction traces. Transactions are named based on the request, and top_n refers to the \"top n slowest transactions\" grouped by these names. The module replaces a recorded trace with a new trace only if the new trace is slower than the previous slowest trace of that name. The default value for this setting is top_n: 20, because the Transactions page also defaults to the 20 slowest transactions. The Node.js agent captures at least five different slow transactions in the first harvest cycle after start up. It will also reset and capture different transactions if no slow transactions have been captured for the last five harvest cycles. This allows you to see more information about more of your app's request paths, at the possible cost of not focusing on the absolutely slowest request for that harvest cycle. Tip To record the absolute slowest transaction over the last minute, you can set top_n: 0 or top_n: 1. However, this causes one very slow route to dominate your transaction traces. transaction_threshold Type Integer or apdex_f Default apdex_f Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRACER_THRESHOLD Server-side label Threshold Threshold of web transaction response time in seconds beyond which a transaction is eligible for transaction tracing. The default value is apdex_f; this sets the trace threshold to four times your application's Apdex T. You can also enter a specific time value in milliseconds. Example: Threshold set to apdex_f The default apdex_t is 100 milliseconds. If your transaction threshold is set to apdex_f, a \"slow\" transaction is 400 milliseconds. hide_internals Type boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HIDE_INTERNALS The agent uses a small amount of CPU in order to hide internal properties that are attached to the web application. If you change this configuration to false, it may slightly decrease your agent overhead, but it could also have an impact on the performance of the agent. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent captures attributes from transaction traces. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from transaction traces. Allows * as wildcard at end. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include in transaction traces. Allows * as wildcard at end. Rules variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the rules: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. name Type Strings or regular expressions Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES A comma-delimited list of rules to match incoming request URLs and name the associated New Relic transaction. Uses the format: name: [ {pattern: 'STRING_OR_REGEX', name: 'NAME'}, {pattern: 'STRING_OR_REGEX', name: 'NAME'} ], Copy Both parameters are required. For strings, you must escape control characters. You do not need to escape control characters in regular expressions. Additional attributes are ignored. Regular expressions support JavaScript-style capture groups, and names use $1-style replacement strings. Regular expressions only find the first matching result; subsequent matches are ignored. For more information, see Node.js transaction naming API. For the NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES environment variable, pass the rules as comma-delimited JSON object literals: NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES='{\"pattern\":\"^t\",\"name\":\"u\"},{\"pattern\":\"^u\",\"name\":\"t\"}' Copy ignore Type Strings or regular expressions Default Regular expression to match socket.io long-polling requests (\"^ \\ /socket \\ .io \\ /. * \\ /xhr-polling/\"). Environ variable NEW_RELIC_IGNORING_RULES Define a list of request URLs you want the agent to ignore. Specify the list as patterns, which can be strings or regular expressions. enforce_backstop Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ENFORCE_BACKSTOP Caution Do not change this setting unless you understand metric grouping issues. When enabled, the agent renames transactions that are not affected by other naming logic (such as the API, rules, or metric normalization rules) to NormalizedUri/*. If you set this to false, the agent sets transaction names to Uri/path/to/resource. Transaction events variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the transaction_events: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enabled Type Boolean Default true When enabled, the agent sends transaction events to New Relic. This event data includes transaction timing, transaction name, and any custom parameters. If this is disabled, the agent does not collect this data or send it to New Relic. max_samples_stored Type Integer Default 10000 Defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. We do not recommend configuring past 10k. The server will cap data at 10k per-minute. Important This configuration had different behavior in agent versions lower than 6.0.0. See max_samples_stored (DEPRECATED) for agent versions 5.x or lower. max_samples_stored (DEPRECATED) Type Integer Default 20000 Defines the maximum number of events the agent stores if it is unable to communicate with the New Relic collector. The values from the previous harvest cycle will be merged into the next one, with this option limiting the maximum number. Make sure this number is greater than max_samples_per_minute; for example, set it to twice as much. Consider your memory overhead before increasing this value. Caution This configuration has different behavior starting with agent version 6.0.0 and a new recommended maximum. See max_samples_stored for agent versions 6.x or higher. max_samples_per_minute (DEPRECATED) Type Integer Default 10000 Defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. Caution This configuration has been replaced with max_samples_stored starting with version 6.0.0 of the agent. See max_samples_stored for 6.x or later agents. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent captures attributes from transaction events. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from transaction events. Allows * as wildcard at end. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include in transaction events. Allows * as wildcard at end. Browser monitoring variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the browser_monitoring: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enable Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITOR_ENABLE Server-side label Enable browser monitoring? Generate JavaScript headers for browser instrumentation. Although this defaults to true, the agent doesn't inject the browser JS code unless you have enabled browser monitoring. Even if you have enabled it and added the browser timing header, you can disable browser monitoring for your app by setting this to false. debug Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITOR_DEBUG If true, request un-minified sources from the server. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITORING_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent sends custom attributes to browser monitoring. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITORING_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from browser monitoring. Allows * as wildcard at end. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITORING_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include in browser monitoring. Allows * as wildcard at end. Custom events variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the custom_insights_events: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. Currently there are no environment variables for custom events. enabled Type Boolean Default true When enabled, the agent sends custom events recorded with recordCustomEvent() to New Relic. If this is disabled, the agent does not collect this data or send it to New Relic. max_samples_stored Type Integer Default 1000 Defines the maximum number of custom events the agent collects per minute. If the number of custom events exceeds this limit, the agent collects a statistical sampling. Important Increasing this limit increases memory usage. Slow queries variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the slow_sql: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. These options control behavior for slow queries, but do not affect SQL nodes in transaction traces. enabled Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SLOW_SQL_ENABLED When enabled, the agent collects slow query details. max_samples Type Integer Default 10 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MAX_SQL_SAMPLES Defines the maximum number of slow queries the agent collects per minute. The agent discards additional queries after the limit is reached. Important Increasing this limit increases memory usage. Custom hostname variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the process_host: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. These options control behavior regarding the host display name in the New Relic APM UI. display_name Type String of 255 bytes or less Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME Specify a custom hostname for display in New Relic. If you do not set this field, New Relic will continue to use the default hostname found by calling os.hostname(). If you use the default hostname settings, New Relic finds the hostname through os.hostname(). If this call fails, New Relic uses the host's IP as the name. If you set ipv_preference: 4 or ipv_preference: 6, you can select the type of IP address (IPv4 or IPv6) that appears in the New Relic UI. ipv_preference Type Integer (4 or 6) Default 4 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_IPV_PREFERENCE Environment variable overrides This section defines two configuration options only available with environment variables. These overrides are not used in most configurations. NEW_RELIC_HOME Path to the directory containing newrelic.js. This is available only as an environment variable. You cannot set it in your config file. Type String Default (none) NEW_RELIC_NO_CONFIG_FILE If used, this prevents the agent from reading configuration settings from newrelic.js. Default values and values from environment variables will still be set. This is available only as an environment variable. You cannot set it in your config file. Type Boolean Default False Datastore tracer variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the datastore_tracer section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. These options control behavior for collecting datastore instance metrics. instance_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true When enabled, the agent collects datastore instance metrics (such as host and port) for some database drivers. These are reported on slow query traces and transaction traces. database_name_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true When enabled, the agent collects database name on slow query traces and transaction traces for some database drivers. Cross application tracing The Node.js agent variables that control cross application tracing typically appear in the cross_application_tracer section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file: enabled Type Boolean Default true When set to true, allows tracing of transactions across more than one New Relic-monitored applications. Error message redaction variables The Node.js agent variables that control error message redaction appear in the allow_raw_exception_messages section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file: enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ALLOW_RAW_EXCEPTION_MESSAGES_ENABLED When false, the agent will redact the messages of captured errors. Distributed tracing Important Enabling distributed tracing disables cross application tracing, and has effects on other APM features. Before enabling, read the transition guide. Requires Node.js agent version 4.7.0 or higher. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. When configuring via the config file, place the following option in the distributed_tracing section. When distributed tracing is enabled, you can collect span events. enabled Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED Set this to true to enable distributed tracing. For example, to enable this in the config file, you would use: distributed_tracing: { enabled: true } Copy exclude_newrelic_header Type Boolean Default false Set this to true to exclude the New Relic header that is attached to outbound requests, and instead only rely on W3C Trace Context Headers for distributed tracing. If this is false then both types of headers are used. For example, to enable this in the config file, you would use: distributed_tracing:{ enabled: true, exclude_newrelic_header: true } Copy Span events Span events are reported for distributed tracing. Distributed tracing must be enabled to report span events. Span configuration is set in the span_events stanza. Options include: enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ENABLED Turns reporting of span events on or off. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED This setting can be used to turn reporting of attributes on or off for span events. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent to span events regardless on how this is set. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE If attributes are enabled for span events, all attribute keys found in this list will be attached to span events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent with span events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Infinite Tracing To turn on Infinite Tracing, enable distributed tracing (set distributed_tracing to enabled: true) and add the additional settings below. For an example, see Language Agents: Configure Distributed Tracing. trace_observer.host Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST For help getting a valid Infinite Tracing trace observer host entry, see Find or create a trace observer endpoint.",

To install the Node.js agent: Ensure you meet the system requirements. In particular, make sure you use a supported Node version. Use the command npm install newrelic --save for each application you want to monitor. From node_modules/newrelic, copy newrelic.js into the root directory of your app. Configure agent via the newrelic.js file or via environment variable: Customize the license_key setting with your license key. Customize the app_name setting with one or more meaningful app names. Add require('newrelic'); as the first line of your app's main module. Optional: For additional Node.js runtime-level statistics, ensure the @newrelic/native-metrics package is installed. Generate some traffic, then wait a few minutes for data to appear in the APM UI. You can further customize your agent behavior via newrelic.js or an environment variable. To keep the agent configuration separate from your app, edit the NEW_RELIC_HOME environmental variable. Keep your Node.js agent up-to-date To ensure that you have the most up-to-date version of New Relic, refer to the Node.js release notes. When applicable, the release notes include a download link with instructions on how to update the Node.js agent. Troubleshooting After you update the agent, generate some traffic and wait a few minutes. If no data appears in the New Relic UI, see the troubleshooting procedures.",

      "body": "To take full advantage of New Relic's latest features, enhancements, and important security patches, we recommend you update your Node.js agent to the latest version. For additional information about specific agent updates, refer to the Node.js agent release notes. The release notes include a download link when applicable, plus instructions to download and install the latest version. If the newrelic module is listed in your package.json, run npm install. If you want to target just the newrelic module, run npm update newrelic. Recommendation: Test your updated version before moving it into production. If you have problems, follow the Node.js agent troubleshooting procedures. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 7 Before upgrading to Node.js version 7, review this information for major changes. Major changes with Node.js agent v7 Comments BREAKING Removed deprecated httpResponseCode, response.status and httpResponseMessage http response attributes v6.4.2-v6.14.0: Starting in agent v6.4.2, these attributes were marked as deprecated but left in to give a transition period for the new attributes. v7: When http response attribute reporting is enabled, http.statusCode and http.statusText will be reported. BREAKING Removed deprecated setIgnoreTransaction API method v5 - v6: Starting in agent v5.0.0, this method was marked as deprecated but left in to give a transition period for the new methods. v7: Applications must use the API method transactionHandle.ignore(). BREAKING Removed the api.custom_parameters_enabled configuration item and associated environment variable NEW_RELIC_API_CUSTOM_PARAMETERS. Applications must use the configuration api.custom_attributes_enabled or the associated environment variable NEW_RELIC_API_CUSTOM_ATTRIBUTES to enable newrelic.addCustomAttribute and newrelic.addCustomAttributes. BREAKING Removed deprecated Distributed Tracing API methods, createDistributedTracePayload() and acceptDistributedTracePayload() v6.4.0-v6.14.0: Starting in agent v6.4.0, these method were marked as deprecated but left in to give a transition period for the new methods. v7: Applications must use the API methods transactionHandle.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(headers) and transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(transportType, headers) . With these methods, the Node agent will now accept W3C's traceparent and tracestate headers when calling transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(headers) and include the W3C headers along with the New Relic distributed tracing header when calling transactionHandle.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(headers), unless the New Relic trace header format is disabled using distributed_tracing.exclude_newrelic_header:true. Update New Relic Dependencies to versions with updated Node version support @newrelic/aws-sdk v3.0.0 @newrelic/koa v5.0.0 @newrelic/native-metrics v6.0.0 @newrelic/superagent v4.0.0 @newrelic/test-utilities v5.0.0 Node version support Node v10 is the earliest version supported by the New Relic Node.js v7 agent. Node 8 and 9 are not supported by v7. Customers running Node 9 and earlier have two options: Upgrade to a supported version of Node and take advantage of the New Relic Node.js v7 agent's new features. Remain on New Relic Node.js v6 agent without the ability to use new features only available with update agent versions. Node 10 no longer receive updates, but New Relic will continue to support these versions of Node for the time being. Tip Upgrade to a newer version of Node as soon as possible. The next major version of the New Relic Node.js agent will likely remove support for Node 10. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 6 Before upgrading to Node.js agent version 6, review this information for major changes. Major changes with Node.js agent v6 Comments Upgraded official Koa framework instrumentation module to v3.0.0 v6: Added support for @koa/router up to v8.0.2. @koa/router v8.0.3 and greater are currently unsupported. v6: Added support for Node v12 and removed support for Node v6, 7, and 9. The minimum supported version is Node v8. Also see New Relic's Koa Release Notes on Github.. Removed deprecated max_samples_per_minute configuration parameter, which is replaced by max_samples_stored behavior v1 - v5: max_samples_per_minute defined the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If your application previously used max_samples_per_minute as an upper bound, you may need to lower the threshold to a valid maximum to avoid data being dropped on the server. We recommend less than 10k. v5: In agent v5 and lower, max_samples_stored defined the maximum number of events the agent stores if it's unable to communicate with the New Relic collector. v6: The new behavior of max_samples_stored defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. This usage of the configuration is consistent with the other APM agents. Troubleshooting tips: If you're missing event data, increase the value of max_samples_stored or revert to the default value. The value of max_samples_stored should not be over 10,000. Node version support Node 8 is the earliest version supported by the New Relic Node.js v6 agent. Node 6, 7 and 9 are not supported by v6. Customers running Node 6, 7 and 9 have two options: Upgrade to a supported version of Node and take advantage of the New Relic Node.js v6 agent's new features. Remain on New Relic Node.js v5 agent without the ability to use new features only available with update agent versions. Node 8 no longer receive updates, but New Relic will continue to support these versions of Node for the time being. Tip Upgrade to a newer version of Node as soon as possible. The next major version of the New Relic Node.js agent will likely remove support for Node 8. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 5 Before upgrading to Node.js agent v5, review this information for major changes. Also see New Relic's Node.js v5 migration guide on GitHub. Major changes with Node.js v5 agent Comments Removed deprecated addCustomParameter methods. v2 - v4: Starting in agent v2.7.0, these methods were marked as deprecated but left in to give a transition period for the new methods. v5: Applications must use the API methods newrelic.addCustomAttribute() and newrelic.addCustomAttributes(). These are drop-in replacements for the old methods. Removed deprecated create*Transaction methods. v2 - v4: Starting in agent v2.0.2, these methods were marked as deprecated but left in to give a transition period to the new methods. v5: Applications must update to the API methods newrelic.startWebTransaction() and newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction(). Troubleshooting tips: These new methods are not drop-in replacements for the old ones. Before moving to these new methods, review our custom instrumentation guide. Removed deprecated createTracer method. v3 - v4: Starting in agent v3.3.0, this method was marked as deprecated in favor of newrelic.startSegment(). v5: Applications must update to newrelic.startSegment(). Removed node-cassandra-cql instrumentation. v4: Applications using the npm package node-cassandra-cql would get datastore metrics for Cassandra. v5: Applications must migrate to the cassandra-driver package to get Cassandra datastore metrics. This module is actively maintained by the same developers. The node-cassandra-cql package was abandoned in February of 2014 in favor of the cassandra-driver package. Removed deprecated capture_params and ignored_params configurations. v2 - v4: Starting in agent v2.7.0, these configuration parameters caused a warning to be logged, and the values were automatically upgraded to the new attributes configurations. v5: A warning will still be logged but the configuration is ignored, and no automatic upgrading happens any more. Troubleshooting tips: If your application had parameters listed in the ignored_params configuration, you will need to move them to attributes.exclude. Node version support Node 6 is the earliest version supported by the New Relic Node.js v5 agent. Node 4 and 5 are not supported by v5. Customers running Node 4 or 5 have two options: Upgrade to a supported version of Node and take advantage of the New Relic Node.js v5 agent's new features. Remain on New Relic Node.js v4 agent without the ability to use new features only available with update agent versions. Node 7 and 9 no longer receive updates, but New Relic will continue to support these versions of Node for the time being. Tip Upgrade to a newer version of Node as soon as possible. The next major version of the New Relic Node.js agent will likely remove support for Node 6 and 7. Feature flags as of v5 As of New Relic for Node.js v5: custom_instrumentation: This feature is no longer configurable. custom_metrics: This feature is no longer configurable. synthetics: This feature is no longer configurable. native_metrics: This feature is now controlled by the plugins.native_metrics.enabled configuration value. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 4 Before upgrading to Node.js agent v4, review this information for major changes. Also see New Relic's Node.js v4 migration guide on GitHub. Upgrade https-proxy-agent from v0 to v2 Major changes with Node.js v4 agent include an upgrade of the https-proxy-agent from v0 to v2. This dependency has been updated due to a security issue in the https-proxy-agent that the New Relic Node.js agent used. Because https-proxy v2 is incompatible with node v0.10 and v0.12, New Relic has deprecated those agent versions. There is no required action to migrate from v3 to v4 of New Relic's Node.js agent. Node version support Node 4 is the earliest version supported by the New Relic Node.js v4 agent. Node 0.10 and 0.12 are not supported by v4. Customers running Node 0.10 or 0.12 have two options: Upgrade to a supported version of Node and take advantage of the New Relic Node.js v4 agent's new features. Remain on the New Relic Node.js v3 agent without the ability to use new features only available with updated agent versions. Node 4, 5, and 7 also no longer receive updates, but New Relic will continue to support these versions of Node for the time being. Tip Upgrade to a newer version of Node as soon as possible. The next major version of the New Relic Node.js agent will likely remove support for Node 4 and 5. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 3 Before upgrading to Node.js agent agent v3, review this information for major changes. Also see New Relic's Node.js v3 migration guide on GitHub. Major changes with Node.js v3 agent Major changes with Node.js v3 agent Comments Removed SSL configuration v2: With the v2 agent, it was possible to configure the agent to connect to New Relic without encryption. v3: Node.js agent v3 always connects to New Relic servers using TLS encryption to protect communications. If the agent is configured to disable this, a warning is logged and the setting is ignored. Request parameters now prefixed with request.parameters. v2: The v2 agent collects request parameters, such as route parameters (/users/:userId) and query parameters (/users?userId=123), as the parameter name (userId). v3: The v3 agent prefixes all request parameters with the string request.parameters.. For example,userId appears as request.parameters.userId. Troubleshooting tips: If you have dashboards, alert policies, or other NRQL queries based on request parameters, update them with the new parameter names. Feature flags as of v3 As of New Relic Node.js agent v3, the send_request_uri_attribute feature is no longer configurable. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 2 Before upgrading to Node.js agent v2, review this information for major changes. Also see New Relic's Node.js v2 migration guide on GitHub. Major changes with Node.js v2 agent Major changes with Node.js v2 agent Comments Reversed naming and ignore rules v1: With the v1 agent, rules defined in the config properties rules.name and rules.ignore were applied in reverse order; the first rule in the list was applied last. v2: Node.js agent v2 applies rules in the order they are defined, so the first rule in the list is applied first. Troubleshooting tips: If you used naming rules in the v1 agent and notice problems, reverse the order of your rules in your configuration. De-duplicated HTTP request transactions v1: The v1 agent started a new transaction for each listener on an HTTP server's request event. In applications with multiple listeners on the request event, this resulted in extraneous transactions being created that almost always did not get named correctly. v2: The v2 agent only creates a single transaction for each request event emitted. Troubleshooting tips: If you used multiple request event listeners and added a call to newrelic.ignoreTransaction() to remove the extra transactions, remove those calls. Stopped swallowing outbound request errors v1: The v1 agent swallowed unhandled error events emitted by outbound HTTP request objects. v2: The v2 agent removes this behavior. Instead, the v2 agent does not change normal Node execution. This means the error event will always be emitted. Troubleshooting tips: If you are making outbound requests and currently do not listen for the error event, add a listener and handle the error as appropriate for your application. Updated configuration options as of v2 In newrelic.js, edit the Node.js agent configuration properties you use for compatiblity with the latest versions: Deprecated property New property capture_params attributes.enabled: false By default, request attributes are not sent to New Relic. Set attributes.enabled: true to include agent-defined or custom attributes in traces. The capture_params property has been deprecated. ignored_params attributes.exclude: [] Add any request attribute keys to the attributes.exclude list. Now, instead of having to be an exact match, wildcards (*) may be appended to each item for broader filtering. The ignored_params property has been deprecated. These Node.js agent configuration properties also have overrides for specific destinations, including: transaction_tracer transaction_events error_collector browser_monitoring For example, if the root attributes.enabled is true and you set transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled: false, this will restrict attributes from being collected in transaction traces, while still allowing them for all others. Deprecated API methods as of v2 The following methods from the Node.js agent have been deprecated, and New Relic has deleted them in v5 of the agent. Each has an easy replacement that accomplishes the same task in a more flexible and reliable way. newrelic.createWebTransaction() Replace with newrelic.startWebTransaction() and newrelic.getTransaction(). newrelic.createBackgroundTransaction() Replace with newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction() and newrelic.getTransaction(). newrelic.addCustomParameter() Replace with newrelic.addCustomAttribute(). newrelic.addCustomParameters() Replace with newrelic.addCustomAttributes(). New v2 agent API methods The following API methods are new with the New Relic Node.js v2 agent. newrelic.getTransaction() This method gets a reference to the currently running transaction. Use in conjunction with: newrelic.startWebTransaction newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction Callback-based message consumer services for troubleshooting message consumers newrelic.startWebTransaction()newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction() These new API methods replace the older create*Transaction methods. They are easier to use and seamlessly work with promises. Unlike the v1 method, the provided callback is invoked immediately. newrelic.instrument()newrelic.instrumentDatastore()newrelic.instrumentWebframework()newrelic.instrumentMessages() Use these methods to add custom instrumentation for third party modules, including those already instrumented by the New Relic Node.js agent. For more information, see New Relic's Node.js instrumentation tutorials on GitHub. newrelic.addCustomAttribute() Use this method to add a custom trace attribute. newrelic.addCustomAttributes() Use this method to add multiple custom trace attributes. Node version support for v2 The earliest version of Node supported by the New Relic Node.js v2 agent is 0.10. Node 0.8, which has not been updated since July of 2014, is not supported by v2. Customers running Node 0.8 have two options: Upgrade to a supported version of Node and take advantage of the New Relic Node.js v2 agent's new features. Remain on New Relic Node.js v1 agent without the ability to use new features only available with updated agent versions. Node 0.10 also no longer receives updates, but New Relic will continue to support this version of Node for the time being. Recommendation: Upgrade to a newer version of Node as soon as possible. npm version support as of v2 The New Relic Node.js agent now requires npm version 2.0.0 or higher. This version of npm comes packaged with Node 0.10.44 or higher. If you are using an earlier version of Node 0.10 you will need to first install npm 2.0.0 or higher, or upgrade to a newer version of Node. To install npm version 2: $ npm install --global npm@2 Copy Feature flags as of v2 As of New Relic Node.js agent v2: express_segments: This feature is no longer configurable. cat: This feature is now controlled by the cross_application_tracer.enabled configuration value.

      "body": "You can tailor the Node.js agent to your app's requirements by editing your newrelic.js config file or by setting an environment variable. The config file resides in the root directory of your app. You can also configure a few options from New Relic, or use the Node.js agent API. Important The license_key setting is required. We highly recommend setting the app_name so that your app has a meaningful name instead of the default My Application. Configuration methods and precedence The primary method to configure the Node.js agent is the agent configuration file (newrelic.js). You can also configure most settings with environment variables. You can also adjust some settings with server-side configuration. The Node.js agent uses this order of precedence for configuration methods: Node.js configuration hierarchy: Server-side configuration settings override environment variables. Environment variables override the agent config file. The config file overrides the agent defaults. Here are detailed descriptions of each configuration method: Agent configuration file The config file (newrelic.js) contains every Node.js agent setting. When you install the Node.js agent, you must copy newrelic.js into your app's root directory. Most settings are empty by default; they inherit their values from config/default.js. Environment variables Most configuration settings in newrelic.js have equivalent environment variables. These are useful, for example, if your agent runs in a PaaS environment such as Heroku or Microsoft Azure. Node.js agent environment variables always start with NEW_RELIC_. Where available, these environment variables are documented below under individual config options as the Environ variable. There are also two rarely used settings that can only be configured via environment variables. Server-side configuration Owners and Admins can view and configure a few settings directly in New Relic. Where available, the UI labels for server-side config are listed in this document under individual config options as the Server-side label. Exports variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the exports.config = { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. app_name (REQUIRED) Type String Default \"My Application\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME The name New Relic uses to identify your app. For example, app_name: ['MyNodeApp']. To use multiple names for your app, specify a comma-delimited list of names. Data for all applications with the same name will be merged in the New Relic UI, so set this carefully. We highly recommend that you replace the default name with a descriptive name to avoid confusion and unintended aggregation of data. Tip For Azure users, the Node.js agent will use APP_POOL_ID if it is set, so you can use the name you chose for your Azure Web Server without setting it twice. license_key (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY This setting is required. Your New Relic license key. For example, license_key: '40HexadecimalCharacters'. agent_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ENABLED Set to false to stop the agent from starting up. This is useful when debugging your code requires temporarily disabling the agent. It prevents the agent from bootstrapping its instrumentation or setting up all its pieces, which prevents the agent from starting up and connecting to New Relic's servers. allow_all_headers If true, enables capture of all HTTP headers, except for those filtered by exclude rules. If false, collected headers are limited to those defined in Node.js agent attributes. Type Boolean Default false Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. apdex_t (DEPRECATED) Type Number Default 0.100 Server-side label Apdex T Set your Apdex T via the New Relic UI. certificates Type Array of strings Default (none) Additional certificates to trust for SSL connections, specified as an array of strings in PEM format. This affects both connections to an HTTPS proxy and connections to New Relic. Tip You can also configure the agent to read its certificates from a file: certificates: [ fs.readFileSync('myca.crt', {encoding: 'utf8'}) ] Copy high_security Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HIGH_SECURITY When set to true, enables high security v2. You must also enable the ssl setting and enable high security in the UI. host Type String Default collector.newrelic.com Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HOST Important Do not edit this value unless New Relic Support asks you to change it. Hostname for the New Relic collector to connect to the Internet; for example, host: 'collector.newrelic.com'. labels Adds tags. Specify your tags as objects or a semicolon-delimited string of colon-separated pairs (for example, Server:One;Data Center:Primary). Type Object or string Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LABELS port Type Integer Default 443 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PORT Important Do not edit this value unless New Relic Support asks you to change it. Port number to connect to the New Relic collector; for example, port: 443. proxy Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_URL A URL specifying the proxy server to connect to the Internet. For example, proxy: 'http://user:pass@10.0.0.1:8000/'. Important The proxy config file setting overrides the other config file proxy settings (proxy_host, proxy_port, proxy_user, proxy_pass) if used. Similarly, the NEW_RELIC_PROXY_URL environment variable overrides the other environment variable proxy settings (NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST, NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT, NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER, and NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS) if used. proxy_host Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST Hostname or IP address of the proxy server to connect to the Internet. proxy_pass Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS Password for authenticating to the proxy server. The agent supports only basic HTTP authentication. proxy_port Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT Port number of the proxy server to connect to the Internet. proxy_user Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER User name for authenticating to the proxy server. The agent supports only basic HTTP authentication. Logging variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the logging: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enabled Type String Default true (false in serverless_mode) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_ENABLED Enables or disables agent specific logging. level Type String Default info Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Defines the level of detail recorded in the agent logs. From least detail to most detail, possible values are fatal, error, warn, info, debug, or trace. Caution Do not use debug or trace logging unless New Relic Support asks you to use them. These levels of logging can generate excessive overhead. For most situations, use info. filepath Type String Default process.cwd() plus newrelic_agent.log Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG Complete path to the New Relic agent log, including the filename. Defaults to filepath: require('path').join(process.cwd(), 'newrelic_agent.log'). The agent will shut down the process if it cannot create this file. The agent creates a log file with the same permissions as the parent Node.js agent process. To write all logging to stdout, set this to stdout. To write all logging to stderr, set this to stderr. Audit logging This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the audit_log: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enabled Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_AUDIT_LOG_ENABLED When enabled, the agent logs the payloads it sends to the collector. This data is included in the main log file even when logging level is set to the lowest level. endpoints Type Array Default Empty array (include all types) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_AUDIT_LOG_ENDPOINTS The agent sends several different types of data to the collector in separate payloads. By default, all of them are included in the log file. This option makes it possible to limit logging only to specific types of data. Valid values include: agent_settings analytic_event_data connect custom_event_data error_data error_event_data metric_data preconnect shutdown span_event_data sql_trace_data transaction_sample_data API configuration This section allows you to choose which API methods are enabled. Each configuration option allows you to modularly enable API methods that are responsible for sending custom information to New Relic. Important All of these are set to false when the agent is in high security mode. custom_attributes_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_API_CUSTOM_ATTRIBUTES This option enables newrelic.addCustomAttribute and newrelic.addCustomAttributes. custom_events_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_API_CUSTOM_EVENTS This option enables recordCustomEvent. notice_error_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_API_NOTICE_ERROR This option enables newrelic.noticeError. Attributes This section defines the variables for Node.js agent attributes in the order they typically appear in the attributes: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, enables capture of attributes for all destinations. exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from all destinations. Allows * as wildcard at end. include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include from all destinations. Allows * as wildcard at end. include_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE_ENABLED When true, patterns may be added to the attributes.include list. Error collector variables You can manage how error are handled in New Relic. This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the error_collector: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ENABLED Server-side label Enable error collection? When enabled, the agent collects error traces from your app. ignore_status_codes Type Array Default 404 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_ERROR_CODES Server-side label Ignore these status codes Comma-delimited list of HTTP status codes for the error collector to ignore. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. ignore_classes Type Array|Object Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_ERRORS Comma-delimited list of javascript error types/classes for the error collector to ignore. The following configuration /* ... */ error_collector: { ignore_classes: [\"ReferenceError\"] } /* ... */ Copy Would ignore all reference errors. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. ignore_messages Type Object Default {} A javascript object describing a list of javascript classes tied to javascript error messages for the collector to ignore. The following configuration. /* ... */ error_collector: { /* ... */ ignore_messages: {\"Error\":[\"Undefined\", \"Out of time\"]} /* ... */ } /* ... */ Copy Would ignore all errors of type Error, with the exact (case-sensitive) message strings of Undefined and Out of time. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. expected_status_codes Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_EXPECTED_ERROR_CODES Comma-delimited list of HTTP status codes for the error collector to mark as expected. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. expected_classes Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_EXPECTED_ERRORS The following configuration /* ... */ error_collector: { expected_classes: [\"ReferenceError\"] } /* ... */ Copy Would mark all reference errors as expected. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. expected_messages Type Object Default {} A javascript object describing a list of javascript classes tied to javascript error messages for the collector to ignore. The following configuration. /* ... */ error_collector: { /* ... */ expected_messages: {\"Error\":[\"Undefined\", \"Out of time\"]} /* ... */ } /* ... */ Copy Would mark all errors of type Error, with the exact (case-sensitive) message strings of Undefined and Out of time. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent captures attributes from error collection. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from error collection. Allows * as wildcard at end. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include in error collection. Allows * as wildcard at end. Transaction tracer variables The agent groups your requests into transactions, which are used to: Visualize where your app spends its time (in transaction breakdowns). Identify slow requests. Group metrics. Isolate other issues, such as slow database performance. This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the transaction_tracer: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. Important Do not use brackets [suffix] at the end of your transaction name. New Relic automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRACER_ENABLED Server-side label Enable transaction tracing? When enabled, the agent collects slow transaction traces. explain_threshold Type Integer Default 500 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_EXPLAIN_THRESHOLD Minimum query duration (in milliseconds) for a transaction to be eligible for slow queries in transaction traces. record_sql Type String (off, obfuscated, or raw) Default off Environ variable NEW_RELIC_RECORD_SQL This option affects both slow queries and record_sql for transaction traces. It can have one of three values: off, obfuscated, or raw. When set to off no slow queries will be captured, and backtraces and SQL will not be included in transaction traces. If set to raw or obfuscated, the agent sends raw or obfuscated SQL and a slow query sample to the collector. The agent may also send SQL when other criteria are met, such as when slow_sql.enabled is set. top_n Type Integer Default 20 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRACER_TOP_N Defines the maximum number of requests eligible for transaction traces. Transactions are named based on the request, and top_n refers to the \"top n slowest transactions\" grouped by these names. The module replaces a recorded trace with a new trace only if the new trace is slower than the previous slowest trace of that name. The default value for this setting is top_n: 20, because the Transactions page also defaults to the 20 slowest transactions. The Node.js agent captures at least five different slow transactions in the first harvest cycle after start up. It will also reset and capture different transactions if no slow transactions have been captured for the last five harvest cycles. This allows you to see more information about more of your app's request paths, at the possible cost of not focusing on the absolutely slowest request for that harvest cycle. Tip To record the absolute slowest transaction over the last minute, you can set top_n: 0 or top_n: 1. However, this causes one very slow route to dominate your transaction traces. transaction_threshold Type Integer or apdex_f Default apdex_f Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRACER_THRESHOLD Server-side label Threshold Threshold of web transaction response time in seconds beyond which a transaction is eligible for transaction tracing. The default value is apdex_f; this sets the trace threshold to four times your application's Apdex T. You can also enter a specific time value in milliseconds. Example: Threshold set to apdex_f The default apdex_t is 100 milliseconds. If your transaction threshold is set to apdex_f, a \"slow\" transaction is 400 milliseconds. hide_internals Type boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HIDE_INTERNALS The agent uses a small amount of CPU in order to hide internal properties that are attached to the web application. If you change this configuration to false, it may slightly decrease your agent overhead, but it could also have an impact on the performance of the agent. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent captures attributes from transaction traces. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from transaction traces. Allows * as wildcard at end. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include in transaction traces. Allows * as wildcard at end. Rules variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the rules: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. name Type Strings or regular expressions Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES A comma-delimited list of rules to match incoming request URLs and name the associated New Relic transaction. Uses the format: name: [ {pattern: 'STRING_OR_REGEX', name: 'NAME'}, {pattern: 'STRING_OR_REGEX', name: 'NAME'} ], Copy Both parameters are required. For strings, you must escape control characters. You do not need to escape control characters in regular expressions. Additional attributes are ignored. Regular expressions support JavaScript-style capture groups, and names use $1-style replacement strings. Regular expressions only find the first matching result; subsequent matches are ignored. For more information, see Node.js transaction naming API. For the NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES environment variable, pass the rules as comma-delimited JSON object literals: NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES='{\"pattern\":\"^t\",\"name\":\"u\"},{\"pattern\":\"^u\",\"name\":\"t\"}' Copy ignore Type Strings or regular expressions Default Regular expression to match socket.io long-polling requests (\"^ \\ /socket \\ .io \\ /. * \\ /xhr-polling/\"). Environ variable NEW_RELIC_IGNORING_RULES Define a list of request URLs you want the agent to ignore. Specify the list as patterns, which can be strings or regular expressions. enforce_backstop Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ENFORCE_BACKSTOP Caution Do not change this setting unless you understand metric grouping issues. When enabled, the agent renames transactions that are not affected by other naming logic (such as the API, rules, or metric normalization rules) to NormalizedUri/*. If you set this to false, the agent sets transaction names to Uri/path/to/resource. Transaction events variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the transaction_events: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enabled Type Boolean Default true When enabled, the agent sends transaction events to New Relic. This event data includes transaction timing, transaction name, and any custom parameters. If this is disabled, the agent does not collect this data or send it to New Relic. max_samples_stored Type Integer Default 10000 Defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. We do not recommend configuring past 10k. The server will cap data at 10k per-minute. Important This configuration had different behavior in agent versions lower than 6.0.0. See max_samples_stored (DEPRECATED) for agent versions 5.x or lower. max_samples_stored (DEPRECATED) Type Integer Default 20000 Defines the maximum number of events the agent stores if it is unable to communicate with the New Relic collector. The values from the previous harvest cycle will be merged into the next one, with this option limiting the maximum number. Make sure this number is greater than max_samples_per_minute; for example, set it to twice as much. Consider your memory overhead before increasing this value. Caution This configuration has different behavior starting with agent version 6.0.0 and a new recommended maximum. See max_samples_stored for agent versions 6.x or higher. max_samples_per_minute (DEPRECATED) Type Integer Default 10000 Defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. Caution This configuration has been replaced with max_samples_stored starting with version 6.0.0 of the agent. See max_samples_stored for 6.x or later agents. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent captures attributes from transaction events. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from transaction events. Allows * as wildcard at end. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include in transaction events. Allows * as wildcard at end. Browser monitoring variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the browser_monitoring: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enable Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITOR_ENABLE Server-side label Enable browser monitoring? Generate JavaScript headers for browser instrumentation. Although this defaults to true, the agent doesn't inject the browser JS code unless you have enabled browser monitoring. Even if you have enabled it and added the browser timing header, you can disable browser monitoring for your app by setting this to false. debug Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITOR_DEBUG If true, request un-minified sources from the server. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITORING_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent sends custom attributes to browser monitoring. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITORING_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from browser monitoring. Allows * as wildcard at end. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITORING_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include in browser monitoring. Allows * as wildcard at end. Custom events variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the custom_insights_events: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. Currently there are no environment variables for custom events. enabled Type Boolean Default true When enabled, the agent sends custom events recorded with recordCustomEvent() to New Relic. If this is disabled, the agent does not collect this data or send it to New Relic. max_samples_stored Type Integer Default 1000 Defines the maximum number of custom events the agent collects per minute. If the number of custom events exceeds this limit, the agent collects a statistical sampling. Important Increasing this limit increases memory usage. Slow queries variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the slow_sql: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. These options control behavior for slow queries, but do not affect SQL nodes in transaction traces. enabled Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SLOW_SQL_ENABLED When enabled, the agent collects slow query details. max_samples Type Integer Default 10 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MAX_SQL_SAMPLES Defines the maximum number of slow queries the agent collects per minute. The agent discards additional queries after the limit is reached. Important Increasing this limit increases memory usage. Custom hostname variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the process_host: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. These options control behavior regarding the host display name in the New Relic APM UI. display_name Type String of 255 bytes or less Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME Specify a custom hostname for display in New Relic. If you do not set this field, New Relic will continue to use the default hostname found by calling os.hostname(). If you use the default hostname settings, New Relic finds the hostname through os.hostname(). If this call fails, New Relic uses the host's IP as the name. If you set ipv_preference: 4 or ipv_preference: 6, you can select the type of IP address (IPv4 or IPv6) that appears in the New Relic UI. ipv_preference Type Integer (4 or 6) Default 4 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_IPV_PREFERENCE Environment variable overrides This section defines two configuration options only available with environment variables. These overrides are not used in most configurations. NEW_RELIC_HOME Path to the directory containing newrelic.js. This is available only as an environment variable. You cannot set it in your config file. Type String Default (none) NEW_RELIC_NO_CONFIG_FILE If used, this prevents the agent from reading configuration settings from newrelic.js. Default values and values from environment variables will still be set. This is available only as an environment variable. You cannot set it in your config file. Type Boolean Default False Datastore tracer variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the datastore_tracer section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. These options control behavior for collecting datastore instance metrics. instance_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true When enabled, the agent collects datastore instance metrics (such as host and port) for some database drivers. These are reported on slow query traces and transaction traces. database_name_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true When enabled, the agent collects database name on slow query traces and transaction traces for some database drivers. Cross application tracing The Node.js agent variables that control cross application tracing typically appear in the cross_application_tracer section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file: enabled Type Boolean Default true When set to true, allows tracing of transactions across more than one New Relic-monitored applications. Error message redaction variables The Node.js agent variables that control error message redaction appear in the allow_raw_exception_messages section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file: enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ALLOW_RAW_EXCEPTION_MESSAGES_ENABLED When false, the agent will redact the messages of captured errors. Distributed tracing Important Enabling distributed tracing disables cross application tracing, and has effects on other APM features. Before enabling, read the transition guide. Requires Node.js agent version 4.7.0 or higher. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. When configuring via the config file, place the following option in the distributed_tracing section. When distributed tracing is enabled, you can collect span events. enabled Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED Set this to true to enable distributed tracing. For example, to enable this in the config file, you would use: distributed_tracing: { enabled: true } Copy exclude_newrelic_header Type Boolean Default false Set this to true to exclude the New Relic header that is attached to outbound requests, and instead only rely on W3C Trace Context Headers for distributed tracing. If this is false then both types of headers are used. For example, to enable this in the config file, you would use: distributed_tracing:{ enabled: true, exclude_newrelic_header: true } Copy Span events Span events are reported for distributed tracing. Distributed tracing must be enabled to report span events. Span configuration is set in the span_events stanza. Options include: enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ENABLED Turns reporting of span events on or off. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED This setting can be used to turn reporting of attributes on or off for span events. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent to span events regardless on how this is set. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE If attributes are enabled for span events, all attribute keys found in this list will be attached to span events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent with span events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Infinite Tracing To turn on Infinite Tracing, enable distributed tracing (set distributed_tracing to enabled: true) and add the additional settings below. For an example, see Language Agents: Configure Distributed Tracing. trace_observer.host Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST For help getting a valid Infinite Tracing trace observer host entry, see Find or create a trace observer endpoint.",

This document explains how to build, configure, and deploy your Dockerized Node.js application that has been instrumented with New Relic. Tip To use Node.js or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Instrument your container With just a few additions your existing Dockerfile can be used with our Node.js agent. You'll configure the agent by running your new Docker image with environment variables set. Add newrelic to your package.json: \"newrelic\": \"latest\", Copy Install a specific version, or use any of the other options provided by the package.json format. Check the Node.js agent release notes for information about past agent versions. In the first line of your app's main module, add require('newrelic');. Add this line to your Dockerfile so the agent can run without a configuration file: ENV NEW_RELIC_NO_CONFIG_FILE=true Copy Build your Docker image the way you normally do. To run your Docker app with the agent enabled, add your license key and app name to your docker run command as environment variables: docker run -e NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=YOUR_LICENSE_KEY \\ -e NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"Your Application Name\" \\ your_image_name:latest Copy Other configuration options Caution Do not include your license key in your Dockerfile or Docker image. For more information, see our documentation on license key security. In addition to setting your application name or license key, you can set other configuration options by starting your container with the -e option. For example, to enable distributed tracing, use: $ docker run -e NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=YOUR_LICENSE_KEY \\ -e NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"Your Application Name\" \\ -e NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED=true \\ your_image_name:latest Copy You can also set configuration options in your Dockerfile using ENV directives: ENV NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED=true \\ NEW_RELIC_LOG=stdout # etc. Copy",

      "body": "To take full advantage of New Relic's latest features, enhancements, and important security patches, we recommend you update your Node.js agent to the latest version. For additional information about specific agent updates, refer to the Node.js agent release notes. The release notes include a download link when applicable, plus instructions to download and install the latest version. If the newrelic module is listed in your package.json, run npm install. If you want to target just the newrelic module, run npm update newrelic. Recommendation: Test your updated version before moving it into production. If you have problems, follow the Node.js agent troubleshooting procedures. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 7 Before upgrading to Node.js version 7, review this information for major changes. Major changes with Node.js agent v7 Comments BREAKING Removed deprecated httpResponseCode, response.status and httpResponseMessage http response attributes v6.4.2-v6.14.0: Starting in agent v6.4.2, these attributes were marked as deprecated but left in to give a transition period for the new attributes. v7: When http response attribute reporting is enabled, http.statusCode and http.statusText will be reported. BREAKING Removed deprecated setIgnoreTransaction API method v5 - v6: Starting in agent v5.0.0, this method was marked as deprecated but left in to give a transition period for the new methods. v7: Applications must use the API method transactionHandle.ignore(). BREAKING Removed the api.custom_parameters_enabled configuration item and associated environment variable NEW_RELIC_API_CUSTOM_PARAMETERS. Applications must use the configuration api.custom_attributes_enabled or the associated environment variable NEW_RELIC_API_CUSTOM_ATTRIBUTES to enable newrelic.addCustomAttribute and newrelic.addCustomAttributes. BREAKING Removed deprecated Distributed Tracing API methods, createDistributedTracePayload() and acceptDistributedTracePayload() v6.4.0-v6.14.0: Starting in agent v6.4.0, these method were marked as deprecated but left in to give a transition period for the new methods. v7: Applications must use the API methods transactionHandle.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(headers) and transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(transportType, headers) . With these methods, the Node agent will now accept W3C's traceparent and tracestate headers when calling transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(headers) and include the W3C headers along with the New Relic distributed tracing header when calling transactionHandle.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(headers), unless the New Relic trace header format is disabled using distributed_tracing.exclude_newrelic_header:true. Update New Relic Dependencies to versions with updated Node version support @newrelic/aws-sdk v3.0.0 @newrelic/koa v5.0.0 @newrelic/native-metrics v6.0.0 @newrelic/superagent v4.0.0 @newrelic/test-utilities v5.0.0 Node version support Node v10 is the earliest version supported by the New Relic Node.js v7 agent. Node 8 and 9 are not supported by v7. Customers running Node 9 and earlier have two options: Upgrade to a supported version of Node and take advantage of the New Relic Node.js v7 agent's new features. Remain on New Relic Node.js v6 agent without the ability to use new features only available with update agent versions. Node 10 no longer receive updates, but New Relic will continue to support these versions of Node for the time being. Tip Upgrade to a newer version of Node as soon as possible. The next major version of the New Relic Node.js agent will likely remove support for Node 10. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 6 Before upgrading to Node.js agent version 6, review this information for major changes. Major changes with Node.js agent v6 Comments Upgraded official Koa framework instrumentation module to v3.0.0 v6: Added support for @koa/router up to v8.0.2. @koa/router v8.0.3 and greater are currently unsupported. v6: Added support for Node v12 and removed support for Node v6, 7, and 9. The minimum supported version is Node v8. Also see New Relic's Koa Release Notes on Github.. Removed deprecated max_samples_per_minute configuration parameter, which is replaced by max_samples_stored behavior v1 - v5: max_samples_per_minute defined the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If your application previously used max_samples_per_minute as an upper bound, you may need to lower the threshold to a valid maximum to avoid data being dropped on the server. We recommend less than 10k. v5: In agent v5 and lower, max_samples_stored defined the maximum number of events the agent stores if it's unable to communicate with the New Relic collector. v6: The new behavior of max_samples_stored defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. This usage of the configuration is consistent with the other APM agents. Troubleshooting tips: If you're missing event data, increase the value of max_samples_stored or revert to the default value. The value of max_samples_stored should not be over 10,000. Node version support Node 8 is the earliest version supported by the New Relic Node.js v6 agent. Node 6, 7 and 9 are not supported by v6. Customers running Node 6, 7 and 9 have two options: Upgrade to a supported version of Node and take advantage of the New Relic Node.js v6 agent's new features. Remain on New Relic Node.js v5 agent without the ability to use new features only available with update agent versions. Node 8 no longer receive updates, but New Relic will continue to support these versions of Node for the time being. Tip Upgrade to a newer version of Node as soon as possible. The next major version of the New Relic Node.js agent will likely remove support for Node 8. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 5 Before upgrading to Node.js agent v5, review this information for major changes. Also see New Relic's Node.js v5 migration guide on GitHub. Major changes with Node.js v5 agent Comments Removed deprecated addCustomParameter methods. v2 - v4: Starting in agent v2.7.0, these methods were marked as deprecated but left in to give a transition period for the new methods. v5: Applications must use the API methods newrelic.addCustomAttribute() and newrelic.addCustomAttributes(). These are drop-in replacements for the old methods. Removed deprecated create*Transaction methods. v2 - v4: Starting in agent v2.0.2, these methods were marked as deprecated but left in to give a transition period to the new methods. v5: Applications must update to the API methods newrelic.startWebTransaction() and newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction(). Troubleshooting tips: These new methods are not drop-in replacements for the old ones. Before moving to these new methods, review our custom instrumentation guide. Removed deprecated createTracer method. v3 - v4: Starting in agent v3.3.0, this method was marked as deprecated in favor of newrelic.startSegment(). v5: Applications must update to newrelic.startSegment(). Removed node-cassandra-cql instrumentation. v4: Applications using the npm package node-cassandra-cql would get datastore metrics for Cassandra. v5: Applications must migrate to the cassandra-driver package to get Cassandra datastore metrics. This module is actively maintained by the same developers. The node-cassandra-cql package was abandoned in February of 2014 in favor of the cassandra-driver package. Removed deprecated capture_params and ignored_params configurations. v2 - v4: Starting in agent v2.7.0, these configuration parameters caused a warning to be logged, and the values were automatically upgraded to the new attributes configurations. v5: A warning will still be logged but the configuration is ignored, and no automatic upgrading happens any more. Troubleshooting tips: If your application had parameters listed in the ignored_params configuration, you will need to move them to attributes.exclude. Node version support Node 6 is the earliest version supported by the New Relic Node.js v5 agent. Node 4 and 5 are not supported by v5. Customers running Node 4 or 5 have two options: Upgrade to a supported version of Node and take advantage of the New Relic Node.js v5 agent's new features. Remain on New Relic Node.js v4 agent without the ability to use new features only available with update agent versions. Node 7 and 9 no longer receive updates, but New Relic will continue to support these versions of Node for the time being. Tip Upgrade to a newer version of Node as soon as possible. The next major version of the New Relic Node.js agent will likely remove support for Node 6 and 7. Feature flags as of v5 As of New Relic for Node.js v5: custom_instrumentation: This feature is no longer configurable. custom_metrics: This feature is no longer configurable. synthetics: This feature is no longer configurable. native_metrics: This feature is now controlled by the plugins.native_metrics.enabled configuration value. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 4 Before upgrading to Node.js agent v4, review this information for major changes. Also see New Relic's Node.js v4 migration guide on GitHub. Upgrade https-proxy-agent from v0 to v2 Major changes with Node.js v4 agent include an upgrade of the https-proxy-agent from v0 to v2. This dependency has been updated due to a security issue in the https-proxy-agent that the New Relic Node.js agent used. Because https-proxy v2 is incompatible with node v0.10 and v0.12, New Relic has deprecated those agent versions. There is no required action to migrate from v3 to v4 of New Relic's Node.js agent. Node version support Node 4 is the earliest version supported by the New Relic Node.js v4 agent. Node 0.10 and 0.12 are not supported by v4. Customers running Node 0.10 or 0.12 have two options: Upgrade to a supported version of Node and take advantage of the New Relic Node.js v4 agent's new features. Remain on the New Relic Node.js v3 agent without the ability to use new features only available with updated agent versions. Node 4, 5, and 7 also no longer receive updates, but New Relic will continue to support these versions of Node for the time being. Tip Upgrade to a newer version of Node as soon as possible. The next major version of the New Relic Node.js agent will likely remove support for Node 4 and 5. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 3 Before upgrading to Node.js agent agent v3, review this information for major changes. Also see New Relic's Node.js v3 migration guide on GitHub. Major changes with Node.js v3 agent Major changes with Node.js v3 agent Comments Removed SSL configuration v2: With the v2 agent, it was possible to configure the agent to connect to New Relic without encryption. v3: Node.js agent v3 always connects to New Relic servers using TLS encryption to protect communications. If the agent is configured to disable this, a warning is logged and the setting is ignored. Request parameters now prefixed with request.parameters. v2: The v2 agent collects request parameters, such as route parameters (/users/:userId) and query parameters (/users?userId=123), as the parameter name (userId). v3: The v3 agent prefixes all request parameters with the string request.parameters.. For example,userId appears as request.parameters.userId. Troubleshooting tips: If you have dashboards, alert policies, or other NRQL queries based on request parameters, update them with the new parameter names. Feature flags as of v3 As of New Relic Node.js agent v3, the send_request_uri_attribute feature is no longer configurable. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 2 Before upgrading to Node.js agent v2, review this information for major changes. Also see New Relic's Node.js v2 migration guide on GitHub. Major changes with Node.js v2 agent Major changes with Node.js v2 agent Comments Reversed naming and ignore rules v1: With the v1 agent, rules defined in the config properties rules.name and rules.ignore were applied in reverse order; the first rule in the list was applied last. v2: Node.js agent v2 applies rules in the order they are defined, so the first rule in the list is applied first. Troubleshooting tips: If you used naming rules in the v1 agent and notice problems, reverse the order of your rules in your configuration. De-duplicated HTTP request transactions v1: The v1 agent started a new transaction for each listener on an HTTP server's request event. In applications with multiple listeners on the request event, this resulted in extraneous transactions being created that almost always did not get named correctly. v2: The v2 agent only creates a single transaction for each request event emitted. Troubleshooting tips: If you used multiple request event listeners and added a call to newrelic.ignoreTransaction() to remove the extra transactions, remove those calls. Stopped swallowing outbound request errors v1: The v1 agent swallowed unhandled error events emitted by outbound HTTP request objects. v2: The v2 agent removes this behavior. Instead, the v2 agent does not change normal Node execution. This means the error event will always be emitted. Troubleshooting tips: If you are making outbound requests and currently do not listen for the error event, add a listener and handle the error as appropriate for your application. Updated configuration options as of v2 In newrelic.js, edit the Node.js agent configuration properties you use for compatiblity with the latest versions: Deprecated property New property capture_params attributes.enabled: false By default, request attributes are not sent to New Relic. Set attributes.enabled: true to include agent-defined or custom attributes in traces. The capture_params property has been deprecated. ignored_params attributes.exclude: [] Add any request attribute keys to the attributes.exclude list. Now, instead of having to be an exact match, wildcards (*) may be appended to each item for broader filtering. The ignored_params property has been deprecated. These Node.js agent configuration properties also have overrides for specific destinations, including: transaction_tracer transaction_events error_collector browser_monitoring For example, if the root attributes.enabled is true and you set transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled: false, this will restrict attributes from being collected in transaction traces, while still allowing them for all others. Deprecated API methods as of v2 The following methods from the Node.js agent have been deprecated, and New Relic has deleted them in v5 of the agent. Each has an easy replacement that accomplishes the same task in a more flexible and reliable way. newrelic.createWebTransaction() Replace with newrelic.startWebTransaction() and newrelic.getTransaction(). newrelic.createBackgroundTransaction() Replace with newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction() and newrelic.getTransaction(). newrelic.addCustomParameter() Replace with newrelic.addCustomAttribute(). newrelic.addCustomParameters() Replace with newrelic.addCustomAttributes(). New v2 agent API methods The following API methods are new with the New Relic Node.js v2 agent. newrelic.getTransaction() This method gets a reference to the currently running transaction. Use in conjunction with: newrelic.startWebTransaction newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction Callback-based message consumer services for troubleshooting message consumers newrelic.startWebTransaction()newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction() These new API methods replace the older create*Transaction methods. They are easier to use and seamlessly work with promises. Unlike the v1 method, the provided callback is invoked immediately. newrelic.instrument()newrelic.instrumentDatastore()newrelic.instrumentWebframework()newrelic.instrumentMessages() Use these methods to add custom instrumentation for third party modules, including those already instrumented by the New Relic Node.js agent. For more information, see New Relic's Node.js instrumentation tutorials on GitHub. newrelic.addCustomAttribute() Use this method to add a custom trace attribute. newrelic.addCustomAttributes() Use this method to add multiple custom trace attributes. Node version support for v2 The earliest version of Node supported by the New Relic Node.js v2 agent is 0.10. Node 0.8, which has not been updated since July of 2014, is not supported by v2. Customers running Node 0.8 have two options: Upgrade to a supported version of Node and take advantage of the New Relic Node.js v2 agent's new features. Remain on New Relic Node.js v1 agent without the ability to use new features only available with updated agent versions. Node 0.10 also no longer receives updates, but New Relic will continue to support this version of Node for the time being. Recommendation: Upgrade to a newer version of Node as soon as possible. npm version support as of v2 The New Relic Node.js agent now requires npm version 2.0.0 or higher. This version of npm comes packaged with Node 0.10.44 or higher. If you are using an earlier version of Node 0.10 you will need to first install npm 2.0.0 or higher, or upgrade to a newer version of Node. To install npm version 2: $ npm install --global npm@2 Copy Feature flags as of v2 As of New Relic Node.js agent v2: express_segments: This feature is no longer configurable. cat: This feature is now controlled by the cross_application_tracer.enabled configuration value. Framework minimum versions as of v2 As of New Relic Node.js agent v2: Module V2 minimum Minimum before v2 express 4.6.0 2.0.0 mysql 2.0.0 0.9.0",

Add Node.js data Install the Node.js agent Important If you're using the agent in a Docker container, install the agent in each container. To install the Node.js agent: Ensure you meet the system requirements. In particular, make sure you use a supported Node version. Use the command npm install newrelic --save for each application you want to monitor. From node_modules/newrelic, copy newrelic.js into the root directory of your app. Configure agent via the newrelic.js file or via environment variable: Customize the license_key setting with your license key. Customize the app_name setting with one or more meaningful app names. Add require('newrelic'); as the first line of your app's main module. Optional: For additional Node.js runtime-level statistics, ensure the @newrelic/native-metrics package is installed. Generate some traffic, then wait a few minutes for data to appear in the APM UI. You can further customize your agent behavior via newrelic.js or an environment variable. To keep the agent configuration separate from your app, edit the NEW_RELIC_HOME environmental variable. Keep your Node.js agent up-to-date To ensure that you have the most up-to-date version of New Relic, refer to the Node.js release notes. When applicable, the release notes include a download link with instructions on how to update the Node.js agent. Troubleshooting After you update the agent, generate some traffic and wait a few minutes. If no data appears in the New Relic UI, see the troubleshooting procedures.",

      "body": "To take full advantage of New Relic's latest features, enhancements, and important security patches, we recommend you update your Node.js agent to the latest version. For additional information about specific agent updates, refer to the Node.js agent release notes. The release notes include a download link when applicable, plus instructions to download and install the latest version. If the newrelic module is listed in your package.json, run npm install. If you want to target just the newrelic module, run npm update newrelic. Recommendation: Test your updated version before moving it into production. If you have problems, follow the Node.js agent troubleshooting procedures. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 7 Before upgrading to Node.js version 7, review this information for major changes. Major changes with Node.js agent v7 Comments BREAKING Removed deprecated httpResponseCode, response.status and httpResponseMessage http response attributes v6.4.2-v6.14.0: Starting in agent v6.4.2, these attributes were marked as deprecated but left in to give a transition period for the new attributes. v7: When http response attribute reporting is enabled, http.statusCode and http.statusText will be reported. BREAKING Removed deprecated setIgnoreTransaction API method v5 - v6: Starting in agent v5.0.0, this method was marked as deprecated but left in to give a transition period for the new methods. v7: Applications must use the API method transactionHandle.ignore(). BREAKING Removed the api.custom_parameters_enabled configuration item and associated environment variable NEW_RELIC_API_CUSTOM_PARAMETERS. Applications must use the configuration api.custom_attributes_enabled or the associated environment variable NEW_RELIC_API_CUSTOM_ATTRIBUTES to enable newrelic.addCustomAttribute and newrelic.addCustomAttributes. BREAKING Removed deprecated Distributed Tracing API methods, createDistributedTracePayload() and acceptDistributedTracePayload() v6.4.0-v6.14.0: Starting in agent v6.4.0, these method were marked as deprecated but left in to give a transition period for the new methods. v7: Applications must use the API methods transactionHandle.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(headers) and transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(transportType, headers) . With these methods, the Node agent will now accept W3C's traceparent and tracestate headers when calling transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(headers) and include the W3C headers along with the New Relic distributed tracing header when calling transactionHandle.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(headers), unless the New Relic trace header format is disabled using distributed_tracing.exclude_newrelic_header:true. Update New Relic Dependencies to versions with updated Node version support @newrelic/aws-sdk v3.0.0 @newrelic/koa v5.0.0 @newrelic/native-metrics v6.0.0 @newrelic/superagent v4.0.0 @newrelic/test-utilities v5.0.0 Node version support Node v10 is the earliest version supported by the New Relic Node.js v7 agent. Node 8 and 9 are not supported by v7. Customers running Node 9 and earlier have two options: Upgrade to a supported version of Node and take advantage of the New Relic Node.js v7 agent's new features. Remain on New Relic Node.js v6 agent without the ability to use new features only available with update agent versions. Node 10 no longer receive updates, but New Relic will continue to support these versions of Node for the time being. Tip Upgrade to a newer version of Node as soon as possible. The next major version of the New Relic Node.js agent will likely remove support for Node 10. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 6 Before upgrading to Node.js agent version 6, review this information for major changes. Major changes with Node.js agent v6 Comments Upgraded official Koa framework instrumentation module to v3.0.0 v6: Added support for @koa/router up to v8.0.2. @koa/router v8.0.3 and greater are currently unsupported. v6: Added support for Node v12 and removed support for Node v6, 7, and 9. The minimum supported version is Node v8. Also see New Relic's Koa Release Notes on Github.. Removed deprecated max_samples_per_minute configuration parameter, which is replaced by max_samples_stored behavior v1 - v5: max_samples_per_minute defined the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If your application previously used max_samples_per_minute as an upper bound, you may need to lower the threshold to a valid maximum to avoid data being dropped on the server. We recommend less than 10k. v5: In agent v5 and lower, max_samples_stored defined the maximum number of events the agent stores if it's unable to communicate with the New Relic collector. v6: The new behavior of max_samples_stored defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. This usage of the configuration is consistent with the other APM agents. Troubleshooting tips: If you're missing event data, increase the value of max_samples_stored or revert to the default value. The value of max_samples_stored should not be over 10,000. Node version support Node 8 is the earliest version supported by the New Relic Node.js v6 agent. Node 6, 7 and 9 are not supported by v6. Customers running Node 6, 7 and 9 have two options: Upgrade to a supported version of Node and take advantage of the New Relic Node.js v6 agent's new features. Remain on New Relic Node.js v5 agent without the ability to use new features only available with update agent versions. Node 8 no longer receive updates, but New Relic will continue to support these versions of Node for the time being. Tip Upgrade to a newer version of Node as soon as possible. The next major version of the New Relic Node.js agent will likely remove support for Node 8. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 5 Before upgrading to Node.js agent v5, review this information for major changes. Also see New Relic's Node.js v5 migration guide on GitHub. Major changes with Node.js v5 agent Comments Removed deprecated addCustomParameter methods. v2 - v4: Starting in agent v2.7.0, these methods were marked as deprecated but left in to give a transition period for the new methods. v5: Applications must use the API methods newrelic.addCustomAttribute() and newrelic.addCustomAttributes(). These are drop-in replacements for the old methods. Removed deprecated create*Transaction methods. v2 - v4: Starting in agent v2.0.2, these methods were marked as deprecated but left in to give a transition period to the new methods. v5: Applications must update to the API methods newrelic.startWebTransaction() and newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction(). Troubleshooting tips: These new methods are not drop-in replacements for the old ones. Before moving to these new methods, review our custom instrumentation guide. Removed deprecated createTracer method. v3 - v4: Starting in agent v3.3.0, this method was marked as deprecated in favor of newrelic.startSegment(). v5: Applications must update to newrelic.startSegment(). Removed node-cassandra-cql instrumentation. v4: Applications using the npm package node-cassandra-cql would get datastore metrics for Cassandra. v5: Applications must migrate to the cassandra-driver package to get Cassandra datastore metrics. This module is actively maintained by the same developers. The node-cassandra-cql package was abandoned in February of 2014 in favor of the cassandra-driver package. Removed deprecated capture_params and ignored_params configurations. v2 - v4: Starting in agent v2.7.0, these configuration parameters caused a warning to be logged, and the values were automatically upgraded to the new attributes configurations. v5: A warning will still be logged but the configuration is ignored, and no automatic upgrading happens any more. Troubleshooting tips: If your application had parameters listed in the ignored_params configuration, you will need to move them to attributes.exclude. Node version support Node 6 is the earliest version supported by the New Relic Node.js v5 agent. Node 4 and 5 are not supported by v5. Customers running Node 4 or 5 have two options: Upgrade to a supported version of Node and take advantage of the New Relic Node.js v5 agent's new features. Remain on New Relic Node.js v4 agent without the ability to use new features only available with update agent versions. Node 7 and 9 no longer receive updates, but New Relic will continue to support these versions of Node for the time being. Tip Upgrade to a newer version of Node as soon as possible. The next major version of the New Relic Node.js agent will likely remove support for Node 6 and 7. Feature flags as of v5 As of New Relic for Node.js v5: custom_instrumentation: This feature is no longer configurable. custom_metrics: This feature is no longer configurable. synthetics: This feature is no longer configurable. native_metrics: This feature is now controlled by the plugins.native_metrics.enabled configuration value. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 4 Before upgrading to Node.js agent v4, review this information for major changes. Also see New Relic's Node.js v4 migration guide on GitHub. Upgrade https-proxy-agent from v0 to v2 Major changes with Node.js v4 agent include an upgrade of the https-proxy-agent from v0 to v2. This dependency has been updated due to a security issue in the https-proxy-agent that the New Relic Node.js agent used. Because https-proxy v2 is incompatible with node v0.10 and v0.12, New Relic has deprecated those agent versions. There is no required action to migrate from v3 to v4 of New Relic's Node.js agent. Node version support Node 4 is the earliest version supported by the New Relic Node.js v4 agent. Node 0.10 and 0.12 are not supported by v4. Customers running Node 0.10 or 0.12 have two options: Upgrade to a supported version of Node and take advantage of the New Relic Node.js v4 agent's new features. Remain on the New Relic Node.js v3 agent without the ability to use new features only available with updated agent versions. Node 4, 5, and 7 also no longer receive updates, but New Relic will continue to support these versions of Node for the time being. Tip Upgrade to a newer version of Node as soon as possible. The next major version of the New Relic Node.js agent will likely remove support for Node 4 and 5. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 3 Before upgrading to Node.js agent agent v3, review this information for major changes. Also see New Relic's Node.js v3 migration guide on GitHub. Major changes with Node.js v3 agent Major changes with Node.js v3 agent Comments Removed SSL configuration v2: With the v2 agent, it was possible to configure the agent to connect to New Relic without encryption. v3: Node.js agent v3 always connects to New Relic servers using TLS encryption to protect communications. If the agent is configured to disable this, a warning is logged and the setting is ignored. Request parameters now prefixed with request.parameters. v2: The v2 agent collects request parameters, such as route parameters (/users/:userId) and query parameters (/users?userId=123), as the parameter name (userId). v3: The v3 agent prefixes all request parameters with the string request.parameters.. For example,userId appears as request.parameters.userId. Troubleshooting tips: If you have dashboards, alert policies, or other NRQL queries based on request parameters, update them with the new parameter names. Feature flags as of v3 As of New Relic Node.js agent v3, the send_request_uri_attribute feature is no longer configurable. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 2 Before upgrading to Node.js agent v2, review this information for major changes. Also see New Relic's Node.js v2 migration guide on GitHub. Major changes with Node.js v2 agent Major changes with Node.js v2 agent Comments Reversed naming and ignore rules v1: With the v1 agent, rules defined in the config properties rules.name and rules.ignore were applied in reverse order; the first rule in the list was applied last. v2: Node.js agent v2 applies rules in the order they are defined, so the first rule in the list is applied first. Troubleshooting tips: If you used naming rules in the v1 agent and notice problems, reverse the order of your rules in your configuration. De-duplicated HTTP request transactions v1: The v1 agent started a new transaction for each listener on an HTTP server's request event. In applications with multiple listeners on the request event, this resulted in extraneous transactions being created that almost always did not get named correctly. v2: The v2 agent only creates a single transaction for each request event emitted. Troubleshooting tips: If you used multiple request event listeners and added a call to newrelic.ignoreTransaction() to remove the extra transactions, remove those calls. Stopped swallowing outbound request errors v1: The v1 agent swallowed unhandled error events emitted by outbound HTTP request objects. v2: The v2 agent removes this behavior. Instead, the v2 agent does not change normal Node execution. This means the error event will always be emitted. Troubleshooting tips: If you are making outbound requests and currently do not listen for the error event, add a listener and handle the error as appropriate for your application. Updated configuration options as of v2 In newrelic.js, edit the Node.js agent configuration properties you use for compatiblity with the latest versions: Deprecated property New property capture_params attributes.enabled: false By default, request attributes are not sent to New Relic. Set attributes.enabled: true to include agent-defined or custom attributes in traces. The capture_params property has been deprecated. ignored_params attributes.exclude: [] Add any request attribute keys to the attributes.exclude list. Now, instead of having to be an exact match, wildcards (*) may be appended to each item for broader filtering. The ignored_params property has been deprecated. These Node.js agent configuration properties also have overrides for specific destinations, including: transaction_tracer transaction_events error_collector browser_monitoring For example, if the root attributes.enabled is true and you set transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled: false, this will restrict attributes from being collected in transaction traces, while still allowing them for all others. Deprecated API methods as of v2 The following methods from the Node.js agent have been deprecated, and New Relic has deleted them in v5 of the agent. Each has an easy replacement that accomplishes the same task in a more flexible and reliable way. newrelic.createWebTransaction() Replace with newrelic.startWebTransaction() and newrelic.getTransaction(). newrelic.createBackgroundTransaction() Replace with newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction() and newrelic.getTransaction(). newrelic.addCustomParameter() Replace with newrelic.addCustomAttribute(). newrelic.addCustomParameters() Replace with newrelic.addCustomAttributes(). New v2 agent API methods The following API methods are new with the New Relic Node.js v2 agent. newrelic.getTransaction() This method gets a reference to the currently running transaction. Use in conjunction with: newrelic.startWebTransaction newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction Callback-based message consumer services for troubleshooting message consumers newrelic.startWebTransaction()newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction() These new API methods replace the older create*Transaction methods. They are easier to use and seamlessly work with promises. Unlike the v1 method, the provided callback is invoked immediately. newrelic.instrument()newrelic.instrumentDatastore()newrelic.instrumentWebframework()newrelic.instrumentMessages() Use these methods to add custom instrumentation for third party modules, including those already instrumented by the New Relic Node.js agent. For more information, see New Relic's Node.js instrumentation tutorials on GitHub. newrelic.addCustomAttribute() Use this method to add a custom trace attribute. newrelic.addCustomAttributes() Use this method to add multiple custom trace attributes. Node version support for v2 The earliest version of Node supported by the New Relic Node.js v2 agent is 0.10. Node 0.8, which has not been updated since July of 2014, is not supported by v2. Customers running Node 0.8 have two options: Upgrade to a supported version of Node and take advantage of the New Relic Node.js v2 agent's new features. Remain on New Relic Node.js v1 agent without the ability to use new features only available with updated agent versions. Node 0.10 also no longer receives updates, but New Relic will continue to support this version of Node for the time being. Recommendation: Upgrade to a newer version of Node as soon as possible. npm version support as of v2 The New Relic Node.js agent now requires npm version 2.0.0 or higher. This version of npm comes packaged with Node 0.10.44 or higher. If you are using an earlier version of Node 0.10 you will need to first install npm 2.0.0 or higher, or upgrade to a newer version of Node. To install npm version 2: $ npm install --global npm@2 Copy Feature flags as of v2 As of New Relic Node.js agent v2: express_segments: This feature is no longer configurable. cat: This feature is now controlled by the cross_application_tracer.enabled configuration value.

      "body": "You can tailor the Node.js agent to your app's requirements by editing your newrelic.js config file or by setting an environment variable. The config file resides in the root directory of your app. You can also configure a few options from New Relic, or use the Node.js agent API. Important The license_key setting is required. We highly recommend setting the app_name so that your app has a meaningful name instead of the default My Application. Configuration methods and precedence The primary method to configure the Node.js agent is the agent configuration file (newrelic.js). You can also configure most settings with environment variables. You can also adjust some settings with server-side configuration. The Node.js agent uses this order of precedence for configuration methods: Node.js configuration hierarchy: Server-side configuration settings override environment variables. Environment variables override the agent config file. The config file overrides the agent defaults. Here are detailed descriptions of each configuration method: Agent configuration file The config file (newrelic.js) contains every Node.js agent setting. When you install the Node.js agent, you must copy newrelic.js into your app's root directory. Most settings are empty by default; they inherit their values from config/default.js. Environment variables Most configuration settings in newrelic.js have equivalent environment variables. These are useful, for example, if your agent runs in a PaaS environment such as Heroku or Microsoft Azure. Node.js agent environment variables always start with NEW_RELIC_. Where available, these environment variables are documented below under individual config options as the Environ variable. There are also two rarely used settings that can only be configured via environment variables. Server-side configuration Owners and Admins can view and configure a few settings directly in New Relic. Where available, the UI labels for server-side config are listed in this document under individual config options as the Server-side label. Exports variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the exports.config = { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. app_name (REQUIRED) Type String Default \"My Application\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME The name New Relic uses to identify your app. For example, app_name: ['MyNodeApp']. To use multiple names for your app, specify a comma-delimited list of names. Data for all applications with the same name will be merged in the New Relic UI, so set this carefully. We highly recommend that you replace the default name with a descriptive name to avoid confusion and unintended aggregation of data. Tip For Azure users, the Node.js agent will use APP_POOL_ID if it is set, so you can use the name you chose for your Azure Web Server without setting it twice. license_key (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY This setting is required. Your New Relic license key. For example, license_key: '40HexadecimalCharacters'. agent_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ENABLED Set to false to stop the agent from starting up. This is useful when debugging your code requires temporarily disabling the agent. It prevents the agent from bootstrapping its instrumentation or setting up all its pieces, which prevents the agent from starting up and connecting to New Relic's servers. allow_all_headers If true, enables capture of all HTTP headers, except for those filtered by exclude rules. If false, collected headers are limited to those defined in Node.js agent attributes. Type Boolean Default false Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. apdex_t (DEPRECATED) Type Number Default 0.100 Server-side label Apdex T Set your Apdex T via the New Relic UI. certificates Type Array of strings Default (none) Additional certificates to trust for SSL connections, specified as an array of strings in PEM format. This affects both connections to an HTTPS proxy and connections to New Relic. Tip You can also configure the agent to read its certificates from a file: certificates: [ fs.readFileSync('myca.crt', {encoding: 'utf8'}) ] Copy high_security Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HIGH_SECURITY When set to true, enables high security v2. You must also enable the ssl setting and enable high security in the UI. host Type String Default collector.newrelic.com Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HOST Important Do not edit this value unless New Relic Support asks you to change it. Hostname for the New Relic collector to connect to the Internet; for example, host: 'collector.newrelic.com'. labels Adds tags. Specify your tags as objects or a semicolon-delimited string of colon-separated pairs (for example, Server:One;Data Center:Primary). Type Object or string Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LABELS port Type Integer Default 443 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PORT Important Do not edit this value unless New Relic Support asks you to change it. Port number to connect to the New Relic collector; for example, port: 443. proxy Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_URL A URL specifying the proxy server to connect to the Internet. For example, proxy: 'http://user:pass@10.0.0.1:8000/'. Important The proxy config file setting overrides the other config file proxy settings (proxy_host, proxy_port, proxy_user, proxy_pass) if used. Similarly, the NEW_RELIC_PROXY_URL environment variable overrides the other environment variable proxy settings (NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST, NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT, NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER, and NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS) if used. proxy_host Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST Hostname or IP address of the proxy server to connect to the Internet. proxy_pass Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS Password for authenticating to the proxy server. The agent supports only basic HTTP authentication. proxy_port Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT Port number of the proxy server to connect to the Internet. proxy_user Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER User name for authenticating to the proxy server. The agent supports only basic HTTP authentication. Logging variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the logging: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enabled Type String Default true (false in serverless_mode) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_ENABLED Enables or disables agent specific logging. level Type String Default info Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Defines the level of detail recorded in the agent logs. From least detail to most detail, possible values are fatal, error, warn, info, debug, or trace. Caution Do not use debug or trace logging unless New Relic Support asks you to use them. These levels of logging can generate excessive overhead. For most situations, use info. filepath Type String Default process.cwd() plus newrelic_agent.log Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG Complete path to the New Relic agent log, including the filename. Defaults to filepath: require('path').join(process.cwd(), 'newrelic_agent.log'). The agent will shut down the process if it cannot create this file. The agent creates a log file with the same permissions as the parent Node.js agent process. To write all logging to stdout, set this to stdout. To write all logging to stderr, set this to stderr. Audit logging This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the audit_log: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enabled Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_AUDIT_LOG_ENABLED When enabled, the agent logs the payloads it sends to the collector. This data is included in the main log file even when logging level is set to the lowest level. endpoints Type Array Default Empty array (include all types) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_AUDIT_LOG_ENDPOINTS The agent sends several different types of data to the collector in separate payloads. By default, all of them are included in the log file. This option makes it possible to limit logging only to specific types of data. Valid values include: agent_settings analytic_event_data connect custom_event_data error_data error_event_data metric_data preconnect shutdown span_event_data sql_trace_data transaction_sample_data API configuration This section allows you to choose which API methods are enabled. Each configuration option allows you to modularly enable API methods that are responsible for sending custom information to New Relic. Important All of these are set to false when the agent is in high security mode. custom_attributes_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_API_CUSTOM_ATTRIBUTES This option enables newrelic.addCustomAttribute and newrelic.addCustomAttributes. custom_events_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_API_CUSTOM_EVENTS This option enables recordCustomEvent. notice_error_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_API_NOTICE_ERROR This option enables newrelic.noticeError. Attributes This section defines the variables for Node.js agent attributes in the order they typically appear in the attributes: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, enables capture of attributes for all destinations. exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from all destinations. Allows * as wildcard at end. include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include from all destinations. Allows * as wildcard at end. include_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE_ENABLED When true, patterns may be added to the attributes.include list. Error collector variables You can manage how error are handled in New Relic. This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the error_collector: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ENABLED Server-side label Enable error collection? When enabled, the agent collects error traces from your app. ignore_status_codes Type Array Default 404 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_ERROR_CODES Server-side label Ignore these status codes Comma-delimited list of HTTP status codes for the error collector to ignore. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. ignore_classes Type Array|Object Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_ERRORS Comma-delimited list of javascript error types/classes for the error collector to ignore. The following configuration /* ... */ error_collector: { ignore_classes: [\"ReferenceError\"] } /* ... */ Copy Would ignore all reference errors. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. ignore_messages Type Object Default {} A javascript object describing a list of javascript classes tied to javascript error messages for the collector to ignore. The following configuration. /* ... */ error_collector: { /* ... */ ignore_messages: {\"Error\":[\"Undefined\", \"Out of time\"]} /* ... */ } /* ... */ Copy Would ignore all errors of type Error, with the exact (case-sensitive) message strings of Undefined and Out of time. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. expected_status_codes Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_EXPECTED_ERROR_CODES Comma-delimited list of HTTP status codes for the error collector to mark as expected. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. expected_classes Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_EXPECTED_ERRORS The following configuration /* ... */ error_collector: { expected_classes: [\"ReferenceError\"] } /* ... */ Copy Would mark all reference errors as expected. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. expected_messages Type Object Default {} A javascript object describing a list of javascript classes tied to javascript error messages for the collector to ignore. The following configuration. /* ... */ error_collector: { /* ... */ expected_messages: {\"Error\":[\"Undefined\", \"Out of time\"]} /* ... */ } /* ... */ Copy Would mark all errors of type Error, with the exact (case-sensitive) message strings of Undefined and Out of time. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent captures attributes from error collection. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from error collection. Allows * as wildcard at end. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include in error collection. Allows * as wildcard at end. Transaction tracer variables The agent groups your requests into transactions, which are used to: Visualize where your app spends its time (in transaction breakdowns). Identify slow requests. Group metrics. Isolate other issues, such as slow database performance. This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the transaction_tracer: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. Important Do not use brackets [suffix] at the end of your transaction name. New Relic automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRACER_ENABLED Server-side label Enable transaction tracing? When enabled, the agent collects slow transaction traces. explain_threshold Type Integer Default 500 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_EXPLAIN_THRESHOLD Minimum query duration (in milliseconds) for a transaction to be eligible for slow queries in transaction traces. record_sql Type String (off, obfuscated, or raw) Default off Environ variable NEW_RELIC_RECORD_SQL This option affects both slow queries and record_sql for transaction traces. It can have one of three values: off, obfuscated, or raw. When set to off no slow queries will be captured, and backtraces and SQL will not be included in transaction traces. If set to raw or obfuscated, the agent sends raw or obfuscated SQL and a slow query sample to the collector. The agent may also send SQL when other criteria are met, such as when slow_sql.enabled is set. top_n Type Integer Default 20 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRACER_TOP_N Defines the maximum number of requests eligible for transaction traces. Transactions are named based on the request, and top_n refers to the \"top n slowest transactions\" grouped by these names. The module replaces a recorded trace with a new trace only if the new trace is slower than the previous slowest trace of that name. The default value for this setting is top_n: 20, because the Transactions page also defaults to the 20 slowest transactions. The Node.js agent captures at least five different slow transactions in the first harvest cycle after start up. It will also reset and capture different transactions if no slow transactions have been captured for the last five harvest cycles. This allows you to see more information about more of your app's request paths, at the possible cost of not focusing on the absolutely slowest request for that harvest cycle. Tip To record the absolute slowest transaction over the last minute, you can set top_n: 0 or top_n: 1. However, this causes one very slow route to dominate your transaction traces. transaction_threshold Type Integer or apdex_f Default apdex_f Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRACER_THRESHOLD Server-side label Threshold Threshold of web transaction response time in seconds beyond which a transaction is eligible for transaction tracing. The default value is apdex_f; this sets the trace threshold to four times your application's Apdex T. You can also enter a specific time value in milliseconds. Example: Threshold set to apdex_f The default apdex_t is 100 milliseconds. If your transaction threshold is set to apdex_f, a \"slow\" transaction is 400 milliseconds. hide_internals Type boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HIDE_INTERNALS The agent uses a small amount of CPU in order to hide internal properties that are attached to the web application. If you change this configuration to false, it may slightly decrease your agent overhead, but it could also have an impact on the performance of the agent. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent captures attributes from transaction traces. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from transaction traces. Allows * as wildcard at end. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include in transaction traces. Allows * as wildcard at end. Rules variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the rules: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. name Type Strings or regular expressions Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES A comma-delimited list of rules to match incoming request URLs and name the associated New Relic transaction. Uses the format: name: [ {pattern: 'STRING_OR_REGEX', name: 'NAME'}, {pattern: 'STRING_OR_REGEX', name: 'NAME'} ], Copy Both parameters are required. For strings, you must escape control characters. You do not need to escape control characters in regular expressions. Additional attributes are ignored. Regular expressions support JavaScript-style capture groups, and names use $1-style replacement strings. Regular expressions only find the first matching result; subsequent matches are ignored. For more information, see Node.js transaction naming API. For the NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES environment variable, pass the rules as comma-delimited JSON object literals: NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES='{\"pattern\":\"^t\",\"name\":\"u\"},{\"pattern\":\"^u\",\"name\":\"t\"}' Copy ignore Type Strings or regular expressions Default Regular expression to match socket.io long-polling requests (\"^ \\ /socket \\ .io \\ /. * \\ /xhr-polling/\"). Environ variable NEW_RELIC_IGNORING_RULES Define a list of request URLs you want the agent to ignore. Specify the list as patterns, which can be strings or regular expressions. enforce_backstop Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ENFORCE_BACKSTOP Caution Do not change this setting unless you understand metric grouping issues. When enabled, the agent renames transactions that are not affected by other naming logic (such as the API, rules, or metric normalization rules) to NormalizedUri/*. If you set this to false, the agent sets transaction names to Uri/path/to/resource. Transaction events variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the transaction_events: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enabled Type Boolean Default true When enabled, the agent sends transaction events to New Relic. This event data includes transaction timing, transaction name, and any custom parameters. If this is disabled, the agent does not collect this data or send it to New Relic. max_samples_stored Type Integer Default 10000 Defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. We do not recommend configuring past 10k. The server will cap data at 10k per-minute. Important This configuration had different behavior in agent versions lower than 6.0.0. See max_samples_stored (DEPRECATED) for agent versions 5.x or lower. max_samples_stored (DEPRECATED) Type Integer Default 20000 Defines the maximum number of events the agent stores if it is unable to communicate with the New Relic collector. The values from the previous harvest cycle will be merged into the next one, with this option limiting the maximum number. Make sure this number is greater than max_samples_per_minute; for example, set it to twice as much. Consider your memory overhead before increasing this value. Caution This configuration has different behavior starting with agent version 6.0.0 and a new recommended maximum. See max_samples_stored for agent versions 6.x or higher. max_samples_per_minute (DEPRECATED) Type Integer Default 10000 Defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. Caution This configuration has been replaced with max_samples_stored starting with version 6.0.0 of the agent. See max_samples_stored for 6.x or later agents. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent captures attributes from transaction events. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from transaction events. Allows * as wildcard at end. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include in transaction events. Allows * as wildcard at end. Browser monitoring variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the browser_monitoring: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enable Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITOR_ENABLE Server-side label Enable browser monitoring? Generate JavaScript headers for browser instrumentation. Although this defaults to true, the agent doesn't inject the browser JS code unless you have enabled browser monitoring. Even if you have enabled it and added the browser timing header, you can disable browser monitoring for your app by setting this to false. debug Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITOR_DEBUG If true, request un-minified sources from the server. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITORING_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent sends custom attributes to browser monitoring. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITORING_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from browser monitoring. Allows * as wildcard at end. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITORING_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include in browser monitoring. Allows * as wildcard at end. Custom events variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the custom_insights_events: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. Currently there are no environment variables for custom events. enabled Type Boolean Default true When enabled, the agent sends custom events recorded with recordCustomEvent() to New Relic. If this is disabled, the agent does not collect this data or send it to New Relic. max_samples_stored Type Integer Default 1000 Defines the maximum number of custom events the agent collects per minute. If the number of custom events exceeds this limit, the agent collects a statistical sampling. Important Increasing this limit increases memory usage. Slow queries variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the slow_sql: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. These options control behavior for slow queries, but do not affect SQL nodes in transaction traces. enabled Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SLOW_SQL_ENABLED When enabled, the agent collects slow query details. max_samples Type Integer Default 10 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MAX_SQL_SAMPLES Defines the maximum number of slow queries the agent collects per minute. The agent discards additional queries after the limit is reached. Important Increasing this limit increases memory usage. Custom hostname variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the process_host: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. These options control behavior regarding the host display name in the New Relic APM UI. display_name Type String of 255 bytes or less Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME Specify a custom hostname for display in New Relic. If you do not set this field, New Relic will continue to use the default hostname found by calling os.hostname(). If you use the default hostname settings, New Relic finds the hostname through os.hostname(). If this call fails, New Relic uses the host's IP as the name. If you set ipv_preference: 4 or ipv_preference: 6, you can select the type of IP address (IPv4 or IPv6) that appears in the New Relic UI. ipv_preference Type Integer (4 or 6) Default 4 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_IPV_PREFERENCE Environment variable overrides This section defines two configuration options only available with environment variables. These overrides are not used in most configurations. NEW_RELIC_HOME Path to the directory containing newrelic.js. This is available only as an environment variable. You cannot set it in your config file. Type String Default (none) NEW_RELIC_NO_CONFIG_FILE If used, this prevents the agent from reading configuration settings from newrelic.js. Default values and values from environment variables will still be set. This is available only as an environment variable. You cannot set it in your config file. Type Boolean Default False Datastore tracer variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the datastore_tracer section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. These options control behavior for collecting datastore instance metrics. instance_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true When enabled, the agent collects datastore instance metrics (such as host and port) for some database drivers. These are reported on slow query traces and transaction traces. database_name_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true When enabled, the agent collects database name on slow query traces and transaction traces for some database drivers. Cross application tracing The Node.js agent variables that control cross application tracing typically appear in the cross_application_tracer section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file: enabled Type Boolean Default true When set to true, allows tracing of transactions across more than one New Relic-monitored applications. Error message redaction variables The Node.js agent variables that control error message redaction appear in the allow_raw_exception_messages section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file: enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ALLOW_RAW_EXCEPTION_MESSAGES_ENABLED When false, the agent will redact the messages of captured errors. Distributed tracing Important Enabling distributed tracing disables cross application tracing, and has effects on other APM features. Before enabling, read the transition guide. Requires Node.js agent version 4.7.0 or higher. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. When configuring via the config file, place the following option in the distributed_tracing section. When distributed tracing is enabled, you can collect span events. enabled Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED Set this to true to enable distributed tracing. For example, to enable this in the config file, you would use: distributed_tracing: { enabled: true } Copy exclude_newrelic_header Type Boolean Default false Set this to true to exclude the New Relic header that is attached to outbound requests, and instead only rely on W3C Trace Context Headers for distributed tracing. If this is false then both types of headers are used. For example, to enable this in the config file, you would use: distributed_tracing:{ enabled: true, exclude_newrelic_header: true } Copy Span events Span events are reported for distributed tracing. Distributed tracing must be enabled to report span events. Span configuration is set in the span_events stanza. Options include: enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ENABLED Turns reporting of span events on or off. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED This setting can be used to turn reporting of attributes on or off for span events. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent to span events regardless on how this is set. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE If attributes are enabled for span events, all attribute keys found in this list will be attached to span events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent with span events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Infinite Tracing To turn on Infinite Tracing, enable distributed tracing (set distributed_tracing to enabled: true) and add the additional settings below. For an example, see Language Agents: Configure Distributed Tracing. trace_observer.host Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST For help getting a valid Infinite Tracing trace observer host entry, see Find or create a trace observer endpoint.",

Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Add Node.js data Install the Node.js agent Important If you're using the agent in a Docker container, install the agent in each container. To install the Node.js agent: Ensure you meet the system requirements. In particular, make sure you use a supported Node version. Use the command npm install newrelic --save for each application you want to monitor. From node_modules/newrelic, copy newrelic.js into the root directory of your app. Configure agent via the newrelic.js file or via environment variable: Customize the license_key setting with your license key. Customize the app_name setting with one or more meaningful app names. Add require('newrelic'); as the first line of your app's main module. Optional: For additional Node.js runtime-level statistics, ensure the @newrelic/native-metrics package is installed. Generate some traffic, then wait a few minutes for data to appear in the APM UI. You can further customize your agent behavior via newrelic.js or an environment variable. To keep the agent configuration separate from your app, edit the NEW_RELIC_HOME environmental variable. Keep your Node.js agent up-to-date To ensure that you have the most up-to-date version of New Relic, refer to the Node.js release notes. When applicable, the release notes include a download link with instructions on how to update the Node.js agent. Troubleshooting After you update the agent, generate some traffic and wait a few minutes. If no data appears in the New Relic UI, see the troubleshooting procedures.",

      "body": "You can tailor the Node.js agent to your app's requirements by editing your newrelic.js config file or by setting an environment variable. The config file resides in the root directory of your app. You can also configure a few options from New Relic, or use the Node.js agent API. Important The license_key setting is required. We highly recommend setting the app_name so that your app has a meaningful name instead of the default My Application. Configuration methods and precedence The primary method to configure the Node.js agent is the agent configuration file (newrelic.js). You can also configure most settings with environment variables. You can also adjust some settings with server-side configuration. The Node.js agent uses this order of precedence for configuration methods: Node.js configuration hierarchy: Server-side configuration settings override environment variables. Environment variables override the agent config file. The config file overrides the agent defaults. Here are detailed descriptions of each configuration method: Agent configuration file The config file (newrelic.js) contains every Node.js agent setting. When you install the Node.js agent, you must copy newrelic.js into your app's root directory. Most settings are empty by default; they inherit their values from config/default.js. Environment variables Most configuration settings in newrelic.js have equivalent environment variables. These are useful, for example, if your agent runs in a PaaS environment such as Heroku or Microsoft Azure. Node.js agent environment variables always start with NEW_RELIC_. Where available, these environment variables are documented below under individual config options as the Environ variable. There are also two rarely used settings that can only be configured via environment variables. Server-side configuration Owners and Admins can view and configure a few settings directly in New Relic. Where available, the UI labels for server-side config are listed in this document under individual config options as the Server-side label. Exports variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the exports.config = { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. app_name (REQUIRED) Type String Default \"My Application\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME The name New Relic uses to identify your app. For example, app_name: ['MyNodeApp']. To use multiple names for your app, specify a comma-delimited list of names. Data for all applications with the same name will be merged in the New Relic UI, so set this carefully. We highly recommend that you replace the default name with a descriptive name to avoid confusion and unintended aggregation of data. Tip For Azure users, the Node.js agent will use APP_POOL_ID if it is set, so you can use the name you chose for your Azure Web Server without setting it twice. license_key (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY This setting is required. Your New Relic license key. For example, license_key: '40HexadecimalCharacters'. agent_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ENABLED Set to false to stop the agent from starting up. This is useful when debugging your code requires temporarily disabling the agent. It prevents the agent from bootstrapping its instrumentation or setting up all its pieces, which prevents the agent from starting up and connecting to New Relic's servers. allow_all_headers If true, enables capture of all HTTP headers, except for those filtered by exclude rules. If false, collected headers are limited to those defined in Node.js agent attributes. Type Boolean Default false Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. apdex_t (DEPRECATED) Type Number Default 0.100 Server-side label Apdex T Set your Apdex T via the New Relic UI. certificates Type Array of strings Default (none) Additional certificates to trust for SSL connections, specified as an array of strings in PEM format. This affects both connections to an HTTPS proxy and connections to New Relic. Tip You can also configure the agent to read its certificates from a file: certificates: [ fs.readFileSync('myca.crt', {encoding: 'utf8'}) ] Copy high_security Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HIGH_SECURITY When set to true, enables high security v2. You must also enable the ssl setting and enable high security in the UI. host Type String Default collector.newrelic.com Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HOST Important Do not edit this value unless New Relic Support asks you to change it. Hostname for the New Relic collector to connect to the Internet; for example, host: 'collector.newrelic.com'. labels Adds tags. Specify your tags as objects or a semicolon-delimited string of colon-separated pairs (for example, Server:One;Data Center:Primary). Type Object or string Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LABELS port Type Integer Default 443 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PORT Important Do not edit this value unless New Relic Support asks you to change it. Port number to connect to the New Relic collector; for example, port: 443. proxy Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_URL A URL specifying the proxy server to connect to the Internet. For example, proxy: 'http://user:pass@10.0.0.1:8000/'. Important The proxy config file setting overrides the other config file proxy settings (proxy_host, proxy_port, proxy_user, proxy_pass) if used. Similarly, the NEW_RELIC_PROXY_URL environment variable overrides the other environment variable proxy settings (NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST, NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT, NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER, and NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS) if used. proxy_host Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST Hostname or IP address of the proxy server to connect to the Internet. proxy_pass Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS Password for authenticating to the proxy server. The agent supports only basic HTTP authentication. proxy_port Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT Port number of the proxy server to connect to the Internet. proxy_user Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER User name for authenticating to the proxy server. The agent supports only basic HTTP authentication. Logging variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the logging: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enabled Type String Default true (false in serverless_mode) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_ENABLED Enables or disables agent specific logging. level Type String Default info Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Defines the level of detail recorded in the agent logs. From least detail to most detail, possible values are fatal, error, warn, info, debug, or trace. Caution Do not use debug or trace logging unless New Relic Support asks you to use them. These levels of logging can generate excessive overhead. For most situations, use info. filepath Type String Default process.cwd() plus newrelic_agent.log Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG Complete path to the New Relic agent log, including the filename. Defaults to filepath: require('path').join(process.cwd(), 'newrelic_agent.log'). The agent will shut down the process if it cannot create this file. The agent creates a log file with the same permissions as the parent Node.js agent process. To write all logging to stdout, set this to stdout. To write all logging to stderr, set this to stderr. Audit logging This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the audit_log: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enabled Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_AUDIT_LOG_ENABLED When enabled, the agent logs the payloads it sends to the collector. This data is included in the main log file even when logging level is set to the lowest level. endpoints Type Array Default Empty array (include all types) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_AUDIT_LOG_ENDPOINTS The agent sends several different types of data to the collector in separate payloads. By default, all of them are included in the log file. This option makes it possible to limit logging only to specific types of data. Valid values include: agent_settings analytic_event_data connect custom_event_data error_data error_event_data metric_data preconnect shutdown span_event_data sql_trace_data transaction_sample_data API configuration This section allows you to choose which API methods are enabled. Each configuration option allows you to modularly enable API methods that are responsible for sending custom information to New Relic. Important All of these are set to false when the agent is in high security mode. custom_attributes_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_API_CUSTOM_ATTRIBUTES This option enables newrelic.addCustomAttribute and newrelic.addCustomAttributes. custom_events_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_API_CUSTOM_EVENTS This option enables recordCustomEvent. notice_error_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_API_NOTICE_ERROR This option enables newrelic.noticeError. Attributes This section defines the variables for Node.js agent attributes in the order they typically appear in the attributes: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, enables capture of attributes for all destinations. exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from all destinations. Allows * as wildcard at end. include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include from all destinations. Allows * as wildcard at end. include_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE_ENABLED When true, patterns may be added to the attributes.include list. Error collector variables You can manage how error are handled in New Relic. This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the error_collector: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ENABLED Server-side label Enable error collection? When enabled, the agent collects error traces from your app. ignore_status_codes Type Array Default 404 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_ERROR_CODES Server-side label Ignore these status codes Comma-delimited list of HTTP status codes for the error collector to ignore. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. ignore_classes Type Array|Object Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_ERRORS Comma-delimited list of javascript error types/classes for the error collector to ignore. The following configuration /* ... */ error_collector: { ignore_classes: [\"ReferenceError\"] } /* ... */ Copy Would ignore all reference errors. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. ignore_messages Type Object Default {} A javascript object describing a list of javascript classes tied to javascript error messages for the collector to ignore. The following configuration. /* ... */ error_collector: { /* ... */ ignore_messages: {\"Error\":[\"Undefined\", \"Out of time\"]} /* ... */ } /* ... */ Copy Would ignore all errors of type Error, with the exact (case-sensitive) message strings of Undefined and Out of time. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. expected_status_codes Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_EXPECTED_ERROR_CODES Comma-delimited list of HTTP status codes for the error collector to mark as expected. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. expected_classes Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_EXPECTED_ERRORS The following configuration /* ... */ error_collector: { expected_classes: [\"ReferenceError\"] } /* ... */ Copy Would mark all reference errors as expected. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. expected_messages Type Object Default {} A javascript object describing a list of javascript classes tied to javascript error messages for the collector to ignore. The following configuration. /* ... */ error_collector: { /* ... */ expected_messages: {\"Error\":[\"Undefined\", \"Out of time\"]} /* ... */ } /* ... */ Copy Would mark all errors of type Error, with the exact (case-sensitive) message strings of Undefined and Out of time. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent captures attributes from error collection. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from error collection. Allows * as wildcard at end. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include in error collection. Allows * as wildcard at end. Transaction tracer variables The agent groups your requests into transactions, which are used to: Visualize where your app spends its time (in transaction breakdowns). Identify slow requests. Group metrics. Isolate other issues, such as slow database performance. This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the transaction_tracer: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. Important Do not use brackets [suffix] at the end of your transaction name. New Relic automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRACER_ENABLED Server-side label Enable transaction tracing? When enabled, the agent collects slow transaction traces. explain_threshold Type Integer Default 500 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_EXPLAIN_THRESHOLD Minimum query duration (in milliseconds) for a transaction to be eligible for slow queries in transaction traces. record_sql Type String (off, obfuscated, or raw) Default off Environ variable NEW_RELIC_RECORD_SQL This option affects both slow queries and record_sql for transaction traces. It can have one of three values: off, obfuscated, or raw. When set to off no slow queries will be captured, and backtraces and SQL will not be included in transaction traces. If set to raw or obfuscated, the agent sends raw or obfuscated SQL and a slow query sample to the collector. The agent may also send SQL when other criteria are met, such as when slow_sql.enabled is set. top_n Type Integer Default 20 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRACER_TOP_N Defines the maximum number of requests eligible for transaction traces. Transactions are named based on the request, and top_n refers to the \"top n slowest transactions\" grouped by these names. The module replaces a recorded trace with a new trace only if the new trace is slower than the previous slowest trace of that name. The default value for this setting is top_n: 20, because the Transactions page also defaults to the 20 slowest transactions. The Node.js agent captures at least five different slow transactions in the first harvest cycle after start up. It will also reset and capture different transactions if no slow transactions have been captured for the last five harvest cycles. This allows you to see more information about more of your app's request paths, at the possible cost of not focusing on the absolutely slowest request for that harvest cycle. Tip To record the absolute slowest transaction over the last minute, you can set top_n: 0 or top_n: 1. However, this causes one very slow route to dominate your transaction traces. transaction_threshold Type Integer or apdex_f Default apdex_f Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRACER_THRESHOLD Server-side label Threshold Threshold of web transaction response time in seconds beyond which a transaction is eligible for transaction tracing. The default value is apdex_f; this sets the trace threshold to four times your application's Apdex T. You can also enter a specific time value in milliseconds. Example: Threshold set to apdex_f The default apdex_t is 100 milliseconds. If your transaction threshold is set to apdex_f, a \"slow\" transaction is 400 milliseconds. hide_internals Type boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HIDE_INTERNALS The agent uses a small amount of CPU in order to hide internal properties that are attached to the web application. If you change this configuration to false, it may slightly decrease your agent overhead, but it could also have an impact on the performance of the agent. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent captures attributes from transaction traces. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from transaction traces. Allows * as wildcard at end. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include in transaction traces. Allows * as wildcard at end. Rules variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the rules: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. name Type Strings or regular expressions Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES A comma-delimited list of rules to match incoming request URLs and name the associated New Relic transaction. Uses the format: name: [ {pattern: 'STRING_OR_REGEX', name: 'NAME'}, {pattern: 'STRING_OR_REGEX', name: 'NAME'} ], Copy Both parameters are required. For strings, you must escape control characters. You do not need to escape control characters in regular expressions. Additional attributes are ignored. Regular expressions support JavaScript-style capture groups, and names use $1-style replacement strings. Regular expressions only find the first matching result; subsequent matches are ignored. For more information, see Node.js transaction naming API. For the NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES environment variable, pass the rules as comma-delimited JSON object literals: NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES='{\"pattern\":\"^t\",\"name\":\"u\"},{\"pattern\":\"^u\",\"name\":\"t\"}' Copy ignore Type Strings or regular expressions Default Regular expression to match socket.io long-polling requests (\"^ \\ /socket \\ .io \\ /. * \\ /xhr-polling/\"). Environ variable NEW_RELIC_IGNORING_RULES Define a list of request URLs you want the agent to ignore. Specify the list as patterns, which can be strings or regular expressions. enforce_backstop Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ENFORCE_BACKSTOP Caution Do not change this setting unless you understand metric grouping issues. When enabled, the agent renames transactions that are not affected by other naming logic (such as the API, rules, or metric normalization rules) to NormalizedUri/*. If you set this to false, the agent sets transaction names to Uri/path/to/resource. Transaction events variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the transaction_events: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enabled Type Boolean Default true When enabled, the agent sends transaction events to New Relic. This event data includes transaction timing, transaction name, and any custom parameters. If this is disabled, the agent does not collect this data or send it to New Relic. max_samples_stored Type Integer Default 10000 Defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. We do not recommend configuring past 10k. The server will cap data at 10k per-minute. Important This configuration had different behavior in agent versions lower than 6.0.0. See max_samples_stored (DEPRECATED) for agent versions 5.x or lower. max_samples_stored (DEPRECATED) Type Integer Default 20000 Defines the maximum number of events the agent stores if it is unable to communicate with the New Relic collector. The values from the previous harvest cycle will be merged into the next one, with this option limiting the maximum number. Make sure this number is greater than max_samples_per_minute; for example, set it to twice as much. Consider your memory overhead before increasing this value. Caution This configuration has different behavior starting with agent version 6.0.0 and a new recommended maximum. See max_samples_stored for agent versions 6.x or higher. max_samples_per_minute (DEPRECATED) Type Integer Default 10000 Defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. Caution This configuration has been replaced with max_samples_stored starting with version 6.0.0 of the agent. See max_samples_stored for 6.x or later agents. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent captures attributes from transaction events. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from transaction events. Allows * as wildcard at end. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include in transaction events. Allows * as wildcard at end. Browser monitoring variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the browser_monitoring: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enable Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITOR_ENABLE Server-side label Enable browser monitoring? Generate JavaScript headers for browser instrumentation. Although this defaults to true, the agent doesn't inject the browser JS code unless you have enabled browser monitoring. Even if you have enabled it and added the browser timing header, you can disable browser monitoring for your app by setting this to false. debug Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITOR_DEBUG If true, request un-minified sources from the server. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITORING_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent sends custom attributes to browser monitoring. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITORING_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from browser monitoring. Allows * as wildcard at end. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITORING_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include in browser monitoring. Allows * as wildcard at end. Custom events variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the custom_insights_events: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. Currently there are no environment variables for custom events. enabled Type Boolean Default true When enabled, the agent sends custom events recorded with recordCustomEvent() to New Relic. If this is disabled, the agent does not collect this data or send it to New Relic. max_samples_stored Type Integer Default 1000 Defines the maximum number of custom events the agent collects per minute. If the number of custom events exceeds this limit, the agent collects a statistical sampling. Important Increasing this limit increases memory usage. Slow queries variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the slow_sql: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. These options control behavior for slow queries, but do not affect SQL nodes in transaction traces. enabled Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SLOW_SQL_ENABLED When enabled, the agent collects slow query details. max_samples Type Integer Default 10 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MAX_SQL_SAMPLES Defines the maximum number of slow queries the agent collects per minute. The agent discards additional queries after the limit is reached. Important Increasing this limit increases memory usage. Custom hostname variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the process_host: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. These options control behavior regarding the host display name in the New Relic APM UI. display_name Type String of 255 bytes or less Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME Specify a custom hostname for display in New Relic. If you do not set this field, New Relic will continue to use the default hostname found by calling os.hostname(). If you use the default hostname settings, New Relic finds the hostname through os.hostname(). If this call fails, New Relic uses the host's IP as the name. If you set ipv_preference: 4 or ipv_preference: 6, you can select the type of IP address (IPv4 or IPv6) that appears in the New Relic UI. ipv_preference Type Integer (4 or 6) Default 4 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_IPV_PREFERENCE Environment variable overrides This section defines two configuration options only available with environment variables. These overrides are not used in most configurations. NEW_RELIC_HOME Path to the directory containing newrelic.js. This is available only as an environment variable. You cannot set it in your config file. Type String Default (none) NEW_RELIC_NO_CONFIG_FILE If used, this prevents the agent from reading configuration settings from newrelic.js. Default values and values from environment variables will still be set. This is available only as an environment variable. You cannot set it in your config file. Type Boolean Default False Datastore tracer variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the datastore_tracer section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. These options control behavior for collecting datastore instance metrics. instance_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true When enabled, the agent collects datastore instance metrics (such as host and port) for some database drivers. These are reported on slow query traces and transaction traces. database_name_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true When enabled, the agent collects database name on slow query traces and transaction traces for some database drivers. Cross application tracing The Node.js agent variables that control cross application tracing typically appear in the cross_application_tracer section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file: enabled Type Boolean Default true When set to true, allows tracing of transactions across more than one New Relic-monitored applications. Error message redaction variables The Node.js agent variables that control error message redaction appear in the allow_raw_exception_messages section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file: enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ALLOW_RAW_EXCEPTION_MESSAGES_ENABLED When false, the agent will redact the messages of captured errors. Distributed tracing Important Enabling distributed tracing disables cross application tracing, and has effects on other APM features. Before enabling, read the transition guide. Requires Node.js agent version 4.7.0 or higher. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. When configuring via the config file, place the following option in the distributed_tracing section. When distributed tracing is enabled, you can collect span events. enabled Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED Set this to true to enable distributed tracing. For example, to enable this in the config file, you would use: distributed_tracing: { enabled: true } Copy exclude_newrelic_header Type Boolean Default false Set this to true to exclude the New Relic header that is attached to outbound requests, and instead only rely on W3C Trace Context Headers for distributed tracing. If this is false then both types of headers are used. For example, to enable this in the config file, you would use: distributed_tracing:{ enabled: true, exclude_newrelic_header: true } Copy Span events Span events are reported for distributed tracing. Distributed tracing must be enabled to report span events. Span configuration is set in the span_events stanza. Options include: enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ENABLED Turns reporting of span events on or off. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED This setting can be used to turn reporting of attributes on or off for span events. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent to span events regardless on how this is set. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE If attributes are enabled for span events, all attribute keys found in this list will be attached to span events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent with span events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Infinite Tracing To turn on Infinite Tracing, enable distributed tracing (set distributed_tracing to enabled: true) and add the additional settings below. For an example, see Language Agents: Configure Distributed Tracing. trace_observer.host Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST For help getting a valid Infinite Tracing trace observer host entry, see Find or create a trace observer endpoint.",

      "body": "Our Node.js agent is publicly available on the Node Package Manager (npm) repository as well as on GitHub. You can use our launcher, or follow the instructions in this document to complete a basic Node.js agent installation. Tip To use Node.js or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Add Node.js data Install the Node.js agent Important If you're using the agent in a Docker container, install the agent in each container. To install the Node.js agent: Ensure you meet the system requirements. In particular, make sure you use a supported Node version. Use the command npm install newrelic --save for each application you want to monitor. From node_modules/newrelic, copy newrelic.js into the root directory of your app. Configure agent via the newrelic.js file or via environment variable: Customize the license_key setting with your license key. Customize the app_name setting with one or more meaningful app names. Add require('newrelic'); as the first line of your app's main module. Optional: For additional Node.js runtime-level statistics, ensure the @newrelic/native-metrics package is installed. Generate some traffic, then wait a few minutes for data to appear in the APM UI. You can further customize your agent behavior via newrelic.js or an environment variable. To keep the agent configuration separate from your app, edit the NEW_RELIC_HOME environmental variable. Keep your Node.js agent up-to-date To ensure that you have the most up-to-date version of New Relic, refer to the Node.js release notes. When applicable, the release notes include a download link with instructions on how to update the Node.js agent.

      "body": "To take full advantage of New Relic's latest features, enhancements, and important security patches, we recommend you update your Node.js agent to the latest version. For additional information about specific agent updates, refer to the Node.js agent release notes. The release notes include a download link when applicable, plus instructions to download and install the latest version. If the newrelic module is listed in your package.json, run npm install. If you want to target just the newrelic module, run npm update newrelic. Recommendation: Test your updated version before moving it into production. If you have problems, follow the Node.js agent troubleshooting procedures. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 7 Before upgrading to Node.js version 7, review this information for major changes. Major changes with Node.js agent v7 Comments BREAKING Removed deprecated httpResponseCode, response.status and httpResponseMessage http response attributes v6.4.2-v6.14.0: Starting in agent v6.4.2, these attributes were marked as deprecated but left in to give a transition period for the new attributes. v7: When http response attribute reporting is enabled, http.statusCode and http.statusText will be reported. BREAKING Removed deprecated setIgnoreTransaction API method v5 - v6: Starting in agent v5.0.0, this method was marked as deprecated but left in to give a transition period for the new methods. v7: Applications must use the API method transactionHandle.ignore(). BREAKING Removed the api.custom_parameters_enabled configuration item and associated environment variable NEW_RELIC_API_CUSTOM_PARAMETERS. Applications must use the configuration api.custom_attributes_enabled or the associated environment variable NEW_RELIC_API_CUSTOM_ATTRIBUTES to enable newrelic.addCustomAttribute and newrelic.addCustomAttributes. BREAKING Removed deprecated Distributed Tracing API methods, createDistributedTracePayload() and acceptDistributedTracePayload() v6.4.0-v6.14.0: Starting in agent v6.4.0, these method were marked as deprecated but left in to give a transition period for the new methods. v7: Applications must use the API methods transactionHandle.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(headers) and transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(transportType, headers) . With these methods, the Node agent will now accept W3C's traceparent and tracestate headers when calling transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(headers) and include the W3C headers along with the New Relic distributed tracing header when calling transactionHandle.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(headers), unless the New Relic trace header format is disabled using distributed_tracing.exclude_newrelic_header:true. Update New Relic Dependencies to versions with updated Node version support @newrelic/aws-sdk v3.0.0 @newrelic/koa v5.0.0 @newrelic/native-metrics v6.0.0 @newrelic/superagent v4.0.0 @newrelic/test-utilities v5.0.0 Node version support Node v10 is the earliest version supported by the New Relic Node.js v7 agent. Node 8 and 9 are not supported by v7. Customers running Node 9 and earlier have two options: Upgrade to a supported version of Node and take advantage of the New Relic Node.js v7 agent's new features. Remain on New Relic Node.js v6 agent without the ability to use new features only available with update agent versions. Node 10 no longer receive updates, but New Relic will continue to support these versions of Node for the time being. Tip Upgrade to a newer version of Node as soon as possible. The next major version of the New Relic Node.js agent will likely remove support for Node 10. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 6 Before upgrading to Node.js agent version 6, review this information for major changes. Major changes with Node.js agent v6 Comments Upgraded official Koa framework instrumentation module to v3.0.0 v6: Added support for @koa/router up to v8.0.2. @koa/router v8.0.3 and greater are currently unsupported. v6: Added support for Node v12 and removed support for Node v6, 7, and 9. The minimum supported version is Node v8. Also see New Relic's Koa Release Notes on Github.. Removed deprecated max_samples_per_minute configuration parameter, which is replaced by max_samples_stored behavior v1 - v5: max_samples_per_minute defined the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If your application previously used max_samples_per_minute as an upper bound, you may need to lower the threshold to a valid maximum to avoid data being dropped on the server. We recommend less than 10k. v5: In agent v5 and lower, max_samples_stored defined the maximum number of events the agent stores if it's unable to communicate with the New Relic collector. v6: The new behavior of max_samples_stored defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. This usage of the configuration is consistent with the other APM agents. Troubleshooting tips: If you're missing event data, increase the value of max_samples_stored or revert to the default value. The value of max_samples_stored should not be over 10,000. Node version support Node 8 is the earliest version supported by the New Relic Node.js v6 agent. Node 6, 7 and 9 are not supported by v6. Customers running Node 6, 7 and 9 have two options: Upgrade to a supported version of Node and take advantage of the New Relic Node.js v6 agent's new features. Remain on New Relic Node.js v5 agent without the ability to use new features only available with update agent versions. Node 8 no longer receive updates, but New Relic will continue to support these versions of Node for the time being. Tip Upgrade to a newer version of Node as soon as possible. The next major version of the New Relic Node.js agent will likely remove support for Node 8. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 5 Before upgrading to Node.js agent v5, review this information for major changes. Also see New Relic's Node.js v5 migration guide on GitHub. Major changes with Node.js v5 agent Comments Removed deprecated addCustomParameter methods. v2 - v4: Starting in agent v2.7.0, these methods were marked as deprecated but left in to give a transition period for the new methods. v5: Applications must use the API methods newrelic.addCustomAttribute() and newrelic.addCustomAttributes(). These are drop-in replacements for the old methods. Removed deprecated create*Transaction methods. v2 - v4: Starting in agent v2.0.2, these methods were marked as deprecated but left in to give a transition period to the new methods. v5: Applications must update to the API methods newrelic.startWebTransaction() and newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction(). Troubleshooting tips: These new methods are not drop-in replacements for the old ones. Before moving to these new methods, review our custom instrumentation guide. Removed deprecated createTracer method. v3 - v4: Starting in agent v3.3.0, this method was marked as deprecated in favor of newrelic.startSegment(). v5: Applications must update to newrelic.startSegment(). Removed node-cassandra-cql instrumentation. v4: Applications using the npm package node-cassandra-cql would get datastore metrics for Cassandra. v5: Applications must migrate to the cassandra-driver package to get Cassandra datastore metrics. This module is actively maintained by the same developers. The node-cassandra-cql package was abandoned in February of 2014 in favor of the cassandra-driver package. Removed deprecated capture_params and ignored_params configurations. v2 - v4: Starting in agent v2.7.0, these configuration parameters caused a warning to be logged, and the values were automatically upgraded to the new attributes configurations. v5: A warning will still be logged but the configuration is ignored, and no automatic upgrading happens any more. Troubleshooting tips: If your application had parameters listed in the ignored_params configuration, you will need to move them to attributes.exclude. Node version support Node 6 is the earliest version supported by the New Relic Node.js v5 agent. Node 4 and 5 are not supported by v5. Customers running Node 4 or 5 have two options: Upgrade to a supported version of Node and take advantage of the New Relic Node.js v5 agent's new features. Remain on New Relic Node.js v4 agent without the ability to use new features only available with update agent versions. Node 7 and 9 no longer receive updates, but New Relic will continue to support these versions of Node for the time being. Tip Upgrade to a newer version of Node as soon as possible. The next major version of the New Relic Node.js agent will likely remove support for Node 6 and 7. Feature flags as of v5 As of New Relic for Node.js v5: custom_instrumentation: This feature is no longer configurable. custom_metrics: This feature is no longer configurable. synthetics: This feature is no longer configurable. native_metrics: This feature is now controlled by the plugins.native_metrics.enabled configuration value. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 4 Before upgrading to Node.js agent v4, review this information for major changes. Also see New Relic's Node.js v4 migration guide on GitHub. Upgrade https-proxy-agent from v0 to v2 Major changes with Node.js v4 agent include an upgrade of the https-proxy-agent from v0 to v2. This dependency has been updated due to a security issue in the https-proxy-agent that the New Relic Node.js agent used. Because https-proxy v2 is incompatible with node v0.10 and v0.12, New Relic has deprecated those agent versions. There is no required action to migrate from v3 to v4 of New Relic's Node.js agent. Node version support Node 4 is the earliest version supported by the New Relic Node.js v4 agent. Node 0.10 and 0.12 are not supported by v4. Customers running Node 0.10 or 0.12 have two options: Upgrade to a supported version of Node and take advantage of the New Relic Node.js v4 agent's new features. Remain on the New Relic Node.js v3 agent without the ability to use new features only available with updated agent versions. Node 4, 5, and 7 also no longer receive updates, but New Relic will continue to support these versions of Node for the time being. Tip Upgrade to a newer version of Node as soon as possible. The next major version of the New Relic Node.js agent will likely remove support for Node 4 and 5. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 3 Before upgrading to Node.js agent agent v3, review this information for major changes. Also see New Relic's Node.js v3 migration guide on GitHub. Major changes with Node.js v3 agent Major changes with Node.js v3 agent Comments Removed SSL configuration v2: With the v2 agent, it was possible to configure the agent to connect to New Relic without encryption. v3: Node.js agent v3 always connects to New Relic servers using TLS encryption to protect communications. If the agent is configured to disable this, a warning is logged and the setting is ignored. Request parameters now prefixed with request.parameters. v2: The v2 agent collects request parameters, such as route parameters (/users/:userId) and query parameters (/users?userId=123), as the parameter name (userId). v3: The v3 agent prefixes all request parameters with the string request.parameters.. For example,userId appears as request.parameters.userId. Troubleshooting tips: If you have dashboards, alert policies, or other NRQL queries based on request parameters, update them with the new parameter names. Feature flags as of v3 As of New Relic Node.js agent v3, the send_request_uri_attribute feature is no longer configurable. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 2 Before upgrading to Node.js agent v2, review this information for major changes. Also see New Relic's Node.js v2 migration guide on GitHub. Major changes with Node.js v2 agent Major changes with Node.js v2 agent Comments Reversed naming and ignore rules v1: With the v1 agent, rules defined in the config properties rules.name and rules.ignore were applied in reverse order; the first rule in the list was applied last. v2: Node.js agent v2 applies rules in the order they are defined, so the first rule in the list is applied first. Troubleshooting tips: If you used naming rules in the v1 agent and notice problems, reverse the order of your rules in your configuration. De-duplicated HTTP request transactions v1: The v1 agent started a new transaction for each listener on an HTTP server's request event. In applications with multiple listeners on the request event, this resulted in extraneous transactions being created that almost always did not get named correctly. v2: The v2 agent only creates a single transaction for each request event emitted. Troubleshooting tips: If you used multiple request event listeners and added a call to newrelic.ignoreTransaction() to remove the extra transactions, remove those calls. Stopped swallowing outbound request errors v1: The v1 agent swallowed unhandled error events emitted by outbound HTTP request objects. v2: The v2 agent removes this behavior. Instead, the v2 agent does not change normal Node execution. This means the error event will always be emitted. Troubleshooting tips: If you are making outbound requests and currently do not listen for the error event, add a listener and handle the error as appropriate for your application. Updated configuration options as of v2 In newrelic.js, edit the Node.js agent configuration properties you use for compatiblity with the latest versions: Deprecated property New property capture_params attributes.enabled: false By default, request attributes are not sent to New Relic. Set attributes.enabled: true to include agent-defined or custom attributes in traces. The capture_params property has been deprecated. ignored_params attributes.exclude: [] Add any request attribute keys to the attributes.exclude list. Now, instead of having to be an exact match, wildcards (*) may be appended to each item for broader filtering. The ignored_params property has been deprecated. These Node.js agent configuration properties also have overrides for specific destinations, including: transaction_tracer transaction_events error_collector browser_monitoring For example, if the root attributes.enabled is true and you set transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled: false, this will restrict attributes from being collected in transaction traces, while still allowing them for all others. Deprecated API methods as of v2 The following methods from the Node.js agent have been deprecated, and New Relic has deleted them in v5 of the agent. Each has an easy replacement that accomplishes the same task in a more flexible and reliable way. newrelic.createWebTransaction() Replace with newrelic.startWebTransaction() and newrelic.getTransaction(). newrelic.createBackgroundTransaction() Replace with newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction() and newrelic.getTransaction(). newrelic.addCustomParameter() Replace with newrelic.addCustomAttribute(). newrelic.addCustomParameters() Replace with newrelic.addCustomAttributes(). New v2 agent API methods The following API methods are new with the New Relic Node.js v2 agent. newrelic.getTransaction() This method gets a reference to the currently running transaction. Use in conjunction with: newrelic.startWebTransaction newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction Callback-based message consumer services for troubleshooting message consumers newrelic.startWebTransaction()newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction() These new API methods replace the older create*Transaction methods. They are easier to use and seamlessly work with promises. Unlike the v1 method, the provided callback is invoked immediately. newrelic.instrument()newrelic.instrumentDatastore()newrelic.instrumentWebframework()newrelic.instrumentMessages() Use these methods to add custom instrumentation for third party modules, including those already instrumented by the New Relic Node.js agent. For more information, see New Relic's Node.js instrumentation tutorials on GitHub. newrelic.addCustomAttribute() Use this method to add a custom trace attribute. newrelic.addCustomAttributes() Use this method to add multiple custom trace attributes. Node version support for v2 The earliest version of Node supported by the New Relic Node.js v2 agent is 0.10. Node 0.8, which has not been updated since July of 2014, is not supported by v2. Customers running Node 0.8 have two options: Upgrade to a supported version of Node and take advantage of the New Relic Node.js v2 agent's new features. Remain on New Relic Node.js v1 agent without the ability to use new features only available with updated agent versions. Node 0.10 also no longer receives updates, but New Relic will continue to support this version of Node for the time being. Recommendation: Upgrade to a newer version of Node as soon as possible. npm version support as of v2 The New Relic Node.js agent now requires npm version 2.0.0 or higher. This version of npm comes packaged with Node 0.10.44 or higher.

      "body": "Our Node.js agent is publicly available on the Node Package Manager (npm) repository as well as on GitHub. Before you install the Node.js agent, make sure your application meets the following system requirements. Node.js version support Tip For best performance, use the latest active long term support (LTS) version of Node.js. Support for new Node.js releases We will support the latest even versions of Node.js releases by the beginning of the following active long term support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Node.js version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Node.js agent with support 16 October 2021 April-October 2021 End of support for Node.js releases reaching EOL When support for a new long term support agent version is made available, support for the Node.js agent version that reaches end-of-life during the same time period will simultaneously drop. The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Node.js version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Node.js agent dropping support 12 April 2022 April-October 2022 10 April 2021 As of July 31, 2021, we're discontinuing support for Node.js 10. For more details, including how you can easily prepare for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. Node.js 12 errors For Node.js 12, the following change affects the Node.js agent: Errors resulting in unhandled rejections are not scoped to the transaction that was active when the rejected promise was created. This is because the promise responsible for triggering the init async hook is no longer passed through on the promise wrap instance. This breaks the linkage that associates a given promise rejection with the transaction it was scheduled in. Supported Node.js frameworks Express 4.6.0 or higher Restify Connect v1 and v2 (router not supported) Hapi Koa 2.0.0 or higher (external module loaded with the agent) If you are using a supported framework with default routers, the Node.js agent can read these frameworks' route names as-is. However, if you want more specific names than are provided by your framework, you may want to use one or more of the tools New Relic provides with the Node.js transaction naming API. Operating systems Linux SmartOS macOS 10.7 and higher Windows Server 2008 and higher Datastores The Node.js agent monitors the performance of Node.js application calls to these datastores: Cassandra Memcached MongoDB MySQL (via mysql and mysql2 packages) Redis Postgres (including the native and pure JavaScript packages) Instance details We collect instance details for a variety of databases and database drivers. The ability to view specific instances and the types of database information in APM depends on your agent version. New Relic's Node.js agent version 1.31.0 or higher supports the following: Database npm module name Minimum module version Minimum agent version PostgreSQL pg 4.0.0 1.31.0 Redis redis 2.0.0 1.31.0 MongoDB mongodb 2.1.0 1.32.0 MySQL mysql 2.4.1 1.32.0 Memcached memcached 1.0.0 1.33.0 To request instance-level information from datastores currently not listed for your New Relic agent, get support at support.newrelic.com. Messages queues Message queue instrumentation is only available with the New Relic Node.js agent v2 or higher. Currently supported message queue instrumentation: amqplib For other message queue libraries, use custom instrumentation. Hosting services Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment AWS EC2 Microsoft Azure Heroku Process managers In general, process managers that handle starting, stopping, and restarting of Node.js (like Forever) should be compatible with the Node.js agent. If you are using PM2, the minimum supported version of PM2 is 2.0. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Connect the agent to other New Relic features The Node.js agent integrates with other features to give you full-stack observability: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Node.js agent automatically injects the browser monitoring agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser monitoring injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Node.js agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in infrastructure monitoring. New Relic dashboards The Node.js agent sends default events and attributes for NRQL queries. You can also record custom events for advanced analysis. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

With features like service maps and error analytics, our Node.js agent helps you get the full picture of your app environment. Tip To use Node.js or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Why it matters Many Node application requests are based on raw URLs. Our solution is different. New Relic for Node.js assumes it can group requests to your application into transactions instead of HTTP requests. Transactions are defined by giving one or more request paths a name. These names are used to: Visualize where your app is spending its time (in transaction breakdowns). Identify slow requests. Group metrics. Show you which portions of your application are suffering from slow database performance. Installation To install our agent, you need to sign up for New Relic first. Once you're logged in, follow the instructions or use our launcher to get data flowing in. Review the system requirements. Read the install docs. Go directly to the New Relic UI to add Node.js data. Extend your instrumentation After installing the Node.js agent, extend your instrumentation: Extend your instrumentation Comments Customization Implement Node.js custom instrumentation. Collect custom metrics via an API call. Use our Node.js agent API to control, customize, or extend the agent's functionality. Open source telemetry To create your own integrations, use our Node Telemetry SDK. To gain visibility into your GraphQL payloads, use our Apollo Server plugin. Traces Enable distributed tracing. VM measurements Collect key metric timeslice data from the Node.js virtual machine. View detailed VM statistics in the New Relic UI. End-user activity Integrate the Node.js agent with browser monitoring. Gain visibility into user activity with browser monitoring's page load timing process. Troubleshoot your installation If you encounter issues with your Node.js agent, see our troubleshooting information: Large memory usage: If you've installed the Node.js agent and your memory usage has increased, check out these possible solutions.

      "body": "To take full advantage of New Relic's latest features, enhancements, and important security patches, we recommend you update your Node.js agent to the latest version. For additional information about specific agent updates, refer to the Node.js agent release notes. The release notes include a download link when applicable, plus instructions to download and install the latest version. If the newrelic module is listed in your package.json, run npm install. If you want to target just the newrelic module, run npm update newrelic. Recommendation: Test your updated version before moving it into production. If you have problems, follow the Node.js agent troubleshooting procedures. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 7 Before upgrading to Node.js version 7, review this information for major changes. Major changes with Node.js agent v7 Comments BREAKING Removed deprecated httpResponseCode, response.status and httpResponseMessage http response attributes v6.4.2-v6.14.0: Starting in agent v6.4.2, these attributes were marked as deprecated but left in to give a transition period for the new attributes. v7: When http response attribute reporting is enabled, http.statusCode and http.statusText will be reported. BREAKING Removed deprecated setIgnoreTransaction API method v5 - v6: Starting in agent v5.0.0, this method was marked as deprecated but left in to give a transition period for the new methods. v7: Applications must use the API method transactionHandle.ignore(). BREAKING Removed the api.custom_parameters_enabled configuration item and associated environment variable NEW_RELIC_API_CUSTOM_PARAMETERS. Applications must use the configuration api.custom_attributes_enabled or the associated environment variable NEW_RELIC_API_CUSTOM_ATTRIBUTES to enable newrelic.addCustomAttribute and newrelic.addCustomAttributes. BREAKING Removed deprecated Distributed Tracing API methods, createDistributedTracePayload() and acceptDistributedTracePayload() v6.4.0-v6.14.0: Starting in agent v6.4.0, these method were marked as deprecated but left in to give a transition period for the new methods. v7: Applications must use the API methods transactionHandle.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(headers) and transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(transportType, headers) . With these methods, the Node agent will now accept W3C's traceparent and tracestate headers when calling transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(headers) and include the W3C headers along with the New Relic distributed tracing header when calling transactionHandle.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(headers), unless the New Relic trace header format is disabled using distributed_tracing.exclude_newrelic_header:true. Update New Relic Dependencies to versions with updated Node version support @newrelic/aws-sdk v3.0.0 @newrelic/koa v5.0.0 @newrelic/native-metrics v6.0.0 @newrelic/superagent v4.0.0 @newrelic/test-utilities v5.0.0 Node version support Node v10 is the earliest version supported by the New Relic Node.js v7 agent. Node 8 and 9 are not supported by v7. Customers running Node 9 and earlier have two options: Upgrade to a supported version of Node and take advantage of the New Relic Node.js v7 agent's new features. Remain on New Relic Node.js v6 agent without the ability to use new features only available with update agent versions. Node 10 no longer receive updates, but New Relic will continue to support these versions of Node for the time being. Tip Upgrade to a newer version of Node as soon as possible. The next major version of the New Relic Node.js agent will likely remove support for Node 10. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 6 Before upgrading to Node.js agent version 6, review this information for major changes. Major changes with Node.js agent v6 Comments Upgraded official Koa framework instrumentation module to v3.0.0 v6: Added support for @koa/router up to v8.0.2. @koa/router v8.0.3 and greater are currently unsupported. v6: Added support for Node v12 and removed support for Node v6, 7, and 9. The minimum supported version is Node v8. Also see New Relic's Koa Release Notes on Github.. Removed deprecated max_samples_per_minute configuration parameter, which is replaced by max_samples_stored behavior v1 - v5: max_samples_per_minute defined the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If your application previously used max_samples_per_minute as an upper bound, you may need to lower the threshold to a valid maximum to avoid data being dropped on the server. We recommend less than 10k. v5: In agent v5 and lower, max_samples_stored defined the maximum number of events the agent stores if it's unable to communicate with the New Relic collector. v6: The new behavior of max_samples_stored defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. This usage of the configuration is consistent with the other APM agents. Troubleshooting tips: If you're missing event data, increase the value of max_samples_stored or revert to the default value. The value of max_samples_stored should not be over 10,000. Node version support Node 8 is the earliest version supported by the New Relic Node.js v6 agent. Node 6, 7 and 9 are not supported by v6. Customers running Node 6, 7 and 9 have two options: Upgrade to a supported version of Node and take advantage of the New Relic Node.js v6 agent's new features. Remain on New Relic Node.js v5 agent without the ability to use new features only available with update agent versions. Node 8 no longer receive updates, but New Relic will continue to support these versions of Node for the time being. Tip Upgrade to a newer version of Node as soon as possible. The next major version of the New Relic Node.js agent will likely remove support for Node 8. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 5 Before upgrading to Node.js agent v5, review this information for major changes. Also see New Relic's Node.js v5 migration guide on GitHub. Major changes with Node.js v5 agent Comments Removed deprecated addCustomParameter methods. v2 - v4: Starting in agent v2.7.0, these methods were marked as deprecated but left in to give a transition period for the new methods. v5: Applications must use the API methods newrelic.addCustomAttribute() and newrelic.addCustomAttributes(). These are drop-in replacements for the old methods. Removed deprecated create*Transaction methods. v2 - v4: Starting in agent v2.0.2, these methods were marked as deprecated but left in to give a transition period to the new methods. v5: Applications must update to the API methods newrelic.startWebTransaction() and newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction(). Troubleshooting tips: These new methods are not drop-in replacements for the old ones. Before moving to these new methods, review our custom instrumentation guide. Removed deprecated createTracer method. v3 - v4: Starting in agent v3.3.0, this method was marked as deprecated in favor of newrelic.startSegment(). v5: Applications must update to newrelic.startSegment(). Removed node-cassandra-cql instrumentation. v4: Applications using the npm package node-cassandra-cql would get datastore metrics for Cassandra. v5: Applications must migrate to the cassandra-driver package to get Cassandra datastore metrics. This module is actively maintained by the same developers. The node-cassandra-cql package was abandoned in February of 2014 in favor of the cassandra-driver package. Removed deprecated capture_params and ignored_params configurations. v2 - v4: Starting in agent v2.7.0, these configuration parameters caused a warning to be logged, and the values were automatically upgraded to the new attributes configurations. v5: A warning will still be logged but the configuration is ignored, and no automatic upgrading happens any more. Troubleshooting tips: If your application had parameters listed in the ignored_params configuration, you will need to move them to attributes.exclude. Node version support Node 6 is the earliest version supported by the New Relic Node.js v5 agent. Node 4 and 5 are not supported by v5. Customers running Node 4 or 5 have two options: Upgrade to a supported version of Node and take advantage of the New Relic Node.js v5 agent's new features. Remain on New Relic Node.js v4 agent without the ability to use new features only available with update agent versions. Node 7 and 9 no longer receive updates, but New Relic will continue to support these versions of Node for the time being. Tip Upgrade to a newer version of Node as soon as possible. The next major version of the New Relic Node.js agent will likely remove support for Node 6 and 7. Feature flags as of v5 As of New Relic for Node.js v5: custom_instrumentation: This feature is no longer configurable. custom_metrics: This feature is no longer configurable. synthetics: This feature is no longer configurable. native_metrics: This feature is now controlled by the plugins.native_metrics.enabled configuration value. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 4 Before upgrading to Node.js agent v4, review this information for major changes. Also see New Relic's Node.js v4 migration guide on GitHub. Upgrade https-proxy-agent from v0 to v2 Major changes with Node.js v4 agent include an upgrade of the https-proxy-agent from v0 to v2. This dependency has been updated due to a security issue in the https-proxy-agent that the New Relic Node.js agent used. Because https-proxy v2 is incompatible with node v0.10 and v0.12, New Relic has deprecated those agent versions. There is no required action to migrate from v3 to v4 of New Relic's Node.js agent. Node version support Node 4 is the earliest version supported by the New Relic Node.js v4 agent. Node 0.10 and 0.12 are not supported by v4. Customers running Node 0.10 or 0.12 have two options: Upgrade to a supported version of Node and take advantage of the New Relic Node.js v4 agent's new features. Remain on the New Relic Node.js v3 agent without the ability to use new features only available with updated agent versions. Node 4, 5, and 7 also no longer receive updates, but New Relic will continue to support these versions of Node for the time being. Tip Upgrade to a newer version of Node as soon as possible. The next major version of the New Relic Node.js agent will likely remove support for Node 4 and 5. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 3 Before upgrading to Node.js agent agent v3, review this information for major changes. Also see New Relic's Node.js v3 migration guide on GitHub. Major changes with Node.js v3 agent Major changes with Node.js v3 agent Comments Removed SSL configuration v2: With the v2 agent, it was possible to configure the agent to connect to New Relic without encryption. v3: Node.js agent v3 always connects to New Relic servers using TLS encryption to protect communications. If the agent is configured to disable this, a warning is logged and the setting is ignored. Request parameters now prefixed with request.parameters. v2: The v2 agent collects request parameters, such as route parameters (/users/:userId) and query parameters (/users?userId=123), as the parameter name (userId). v3: The v3 agent prefixes all request parameters with the string request.parameters.. For example,userId appears as request.parameters.userId. Troubleshooting tips: If you have dashboards, alert policies, or other NRQL queries based on request parameters, update them with the new parameter names. Feature flags as of v3 As of New Relic Node.js agent v3, the send_request_uri_attribute feature is no longer configurable. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 2 Before upgrading to Node.js agent v2, review this information for major changes. Also see New Relic's Node.js v2 migration guide on GitHub. Major changes with Node.js v2 agent Major changes with Node.js v2 agent Comments Reversed naming and ignore rules v1: With the v1 agent, rules defined in the config properties rules.name and rules.ignore were applied in reverse order; the first rule in the list was applied last. v2: Node.js agent v2 applies rules in the order they are defined, so the first rule in the list is applied first. Troubleshooting tips: If you used naming rules in the v1 agent and notice problems, reverse the order of your rules in your configuration. De-duplicated HTTP request transactions v1: The v1 agent started a new transaction for each listener on an HTTP server's request event. In applications with multiple listeners on the request event, this resulted in extraneous transactions being created that almost always did not get named correctly. v2: The v2 agent only creates a single transaction for each request event emitted. Troubleshooting tips: If you used multiple request event listeners and added a call to newrelic.ignoreTransaction() to remove the extra transactions, remove those calls. Stopped swallowing outbound request errors v1: The v1 agent swallowed unhandled error events emitted by outbound HTTP request objects. v2: The v2 agent removes this behavior. Instead, the v2 agent does not change normal Node execution. This means the error event will always be emitted. Troubleshooting tips: If you are making outbound requests and currently do not listen for the error event, add a listener and handle the error as appropriate for your application. Updated configuration options as of v2 In newrelic.js, edit the Node.js agent configuration properties you use for compatiblity with the latest versions: Deprecated property New property capture_params attributes.enabled: false By default, request attributes are not sent to New Relic. Set attributes.enabled: true to include agent-defined or custom attributes in traces. The capture_params property has been deprecated. ignored_params attributes.exclude: [] Add any request attribute keys to the attributes.exclude list. Now, instead of having to be an exact match, wildcards (*) may be appended to each item for broader filtering. The ignored_params property has been deprecated. These Node.js agent configuration properties also have overrides for specific destinations, including: transaction_tracer transaction_events error_collector browser_monitoring For example, if the root attributes.enabled is true and you set transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled: false, this will restrict attributes from being collected in transaction traces, while still allowing them for all others. Deprecated API methods as of v2 The following methods from the Node.js agent have been deprecated, and New Relic has deleted them in v5 of the agent. Each has an easy replacement that accomplishes the same task in a more flexible and reliable way. newrelic.createWebTransaction() Replace with newrelic.startWebTransaction() and newrelic.getTransaction(). newrelic.createBackgroundTransaction() Replace with newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction() and newrelic.getTransaction(). newrelic.addCustomParameter() Replace with newrelic.addCustomAttribute(). newrelic.addCustomParameters() Replace with newrelic.addCustomAttributes(). New v2 agent API methods The following API methods are new with the New Relic Node.js v2 agent. newrelic.getTransaction() This method gets a reference to the currently running transaction. Use in conjunction with: newrelic.startWebTransaction newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction Callback-based message consumer services for troubleshooting message consumers newrelic.startWebTransaction()newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction() These new API methods replace the older create*Transaction methods. They are easier to use and seamlessly work with promises. Unlike the v1 method, the provided callback is invoked immediately. newrelic.instrument()newrelic.instrumentDatastore()newrelic.instrumentWebframework()newrelic.instrumentMessages() Use these methods to add custom instrumentation for third party modules, including those already instrumented by the New Relic Node.js agent. For more information, see New Relic's Node.js instrumentation tutorials on GitHub. newrelic.addCustomAttribute() Use this method to add a custom trace attribute. newrelic.addCustomAttributes() Use this method to add multiple custom trace attributes. Node version support for v2 The earliest version of Node supported by the New Relic Node.js v2 agent is 0.10. Node 0.8, which has not been updated since July of 2014, is not supported by v2. Customers running Node 0.8 have two options: Upgrade to a supported version of Node and take advantage of the New Relic Node.js v2 agent's new features. Remain on New Relic Node.js v1 agent without the ability to use new features only available with updated agent versions. Node 0.10 also no longer receives updates, but New Relic will continue to support this version of Node for the time being. Recommendation: Upgrade to a newer version of Node as soon as possible. npm version support as of v2 The New Relic Node.js agent now requires npm version 2.0.0 or higher. This version of npm comes packaged with Node 0.10.44 or higher. If you are using an earlier version of Node 0.10 you will need to first install npm 2.0.0 or higher, or upgrade to a newer version of Node. To install npm version 2: $ npm install --global npm@2 Copy Feature flags as of v2 As of New Relic Node.js agent v2: express_segments: This feature is no longer configurable. cat: This feature is now controlled by the cross_application_tracer.enabled configuration value. Framework minimum versions as of v2 As of New Relic Node.js agent v2: Module V2 minimum Minimum before v2 express 4.6.0 2.0.0 mysql 2.0.0 0.9.0",

      "body": "Our Node.js agent is publicly available on the Node Package Manager (npm) repository as well as on GitHub. Before you install the Node.js agent, make sure your application meets the following system requirements. Node.js version support Tip For best performance, use the latest active long term support (LTS) version of Node.js. Support for new Node.js releases We will support the latest even versions of Node.js releases by the beginning of the following active long term support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Node.js version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Node.js agent with support 16 October 2021 April-October 2021 End of support for Node.js releases reaching EOL When support for a new long term support agent version is made available, support for the Node.js agent version that reaches end-of-life during the same time period will simultaneously drop. The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Node.js version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Node.js agent dropping support 12 April 2022 April-October 2022 10 April 2021 As of July 31, 2021, we're discontinuing support for Node.js 10. For more details, including how you can easily prepare for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. Node.js 12 errors For Node.js 12, the following change affects the Node.js agent: Errors resulting in unhandled rejections are not scoped to the transaction that was active when the rejected promise was created. This is because the promise responsible for triggering the init async hook is no longer passed through on the promise wrap instance. This breaks the linkage that associates a given promise rejection with the transaction it was scheduled in. Supported Node.js frameworks Express 4.6.0 or higher Restify Connect v1 and v2 (router not supported) Hapi Koa 2.0.0 or higher (external module loaded with the agent) If you are using a supported framework with default routers, the Node.js agent can read these frameworks' route names as-is. However, if you want more specific names than are provided by your framework, you may want to use one or more of the tools New Relic provides with the Node.js transaction naming API. Operating systems Linux SmartOS macOS 10.7 and higher Windows Server 2008 and higher Datastores The Node.js agent monitors the performance of Node.js application calls to these datastores: Cassandra Memcached MongoDB MySQL (via mysql and mysql2 packages) Redis Postgres (including the native and pure JavaScript packages) Instance details We collect instance details for a variety of databases and database drivers. The ability to view specific instances and the types of database information in APM depends on your agent version. New Relic's Node.js agent version 1.31.0 or higher supports the following: Database npm module name Minimum module version Minimum agent version PostgreSQL pg 4.0.0 1.31.0 Redis redis 2.0.0 1.31.0 MongoDB mongodb 2.1.0 1.32.0 MySQL mysql 2.4.1 1.32.0 Memcached memcached 1.0.0 1.33.0 To request instance-level information from datastores currently not listed for your New Relic agent, get support at support.newrelic.com. Messages queues Message queue instrumentation is only available with the New Relic Node.js agent v2 or higher. Currently supported message queue instrumentation: amqplib For other message queue libraries, use custom instrumentation. Hosting services Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment AWS EC2 Microsoft Azure Heroku Process managers In general, process managers that handle starting, stopping, and restarting of Node.js (like Forever) should be compatible with the Node.js agent. If you are using PM2, the minimum supported version of PM2 is 2.0. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Connect the agent to other New Relic features The Node.js agent integrates with other features to give you full-stack observability: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Node.js agent automatically injects the browser monitoring agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser monitoring injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Node.js agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in infrastructure monitoring. New Relic dashboards The Node.js agent sends default events and attributes for NRQL queries. You can also record custom events for advanced analysis. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",
