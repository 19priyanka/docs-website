This will help you control the amount and types of data you send to New Relic. This will also help you avoid additional billing charges, as explained in this document. Prevent billing increases We use the Prometheus discovery and scrape annotations. If you set the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration to scrape all the available targets and to send all the data that's exposed from those targets, you may exceed New Relic's platform limits and increase your billing charges. To help prevent this from happening, use the integration's filtering capabilities. For more information, see the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration requirements for Docker and Kubernetes. Also see the troubleshooting procedures for NrIntegrationError events. Identify metrics to ignore or include To decide what data to include or exclude, use New Relic's Metric API to explore your metric data. Then, refine your filters to scrape only relevant targets and send useful metrics. To filter out unwanted metrics from a target, use the ignore_metrics configuration option. To filter out targets instead of the metrics, use the scrape_enabled_label configuration option. The nri-prometheus-latest.yaml manifest file includes the nri-prometheus-cfg config map showing an example configuration. The integration will ignore or include metrics before executing the other functions to add, rename, or copy attributes. Filter out unwanted metrics (ignore) To ignore unwanted metrics, use the following transformation. Example: Configuration To drop all metrics that start with go_ or process_: transformations: - description: \"General processing rules\" ignore_metrics: - prefixes: - \"go_\" - \"process_\" Copy Example: Input go_goroutines 13 process_virtual_memory_bytes 2.062336e+07 mysql_global_status_commands_total{command=\"ha_close\"} 0 mysql_global_status_commands_total{command=\"ha_open\"} 0 Copy This is taken from the MySQL exporter. Besides the MySQL metrics, it also exposes metrics about the exporter that may not be of interest to you. Example: Output mysql_global_status_commands_total{command=\"ha_close\"} 0 mysql_global_status_commands_total{command=\"ha_open\"} 0 Copy Include only specific metrics (except) If you only want to include specific metrics, you can use the except list under the ignore_metrics section. As the name implies, this will ignore all the metrics except the ones that contain the with the given prefixes. Example: Configuration To drop all metrics except kube_hpa_: transformations: - description: \"General processing rules\" ignore_metrics: - except: - kube_hpa_ Copy",

      "body": "This page provides an overview of New Relic's Prometheus integration options and how they work. The information here will help you choose from among our options based on which one best fits your unique business needs. Prometheus OpenMetrics or remote write integration? We currently offer two integration options: Prometheus remote write integration and Prometheus OpenMetrics integration for Kubernetes or Docker. We recommend getting started with the remote write integration if you already have a Prometheus server install base. If you find it hard to manage your Prometheus cluster, or if you are getting started with integrating Prometheus Metrics, you should use OpenMetrics. Examine the benefits, reminders, and recommendations for each option below. Prometheus remote write integration Benefits: Easy access to your combined metrics in New Relic if you already have Prometheus servers. Access only takes one line of yaml in your Prometheus configuration. Access your metrics through both New Relic and Prometheus without making additional adjustments in Prometheus. Federation: Allows you to combine data from multiple servers into a single source. Prometheus High Availability support: We de-duplicate data from HA-pairs on ingest. Reminders: You will need to manage your Prometheus servers. You can reduce your storage retention. Fewer query loads to the server. Recommendations: Evaluate your observability needs to manage your data volumes better: The scrape interval is the biggest factor influencing data volumes: select it based on your observability needs. For example, changing from 15s (default value) to 30s can reduce data volumes by 50%. Set your filters and configure data to target (see metrics or targets). Balance remote write(s) between one or more New Relic accounts or sub-accounts to manage rate limits. Prometheus OpenMetrics integration for Kubernetes or Docker Benefits: Best for an alternative to Prometheus servers Store all your metrics directly in New Relic No need to manage any Prometheus servers yourself. No need for local storage. Reminders: Slightly more complex setup. No support for High Availability replicas. The Kubernetes operator is not available for enhanced operations automation. Regardless of the option you chose, with our Prometheus integrations: You can use Grafana or other query tools via New Relic's Prometheus' API. You benefit from more nuanced security and user management options as part of New Relic One. New Relic's database can be the centralized long-term data store for all your Prometheus metrics, allowing you to observe all your data in one place. You can execute queries to scale, supported by New Relic. Prometheus remote write integration The Prometheus remote write integration allows you to forward telemetry data from your existing Prometheus servers to New Relic. Once integrated, you can leverage the full range of options for setup and management, from raw data to queries, dashboards, and more. Scale your data and get moving quickly With the Prometheus remote write integration, you can: Store and visualize crucial metrics on a single platform Combine and group data across your entire software stack Get a fully connected view of the relationship between data about your software stack and the behaviors and outcomes you’re monitoring Connect your Grafana dashboards (optional). Prometheus remote write dashboard How it works Signup for New Relic is fast and free — we won't even ask for a credit card number. Once logged in, you can get data flowing with a few simple steps: Generate your remote_write URL. Add the new remote_write URL to the configuration file for your Prometheus server. Restart your Prometheus server. Check for your data. Query and explore! Read the setup docs Add Prometheus data Remote write compatibility and requirements New Relic supports the Prometheus remote write integration for Prometheus versions 2.15.0 or newer. Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations New Relic’s Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations for Docker and Kubernetes allow you to scrape Prometheus endpoints and send the data to New Relic, so you can store and visualize crucial metrics on one platform. With these integrations, you can: Automatically identify a static list of endpoints. Collect metrics that are important to your business. Query and visualize this data in the New Relic UI. Connect your Grafana dashboards (optional). Kubernetes OpenMetrics dashboard Reduce overhead and scale your data Collect, analyze, and visualize your metrics data from any source, alongside your telemetry data, so you can correlate issues all in one place. Out-of-the-box integrations for open-source tools like Prometheus make it easy to get started, and eliminate the cost and complexity of hosting, operating, and managing additional monitoring systems. Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations gather all your data in one place, and New Relic stores the metrics from Prometheus. This integration helps remove the overhead of managing storage and availability of the Prometheus server. To learn more about how to scale your data without the hassles of managing Prometheus and a separate dashboard tool, see New Relic's Prometheus OpenMetrics integration blog post. Kubernetes In a Kubernetes environment, New Relic automatically discovers the endpoints in the same way that the Prometheus Kubernetes collector does it. The integration looks for the prometheus.io/scrape annotation or label. You can also identify additional static endpoints in the configuration. Docker The Prometheus OpenMetrics integration gathers all your data in one place, and New Relic stores the metrics from Prometheus. This integration helps remove the overhead of managing storage and availability of the Prometheus server. OpenMetrics integrations compatibility and requirements For Kubernetes and Docker OpenMetrics integrations, you should be aware of the following compatibility and requirements information. Kubernetes New Relic has contributed the Prometheus integration to the open source community under an Apache 2.0 license. This integration supports Prometheus protocol version 2 and Kubernetes versions 1.9 or higher. The integration was tested using Kubernetes 1.9, 1.11, and 1.13 on kops, GKE, and minikube. Limits apply to the metrics you send. For more details, see the metrics API documentation. Important Recommendation: Always run the scraper with one replica. Adding more replicas will result in duplicated data. Docker New Relic has contributed the Prometheus integration to the open source community under an Apache 2.0 license. This integration supports Prometheus protocol version 2. The integration was tested using Docker 1.9, 1.11, and 1.13 on kops, GKE, and minikube. Limits apply to the metrics you send. For details, see the metrics API documentation. What's next Ready to get moving? Here are some suggested next steps: Read the how-to for completing the remote write integration. Read the how-to for completing the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration. Both integration options generate dimensional metrics that are subject to the same rate limits described in the Metric API.

Max data points per minute (DPM) See Additional account conditions. 1 million DPM Max unique timeseries (cardinality) per account per day See Additional account conditions. 1 million A timeseries is a single, unique combination of a metric name and any attributes. Max unique timeseries (cardinality) per metric name per day 100k Max payloads per minute 100k Max attributes per metric 100 Max metric attribute name length 255 characters Max characters for an attribute key 255 characters Max metric attribute value length 4096 characters Allowed HTTP protocols HTTPS only Numerical long values falling outside minimum or maximum Java long values Numerical long values that fall outside of the minimum or maximum Java long value will be rejected. If the number is in the common block, then the entire block will be dropped. If the number is in a metric data point, then the metric data point it resides in will be dropped. Numerical double values falling outside minimum or maximum Java double values Numeric double values that fall outside of a the minimum or maximum Java double value will be rejected. If the number is in the common block, then the entire block will be dropped. If the number is in a metric data point, then the metric data point it resides in will be dropped. Payload size Total maximum size or length: 1MB (10^6 bytes) maximum per POST. We highly recommend using compression. Payload format The payload must encoded as UTF-8. Attribute naming syntax Attribute names can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), periods (.), and underscores (_). The following default limits apply only to data collected via the Prometheus Remote Write integration: Condition Limit Max unique Count and Summary timeseries (cardinality) per account per 5 minute interval See Additional account conditions. 1 million A timeseries is a single, unique combination of a metric name and any attributes. Timeseries received above this limit are dropped. This limit is enforced prior to and in addition to standard Metric limits. Additional account conditions Metric API limits apply at the individual account level. Trial and paid accounts receive a 1M DPM and 1M cardinality limit for trial purposes, but you can request up to 15M DPM and 15M cardinality for your account. To request changes to your metric rate limits, contact your New Relic account representative, or visit our Support portal. Rate limit violations This section describes how the Metric API behaves when you exceed the rate limits, and how to respond if limits are exceeded. Max data points per minute (DPM) Data points per minute refers to the per minute rate at which individual metric values are sent to the Metric API. When the maximum DPM limit is exceeded for an account, the New Relic Metric API returns a 429 response for the remainder of the minute. The response will include a Retry-After header indicating how long to wait in seconds before resubmitting or sending new data. To resolve this issue, either reduce the number of data points you are sending, or request a rate limit change. Subsequent subscription changes do not impact modified rate limits. If an account change impacts your rate limit, you must notify us to adjust your rate limit. To request rate limit changes, contact your New Relic account representative, or visit our Support portal. Max unique timeseries per account per day A timeseries is a single, unique combination of a metric name and any attributes assigned to that metric. For example, if a CPU utilization metric with a single attribute hostname is sent from ten different hosts, this equals ten distinct values for the hostname attribute and ten unique metric timeseries. If the per-account, per-day unique metric timeseries (cardinality) limit is exceeded during a 24 hour period, the endpoint will continue to receive and store raw metric data. However, New Relic will stop creating additional aggregate rollups (1 minute, 5 minutes, etc.) for the remainder of the 24 hour period. (These rollups are used used by default to query time windows longer than 60 minutes.) You can continue to query your data when such a violation occurs by specifying a 60 minute or shorter time window or specifying the RAW keyword as described in view and query your metrics. This can be helpful in identifying potential causes for the violation. Max unique timeseries per metric name per day A timeseries is a single, unique combination of a metric name and any attributes assigned to that metric. For example, if a CPU utilization metric with a single attribute hostname is sent from ten different hosts, this equals ten distinct values for the hostname attribute and ten unique metric timeseries. If the per-metric name, per-day unique metric timeseries (cardinality) limit is exceeded during a 24 hour period, the endpoint will continue to receive and store raw metric data. However, New Relic will stop creating additional aggregate rollups (1 minute, 5 minutes, etc.) for the remainder of the 24 hour period. (These rollups are used used by default to query time windows longer than 60 minutes.) You can continue to query your data when such a violation occurs by specifying a 60 minute or shorter time window or specifying the RAW keyword as described in view and query your metrics. This can be helpful in identifying potential causes for the violation. Max payloads per minute If you make more than 100k POST requests to the Metric API endpoint within a minute, the endpoint will return a 429 response for the remainder of the minute. The response will include a Retry-After header indicating how long to wait in seconds before resubmitting or sending new data. In general, if you reach this limit, consider creating larger payloads. To do this, combine more data points into each request to reduce the number of POSTs that are necessary. If this is not an option, you can request a rate limit increase by contacting your New Relic account representative or visiting our Support portal. Restricted attributes These attributes are restricted by the New Relic platform. Any values submitted with these keys in the attributes section of a metric data point will cause the data point to be dropped, or the value to be omitted or overwritten: Attribute Description newrelic.source This resets to the value metricAPI. metricName This resets to the name value passed into each data point. This allows name to be an attribute key. endTimestamp timestamp and interval.ms will be converted to an endTimestamp for the data point. These attributes are used internally to identify entities. Any values submitted with these keys in the attributes section of a metric data point may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. For more information please refer to Entity synthesis: Attribute Description entity.guid Unique identifier assigned to an entity by New Relic. entity.name Human-readable name of an entity, often used to identify an entity in the UI. entity.type Used to differentiate between different types of entities, like hosts, applications, etc. Additional restrictions include: Restriction Comments Metric and attribute names You cannot pass the same value for metric name and attribute name. In the following example, the metric is invalid because the metric is named service.errors.all and there is an attribute service.errors.all. Example: Metric value used as an attribute (invalid) [ { \"metrics\": [ { \"name\": \"service.errors.all\" , \"type\": \"count\", \"value\": 15, \"timestamp\": 1531414060739, \"interval.ms\": 10000, \"attributes\": { \"service.response.statuscode\": \"400\", \"service.errors.all\" : \"test\", \"service.name\": \"foo\" } } ] } ] Copy Reserved words The Metric API inherits some reserved words from New Relic Insights, including accountID, appId, and eventType. Additionally, the syntax terms for NRQL are restricted unless you backtick (``) them. For a full list, see Reserved words: NRQL syntax terms. Keys within metric JSON All keys used within the metric JSON cannot be attribute keys. This includes interval.ms, timestamp, value, common, min, max, count, sum, and metrics. Exception: You can use name as an attribute key.",

      "body": "You can get Prometheus data flowing in New Relic with just a few simple steps. This page covers basic setup for the remote write integration, as well as a few common troubleshooting topics. For information on integrating Prometheus servers in a high availability (HA) configuration, see our Prometheus high availability documentation. Set up the integration Go to the Prometheus remote write setup launcher in New Relic One, then complete these steps. Add Prometheus data Enter a name for the Prometheus server to be connected and your remote_write URL. Important: The name you enter for the server will create an attribute on your data. It will also be the name that identifies which Prometheus server is sending data to New Relic. Add a new remote_write URL to your Prometheus YML file. Add this information under global_config in the file, at the same indentation level as the global section. Use the following syntax: remote_write: - url: https://metric-api.newrelic.com/prometheus/v1/write?prometheus_server=YOUR_DATA_SOURCE_NAME bearer_token:YOUR_LICENSE_KEY Copy OR remote_write: - url: https://metric-api.newrelic.com/prometheus/v1/write?X-License-Key=YOUR_LICENSE_KEY&prometheus_server=YOUR_DATA_SOURCE_NAME Copy European Union accounts: If you're connecting from the EU, use the following URL: https://metric-api.eu.newrelic.com/prometheus/v1/write Copy Kubernetes and Helm remote write integrations: Add the remote write URL to your Helm values.yaml file. Replace remoteWrite: [] with two lines similar to the following example. Be sure to use your remote write URL and use indentation that matches the rest of the file: remoteWrite: - url: https://metric-api.newrelic.com/prometheus/v1/write?prometheus_server=YOUR_DATA_SOURCE_NAME bearer_token:YOUR_LICENSE_KEY Copy Restart your Prometheus server. View your data in the New Relic UI. For example, use the remote write dashboard we automatically create when you set up your integration. Map Prometheus and New Relic metric types The Prometheus remote write protocol does not include metric type information or other helpful metric metadata when sending metrics to New Relic. Because the remote write protocol doesn't include this information, New Relic infers the metric type based on Prometheus naming conventions. Metrics not following these naming conventions may not be mapped correctly. New Relic maps Prometheus metrics types into New Relic metric types based on Prometheus metric naming conventions as follows: metricName_bucket is stored as a New Relic count metric type. metricName_count is stored as a New Relic count metric type. metricName_total is stored as a New Relic count metric type. metricName_sum is stored as a New Relic summary metric type. Everything else is stored as a New Relic gauge metric type. Override metric type mappings If you have metrics that don't follow Prometheus naming conventions, you can configure remote-write to tag the metric with a newrelic_metric_type label that indicates the metric type. This label is stripped when received by New Relic. Example: You have a counter metric named my_counter, which does not have our naming convention suffix of _bucket, _count or _total. In this situation, your metric would be identified as a gauge rather than a counter. To correct this, add the following relabel configuration to your prometheus.yml: - url: https://metric-api.newrelic.com/prometheus/v1/write?X-License-Key=... write_relabel_configs: - source_labels: [__name__] regex: ^my_counter$ target_label: newrelic_metric_type replacement: \"counter\" action: replace Copy This rule matches any metric with the name my_counter and adds a newrelic_metric_type label that identifies it as a counter. You can use the following (case sensitive) values as the replacement value: counter gauge summary When a newrelic_metric_type label is present on a metric received and set to one of the valid values, New Relic will assign the indicated type to the metric (and strip the label) before downstream consumption in the data pipeline. If you have multiple metrics that don't follow the above naming conventions, you can add multiple rules with each rule matching different source labels. Set allow or deny lists for sent metrics If you need greater control over the data you send to New Relic, you can send a subset of your metrics. To do this, configure remote-write with the write_relabel_configs parameter with a subparameter action value of keep or deny. In this example, you'll only send the metrics that match the regular expression. Unmatched metrics won't be sent. Alternatively, you can use action: drop to drop all of the metrics that match the regular expression. - url: https://metric-api.newrelic.com/prometheus/v1/write?X-License-Key=... write_relabel_configs: - source_labels: [__name__] regex: \"coredns_(.*)|etcd_(.*)\" action: keep Copy This Kubernetes example uses this Helm chart's values.yaml file. If you're using a different Helm chart, please check its remoteWrite documentation (for example, some Helm files use camelcase writeRelabelConfigs instead). remoteWrite: - url: https://metric-api.newrelic.com/prometheus/v1/write?X-License-Key=... write_relabel_configs: - source_labels: [__name__] regex: \"coredns_(.*)|etcd_(.*)\" action: keep Copy Customize remote write behavior You can customize the following parameters if you are writing to more than one account in New Relic or are connecting more than one Prometheus data source to the same account in New Relic. For more information, see the docs on remote write tuning. X-License Key Your account's license key is not an API key. The license key is used for authentication and to identify which account to write data into. If you are configuring Prometheus to write into different New Relic accounts, use a different key on each remote write URL. prometheus_server URL parameter The prometheus_server parameter is a label or attribute used to add to stats that are written to NRDB. Use this same label when configuring your Grafana data source to limit results to just those from a particular prometheus_server. Optimize throughput and memory consumption Remote write increases the total memory consumption of your Prometheus servers. If you're experiencing issues we recommend the following: Increase max_samples_per_send for higher throughput workloads, along a proportional increase in capacity. If memory consumption is still a problem, try limiting the number of max_shards per server. Troubleshoot error messages If you receive an integration error message from New Relic or error messages in your Prometheus server logs after restarting your Prometheus server, review our remote write troubleshooting documentation. This includes fixing common errors, such as missing or incorrect characters, bad requests, request entity too large, and rate limit errors. Remove the integration When you remove the Prometheus remote write integration, this stops new data from flowing, but it will not purge or remove any historical data. To remove the integration, remove the configuration code snippet from your Prometheus YML file, then restart the server.",

      "body": "This page provides an overview of New Relic's Prometheus integration options and how they work. The information here will help you choose from among our options based on which one best fits your unique business needs. Prometheus OpenMetrics or remote write integration? We currently offer two integration options: Prometheus remote write integration and Prometheus OpenMetrics integration for Kubernetes or Docker. We recommend getting started with the remote write integration if you already have a Prometheus server install base. If you find it hard to manage your Prometheus cluster, or if you are getting started with integrating Prometheus Metrics, you should use OpenMetrics. Examine the benefits, reminders, and recommendations for each option below. Prometheus remote write integration Benefits: Easy access to your combined metrics in New Relic if you already have Prometheus servers. Access only takes one line of yaml in your Prometheus configuration. Access your metrics through both New Relic and Prometheus without making additional adjustments in Prometheus. Federation: Allows you to combine data from multiple servers into a single source. Prometheus High Availability support: We de-duplicate data from HA-pairs on ingest. Reminders: You will need to manage your Prometheus servers. You can reduce your storage retention. Fewer query loads to the server. Recommendations: Evaluate your observability needs to manage your data volumes better: The scrape interval is the biggest factor influencing data volumes: select it based on your observability needs. For example, changing from 15s (default value) to 30s can reduce data volumes by 50%. Set your filters and configure data to target (see metrics or targets). Balance remote write(s) between one or more New Relic accounts or sub-accounts to manage rate limits. Prometheus OpenMetrics integration for Kubernetes or Docker Benefits: Best for an alternative to Prometheus servers Store all your metrics directly in New Relic No need to manage any Prometheus servers yourself. No need for local storage. Reminders: Slightly more complex setup. No support for High Availability replicas. The Kubernetes operator is not available for enhanced operations automation. Regardless of the option you chose, with our Prometheus integrations: You can use Grafana or other query tools via New Relic's Prometheus' API. You benefit from more nuanced security and user management options as part of New Relic One. New Relic's database can be the centralized long-term data store for all your Prometheus metrics, allowing you to observe all your data in one place. You can execute queries to scale, supported by New Relic. Prometheus remote write integration The Prometheus remote write integration allows you to forward telemetry data from your existing Prometheus servers to New Relic. Once integrated, you can leverage the full range of options for setup and management, from raw data to queries, dashboards, and more. Scale your data and get moving quickly With the Prometheus remote write integration, you can: Store and visualize crucial metrics on a single platform Combine and group data across your entire software stack Get a fully connected view of the relationship between data about your software stack and the behaviors and outcomes you’re monitoring Connect your Grafana dashboards (optional). Prometheus remote write dashboard How it works Signup for New Relic is fast and free — we won't even ask for a credit card number. Once logged in, you can get data flowing with a few simple steps: Generate your remote_write URL. Add the new remote_write URL to the configuration file for your Prometheus server. Restart your Prometheus server. Check for your data. Query and explore! Read the setup docs Add Prometheus data Remote write compatibility and requirements New Relic supports the Prometheus remote write integration for Prometheus versions 2.15.0 or newer. Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations New Relic’s Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations for Docker and Kubernetes allow you to scrape Prometheus endpoints and send the data to New Relic, so you can store and visualize crucial metrics on one platform. With these integrations, you can: Automatically identify a static list of endpoints. Collect metrics that are important to your business. Query and visualize this data in the New Relic UI. Connect your Grafana dashboards (optional). Kubernetes OpenMetrics dashboard Reduce overhead and scale your data Collect, analyze, and visualize your metrics data from any source, alongside your telemetry data, so you can correlate issues all in one place. Out-of-the-box integrations for open-source tools like Prometheus make it easy to get started, and eliminate the cost and complexity of hosting, operating, and managing additional monitoring systems. Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations gather all your data in one place, and New Relic stores the metrics from Prometheus. This integration helps remove the overhead of managing storage and availability of the Prometheus server. To learn more about how to scale your data without the hassles of managing Prometheus and a separate dashboard tool, see New Relic's Prometheus OpenMetrics integration blog post. Kubernetes In a Kubernetes environment, New Relic automatically discovers the endpoints in the same way that the Prometheus Kubernetes collector does it. The integration looks for the prometheus.io/scrape annotation or label. You can also identify additional static endpoints in the configuration. Docker The Prometheus OpenMetrics integration gathers all your data in one place, and New Relic stores the metrics from Prometheus. This integration helps remove the overhead of managing storage and availability of the Prometheus server. OpenMetrics integrations compatibility and requirements For Kubernetes and Docker OpenMetrics integrations, you should be aware of the following compatibility and requirements information. Kubernetes New Relic has contributed the Prometheus integration to the open source community under an Apache 2.0 license. This integration supports Prometheus protocol version 2 and Kubernetes versions 1.9 or higher. The integration was tested using Kubernetes 1.9, 1.11, and 1.13 on kops, GKE, and minikube. Limits apply to the metrics you send. For more details, see the metrics API documentation. Important Recommendation: Always run the scraper with one replica. Adding more replicas will result in duplicated data. Docker New Relic has contributed the Prometheus integration to the open source community under an Apache 2.0 license. This integration supports Prometheus protocol version 2. The integration was tested using Docker 1.9, 1.11, and 1.13 on kops, GKE, and minikube. Limits apply to the metrics you send. For details, see the metrics API documentation. What's next Ready to get moving? Here are some suggested next steps: Read the how-to for completing the remote write integration. Read the how-to for completing the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration. Both integration options generate dimensional metrics that are subject to the same rate limits described in the Metric API.

      "body": "Problem You have installed the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration for Docker or Kubernetes, but you notice sparse data, missing metrics, and data gaps in New Relic's UI. Solution If some metrics are not being collected regularly, do the following: Check if the CPU is being throttled, and if the memory allocated to the container is enough. In case the container doesn't have enough resources available, it may send data with a longer interval between samples. Low memory limit may cause the integration to be killed and restarted. The correct limits and requests of resources can vary according to the number of targets monitored, and the number of metrics exposed by each target.For more information, see the guidelines in the large environment configuration documentation. Check for the following error message in the logs of the integration: {\"err\":\"unexpected post response code: 413: Request Entity Too Large\"} Copy This issue causes some payloads to be dropped, and it is currently fixed in new releases. If present, update the image to the most recent version. If some /metrics endpoints that are monitored by the integration time out or take several seconds to answer, they may slow down the scraping of data. The integration's performance can degrade if multiple endpoints take a huge amount of time to answer. This leads to intermittent and missing data. To detect those endpoints, run: SELECT average(nr_stats_integration_fetch_target_duration_seconds) FROM Metric where clusterName=’clustername' SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO FACET target LIMIT 30 Copy This query retrieves the data exposed by the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration, and it shows the time required to fetch each endpoint. Fix the endpoints with a latency above 1s, or exclude them from the monitoring removing the Prometheus scraping label. If it's not feasible to remove these endpoints, and the latency in the answer can't be avoided, configure the integration to run more workers in parallel. This allows the integration to fetch more endpoints at the same time. To do so, update the integration to the most recent version, and apply the new configuration option worker_threads. We advise to do it gradually, from 4, 6, 8 and up to 16. This workaround only minimizes the issue, and if multiple endpoints are misbehaving, performances will still be degraded. Moreover, memory and CPU consumption will increase with the number of workers, so memory and CPU must be increased accordingly. In case all the endpoints monitored have a low latency, and the container is not being throttled, run the following query. This helps you verify how much time the integration is taking to scrape all the targets, and to send the data if it's exceeding the configured scrape_duration. SELECT latest(nr_stats_integration_process_duration_seconds) FROM Metric where clusterName=’clustername' SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy First, update the integration to the latest image published. Then, to reduce the time needed to scrape all the targets, increase the number of workers with the configuration option worker_threads. We advise is to do it gradually, from 4 to 6, 8, and up to 16 until r_stats_integration_process_duration_seconds approaches the defined scrape_duration. Note that memory consumption and CPU usage will increase.",

      "body": "This page provides an overview of New Relic's Prometheus integration options and how they work. The information here will help you choose from among our options based on which one best fits your unique business needs. Prometheus OpenMetrics or remote write integration? We currently offer two integration options: Prometheus remote write integration and Prometheus OpenMetrics integration for Kubernetes or Docker. We recommend getting started with the remote write integration if you already have a Prometheus server install base. If you find it hard to manage your Prometheus cluster, or if you are getting started with integrating Prometheus Metrics, you should use OpenMetrics. Examine the benefits, reminders, and recommendations for each option below. Prometheus remote write integration Benefits: Easy access to your combined metrics in New Relic if you already have Prometheus servers. Access only takes one line of yaml in your Prometheus configuration. Access your metrics through both New Relic and Prometheus without making additional adjustments in Prometheus. Federation: Allows you to combine data from multiple servers into a single source. Prometheus High Availability support: We de-duplicate data from HA-pairs on ingest. Reminders: You will need to manage your Prometheus servers. You can reduce your storage retention. Fewer query loads to the server. Recommendations: Evaluate your observability needs to manage your data volumes better: The scrape interval is the biggest factor influencing data volumes: select it based on your observability needs. For example, changing from 15s (default value) to 30s can reduce data volumes by 50%. Set your filters and configure data to target (see metrics or targets). Balance remote write(s) between one or more New Relic accounts or sub-accounts to manage rate limits. Prometheus OpenMetrics integration for Kubernetes or Docker Benefits: Best for an alternative to Prometheus servers Store all your metrics directly in New Relic No need to manage any Prometheus servers yourself. No need for local storage. Reminders: Slightly more complex setup. No support for High Availability replicas. The Kubernetes operator is not available for enhanced operations automation. Regardless of the option you chose, with our Prometheus integrations: You can use Grafana or other query tools via New Relic's Prometheus' API. You benefit from more nuanced security and user management options as part of New Relic One. New Relic's database can be the centralized long-term data store for all your Prometheus metrics, allowing you to observe all your data in one place. You can execute queries to scale, supported by New Relic. Prometheus remote write integration The Prometheus remote write integration allows you to forward telemetry data from your existing Prometheus servers to New Relic. Once integrated, you can leverage the full range of options for setup and management, from raw data to queries, dashboards, and more. Scale your data and get moving quickly With the Prometheus remote write integration, you can: Store and visualize crucial metrics on a single platform Combine and group data across your entire software stack Get a fully connected view of the relationship between data about your software stack and the behaviors and outcomes you’re monitoring Connect your Grafana dashboards (optional). Prometheus remote write dashboard How it works Signup for New Relic is fast and free — we won't even ask for a credit card number. Once logged in, you can get data flowing with a few simple steps: Generate your remote_write URL. Add the new remote_write URL to the configuration file for your Prometheus server. Restart your Prometheus server. Check for your data. Query and explore! Read the setup docs Add Prometheus data Remote write compatibility and requirements New Relic supports the Prometheus remote write integration for Prometheus versions 2.15.0 or newer. Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations New Relic’s Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations for Docker and Kubernetes allow you to scrape Prometheus endpoints and send the data to New Relic, so you can store and visualize crucial metrics on one platform. With these integrations, you can: Automatically identify a static list of endpoints. Collect metrics that are important to your business. Query and visualize this data in the New Relic UI. Connect your Grafana dashboards (optional). Kubernetes OpenMetrics dashboard Reduce overhead and scale your data Collect, analyze, and visualize your metrics data from any source, alongside your telemetry data, so you can correlate issues all in one place. Out-of-the-box integrations for open-source tools like Prometheus make it easy to get started, and eliminate the cost and complexity of hosting, operating, and managing additional monitoring systems. Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations gather all your data in one place, and New Relic stores the metrics from Prometheus. This integration helps remove the overhead of managing storage and availability of the Prometheus server. To learn more about how to scale your data without the hassles of managing Prometheus and a separate dashboard tool, see New Relic's Prometheus OpenMetrics integration blog post. Kubernetes In a Kubernetes environment, New Relic automatically discovers the endpoints in the same way that the Prometheus Kubernetes collector does it. The integration looks for the prometheus.io/scrape annotation or label. You can also identify additional static endpoints in the configuration. Docker The Prometheus OpenMetrics integration gathers all your data in one place, and New Relic stores the metrics from Prometheus. This integration helps remove the overhead of managing storage and availability of the Prometheus server. OpenMetrics integrations compatibility and requirements For Kubernetes and Docker OpenMetrics integrations, you should be aware of the following compatibility and requirements information. Kubernetes New Relic has contributed the Prometheus integration to the open source community under an Apache 2.0 license. This integration supports Prometheus protocol version 2 and Kubernetes versions 1.9 or higher. The integration was tested using Kubernetes 1.9, 1.11, and 1.13 on kops, GKE, and minikube. Limits apply to the metrics you send. For more details, see the metrics API documentation. Important Recommendation: Always run the scraper with one replica. Adding more replicas will result in duplicated data. Docker New Relic has contributed the Prometheus integration to the open source community under an Apache 2.0 license. This integration supports Prometheus protocol version 2. The integration was tested using Docker 1.9, 1.11, and 1.13 on kops, GKE, and minikube. Limits apply to the metrics you send. For details, see the metrics API documentation. What's next Ready to get moving? Here are some suggested next steps: Read the how-to for completing the remote write integration.

      "body": "You can get Prometheus data flowing in New Relic with just a few simple steps. This page covers basic setup for the remote write integration, as well as a few common troubleshooting topics. For information on integrating Prometheus servers in a high availability (HA) configuration, see our Prometheus high availability documentation. Set up the integration Go to the Prometheus remote write setup launcher in New Relic One, then complete these steps. Add Prometheus data Enter a name for the Prometheus server to be connected and your remote_write URL. Important: The name you enter for the server will create an attribute on your data. It will also be the name that identifies which Prometheus server is sending data to New Relic. Add a new remote_write URL to your Prometheus YML file. Add this information under global_config in the file, at the same indentation level as the global section. Use the following syntax: remote_write: - url: https://metric-api.newrelic.com/prometheus/v1/write?prometheus_server=YOUR_DATA_SOURCE_NAME bearer_token:YOUR_LICENSE_KEY Copy OR remote_write: - url: https://metric-api.newrelic.com/prometheus/v1/write?X-License-Key=YOUR_LICENSE_KEY&prometheus_server=YOUR_DATA_SOURCE_NAME Copy European Union accounts: If you're connecting from the EU, use the following URL: https://metric-api.eu.newrelic.com/prometheus/v1/write Copy Kubernetes and Helm remote write integrations: Add the remote write URL to your Helm values.yaml file. Replace remoteWrite: [] with two lines similar to the following example. Be sure to use your remote write URL and use indentation that matches the rest of the file: remoteWrite: - url: https://metric-api.newrelic.com/prometheus/v1/write?prometheus_server=YOUR_DATA_SOURCE_NAME bearer_token:YOUR_LICENSE_KEY Copy Restart your Prometheus server. View your data in the New Relic UI. For example, use the remote write dashboard we automatically create when you set up your integration. Map Prometheus and New Relic metric types The Prometheus remote write protocol does not include metric type information or other helpful metric metadata when sending metrics to New Relic. Because the remote write protocol doesn't include this information, New Relic infers the metric type based on Prometheus naming conventions. Metrics not following these naming conventions may not be mapped correctly. New Relic maps Prometheus metrics types into New Relic metric types based on Prometheus metric naming conventions as follows: metricName_bucket is stored as a New Relic count metric type. metricName_count is stored as a New Relic count metric type. metricName_total is stored as a New Relic count metric type. metricName_sum is stored as a New Relic summary metric type. Everything else is stored as a New Relic gauge metric type. Override metric type mappings If you have metrics that don't follow Prometheus naming conventions, you can configure remote-write to tag the metric with a newrelic_metric_type label that indicates the metric type. This label is stripped when received by New Relic. Example: You have a counter metric named my_counter, which does not have our naming convention suffix of _bucket, _count or _total. In this situation, your metric would be identified as a gauge rather than a counter. To correct this, add the following relabel configuration to your prometheus.yml: - url: https://metric-api.newrelic.com/prometheus/v1/write?X-License-Key=... write_relabel_configs: - source_labels: [__name__] regex: ^my_counter$ target_label: newrelic_metric_type replacement: \"counter\" action: replace Copy This rule matches any metric with the name my_counter and adds a newrelic_metric_type label that identifies it as a counter. You can use the following (case sensitive) values as the replacement value: counter gauge summary When a newrelic_metric_type label is present on a metric received and set to one of the valid values, New Relic will assign the indicated type to the metric (and strip the label) before downstream consumption in the data pipeline. If you have multiple metrics that don't follow the above naming conventions, you can add multiple rules with each rule matching different source labels. Set allow or deny lists for sent metrics If you need greater control over the data you send to New Relic, you can send a subset of your metrics. To do this, configure remote-write with the write_relabel_configs parameter with a subparameter action value of keep or deny. In this example, you'll only send the metrics that match the regular expression. Unmatched metrics won't be sent. Alternatively, you can use action: drop to drop all of the metrics that match the regular expression. - url: https://metric-api.newrelic.com/prometheus/v1/write?X-License-Key=... write_relabel_configs: - source_labels: [__name__] regex: \"coredns_(.*)|etcd_(.*)\" action: keep Copy This Kubernetes example uses this Helm chart's values.yaml file. If you're using a different Helm chart, please check its remoteWrite documentation (for example, some Helm files use camelcase writeRelabelConfigs instead). remoteWrite: - url: https://metric-api.newrelic.com/prometheus/v1/write?X-License-Key=... write_relabel_configs: - source_labels: [__name__] regex: \"coredns_(.*)|etcd_(.*)\" action: keep Copy Customize remote write behavior You can customize the following parameters if you are writing to more than one account in New Relic or are connecting more than one Prometheus data source to the same account in New Relic. For more information, see the docs on remote write tuning. X-License Key Your account's license key is not an API key. The license key is used for authentication and to identify which account to write data into. If you are configuring Prometheus to write into different New Relic accounts, use a different key on each remote write URL. prometheus_server URL parameter The prometheus_server parameter is a label or attribute used to add to stats that are written to NRDB. Use this same label when configuring your Grafana data source to limit results to just those from a particular prometheus_server. Optimize throughput and memory consumption Remote write increases the total memory consumption of your Prometheus servers. If you're experiencing issues we recommend the following: Increase max_samples_per_send for higher throughput workloads, along a proportional increase in capacity. If memory consumption is still a problem, try limiting the number of max_shards per server. Troubleshoot error messages If you receive an integration error message from New Relic or error messages in your Prometheus server logs after restarting your Prometheus server, review our remote write troubleshooting documentation. This includes fixing common errors, such as missing or incorrect characters, bad requests, request entity too large, and rate limit errors. Remove the integration When you remove the Prometheus remote write integration, this stops new data from flowing, but it will not purge or remove any historical data. To remove the integration, remove the configuration code snippet from your Prometheus YML file, then restart the server.",

      "body": "This page provides an overview of New Relic's Prometheus integration options and how they work. The information here will help you choose from among our options based on which one best fits your unique business needs. Prometheus OpenMetrics or remote write integration? We currently offer two integration options: Prometheus remote write integration and Prometheus OpenMetrics integration for Kubernetes or Docker. We recommend getting started with the remote write integration if you already have a Prometheus server install base. If you find it hard to manage your Prometheus cluster, or if you are getting started with integrating Prometheus Metrics, you should use OpenMetrics. Examine the benefits, reminders, and recommendations for each option below. Prometheus remote write integration Benefits: Easy access to your combined metrics in New Relic if you already have Prometheus servers. Access only takes one line of yaml in your Prometheus configuration. Access your metrics through both New Relic and Prometheus without making additional adjustments in Prometheus. Federation: Allows you to combine data from multiple servers into a single source. Prometheus High Availability support: We de-duplicate data from HA-pairs on ingest. Reminders: You will need to manage your Prometheus servers. You can reduce your storage retention. Fewer query loads to the server. Recommendations: Evaluate your observability needs to manage your data volumes better: The scrape interval is the biggest factor influencing data volumes: select it based on your observability needs. For example, changing from 15s (default value) to 30s can reduce data volumes by 50%. Set your filters and configure data to target (see metrics or targets). Balance remote write(s) between one or more New Relic accounts or sub-accounts to manage rate limits. Prometheus OpenMetrics integration for Kubernetes or Docker Benefits: Best for an alternative to Prometheus servers Store all your metrics directly in New Relic No need to manage any Prometheus servers yourself. No need for local storage. Reminders: Slightly more complex setup. No support for High Availability replicas. The Kubernetes operator is not available for enhanced operations automation. Regardless of the option you chose, with our Prometheus integrations: You can use Grafana or other query tools via New Relic's Prometheus' API. You benefit from more nuanced security and user management options as part of New Relic One. New Relic's database can be the centralized long-term data store for all your Prometheus metrics, allowing you to observe all your data in one place. You can execute queries to scale, supported by New Relic. Prometheus remote write integration The Prometheus remote write integration allows you to forward telemetry data from your existing Prometheus servers to New Relic. Once integrated, you can leverage the full range of options for setup and management, from raw data to queries, dashboards, and more. Scale your data and get moving quickly With the Prometheus remote write integration, you can: Store and visualize crucial metrics on a single platform Combine and group data across your entire software stack Get a fully connected view of the relationship between data about your software stack and the behaviors and outcomes you’re monitoring Connect your Grafana dashboards (optional). Prometheus remote write dashboard How it works Signup for New Relic is fast and free — we won't even ask for a credit card number. Once logged in, you can get data flowing with a few simple steps: Generate your remote_write URL. Add the new remote_write URL to the configuration file for your Prometheus server. Restart your Prometheus server. Check for your data. Query and explore! Read the setup docs Add Prometheus data Remote write compatibility and requirements New Relic supports the Prometheus remote write integration for Prometheus versions 2.15.0 or newer. Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations New Relic’s Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations for Docker and Kubernetes allow you to scrape Prometheus endpoints and send the data to New Relic, so you can store and visualize crucial metrics on one platform. With these integrations, you can: Automatically identify a static list of endpoints. Collect metrics that are important to your business. Query and visualize this data in the New Relic UI. Connect your Grafana dashboards (optional). Kubernetes OpenMetrics dashboard Reduce overhead and scale your data Collect, analyze, and visualize your metrics data from any source, alongside your telemetry data, so you can correlate issues all in one place. Out-of-the-box integrations for open-source tools like Prometheus make it easy to get started, and eliminate the cost and complexity of hosting, operating, and managing additional monitoring systems. Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations gather all your data in one place, and New Relic stores the metrics from Prometheus. This integration helps remove the overhead of managing storage and availability of the Prometheus server. To learn more about how to scale your data without the hassles of managing Prometheus and a separate dashboard tool, see New Relic's Prometheus OpenMetrics integration blog post. Kubernetes In a Kubernetes environment, New Relic automatically discovers the endpoints in the same way that the Prometheus Kubernetes collector does it. The integration looks for the prometheus.io/scrape annotation or label. You can also identify additional static endpoints in the configuration. Docker The Prometheus OpenMetrics integration gathers all your data in one place, and New Relic stores the metrics from Prometheus. This integration helps remove the overhead of managing storage and availability of the Prometheus server.

      "body": "Problem You have installed the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration for Docker or Kubernetes, but you notice sparse data, missing metrics, and data gaps in New Relic's UI. Solution If some metrics are not being collected regularly, do the following: Check if the CPU is being throttled, and if the memory allocated to the container is enough. In case the container doesn't have enough resources available, it may send data with a longer interval between samples. Low memory limit may cause the integration to be killed and restarted. The correct limits and requests of resources can vary according to the number of targets monitored, and the number of metrics exposed by each target.For more information, see the guidelines in the large environment configuration documentation. Check for the following error message in the logs of the integration: {\"err\":\"unexpected post response code: 413: Request Entity Too Large\"} Copy This issue causes some payloads to be dropped, and it is currently fixed in new releases. If present, update the image to the most recent version. If some /metrics endpoints that are monitored by the integration time out or take several seconds to answer, they may slow down the scraping of data. The integration's performance can degrade if multiple endpoints take a huge amount of time to answer. This leads to intermittent and missing data. To detect those endpoints, run: SELECT average(nr_stats_integration_fetch_target_duration_seconds) FROM Metric where clusterName=’clustername' SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO FACET target LIMIT 30 Copy This query retrieves the data exposed by the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration, and it shows the time required to fetch each endpoint. Fix the endpoints with a latency above 1s, or exclude them from the monitoring removing the Prometheus scraping label. If it's not feasible to remove these endpoints, and the latency in the answer can't be avoided, configure the integration to run more workers in parallel. This allows the integration to fetch more endpoints at the same time. To do so, update the integration to the most recent version, and apply the new configuration option worker_threads. We advise to do it gradually, from 4, 6, 8 and up to 16. This workaround only minimizes the issue, and if multiple endpoints are misbehaving, performances will still be degraded. Moreover, memory and CPU consumption will increase with the number of workers, so memory and CPU must be increased accordingly. In case all the endpoints monitored have a low latency, and the container is not being throttled, run the following query. This helps you verify how much time the integration is taking to scrape all the targets, and to send the data if it's exceeding the configured scrape_duration. SELECT latest(nr_stats_integration_process_duration_seconds) FROM Metric where clusterName=’clustername' SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy First, update the integration to the latest image published. Then, to reduce the time needed to scrape all the targets, increase the number of workers with the configuration option worker_threads. We advise is to do it gradually, from 4 to 6, 8, and up to 16 until r_stats_integration_process_duration_seconds approaches the defined scrape_duration. Note that memory consumption and CPU usage will increase.",

The information here will help you choose from among our options based on which one best fits your unique business needs. Prometheus OpenMetrics or remote write integration? We currently offer two integration options: Prometheus remote write integration and Prometheus OpenMetrics integration for Kubernetes or Docker. We recommend getting started with the remote write integration if you already have a Prometheus server install base. If you find it hard to manage your Prometheus cluster, or if you are getting started with integrating Prometheus Metrics, you should use OpenMetrics. Examine the benefits, reminders, and recommendations for each option below. Prometheus remote write integration Benefits: Easy access to your combined metrics in New Relic if you already have Prometheus servers. Access only takes one line of yaml in your Prometheus configuration. Access your metrics through both New Relic and Prometheus without making additional adjustments in Prometheus. Federation: Allows you to combine data from multiple servers into a single source. Prometheus High Availability support: We de-duplicate data from HA-pairs on ingest. Reminders: You will need to manage your Prometheus servers. You can reduce your storage retention. Fewer query loads to the server. Recommendations: Evaluate your observability needs to manage your data volumes better: The scrape interval is the biggest factor influencing data volumes: select it based on your observability needs. For example, changing from 15s (default value) to 30s can reduce data volumes by 50%. Set your filters and configure data to target (see metrics or targets). Balance remote write(s) between one or more New Relic accounts or sub-accounts to manage rate limits. Prometheus OpenMetrics integration for Kubernetes or Docker Benefits: Best for an alternative to Prometheus servers Store all your metrics directly in New Relic No need to manage any Prometheus servers yourself. No need for local storage. Reminders: Slightly more complex setup. No support for High Availability replicas. The Kubernetes operator is not available for enhanced operations automation. Regardless of the option you chose, with our Prometheus integrations: You can use Grafana or other query tools via New Relic's Prometheus' API. You benefit from more nuanced security and user management options as part of New Relic One. New Relic's database can be the centralized long-term data store for all your Prometheus metrics, allowing you to observe all your data in one place. You can execute queries to scale, supported by New Relic. Prometheus remote write integration The Prometheus remote write integration allows you to forward telemetry data from your existing Prometheus servers to New Relic. Once integrated, you can leverage the full range of options for setup and management, from raw data to queries, dashboards, and more. Scale your data and get moving quickly With the Prometheus remote write integration, you can: Store and visualize crucial metrics on a single platform Combine and group data across your entire software stack Get a fully connected view of the relationship between data about your software stack and the behaviors and outcomes you’re monitoring Connect your Grafana dashboards (optional). Prometheus remote write dashboard How it works Signup for New Relic is fast and free — we won't even ask for a credit card number. Once logged in, you can get data flowing with a few simple steps: Generate your remote_write URL. Add the new remote_write URL to the configuration file for your Prometheus server. Restart your Prometheus server. Check for your data. Query and explore! Read the setup docs Add Prometheus data Remote write compatibility and requirements New Relic supports the Prometheus remote write integration for Prometheus versions 2.15.0 or newer. Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations New Relic’s Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations for Docker and Kubernetes allow you to scrape Prometheus endpoints and send the data to New Relic, so you can store and visualize crucial metrics on one platform. With these integrations, you can: Automatically identify a static list of endpoints. Collect metrics that are important to your business. Query and visualize this data in the New Relic UI. Connect your Grafana dashboards (optional). Kubernetes OpenMetrics dashboard Reduce overhead and scale your data Collect, analyze, and visualize your metrics data from any source, alongside your telemetry data, so you can correlate issues all in one place. Out-of-the-box integrations for open-source tools like Prometheus make it easy to get started, and eliminate the cost and complexity of hosting, operating, and managing additional monitoring systems. Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations gather all your data in one place, and New Relic stores the metrics from Prometheus. This integration helps remove the overhead of managing storage and availability of the Prometheus server. To learn more about how to scale your data without the hassles of managing Prometheus and a separate dashboard tool, see New Relic's Prometheus OpenMetrics integration blog post. Kubernetes In a Kubernetes environment, New Relic automatically discovers the endpoints in the same way that the Prometheus Kubernetes collector does it. The integration looks for the prometheus.io/scrape annotation or label. You can also identify additional static endpoints in the configuration. Docker The Prometheus OpenMetrics integration gathers all your data in one place, and New Relic stores the metrics from Prometheus. This integration helps remove the overhead of managing storage and availability of the Prometheus server. OpenMetrics integrations compatibility and requirements For Kubernetes and Docker OpenMetrics integrations, you should be aware of the following compatibility and requirements information. Kubernetes New Relic has contributed the Prometheus integration to the open source community under an Apache 2.0 license. This integration supports Prometheus protocol version 2 and Kubernetes versions 1.9 or higher. The integration was tested using Kubernetes 1.9, 1.11, and 1.13 on kops, GKE, and minikube. Limits apply to the metrics you send. For more details, see the metrics API documentation. Important Recommendation: Always run the scraper with one replica. Adding more replicas will result in duplicated data. Docker New Relic has contributed the Prometheus integration to the open source community under an Apache 2.0 license. This integration supports Prometheus protocol version 2. The integration was tested using Docker 1.9, 1.11, and 1.13 on kops, GKE, and minikube. Limits apply to the metrics you send.

      "body": "This page provides an overview of New Relic's Prometheus integration options and how they work. The information here will help you choose from among our options based on which one best fits your unique business needs. Prometheus OpenMetrics or remote write integration? We currently offer two integration options: Prometheus remote write integration and Prometheus OpenMetrics integration for Kubernetes or Docker. We recommend getting started with the remote write integration if you already have a Prometheus server install base. If you find it hard to manage your Prometheus cluster, or if you are getting started with integrating Prometheus Metrics, you should use OpenMetrics. Examine the benefits, reminders, and recommendations for each option below. Prometheus remote write integration Benefits: Easy access to your combined metrics in New Relic if you already have Prometheus servers. Access only takes one line of yaml in your Prometheus configuration. Access your metrics through both New Relic and Prometheus without making additional adjustments in Prometheus. Federation: Allows you to combine data from multiple servers into a single source. Prometheus High Availability support: We de-duplicate data from HA-pairs on ingest. Reminders: You will need to manage your Prometheus servers. You can reduce your storage retention. Fewer query loads to the server. Recommendations: Evaluate your observability needs to manage your data volumes better: The scrape interval is the biggest factor influencing data volumes: select it based on your observability needs. For example, changing from 15s (default value) to 30s can reduce data volumes by 50%. Set your filters and configure data to target (see metrics or targets). Balance remote write(s) between one or more New Relic accounts or sub-accounts to manage rate limits. Prometheus OpenMetrics integration for Kubernetes or Docker Benefits: Best for an alternative to Prometheus servers Store all your metrics directly in New Relic No need to manage any Prometheus servers yourself. No need for local storage. Reminders: Slightly more complex setup. No support for High Availability replicas. The Kubernetes operator is not available for enhanced operations automation. Regardless of the option you chose, with our Prometheus integrations: You can use Grafana or other query tools via New Relic's Prometheus' API. You benefit from more nuanced security and user management options as part of New Relic One. New Relic's database can be the centralized long-term data store for all your Prometheus metrics, allowing you to observe all your data in one place. You can execute queries to scale, supported by New Relic. Prometheus remote write integration The Prometheus remote write integration allows you to forward telemetry data from your existing Prometheus servers to New Relic. Once integrated, you can leverage the full range of options for setup and management, from raw data to queries, dashboards, and more. Scale your data and get moving quickly With the Prometheus remote write integration, you can: Store and visualize crucial metrics on a single platform Combine and group data across your entire software stack Get a fully connected view of the relationship between data about your software stack and the behaviors and outcomes you’re monitoring Connect your Grafana dashboards (optional). Prometheus remote write dashboard How it works Signup for New Relic is fast and free — we won't even ask for a credit card number. Once logged in, you can get data flowing with a few simple steps: Generate your remote_write URL. Add the new remote_write URL to the configuration file for your Prometheus server. Restart your Prometheus server. Check for your data. Query and explore! Read the setup docs Add Prometheus data Remote write compatibility and requirements New Relic supports the Prometheus remote write integration for Prometheus versions 2.15.0 or newer. Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations New Relic’s Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations for Docker and Kubernetes allow you to scrape Prometheus endpoints and send the data to New Relic, so you can store and visualize crucial metrics on one platform. With these integrations, you can: Automatically identify a static list of endpoints. Collect metrics that are important to your business. Query and visualize this data in the New Relic UI. Connect your Grafana dashboards (optional). Kubernetes OpenMetrics dashboard Reduce overhead and scale your data Collect, analyze, and visualize your metrics data from any source, alongside your telemetry data, so you can correlate issues all in one place. Out-of-the-box integrations for open-source tools like Prometheus make it easy to get started, and eliminate the cost and complexity of hosting, operating, and managing additional monitoring systems. Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations gather all your data in one place, and New Relic stores the metrics from Prometheus. This integration helps remove the overhead of managing storage and availability of the Prometheus server. To learn more about how to scale your data without the hassles of managing Prometheus and a separate dashboard tool, see New Relic's Prometheus OpenMetrics integration blog post. Kubernetes In a Kubernetes environment, New Relic automatically discovers the endpoints in the same way that the Prometheus Kubernetes collector does it. The integration looks for the prometheus.io/scrape annotation or label. You can also identify additional static endpoints in the configuration. Docker The Prometheus OpenMetrics integration gathers all your data in one place, and New Relic stores the metrics from Prometheus. This integration helps remove the overhead of managing storage and availability of the Prometheus server. OpenMetrics integrations compatibility and requirements For Kubernetes and Docker OpenMetrics integrations, you should be aware of the following compatibility and requirements information. Kubernetes New Relic has contributed the Prometheus integration to the open source community under an Apache 2.0 license. This integration supports Prometheus protocol version 2 and Kubernetes versions 1.9 or higher. The integration was tested using Kubernetes 1.9, 1.11, and 1.13 on kops, GKE, and minikube. Limits apply to the metrics you send. For more details, see the metrics API documentation. Important Recommendation: Always run the scraper with one replica. Adding more replicas will result in duplicated data. Docker New Relic has contributed the Prometheus integration to the open source community under an Apache 2.0 license. This integration supports Prometheus protocol version 2. The integration was tested using Docker 1.9, 1.11, and 1.13 on kops, GKE, and minikube. Limits apply to the metrics you send. For details, see the metrics API documentation. What's next Ready to get moving? Here are some suggested next steps: Read the how-to for completing the remote write integration. Read the how-to for completing the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration. Both integration options generate dimensional metrics that are subject to the same rate limits described in the Metric API.

      "body": "Problem You have installed the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration for Docker or Kubernetes, and it consumes too much memory or CPU. Solution When running the integration in a huge cluster scraping hundreds of targets, CPU and memory consumption will increase, and the number of workers could affect scrape_duration. For example, a Prometheus OpenMetrics integration consumes 2.5 CPU and 700Mb of RAM because: It scrapes 800 targets, exposing 1000 timeseries each. Each one has a latency of 150ms with a scrape_duration of 30 seconds. To reduce resource consumption: Update the integration to the latest available image. Reduce harvest time by lowering emitter_harvest_period. (The default value is 1s, and the interval cannot be smaller than 200ms.) Since metrics are sent more often, memory consumption is reduced. Collect metrics less frequently by increasing scrape_duration to reduce both memory consumption and CPU usage. Reduce the number of workers to reduce both memory consumption and CPU usage. Scraping will slow down and could exceed scrape_duration. To do so: Update the integration to the latest version available of the image. Decrease worker_threads from the default value of 4 to your preferred value.",

      "body": "Problem You have installed the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration for Docker or Kubernetes, but you notice sparse data, missing metrics, and data gaps in New Relic's UI. Solution If some metrics are not being collected regularly, do the following: Check if the CPU is being throttled, and if the memory allocated to the container is enough. In case the container doesn't have enough resources available, it may send data with a longer interval between samples. Low memory limit may cause the integration to be killed and restarted. The correct limits and requests of resources can vary according to the number of targets monitored, and the number of metrics exposed by each target.For more information, see the guidelines in the large environment configuration documentation. Check for the following error message in the logs of the integration: {\"err\":\"unexpected post response code: 413: Request Entity Too Large\"} Copy This issue causes some payloads to be dropped, and it is currently fixed in new releases. If present, update the image to the most recent version. If some /metrics endpoints that are monitored by the integration time out or take several seconds to answer, they may slow down the scraping of data. The integration's performance can degrade if multiple endpoints take a huge amount of time to answer. This leads to intermittent and missing data. To detect those endpoints, run: SELECT average(nr_stats_integration_fetch_target_duration_seconds) FROM Metric where clusterName=’clustername' SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO FACET target LIMIT 30 Copy This query retrieves the data exposed by the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration, and it shows the time required to fetch each endpoint. Fix the endpoints with a latency above 1s, or exclude them from the monitoring removing the Prometheus scraping label. If it's not feasible to remove these endpoints, and the latency in the answer can't be avoided, configure the integration to run more workers in parallel. This allows the integration to fetch more endpoints at the same time. To do so, update the integration to the most recent version, and apply the new configuration option worker_threads. We advise to do it gradually, from 4, 6, 8 and up to 16. This workaround only minimizes the issue, and if multiple endpoints are misbehaving, performances will still be degraded. Moreover, memory and CPU consumption will increase with the number of workers, so memory and CPU must be increased accordingly. In case all the endpoints monitored have a low latency, and the container is not being throttled, run the following query. This helps you verify how much time the integration is taking to scrape all the targets, and to send the data if it's exceeding the configured scrape_duration. SELECT latest(nr_stats_integration_process_duration_seconds) FROM Metric where clusterName=’clustername' SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy First, update the integration to the latest image published. Then, to reduce the time needed to scrape all the targets, increase the number of workers with the configuration option worker_threads. We advise is to do it gradually, from 4 to 6, 8, and up to 16 until r_stats_integration_process_duration_seconds approaches the defined scrape_duration. Note that memory consumption and CPU usage will increase.",

The information here will help you choose from among our options based on which one best fits your unique business needs. Prometheus OpenMetrics or remote write integration? We currently offer two integration options: Prometheus remote write integration and Prometheus OpenMetrics integration for Kubernetes or Docker. We recommend getting started with the remote write integration if you already have a Prometheus server install base. If you find it hard to manage your Prometheus cluster, or if you are getting started with integrating Prometheus Metrics, you should use OpenMetrics. Examine the benefits, reminders, and recommendations for each option below. Prometheus remote write integration Benefits: Easy access to your combined metrics in New Relic if you already have Prometheus servers. Access only takes one line of yaml in your Prometheus configuration. Access your metrics through both New Relic and Prometheus without making additional adjustments in Prometheus. Federation: Allows you to combine data from multiple servers into a single source. Prometheus High Availability support: We de-duplicate data from HA-pairs on ingest. Reminders: You will need to manage your Prometheus servers. You can reduce your storage retention. Fewer query loads to the server. Recommendations: Evaluate your observability needs to manage your data volumes better: The scrape interval is the biggest factor influencing data volumes: select it based on your observability needs. For example, changing from 15s (default value) to 30s can reduce data volumes by 50%. Set your filters and configure data to target (see metrics or targets). Balance remote write(s) between one or more New Relic accounts or sub-accounts to manage rate limits. Prometheus OpenMetrics integration for Kubernetes or Docker Benefits: Best for an alternative to Prometheus servers Store all your metrics directly in New Relic No need to manage any Prometheus servers yourself. No need for local storage. Reminders: Slightly more complex setup. No support for High Availability replicas. The Kubernetes operator is not available for enhanced operations automation. Regardless of the option you chose, with our Prometheus integrations: You can use Grafana or other query tools via New Relic's Prometheus' API. You benefit from more nuanced security and user management options as part of New Relic One. New Relic's database can be the centralized long-term data store for all your Prometheus metrics, allowing you to observe all your data in one place. You can execute queries to scale, supported by New Relic. Prometheus remote write integration The Prometheus remote write integration allows you to forward telemetry data from your existing Prometheus servers to New Relic. Once integrated, you can leverage the full range of options for setup and management, from raw data to queries, dashboards, and more. Scale your data and get moving quickly With the Prometheus remote write integration, you can: Store and visualize crucial metrics on a single platform Combine and group data across your entire software stack Get a fully connected view of the relationship between data about your software stack and the behaviors and outcomes you’re monitoring Connect your Grafana dashboards (optional). Prometheus remote write dashboard How it works Signup for New Relic is fast and free — we won't even ask for a credit card number. Once logged in, you can get data flowing with a few simple steps: Generate your remote_write URL. Add the new remote_write URL to the configuration file for your Prometheus server. Restart your Prometheus server. Check for your data. Query and explore! Read the setup docs Add Prometheus data Remote write compatibility and requirements New Relic supports the Prometheus remote write integration for Prometheus versions 2.15.0 or newer. Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations New Relic’s Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations for Docker and Kubernetes allow you to scrape Prometheus endpoints and send the data to New Relic, so you can store and visualize crucial metrics on one platform. With these integrations, you can: Automatically identify a static list of endpoints. Collect metrics that are important to your business. Query and visualize this data in the New Relic UI. Connect your Grafana dashboards (optional). Kubernetes OpenMetrics dashboard Reduce overhead and scale your data Collect, analyze, and visualize your metrics data from any source, alongside your telemetry data, so you can correlate issues all in one place. Out-of-the-box integrations for open-source tools like Prometheus make it easy to get started, and eliminate the cost and complexity of hosting, operating, and managing additional monitoring systems. Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations gather all your data in one place, and New Relic stores the metrics from Prometheus. This integration helps remove the overhead of managing storage and availability of the Prometheus server. To learn more about how to scale your data without the hassles of managing Prometheus and a separate dashboard tool, see New Relic's Prometheus OpenMetrics integration blog post. Kubernetes In a Kubernetes environment, New Relic automatically discovers the endpoints in the same way that the Prometheus Kubernetes collector does it. The integration looks for the prometheus.io/scrape annotation or label. You can also identify additional static endpoints in the configuration. Docker The Prometheus OpenMetrics integration gathers all your data in one place, and New Relic stores the metrics from Prometheus. This integration helps remove the overhead of managing storage and availability of the Prometheus server. OpenMetrics integrations compatibility and requirements For Kubernetes and Docker OpenMetrics integrations, you should be aware of the following compatibility and requirements information. Kubernetes New Relic has contributed the Prometheus integration to the open source community under an Apache 2.0 license. This integration supports Prometheus protocol version 2 and Kubernetes versions 1.9 or higher. The integration was tested using Kubernetes 1.9, 1.11, and 1.13 on kops, GKE, and minikube. Limits apply to the metrics you send. For more details, see the metrics API documentation. Important Recommendation: Always run the scraper with one replica.

      "body": "This page provides an overview of New Relic's Prometheus integration options and how they work. The information here will help you choose from among our options based on which one best fits your unique business needs. Prometheus OpenMetrics or remote write integration? We currently offer two integration options: Prometheus remote write integration and Prometheus OpenMetrics integration for Kubernetes or Docker. We recommend getting started with the remote write integration if you already have a Prometheus server install base. If you find it hard to manage your Prometheus cluster, or if you are getting started with integrating Prometheus Metrics, you should use OpenMetrics. Examine the benefits, reminders, and recommendations for each option below. Prometheus remote write integration Benefits: Easy access to your combined metrics in New Relic if you already have Prometheus servers. Access only takes one line of yaml in your Prometheus configuration. Access your metrics through both New Relic and Prometheus without making additional adjustments in Prometheus. Federation: Allows you to combine data from multiple servers into a single source. Prometheus High Availability support: We de-duplicate data from HA-pairs on ingest. Reminders: You will need to manage your Prometheus servers. You can reduce your storage retention. Fewer query loads to the server. Recommendations: Evaluate your observability needs to manage your data volumes better: The scrape interval is the biggest factor influencing data volumes: select it based on your observability needs. For example, changing from 15s (default value) to 30s can reduce data volumes by 50%. Set your filters and configure data to target (see metrics or targets). Balance remote write(s) between one or more New Relic accounts or sub-accounts to manage rate limits. Prometheus OpenMetrics integration for Kubernetes or Docker Benefits: Best for an alternative to Prometheus servers Store all your metrics directly in New Relic No need to manage any Prometheus servers yourself. No need for local storage. Reminders: Slightly more complex setup. No support for High Availability replicas. The Kubernetes operator is not available for enhanced operations automation. Regardless of the option you chose, with our Prometheus integrations: You can use Grafana or other query tools via New Relic's Prometheus' API. You benefit from more nuanced security and user management options as part of New Relic One. New Relic's database can be the centralized long-term data store for all your Prometheus metrics, allowing you to observe all your data in one place. You can execute queries to scale, supported by New Relic. Prometheus remote write integration The Prometheus remote write integration allows you to forward telemetry data from your existing Prometheus servers to New Relic. Once integrated, you can leverage the full range of options for setup and management, from raw data to queries, dashboards, and more. Scale your data and get moving quickly With the Prometheus remote write integration, you can: Store and visualize crucial metrics on a single platform Combine and group data across your entire software stack Get a fully connected view of the relationship between data about your software stack and the behaviors and outcomes you’re monitoring Connect your Grafana dashboards (optional). Prometheus remote write dashboard How it works Signup for New Relic is fast and free — we won't even ask for a credit card number. Once logged in, you can get data flowing with a few simple steps: Generate your remote_write URL. Add the new remote_write URL to the configuration file for your Prometheus server. Restart your Prometheus server. Check for your data. Query and explore! Read the setup docs Add Prometheus data Remote write compatibility and requirements New Relic supports the Prometheus remote write integration for Prometheus versions 2.15.0 or newer. Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations New Relic’s Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations for Docker and Kubernetes allow you to scrape Prometheus endpoints and send the data to New Relic, so you can store and visualize crucial metrics on one platform. With these integrations, you can: Automatically identify a static list of endpoints. Collect metrics that are important to your business. Query and visualize this data in the New Relic UI. Connect your Grafana dashboards (optional). Kubernetes OpenMetrics dashboard Reduce overhead and scale your data Collect, analyze, and visualize your metrics data from any source, alongside your telemetry data, so you can correlate issues all in one place. Out-of-the-box integrations for open-source tools like Prometheus make it easy to get started, and eliminate the cost and complexity of hosting, operating, and managing additional monitoring systems. Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations gather all your data in one place, and New Relic stores the metrics from Prometheus. This integration helps remove the overhead of managing storage and availability of the Prometheus server. To learn more about how to scale your data without the hassles of managing Prometheus and a separate dashboard tool, see New Relic's Prometheus OpenMetrics integration blog post. Kubernetes In a Kubernetes environment, New Relic automatically discovers the endpoints in the same way that the Prometheus Kubernetes collector does it. The integration looks for the prometheus.io/scrape annotation or label. You can also identify additional static endpoints in the configuration. Docker The Prometheus OpenMetrics integration gathers all your data in one place, and New Relic stores the metrics from Prometheus. This integration helps remove the overhead of managing storage and availability of the Prometheus server. OpenMetrics integrations compatibility and requirements For Kubernetes and Docker OpenMetrics integrations, you should be aware of the following compatibility and requirements information. Kubernetes New Relic has contributed the Prometheus integration to the open source community under an Apache 2.0 license. This integration supports Prometheus protocol version 2 and Kubernetes versions 1.9 or higher. The integration was tested using Kubernetes 1.9, 1.11, and 1.13 on kops, GKE, and minikube. Limits apply to the metrics you send. For more details, see the metrics API documentation. Important Recommendation: Always run the scraper with one replica. Adding more replicas will result in duplicated data. Docker New Relic has contributed the Prometheus integration to the open source community under an Apache 2.0 license. This integration supports Prometheus protocol version 2. The integration was tested using Docker 1.9, 1.11, and 1.13 on kops, GKE, and minikube. Limits apply to the metrics you send. For details, see the metrics API documentation. What's next Ready to get moving? Here are some suggested next steps: Read the how-to for completing the remote write integration. Read the how-to for completing the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration. Both integration options generate dimensional metrics that are subject to the same rate limits described in the Metric API.

      "body": "Problem You have installed the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration for Docker or Kubernetes, but you notice sparse data, missing metrics, and data gaps in New Relic's UI. Solution If some metrics are not being collected regularly, do the following: Check if the CPU is being throttled, and if the memory allocated to the container is enough. In case the container doesn't have enough resources available, it may send data with a longer interval between samples. Low memory limit may cause the integration to be killed and restarted. The correct limits and requests of resources can vary according to the number of targets monitored, and the number of metrics exposed by each target.For more information, see the guidelines in the large environment configuration documentation. Check for the following error message in the logs of the integration: {\"err\":\"unexpected post response code: 413: Request Entity Too Large\"} Copy This issue causes some payloads to be dropped, and it is currently fixed in new releases. If present, update the image to the most recent version. If some /metrics endpoints that are monitored by the integration time out or take several seconds to answer, they may slow down the scraping of data. The integration's performance can degrade if multiple endpoints take a huge amount of time to answer. This leads to intermittent and missing data. To detect those endpoints, run: SELECT average(nr_stats_integration_fetch_target_duration_seconds) FROM Metric where clusterName=’clustername' SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO FACET target LIMIT 30 Copy This query retrieves the data exposed by the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration, and it shows the time required to fetch each endpoint. Fix the endpoints with a latency above 1s, or exclude them from the monitoring removing the Prometheus scraping label. If it's not feasible to remove these endpoints, and the latency in the answer can't be avoided, configure the integration to run more workers in parallel. This allows the integration to fetch more endpoints at the same time. To do so, update the integration to the most recent version, and apply the new configuration option worker_threads. We advise to do it gradually, from 4, 6, 8 and up to 16. This workaround only minimizes the issue, and if multiple endpoints are misbehaving, performances will still be degraded. Moreover, memory and CPU consumption will increase with the number of workers, so memory and CPU must be increased accordingly. In case all the endpoints monitored have a low latency, and the container is not being throttled, run the following query. This helps you verify how much time the integration is taking to scrape all the targets, and to send the data if it's exceeding the configured scrape_duration. SELECT latest(nr_stats_integration_process_duration_seconds) FROM Metric where clusterName=’clustername' SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy First, update the integration to the latest image published. Then, to reduce the time needed to scrape all the targets, increase the number of workers with the configuration option worker_threads. We advise is to do it gradually, from 4 to 6, 8, and up to 16 until r_stats_integration_process_duration_seconds approaches the defined scrape_duration. Note that memory consumption and CPU usage will increase.",

Out-of-the-box integrations for open-source tools like Prometheus make it easy to get started, and eliminate the cost and complexity of hosting, operating, and managing additional monitoring systems. Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations gather all your data in one place, and New Relic stores the metrics from Prometheus. This integration helps remove the overhead of managing storage and availability of the Prometheus server. To learn more about how to scale your data without the hassles of managing Prometheus and a separate dashboard tool, see New Relic's Prometheus OpenMetrics integration blog post. Kubernetes In a Kubernetes environment, New Relic automatically discovers the endpoints in the same way that the Prometheus Kubernetes collector does it. The integration looks for the prometheus.io/scrape annotation or label. You can also identify additional static endpoints in the configuration. Docker The Prometheus OpenMetrics integration gathers all your data in one place, and New Relic stores the metrics from Prometheus. This integration helps remove the overhead of managing storage and availability of the Prometheus server. OpenMetrics integrations compatibility and requirements For Kubernetes and Docker OpenMetrics integrations, you should be aware of the following compatibility and requirements information. Kubernetes New Relic has contributed the Prometheus integration to the open source community under an Apache 2.0 license. This integration supports Prometheus protocol version 2 and Kubernetes versions 1.9 or higher. The integration was tested using Kubernetes 1.9, 1.11, and 1.13 on kops, GKE, and minikube. Limits apply to the metrics you send. For more details, see the metrics API documentation. Important Recommendation: Always run the scraper with one replica. Adding more replicas will result in duplicated data. Docker New Relic has contributed the Prometheus integration to the open source community under an Apache 2.0 license. This integration supports Prometheus protocol version 2. The integration was tested using Docker 1.9, 1.11, and 1.13 on kops, GKE, and minikube. Limits apply to the metrics you send.

      "body": "Problem You have installed the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration for Docker or Kubernetes, but you notice sparse data, missing metrics, and data gaps in New Relic's UI. Solution If some metrics are not being collected regularly, do the following: Check if the CPU is being throttled, and if the memory allocated to the container is enough. In case the container doesn't have enough resources available, it may send data with a longer interval between samples. Low memory limit may cause the integration to be killed and restarted. The correct limits and requests of resources can vary according to the number of targets monitored, and the number of metrics exposed by each target.For more information, see the guidelines in the large environment configuration documentation. Check for the following error message in the logs of the integration: {\"err\":\"unexpected post response code: 413: Request Entity Too Large\"} Copy This issue causes some payloads to be dropped, and it is currently fixed in new releases. If present, update the image to the most recent version. If some /metrics endpoints that are monitored by the integration time out or take several seconds to answer, they may slow down the scraping of data. The integration's performance can degrade if multiple endpoints take a huge amount of time to answer. This leads to intermittent and missing data. To detect those endpoints, run: SELECT average(nr_stats_integration_fetch_target_duration_seconds) FROM Metric where clusterName=’clustername' SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO FACET target LIMIT 30 Copy This query retrieves the data exposed by the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration, and it shows the time required to fetch each endpoint. Fix the endpoints with a latency above 1s, or exclude them from the monitoring removing the Prometheus scraping label. If it's not feasible to remove these endpoints, and the latency in the answer can't be avoided, configure the integration to run more workers in parallel. This allows the integration to fetch more endpoints at the same time. To do so, update the integration to the most recent version, and apply the new configuration option worker_threads. We advise to do it gradually, from 4, 6, 8 and up to 16. This workaround only minimizes the issue, and if multiple endpoints are misbehaving, performances will still be degraded. Moreover, memory and CPU consumption will increase with the number of workers, so memory and CPU must be increased accordingly. In case all the endpoints monitored have a low latency, and the container is not being throttled, run the following query. This helps you verify how much time the integration is taking to scrape all the targets, and to send the data if it's exceeding the configured scrape_duration. SELECT latest(nr_stats_integration_process_duration_seconds) FROM Metric where clusterName=’clustername' SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy First, update the integration to the latest image published. Then, to reduce the time needed to scrape all the targets, increase the number of workers with the configuration option worker_threads. We advise is to do it gradually, from 4 to 6, 8, and up to 16 until r_stats_integration_process_duration_seconds approaches the defined scrape_duration. Note that memory consumption and CPU usage will increase.",

      "body": "This page provides an overview of New Relic's Prometheus integration options and how they work. The information here will help you choose from among our options based on which one best fits your unique business needs. Prometheus OpenMetrics or remote write integration? We currently offer two integration options: Prometheus remote write integration and Prometheus OpenMetrics integration for Kubernetes or Docker. We recommend getting started with the remote write integration if you already have a Prometheus server install base. If you find it hard to manage your Prometheus cluster, or if you are getting started with integrating Prometheus Metrics, you should use OpenMetrics. Examine the benefits, reminders, and recommendations for each option below. Prometheus remote write integration Benefits: Easy access to your combined metrics in New Relic if you already have Prometheus servers. Access only takes one line of yaml in your Prometheus configuration. Access your metrics through both New Relic and Prometheus without making additional adjustments in Prometheus. Federation: Allows you to combine data from multiple servers into a single source. Prometheus High Availability support: We de-duplicate data from HA-pairs on ingest. Reminders: You will need to manage your Prometheus servers. You can reduce your storage retention. Fewer query loads to the server. Recommendations: Evaluate your observability needs to manage your data volumes better: The scrape interval is the biggest factor influencing data volumes: select it based on your observability needs. For example, changing from 15s (default value) to 30s can reduce data volumes by 50%. Set your filters and configure data to target (see metrics or targets). Balance remote write(s) between one or more New Relic accounts or sub-accounts to manage rate limits. Prometheus OpenMetrics integration for Kubernetes or Docker Benefits: Best for an alternative to Prometheus servers Store all your metrics directly in New Relic No need to manage any Prometheus servers yourself. No need for local storage. Reminders: Slightly more complex setup. No support for High Availability replicas. The Kubernetes operator is not available for enhanced operations automation. Regardless of the option you chose, with our Prometheus integrations: You can use Grafana or other query tools via New Relic's Prometheus' API. You benefit from more nuanced security and user management options as part of New Relic One. New Relic's database can be the centralized long-term data store for all your Prometheus metrics, allowing you to observe all your data in one place. You can execute queries to scale, supported by New Relic. Prometheus remote write integration The Prometheus remote write integration allows you to forward telemetry data from your existing Prometheus servers to New Relic. Once integrated, you can leverage the full range of options for setup and management, from raw data to queries, dashboards, and more. Scale your data and get moving quickly With the Prometheus remote write integration, you can: Store and visualize crucial metrics on a single platform Combine and group data across your entire software stack Get a fully connected view of the relationship between data about your software stack and the behaviors and outcomes you’re monitoring Connect your Grafana dashboards (optional). Prometheus remote write dashboard How it works Signup for New Relic is fast and free — we won't even ask for a credit card number. Once logged in, you can get data flowing with a few simple steps: Generate your remote_write URL. Add the new remote_write URL to the configuration file for your Prometheus server. Restart your Prometheus server. Check for your data. Query and explore! Read the setup docs Add Prometheus data Remote write compatibility and requirements New Relic supports the Prometheus remote write integration for Prometheus versions 2.15.0 or newer. Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations New Relic’s Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations for Docker and Kubernetes allow you to scrape Prometheus endpoints and send the data to New Relic, so you can store and visualize crucial metrics on one platform. With these integrations, you can: Automatically identify a static list of endpoints. Collect metrics that are important to your business. Query and visualize this data in the New Relic UI. Connect your Grafana dashboards (optional). Kubernetes OpenMetrics dashboard Reduce overhead and scale your data Collect, analyze, and visualize your metrics data from any source, alongside your telemetry data, so you can correlate issues all in one place.

Get proactive notifications from alerts to ensure your app is up and running smoothly. Use the query builder to query your data and create custom dashboards with that data. Install infrastructure monitoring to view the performance of your app's host environment. Support for both .NET Framework and .NET Core New Relic's .NET agent supports both .NET Framework and .NET Core, and it works with all .NET compatible languages, such as VB.NET, C#, and CLI. The agent's support for .NET Core takes advantage of the compatibility, speed, expanded API features, and cross-platform capabilities of Microsoft's .NET Core. The agent does not support Microsoft .NET Core versions earlier than 2.0. With New Relic's support for .NET, you can monitor your apps in dynamic or distributed environments, such as: Cloud-managed server VM images On-host VM servers Microsoft Azure App Services Self-hosted Windows and Linux systems Amazon AWS EC2 VMs Install the agent on Windows with our guided install Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the .NET agent for Windows IIS applications. Ready to get started? Click the Guided install button. If your account reports data through our EU datacenter, click EU Guided install. Guided install EU Guided install In addition to the .NET agent, you can use this to install our infrastructure agent to discover other applications, infrastructure, and log sources running in your environment and recommend which ones should be instrumented. The install automates the configuration and deployment of each system you choose to instrument. Install the agent Before you install the .NET agent, create your New Relic account. Then, review the requirements for .NET Framework or the requirements for .NET Core. When you are ready to install, use our launcher, or see the install instructions appropriate for your operating system: Windows or Linux. Add .NET data Tip To stay up-to-date with new features and bug fixes, see the .NET agent release notes. After you install the agent and wait a few minutes for your app to generate traffic, data will appear in the APM Summary page. If no data appears, or if you encounter other problems, see New Relic's .NET agent troubleshooting procedures. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Summary: After installing the .NET agent, you will see a summary of your app's performance on the Summary page. Configure the agent The most important part of agent configuration is to give your app a descriptive name. New Relic uses this app name to aggregate metrics when you have multiple apps or hosts. The agent also includes a variety of configuration options to further customize your installation. Extend your instrumentation After installing the .NET agent, extend the agent's instrumentation with one or more of these methods: Instrumentation options Details Browser instrumentation Integrate the .NET agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user activity. ASP.NET apps (.NET Framework only): Use any of the available options to install the browser agent. ASP.NET Core apps (targeting .NET Core or .NET Framework): Use either the API method or the copy/paste method to inject the browser agent into your webpages. Custom instrumentation Instrument transactions not captured as part of New Relic's automatic framework instrumentation. Agent API See the .NET agent API guide to learn how to customize the agent's behavior. For example, you can collect custom metrics, flag an error, or ignore a particular transaction entirely. Custom attributes Customize the attributes attached to transactions. Customizing attributes allows you to avoid sending sensitive attributes, or to collect additional attributes for deeper visibility into your transactions. Distributed tracing Enable distributed tracing to understand activity across a complex, distributed system that uses many services and microservices. Open source telemetry Explore these tools: OpenTelemetry exporter and .NET Telemetry SDK. Check the source code The .NET agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "Problem When using service maps, you can't view the full set of entities or the relationships between entities that you expect to see. Solution Make sure that the entities are being monitored with an agent. If you have a mix of agents with some having distributed tracing turned on and some having it turned off, you will not see the relations between those agents. The solution for this scenario is to run all agents either with distributed tracing turned on (preferred) or turn it off for all agents. If this does not remedy the issue, the service you're trying to view may require manual instrumentation. When you view applications and services that we automatically instrument in service maps, you'll usually see complete and detailed data for those nodes in the distributed tracing UI. However, you may notice that some of these services or applications are missing from service maps. Tip Some browser apps are exceptions to this, and may be missing because: Relationships for copy and paste browser agents are not detected. Only the relationships for injected browser agents is shown (the app the agent is injected into). Call relationships (for example, AJAX calling to other apps) are not displayed. If services or apps are missing, you may want to implement custom instrumentation of applications or specific transactions to see more detail in traces. Some examples of when you may need to do this: Transactions not automatically instrumented. To ensure your application is automatically instrumented, read the compatibility and requirements documentation for the agent you're using. If an application isn't automatically instrumented, or if you'd like to add instrumentation of specific activity, see Custom instrumentation. All Go applications. The Go agent, unlike other agents, requires manual instrumentation of your code. For instructions, see Instrument a Go application. A service doesn't use HTTP. If a service doesn't communicate via HTTP, the agent won't send distributed tracing headers. This may be the case for some non-web applications or message queues. To remedy this, use the distributed tracing APIs to instrument either the calling or called application.",

      "body": "When we say auto-telemetry, we’re not talking about cars — we're talking about instant baseline visibility into your Kubernetes clusters. With the New Relic One integration with Pixie, you get similar data to traditional language agents, but without manually instrumenting your code or redeploying your application. Pixie auto-telemetry is powered by eBPF, a virtual machine-like construct that enables Pixie to seamlessly collect fine-grained telemetry data — service-level metrics, unsampled requests, and more. With one install command, you get deeper insight into your Kubernetes clusters and workloads. No language agents required. Live debugging with Pixie shows a service graph listing the namespaces and the node that are available on the current cluster. Simply put, Auto-telemetry with Pixie offers the quickest option for getting observability into your Kubernetes services. Quickly start observing and debugging Kubernetes clusters Our Pixie integration gives you the best of both worlds: Pixie’s fast and simple Kubernetes observability coupled with New Relic One’s incident correlation, intelligent alerting, and long-term retention. You’ll get visibility into HTTP services using golden signals, HTTP transactions, database transactions, distributed tracing, and JVM metrics. You can operate, debug, and scale your Kubernetes clusters based on the information you learn about how your clusters and services are running. Using the New Relic Explorer, you can see key metrics and events at every level, starting with the cluster, and diving down into namespaces, deployments, and pods. You can quickly spot anomalous behavior, and where it’s happening. And then dive deeper using embedded visualizations of your Pixie data. Quickly identify hot spots with Flamegraph. On the Live debugging with Pixie tab, answer questions like what SQL requests your app is making or which services are talking to each other. Important Auto-Telemetry with Pixie leverages Community Cloud with Pixie, a separate platform from New Relic One. Use of Community Cloud with Pixie is subject to separate terms of service. Explore your cluster Access the Pixie UI via New Relic's Live debugging with Pixie area of your Kubernetes clusters. The cluster explorer provides a quick overview of the nodes in your cluster, including CPU, memory, and storage, as well as the status of each pod (healthy, warning, or critical). You can also find out what services are running in each container, their latency, throughput, and error rate. For more information about using the cluster explorer, see Navigate the Kubernetes cluster explorer. Note that you cannot log directly into the Pixie UI unless you have created a separate Pixie login. Tip Containers might be listed for up to four hours after they get decommissioned. You can query the Pixie data in New Relic One and create dashboards for at-a-glance monitoring. Find the data model and sample queries here. Investigate usage spikes with Flamegraph Debugging is orders of magnitude easier when you can quickly see what your application is doing. Flamegraph, a Pixie always-on visualization, requires no instrumentation, redeploying, or recompiling. It works for compiled languages like Go, C+, Rust, to name a few. And at a glance, Flamegraph tells you what functions your application is spending time on and where you have hot spots. Flamegraph is especially useful for hierarchical resource use, like disk usage and CPU utilization. For more information on how to read Flamegraph, see the Pixie documentation. Debug live On the Live debugging with Pixie tab, run PxL scripts — scripts written in Pixie's PxL language — to view live data captured through eBPF. Select the script drop-down and then select a script to run in the tab. (For best results, select a time range that is recent in the time picker.) Scripts enable you to debug: Traffic in multiple formats: HTTP and HTTPs (including encrypted), DNS, Postgres, MySQL, Cassandra, Redis (currently supporting SQL and HTTP in beta).

      "body": "To get up and running with Auto-telemetry with Pixie, you start with our guided installation. The guided installation deploys Pixie with New Relic's Kubernetes integration on your cluster. You don't need to do any further configuration or installation to start using Pixie. If you want to install Auto-telemetry with Pixie on multiple clusters, re-run the guided install for each additional cluster. General prerequisites for using Pixie You must be a New Relic full platform user. Other user-related requirements: Users on our New Relic One user model must be assigned to a group that has a role with Pixie-related capabilities. Users on our original user model cannot be Restricted. Review this Pixie data security overview for actions to take to secure your data. Make sure you have sufficient memory: Pixie requires 2Gb of memory per node in your cluster. Review the other Pixie technical requirements. Setup steps depend on your account status Use the following table to find out where to start installing Auto-telemetry with Pixie. Where you start the installation depends on whether you already have a New Relic or Pixie account, or both. New Relic Pixie Next steps Start the guided install at the beginning of the process. If you already have both types of accounts, and used the same email address for each of them, click the New Relic icon in the Pixie UI. This brings you to the Configure the HELM command/manifest (yaml) file section of the guided installation. Then, follow the steps. If you're using different email addresses in Pixie and New Relic, create a new account for either Pixie or New Relic to match email addresses across both products. You can also contact New Relic support to manually link your existing New Relic account with your Pixie account. If you follow a link to New Relic from the Pixie UI and do not have a New Relic account, you must first create one. Click the New Relic icon in the Pixie UI, and follow the steps to create a New Relic account. When you do so, your Pixie account is linked to it. Then, continue the guided install process with these steps. Sign up for a free New Relic account. Then, start the guided install at the beginning of the process. Install from the beginning of the guided install process Open our New Relic One guided install. Select the account you want to use for the guided install, and click Continue. Note: if you have a single account, you won't see this option. Select Kubernetes and then continue with step one in the next section. Install from the Configure the HELM command/manifest (yaml) file If you arrived in the guided installation process by following a link from Pixie or from within New Relic, your steps begin here. Select the account and cluster for the install. If needed, select a namespace. Important Currently, Pixie performs best on clusters with up to 100 nodes (exceeding 100 nodes can lead to excessive memory usage and scripts failing to run). Friendly reminder: autoscaling can quickly drive up your node numbers. Click Continue. Select the data you want to gather, observe, and debug, and click Continue. On the Choose install method page, select either Helm or manifest. Helm method Run the provided Helm command on your command line. If you're concerned about the amount of Pixie data you'll ingest, check out strategies for reducing ingest. Helm installs a bundle containing the New Relic infrastructure agent, an integration to gather Prometheus metrics and Kubernetes events, and the Pixie integration. The deployment takes a few minutes to complete. To see the status of the install to the cluster, run kubectl get pods -n newrelic. For general information about installing a Kubernetes integration, see this Helm install info. manifest method Run the provided command in your console, and insert the path to your downloaded manifest. If you're running your Kubernetes cluster in the cloud, see the additional steps in the Kubernetes docs. Click Continue to open the Listening for data page. When you get the message, See your data, click Kubernetes Cluster Explorer to see your cluster. Auto-telemetry with Pixie might restart after installation. This is caused by the auto update feature.

Auto-telemetry with Pixie therefore benefits from Pixie's approach to keeping data secure. The data that Pixie collects is stored entirely within your Kubernetes cluster. This data does not persist outside of your environment, and will never be stored by Community Cloud for Pixie. This means that your sensitive data remains within your environment and control. Community Cloud for Pixie makes queries directly to your Kubernetes cluster to access the data. In order for the query results to be shown in the Community Cloud for Pixie UI, CLI, and API, the data is sent to the client from your cluster using a reverse proxy. Community Cloud for Pixie’s reverse proxy is designed to ensure: Data is ephemeral. It only passes through the Community Cloud for Pixie's cloud proxy in transit. This ensures data locality. Data is encrypted while in transit. Only you are able to read your data. New Relic One fetches and stores data that related to an application's performance. With Auto-telemetry with Pixie, a predefined subset of data persists outside of your cluster. This data is stored in our database, in your selected region.

The persisted performance metrics include, but are not limited to: Golden metrics (throughput, latency, error rate) for HTTP-based services HTTP transaction data Database transaction data (for MySQL & PostgreSQL) Distributed tracing JVM metrics The data you view on the Live debugging tab comes through Community Cloud for Pixie, and is therefore potentially sensitive. It is not stored by New Relic and is ephemeral and queryable for less than 24 hours. Control who has access to Pixie data If you want to manage which members of your organization can view Pixie data in New Relic One, as well as install and delete Pixie links, you can create a custom role. Note that this option is available only to Enterprise and Pro level customers. For more information, see New Relic's user model. Manage auto-update and two-way communication Pixie maintains an active two-way communication channel from your host system to Community Cloud with Pixie at withpixie.ai.

The guided installation deploys Pixie with New Relic's Kubernetes integration on your cluster. You don't need to do any further configuration or installation to start using Pixie. If you want to install Auto-telemetry with Pixie on multiple clusters, re-run the guided install for each additional cluster. General prerequisites for using Pixie You must be a New Relic full platform user. Other user-related requirements: Users on our New Relic One user model must be assigned to a group that has a role with Pixie-related capabilities. Users on our original user model cannot be Restricted. Review this Pixie data security overview for actions to take to secure your data. Make sure you have sufficient memory: Pixie requires 2Gb of memory per node in your cluster. Review the other Pixie technical requirements. Setup steps depend on your account status Use the following table to find out where to start installing Auto-telemetry with Pixie. Where you start the installation depends on whether you already have a New Relic or Pixie account, or both. New Relic Pixie Next steps Start the guided install at the beginning of the process. If you already have both types of accounts, and used the same email address for each of them, click the New Relic icon in the Pixie UI. This brings you to the Configure the HELM command/manifest (yaml) file section of the guided installation. Then, follow the steps. If you're using different email addresses in Pixie and New Relic, create a new account for either Pixie or New Relic to match email addresses across both products. You can also contact New Relic support to manually link your existing New Relic account with your Pixie account. If you follow a link to New Relic from the Pixie UI and do not have a New Relic account, you must first create one. Click the New Relic icon in the Pixie UI, and follow the steps to create a New Relic account. When you do so, your Pixie account is linked to it. Then, continue the guided install process with these steps. Sign up for a free New Relic account. Then, start the guided install at the beginning of the process. Install from the beginning of the guided install process Open our New Relic One guided install. Select the account you want to use for the guided install, and click Continue. Note: if you have a single account, you won't see this option. Select Kubernetes and then continue with step one in the next section. Install from the Configure the HELM command/manifest (yaml) file If you arrived in the guided installation process by following a link from Pixie or from within New Relic, your steps begin here. Select the account and cluster for the install. If needed, select a namespace. Important Currently, Pixie performs best on clusters with up to 100 nodes (exceeding 100 nodes can lead to excessive memory usage and scripts failing to run). Friendly reminder: autoscaling can quickly drive up your node numbers. Click Continue. Select the data you want to gather, observe, and debug, and click Continue. On the Choose install method page, select either Helm or manifest. Helm method Run the provided Helm command on your command line. If you're concerned about the amount of Pixie data you'll ingest, check out strategies for reducing ingest. Helm installs a bundle containing the New Relic infrastructure agent, an integration to gather Prometheus metrics and Kubernetes events, and the Pixie integration. The deployment takes a few minutes to complete. To see the status of the install to the cluster, run kubectl get pods -n newrelic. For general information about installing a Kubernetes integration, see this Helm install info. manifest method Run the provided command in your console, and insert the path to your downloaded manifest. If you're running your Kubernetes cluster in the cloud, see the additional steps in the Kubernetes docs. Click Continue to open the Listening for data page. When you get the message, See your data, click Kubernetes Cluster Explorer to see your cluster. Auto-telemetry with Pixie might restart after installation. This is caused by the auto update feature. If you link the wrong Pixie and New Relic account Contact support to unlink a Pixie account from your New Relic account.

      "body": "You have options for the type and the amount of data you ingest when you install Auto-telemetry with Pixie. During install, use Helm to reduce or exclude data, either by excluding specific namespaces or pods, or by collecting data for only the nodes you want. Exclude namespaces and pods If you want to reduce the amount of Pixie data that New Relic ingests, you can exclude namespaces or pods by adding the following parameters to your Helm chart during installation. Note that the data still exists in Pixie: excludeNamespacesRegex - use to identify the namespaces that you want to exclude from sending observability data to New Relic. If empty, data for all namespaces is sent to New Relic. For example: --set newrelic-pixie.excludeNamespacesRegex=\"examplenamespace-1|examplenamespace-2\" Copy excludePodsRegex - use to identify pods across all namespaces that you want to exclude from sending observability data to New Relic. If empty, data for all pods (except those in excluded namespaces) is sent to New Relic. For example: --set newrelic-pixie.excludePodsRegex=\"examplepod-1|examplepod-2\" Copy These two configuration options provide additional control over the Metric and Span data sent to New Relic from Pixie. For example, if you wanted to configure the newrelic-pixie integration to exclude all namespaces except for px-sock-shop and kafka-demo, append the following config parameter to your Helm install or Helm upgrade command. --set newrelic-pixie.excludeNamespacesRegex=\"default|kube-node-lease|kube-public|kube-system|newrelic|newrelic-custom-metrics|olm|px-operator\" Copy Or, if you wanted to exclude pods running in a non-excluded namespace, you could add another configuration parameter to your Helm install or Helm upgrade. Instead of matching exact names, you can use a simple regex to match pod names related to load testing, just as an example. --set newrelic-pixie.excludePodsRegex=\"load-test.*|loadgen.*\" Copy If you're performing a brand new install, you'll need to append excludeNamespacesRegex and excludePodsRegex to the helm upgrade --install command provided by New Relic's guided install: kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pixie-labs/pixie/main/k8s/operator/crd/base/px.dev_viziers.yaml && \\ kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pixie-labs/pixie/main/k8s/operator/helm/crds/olm_crd.yaml && \\ helm repo add newrelic https://helm-charts.newrelic.com && helm repo update && \\ kubectl create namespace newrelic ; helm upgrade --install newrelic-bundle newrelic/nri-bundle \\ --set global.licenseKey=<NR LICENSE KEY> \\ --set global.cluster=pixie-auto-telemetry \\ --namespace=newrelic \\ --set newrelic-infrastructure.privileged=true \\ --set ksm.enabled=true \\ --set prometheus.enabled=true \\ --set kubeEvents.enabled=true \\ --set logging.enabled=true \\ --set newrelic-pixie.enabled=true \\ --set newrelic-pixie.apiKey=<PIXIE API KEY> \\ --set pixie-chart.enabled=true \\ --set pixie-chart.deployKey=<PIXIE DEPLOY KEY> \\ --set pixie-chart.clusterName=pixie-auto-telemetry \\ --set newrelic-pixie.excludeNamespacesRegex=\"default|kube-node-lease|kube-public|kube-system|newrelic|newrelic-custom-metrics|olm|px-operator\" \\ --set newrelic-pixie.excludePodsRegex=\"load-test.*|loadgen.*\" Copy If you're just upgrading an existing install, then this is a much simpler approach: helm upgrade newrelic-bundle newrelic/nri-bundle --reuse-values -n newrelic --set newrelic-pixie.excludeNamespacesRegex=\"default|kube-node-lease|kube-public|kube-system|newrelic|newrelic-custom-metrics|olm|px-operator Copy Learn more about the available parameters for the newrelic-pixie Helm chart here. Use Kubernetes features to collect selected data When you deploy Auto-telemetry with Pixie, you're actually enabling the Auto-telemetry with Pixie Helm chart, as well as other New Relic components included in the New Relic infrastructure bundle. The Pixie Edge Module (PEM) pods are deployed to the cluster as a Kubernetes DaemonSet. This means that by default, a pod is scheduled to every cluster node and is responsible for collecting all of the observability metrics for that node. In Kubernetes, you can assign pods to a specific subset of cluster nodes using nodeSelectors, taints/tolerations, and node affinity/anti-affinity. That way, you'll only collect metrics for the nodes you choose, instead of every node. This is helpful if you only want to deploy Auto-telemetry with Pixie to five of your ten cluster nodes, for example. Maybe the designated five nodes are responsible for high-priority workloads, or perhaps you're running both Linux and Windows nodes in your cluster and only want to deploy on the Linux nodes, since Windows nodes are not currently supported. You can now assign pods to a subset of nodes by providing an additional option to the guided installation command. This option passes an escaped JSON string to the Auto-telemetry with Pixie chart, which enables a nodeSelector that only schedules the PEM DaemonSet on nodes with the label pixie=allowed. --set pixie-chart.patches.vizier-pem='\\{\\\"spec\\\"\\: \\{\\\"template\\\"\\: \\{\\\"spec\\\"\\: \\{ \\\"nodeSelector\\\"\\: \\{\\\"pixie\\\"\\: \\\"allowed\\\" \\}\\}\\}\\}\\}' Copy If you're using a values file, common with Helm, then this is what that would look like in the nri-bundle values.yaml: pixie-chart: enabled: true patches: vizier-pem: '{\"spec\": {\"template\": {\"spec\": { \"nodeSelector\": {\"pixie\": \"allowed\" }}}}}' Copy This approach gives you a multitude of configuration options; you just need to stick with the standard Kubernetes spec.",

With the New Relic One integration with Pixie, you get similar data to traditional language agents, but without manually instrumenting your code or redeploying your application. Pixie auto-telemetry is powered by eBPF, a virtual machine-like construct that enables Pixie to seamlessly collect fine-grained telemetry data — service-level metrics, unsampled requests, and more. With one install command, you get deeper insight into your Kubernetes clusters and workloads. No language agents required. Live debugging with Pixie shows a service graph listing the namespaces and the node that are available on the current cluster. Simply put, Auto-telemetry with Pixie offers the quickest option for getting observability into your Kubernetes services. Quickly start observing and debugging Kubernetes clusters Our Pixie integration gives you the best of both worlds: Pixie’s fast and simple Kubernetes observability coupled with New Relic One’s incident correlation, intelligent alerting, and long-term retention. You’ll get visibility into HTTP services using golden signals, HTTP transactions, database transactions, distributed tracing, and JVM metrics. You can operate, debug, and scale your Kubernetes clusters based on the information you learn about how your clusters and services are running. Using the New Relic Explorer, you can see key metrics and events at every level, starting with the cluster, and diving down into namespaces, deployments, and pods. You can quickly spot anomalous behavior, and where it’s happening. And then dive deeper using embedded visualizations of your Pixie data. Quickly identify hot spots with Flamegraph. On the Live debugging with Pixie tab, answer questions like what SQL requests your app is making or which services are talking to each other. Important Auto-Telemetry with Pixie leverages Community Cloud with Pixie, a separate platform from New Relic One. Use of Community Cloud with Pixie is subject to separate terms of service. Explore your cluster Access the Pixie UI via New Relic's Live debugging with Pixie area of your Kubernetes clusters. The cluster explorer provides a quick overview of the nodes in your cluster, including CPU, memory, and storage, as well as the status of each pod (healthy, warning, or critical). You can also find out what services are running in each container, their latency, throughput, and error rate. For more information about using the cluster explorer, see Navigate the Kubernetes cluster explorer. Note that you cannot log directly into the Pixie UI unless you have created a separate Pixie login. Tip Containers might be listed for up to four hours after they get decommissioned. You can query the Pixie data in New Relic One and create dashboards for at-a-glance monitoring. Find the data model and sample queries here. Investigate usage spikes with Flamegraph Debugging is orders of magnitude easier when you can quickly see what your application is doing. Flamegraph, a Pixie always-on visualization, requires no instrumentation, redeploying, or recompiling. It works for compiled languages like Go, C+, Rust, to name a few. And at a glance, Flamegraph tells you what functions your application is spending time on and where you have hot spots. Flamegraph is especially useful for hierarchical resource use, like disk usage and CPU utilization. For more information on how to read Flamegraph, see the Pixie documentation. Debug live On the Live debugging with Pixie tab, run PxL scripts — scripts written in Pixie's PxL language — to view live data captured through eBPF. Select the script drop-down and then select a script to run in the tab. (For best results, select a time range that is recent in the time picker.) Scripts enable you to debug: Traffic in multiple formats: HTTP and HTTPs (including encrypted), DNS, Postgres, MySQL, Cassandra, Redis (currently supporting SQL and HTTP in beta).

      "body": "Auto-telemetry with Pixie is New Relic One's integration of Community Cloud for Pixie, a managed version of Pixie open source software. Auto-telemetry with Pixie therefore benefits from Pixie's approach to keeping data secure. The data that Pixie collects is stored entirely within your Kubernetes cluster. This data does not persist outside of your environment, and will never be stored by Community Cloud for Pixie. This means that your sensitive data remains within your environment and control. Community Cloud for Pixie makes queries directly to your Kubernetes cluster to access the data. In order for the query results to be shown in the Community Cloud for Pixie UI, CLI, and API, the data is sent to the client from your cluster using a reverse proxy. Community Cloud for Pixie’s reverse proxy is designed to ensure: Data is ephemeral. It only passes through the Community Cloud for Pixie's cloud proxy in transit. This ensures data locality. Data is encrypted while in transit. Only you are able to read your data. New Relic One fetches and stores data that related to an application's performance. With Auto-telemetry with Pixie, a predefined subset of data persists outside of your cluster. This data is stored in our database, in your selected region. This data persists in order to give you long-term storage, alerting, correlation with additional data, and the ability to use advanced New Relic platform capabilities, such as anomaly detection. The persisted performance metrics include, but are not limited to: Golden metrics (throughput, latency, error rate) for HTTP-based services HTTP transaction data Database transaction data (for MySQL & PostgreSQL) Distributed tracing JVM metrics The data you view on the Live debugging tab comes through Community Cloud for Pixie, and is therefore potentially sensitive. It is not stored by New Relic and is ephemeral and queryable for less than 24 hours. Control who has access to Pixie data If you want to manage which members of your organization can view Pixie data in New Relic One, as well as install and delete Pixie links, you can create a custom role. Note that this option is available only to Enterprise and Pro level customers. For more information, see New Relic's user model. Manage auto-update and two-way communication Pixie maintains an active two-way communication channel from your host system to Community Cloud with Pixie at withpixie.ai. Pixie uses this communication channel to query data, push updates, and retrieve metadata and health checks about Pixie and your Kubernetes cluster. By default, Pixie queries withpixie.ai to check if new updates have been pushed and then automatically installs them if they’re present. To disable auto updates, you must set a flag prior to the install process using either Helm or in the newrelic-manifest.yaml file. To disable automatic updates, choose one: Helm option Add --set pixie-chart.disableAutoUpdate=true to your Helm command. newrelic-manifest.yaml option in your newrelic-manifest.yaml file under the pl-cluster-config section, add PL_DISABLE_AUTO_UPDATE: \"true\" to the data directive. Example: --- apiVersion: v1 data: PL_CUSTOM_ANNOTATIONS: \"\" PL_CUSTOM_LABELS: \"\" PL_DISABLE_AUTO_UPDATE: \"true\" PL_ETCD_OPERATOR_ENABLED: \"false\" PL_MD_ETCD_SERVER: \"https://etcd.newrelic.svc:2379\" PX_MEMORY_LIMIT: \"\" kind: ConfigMap metadata: annotations: creationTimestamp: null labels: name: pl-cluster-config namespace: newrelic --- Copy",

      "body": "You have options for the type and the amount of data you ingest when you install Auto-telemetry with Pixie. During install, use Helm to reduce or exclude data, either by excluding specific namespaces or pods, or by collecting data for only the nodes you want. Exclude namespaces and pods If you want to reduce the amount of Pixie data that New Relic ingests, you can exclude namespaces or pods by adding the following parameters to your Helm chart during installation. Note that the data still exists in Pixie: excludeNamespacesRegex - use to identify the namespaces that you want to exclude from sending observability data to New Relic. If empty, data for all namespaces is sent to New Relic. For example: --set newrelic-pixie.excludeNamespacesRegex=\"examplenamespace-1|examplenamespace-2\" Copy excludePodsRegex - use to identify pods across all namespaces that you want to exclude from sending observability data to New Relic. If empty, data for all pods (except those in excluded namespaces) is sent to New Relic. For example: --set newrelic-pixie.excludePodsRegex=\"examplepod-1|examplepod-2\" Copy These two configuration options provide additional control over the Metric and Span data sent to New Relic from Pixie. For example, if you wanted to configure the newrelic-pixie integration to exclude all namespaces except for px-sock-shop and kafka-demo, append the following config parameter to your Helm install or Helm upgrade command. --set newrelic-pixie.excludeNamespacesRegex=\"default|kube-node-lease|kube-public|kube-system|newrelic|newrelic-custom-metrics|olm|px-operator\" Copy Or, if you wanted to exclude pods running in a non-excluded namespace, you could add another configuration parameter to your Helm install or Helm upgrade. Instead of matching exact names, you can use a simple regex to match pod names related to load testing, just as an example. --set newrelic-pixie.excludePodsRegex=\"load-test.*|loadgen.*\" Copy If you're performing a brand new install, you'll need to append excludeNamespacesRegex and excludePodsRegex to the helm upgrade --install command provided by New Relic's guided install: kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pixie-labs/pixie/main/k8s/operator/crd/base/px.dev_viziers.yaml && \\ kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pixie-labs/pixie/main/k8s/operator/helm/crds/olm_crd.yaml && \\ helm repo add newrelic https://helm-charts.newrelic.com && helm repo update && \\ kubectl create namespace newrelic ; helm upgrade --install newrelic-bundle newrelic/nri-bundle \\ --set global.licenseKey=<NR LICENSE KEY> \\ --set global.cluster=pixie-auto-telemetry \\ --namespace=newrelic \\ --set newrelic-infrastructure.privileged=true \\ --set ksm.enabled=true \\ --set prometheus.enabled=true \\ --set kubeEvents.enabled=true \\ --set logging.enabled=true \\ --set newrelic-pixie.enabled=true \\ --set newrelic-pixie.apiKey=<PIXIE API KEY> \\ --set pixie-chart.enabled=true \\ --set pixie-chart.deployKey=<PIXIE DEPLOY KEY> \\ --set pixie-chart.clusterName=pixie-auto-telemetry \\ --set newrelic-pixie.excludeNamespacesRegex=\"default|kube-node-lease|kube-public|kube-system|newrelic|newrelic-custom-metrics|olm|px-operator\" \\ --set newrelic-pixie.excludePodsRegex=\"load-test.*|loadgen.*\" Copy If you're just upgrading an existing install, then this is a much simpler approach: helm upgrade newrelic-bundle newrelic/nri-bundle --reuse-values -n newrelic --set newrelic-pixie.excludeNamespacesRegex=\"default|kube-node-lease|kube-public|kube-system|newrelic|newrelic-custom-metrics|olm|px-operator Copy Learn more about the available parameters for the newrelic-pixie Helm chart here. Use Kubernetes features to collect selected data When you deploy Auto-telemetry with Pixie, you're actually enabling the Auto-telemetry with Pixie Helm chart, as well as other New Relic components included in the New Relic infrastructure bundle. The Pixie Edge Module (PEM) pods are deployed to the cluster as a Kubernetes DaemonSet. This means that by default, a pod is scheduled to every cluster node and is responsible for collecting all of the observability metrics for that node. In Kubernetes, you can assign pods to a specific subset of cluster nodes using nodeSelectors, taints/tolerations, and node affinity/anti-affinity. That way, you'll only collect metrics for the nodes you choose, instead of every node. This is helpful if you only want to deploy Auto-telemetry with Pixie to five of your ten cluster nodes, for example. Maybe the designated five nodes are responsible for high-priority workloads, or perhaps you're running both Linux and Windows nodes in your cluster and only want to deploy on the Linux nodes, since Windows nodes are not currently supported. You can now assign pods to a subset of nodes by providing an additional option to the guided installation command. This option passes an escaped JSON string to the Auto-telemetry with Pixie chart, which enables a nodeSelector that only schedules the PEM DaemonSet on nodes with the label pixie=allowed. --set pixie-chart.patches.vizier-pem='\\{\\\"spec\\\"\\: \\{\\\"template\\\"\\: \\{\\\"spec\\\"\\: \\{ \\\"nodeSelector\\\"\\: \\{\\\"pixie\\\"\\: \\\"allowed\\\" \\}\\}\\}\\}\\}' Copy If you're using a values file, common with Helm, then this is what that would look like in the nri-bundle values.yaml: pixie-chart: enabled: true patches: vizier-pem: '{\"spec\": {\"template\": {\"spec\": { \"nodeSelector\": {\"pixie\": \"allowed\" }}}}}' Copy This approach gives you a multitude of configuration options; you just need to stick with the standard Kubernetes spec.",

      "body": "To get up and running with Auto-telemetry with Pixie, you start with our guided installation. The guided installation deploys Pixie with New Relic's Kubernetes integration on your cluster. You don't need to do any further configuration or installation to start using Pixie. If you want to install Auto-telemetry with Pixie on multiple clusters, re-run the guided install for each additional cluster. General prerequisites for using Pixie You must be a New Relic full platform user. Other user-related requirements: Users on our New Relic One user model must be assigned to a group that has a role with Pixie-related capabilities. Users on our original user model cannot be Restricted. Review this Pixie data security overview for actions to take to secure your data. Make sure you have sufficient memory: Pixie requires 2Gb of memory per node in your cluster. Review the other Pixie technical requirements. Setup steps depend on your account status Use the following table to find out where to start installing Auto-telemetry with Pixie. Where you start the installation depends on whether you already have a New Relic or Pixie account, or both. New Relic Pixie Next steps Start the guided install at the beginning of the process. If you already have both types of accounts, and used the same email address for each of them, click the New Relic icon in the Pixie UI. This brings you to the Configure the HELM command/manifest (yaml) file section of the guided installation. Then, follow the steps. If you're using different email addresses in Pixie and New Relic, create a new account for either Pixie or New Relic to match email addresses across both products. You can also contact New Relic support to manually link your existing New Relic account with your Pixie account. If you follow a link to New Relic from the Pixie UI and do not have a New Relic account, you must first create one. Click the New Relic icon in the Pixie UI, and follow the steps to create a New Relic account. When you do so, your Pixie account is linked to it. Then, continue the guided install process with these steps. Sign up for a free New Relic account. Then, start the guided install at the beginning of the process. Install from the beginning of the guided install process Open our New Relic One guided install. Select the account you want to use for the guided install, and click Continue. Note: if you have a single account, you won't see this option. Select Kubernetes and then continue with step one in the next section. Install from the Configure the HELM command/manifest (yaml) file If you arrived in the guided installation process by following a link from Pixie or from within New Relic, your steps begin here. Select the account and cluster for the install. If needed, select a namespace. Important Currently, Pixie performs best on clusters with up to 100 nodes (exceeding 100 nodes can lead to excessive memory usage and scripts failing to run). Friendly reminder: autoscaling can quickly drive up your node numbers. Click Continue. Select the data you want to gather, observe, and debug, and click Continue. On the Choose install method page, select either Helm or manifest. Helm method Run the provided Helm command on your command line. If you're concerned about the amount of Pixie data you'll ingest, check out strategies for reducing ingest. Helm installs a bundle containing the New Relic infrastructure agent, an integration to gather Prometheus metrics and Kubernetes events, and the Pixie integration.

      "body": "Auto-telemetry with Pixie is New Relic One's integration of Community Cloud for Pixie, a managed version of Pixie open source software. Auto-telemetry with Pixie therefore benefits from Pixie's approach to keeping data secure. The data that Pixie collects is stored entirely within your Kubernetes cluster. This data does not persist outside of your environment, and will never be stored by Community Cloud for Pixie. This means that your sensitive data remains within your environment and control. Community Cloud for Pixie makes queries directly to your Kubernetes cluster to access the data. In order for the query results to be shown in the Community Cloud for Pixie UI, CLI, and API, the data is sent to the client from your cluster using a reverse proxy. Community Cloud for Pixie’s reverse proxy is designed to ensure: Data is ephemeral. It only passes through the Community Cloud for Pixie's cloud proxy in transit. This ensures data locality. Data is encrypted while in transit. Only you are able to read your data. New Relic One fetches and stores data that related to an application's performance. With Auto-telemetry with Pixie, a predefined subset of data persists outside of your cluster. This data is stored in our database, in your selected region. This data persists in order to give you long-term storage, alerting, correlation with additional data, and the ability to use advanced New Relic platform capabilities, such as anomaly detection. The persisted performance metrics include, but are not limited to: Golden metrics (throughput, latency, error rate) for HTTP-based services HTTP transaction data Database transaction data (for MySQL & PostgreSQL) Distributed tracing JVM metrics The data you view on the Live debugging tab comes through Community Cloud for Pixie, and is therefore potentially sensitive. It is not stored by New Relic and is ephemeral and queryable for less than 24 hours. Control who has access to Pixie data If you want to manage which members of your organization can view Pixie data in New Relic One, as well as install and delete Pixie links, you can create a custom role. Note that this option is available only to Enterprise and Pro level customers. For more information, see New Relic's user model. Manage auto-update and two-way communication Pixie maintains an active two-way communication channel from your host system to Community Cloud with Pixie at withpixie.ai. Pixie uses this communication channel to query data, push updates, and retrieve metadata and health checks about Pixie and your Kubernetes cluster. By default, Pixie queries withpixie.ai to check if new updates have been pushed and then automatically installs them if they’re present. To disable auto updates, you must set a flag prior to the install process using either Helm or in the newrelic-manifest.yaml file. To disable automatic updates, choose one: Helm option Add --set pixie-chart.disableAutoUpdate=true to your Helm command. newrelic-manifest.yaml option in your newrelic-manifest.yaml file under the pl-cluster-config section, add PL_DISABLE_AUTO_UPDATE: \"true\" to the data directive.

      "body": "When we say auto-telemetry, we’re not talking about cars — we're talking about instant baseline visibility into your Kubernetes clusters. With the New Relic One integration with Pixie, you get similar data to traditional language agents, but without manually instrumenting your code or redeploying your application. Pixie auto-telemetry is powered by eBPF, a virtual machine-like construct that enables Pixie to seamlessly collect fine-grained telemetry data — service-level metrics, unsampled requests, and more. With one install command, you get deeper insight into your Kubernetes clusters and workloads. No language agents required. Live debugging with Pixie shows a service graph listing the namespaces and the node that are available on the current cluster. Simply put, Auto-telemetry with Pixie offers the quickest option for getting observability into your Kubernetes services. Quickly start observing and debugging Kubernetes clusters Our Pixie integration gives you the best of both worlds: Pixie’s fast and simple Kubernetes observability coupled with New Relic One’s incident correlation, intelligent alerting, and long-term retention. You’ll get visibility into HTTP services using golden signals, HTTP transactions, database transactions, distributed tracing, and JVM metrics. You can operate, debug, and scale your Kubernetes clusters based on the information you learn about how your clusters and services are running. Using the New Relic Explorer, you can see key metrics and events at every level, starting with the cluster, and diving down into namespaces, deployments, and pods. You can quickly spot anomalous behavior, and where it’s happening. And then dive deeper using embedded visualizations of your Pixie data. Quickly identify hot spots with Flamegraph. On the Live debugging with Pixie tab, answer questions like what SQL requests your app is making or which services are talking to each other. Important Auto-Telemetry with Pixie leverages Community Cloud with Pixie, a separate platform from New Relic One. Use of Community Cloud with Pixie is subject to separate terms of service. Explore your cluster Access the Pixie UI via New Relic's Live debugging with Pixie area of your Kubernetes clusters. The cluster explorer provides a quick overview of the nodes in your cluster, including CPU, memory, and storage, as well as the status of each pod (healthy, warning, or critical). You can also find out what services are running in each container, their latency, throughput, and error rate. For more information about using the cluster explorer, see Navigate the Kubernetes cluster explorer. Note that you cannot log directly into the Pixie UI unless you have created a separate Pixie login. Tip Containers might be listed for up to four hours after they get decommissioned. You can query the Pixie data in New Relic One and create dashboards for at-a-glance monitoring. Find the data model and sample queries here. Investigate usage spikes with Flamegraph Debugging is orders of magnitude easier when you can quickly see what your application is doing. Flamegraph, a Pixie always-on visualization, requires no instrumentation, redeploying, or recompiling. It works for compiled languages like Go, C+, Rust, to name a few. And at a glance, Flamegraph tells you what functions your application is spending time on and where you have hot spots. Flamegraph is especially useful for hierarchical resource use, like disk usage and CPU utilization. For more information on how to read Flamegraph, see the Pixie documentation. Debug live On the Live debugging with Pixie tab, run PxL scripts — scripts written in Pixie's PxL language — to view live data captured through eBPF. Select the script drop-down and then select a script to run in the tab. (For best results, select a time range that is recent in the time picker.) Scripts enable you to debug: Traffic in multiple formats: HTTP and HTTPs (including encrypted), DNS, Postgres, MySQL, Cassandra, Redis (currently supporting SQL and HTTP in beta).

      "body": "To get up and running with Auto-telemetry with Pixie, you start with our guided installation. The guided installation deploys Pixie with New Relic's Kubernetes integration on your cluster. You don't need to do any further configuration or installation to start using Pixie. If you want to install Auto-telemetry with Pixie on multiple clusters, re-run the guided install for each additional cluster. General prerequisites for using Pixie You must be a New Relic full platform user. Other user-related requirements: Users on our New Relic One user model must be assigned to a group that has a role with Pixie-related capabilities. Users on our original user model cannot be Restricted. Review this Pixie data security overview for actions to take to secure your data. Make sure you have sufficient memory: Pixie requires 2Gb of memory per node in your cluster. Review the other Pixie technical requirements. Setup steps depend on your account status Use the following table to find out where to start installing Auto-telemetry with Pixie. Where you start the installation depends on whether you already have a New Relic or Pixie account, or both. New Relic Pixie Next steps Start the guided install at the beginning of the process. If you already have both types of accounts, and used the same email address for each of them, click the New Relic icon in the Pixie UI. This brings you to the Configure the HELM command/manifest (yaml) file section of the guided installation. Then, follow the steps. If you're using different email addresses in Pixie and New Relic, create a new account for either Pixie or New Relic to match email addresses across both products. You can also contact New Relic support to manually link your existing New Relic account with your Pixie account. If you follow a link to New Relic from the Pixie UI and do not have a New Relic account, you must first create one. Click the New Relic icon in the Pixie UI, and follow the steps to create a New Relic account. When you do so, your Pixie account is linked to it. Then, continue the guided install process with these steps. Sign up for a free New Relic account. Then, start the guided install at the beginning of the process. Install from the beginning of the guided install process Open our New Relic One guided install. Select the account you want to use for the guided install, and click Continue. Note: if you have a single account, you won't see this option. Select Kubernetes and then continue with step one in the next section. Install from the Configure the HELM command/manifest (yaml) file If you arrived in the guided installation process by following a link from Pixie or from within New Relic, your steps begin here. Select the account and cluster for the install. If needed, select a namespace. Important Currently, Pixie performs best on clusters with up to 100 nodes (exceeding 100 nodes can lead to excessive memory usage and scripts failing to run). Friendly reminder: autoscaling can quickly drive up your node numbers. Click Continue. Select the data you want to gather, observe, and debug, and click Continue. On the Choose install method page, select either Helm or manifest. Helm method Run the provided Helm command on your command line. If you're concerned about the amount of Pixie data you'll ingest, check out strategies for reducing ingest.

It’s getting the whole picture of everything that enables your applications and devices to deliver value to your customers, from the container running a microservice in the cloud to a mobile website's shopping cart button. You’re in control because you understand your system New Relic helps you cut through the layers of complexity surrounding your systems by bringing together and connecting data from any instrumented source and environment, without having to jump between tools. You can interrogate your data for patterns, discover them using our data platform, or get proactive results from our machine learning tools. New Relic provides answers to essential questions in one place. All the answers in one place As a full user you get access to our entire set of observability tools. All our tools are interconnected and accessible in New Relic One. All the data you bring to New Relic through agents and integrations are metrics, events, logs, and traces that feed our platform's analytics and monitoring capabilities. New Relic links your data in a meaningful way so that you can explore it, build dashboards, and set up alerts. Our more curated observability UI experiences allow to visualize, analyze, and troubleshoot your entire software stack in one unified platform. The New Relic Explorer consolidates all the entities in your system, and how they're connected, in a single place, so you can easily detect performance trends and issues. By automatically connecting infrastructure health with application performance and end-user behavior, you can cut through the noise to find the signal. Start anywhere Being fully-connected, New Relic allows you to start your observability journey from any element of your stack. For example, you can get to crucial infrastructure logs from traces of an application running on a problematic Kubernetes pod. Use the Explorer in New Relic One to access and observe the full stack of your software, see performance data and alerting status at a glance, and check relationships. We provide you with a simple, yet powerful visual tool to monitor all your entities, that is, anything we can identify that reports data. In the New Relic ecosystem, entities include basic components like applications, hosts, containers, or database services, but it can also refer to custom groupings of such elements. You can also create your own entities. The more entities you instrument, the more data you'll bring in. The more data you've brought to New Relic, the more you'll understand your metrics, events, logs, and traces.

      "body": "BETA FEATURE This feature is still in development, but we encourage you to try it out! You can use metrics from your New Relic account to autoscale applications and services in your Kubernetes cluster by deploying the New Relic Metrics Adapter. This adapter fetches the metric values from New Relic and makes them available for the Horizontal Pod Autoscalers. The newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter implements the external.metrics.k8s.io API to support the use of external metrics based New Relic NRQL queries results. Once deployed, the value for each configured metric is fetched using the NerdGraph API based on the configured NRQL query. The metrics adapter exposes the metrics over a secured endpoint with TLS. New Relic metrics adapter in a cluster. Requirements Kubernetes 1.16 or higher. The New Relic Kubernetes integration. New Relic's user API key. No other External Metrics Adapter installed in the cluster. Installation To install the New Relic Metrics Adapter, we provide the newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter Helm chart, which is also included in the nri-bundle chart used to deploy all New Relic Kubernetes components. Install the New Relic Metrics Adapter by running the following command: helm upgrade --install newrelic newrelic/nri-bundle \\ --namespace newrelic --create-namespace \\ --set global.licenseKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY \\ --set global.cluster=K8S_CLUSTER_NAME \\ --set infrastructure.enabled=true \\ --set prometheus.enabled=true \\ --set webhook.enabled=true \\ --set ksm.enabled=true \\ --set kubeEvents.enabled=true \\ --set metrics-adapter.enabled=true \\ --set newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.personalAPIKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_PERSONAL_API_KEY \\ --set newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.config.accountID=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID \\ --set newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.config.externalMetrics.external_metric_name.query=NRQL query Copy Please notice and adjust the following flags: metrics-adapter.enabled: Must be set to true so the metrics adapter chart is installed. newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.personalAPIKey: Must be set to valid New Relic Personal API key. newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.accountID: Must be set to valid New Relic account where metrics are going to be fetched from. newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.config.externalMetrics.<var>external_metric_name</var>.<var>query</var>: Adds a new external metric where: <var>external_metric_name</var>: The metric name. <var>query</var>: The base NRQL query that is used to get the value for the metric. Tip Alternatively, you can use a values.yaml file that can be passed to the helm command with the --values flag. Values files can contain all parameters needed to configure the metrics explained in the configuration section. Configuration You can configure multiple metrics in the metrics adapter and change some parameters to modify the behaviour of the metrics cache and filtering. To see the full list and descriptions of all parameters that can be modified, refer to the chart README.md and values.yaml files. How it works The following values enable the metrics adapter on the nri-bundle chart installation: metrics-adapter: enabled: true newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter: personalAPIKey: <Personal API Key> config: accountID: <Account ID> externalMetrics: nginx_average_requests: query: \"FROM Metric SELECT average(nginx.server.net.requestsPerSecond) SINCE 2 MINUTES AGO\" Copy Caution The default time span for metrics is 1h. Therefore, you should define queries with the SINCE clause to adjust the time span according to your environment and needs. There is an HPA consuming the external metric as follows: kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler apiVersion: autoscaling/v2beta2 metadata: name: nginx-scaler spec: scaleTargetRef: apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment name: nginx minReplicas: 1 maxReplicas: 10 metrics: - type: External external: metric: name: nginx_average_requests selector: matchLabels: k8s.namespaceName: nginx target: type: Value value: 10000 Copy Based on the HPA definition, the controller manager fetches the metrics from the external metrics API which are served by the New Relic metrics adapter. The New Relic metrics adapter receives the query including the nginx_average_requests metric name and all the selectors, and searches for a matching metric name in the internal memory based on the configured metrics. Then, it adds the selectors to the query to form a final query that is executed using NerdGraph to fetch the value from New Relic. The above example will generate a query like the following: FROM Metric SELECT average(nginx.server.net.requestsPerSecond) WHERE clusterName=<clusterName> AND `k8s.namespaceName`='nginx' SINCE 2 MINUTES AGO Copy Notice that a clusterName filter has been automatically added to the query to exclude metrics from other clusters in the same account. You can remove it by using the removeClusterFilter configuration parameter. Also the value is cached for a period of time defined by the cacheTTLSeconds configuration parameter, whose deafult is 30 seconds. Troubleshooting Get verbose logs Most common errors are displayed in the standard (non-verbose) logs. If you're doing a more in-depth investigation on your own or with New Relic Support, you can enable verbose mode. To get verbose logging details for an integration using Helm: Enable verbose logging: bash Copy $ helm upgrade -n <namespace> --reuse-values newrelic-bundle --set newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.verboseLog=true newrelic/nri-bundle Leave on verbose mode for a few minutes, or until enough activity has occurred. When you have the information you need, disable verbose logging: bash Copy $ helm upgrade --reuse-values newrelic-bundle --set newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.verboseLog=false newrelic/nri-bundle Caution Verbose mode increases significantly the amount of information sent to log files. Enable this mode temporarily, only for troubleshooting purposes, and reset the log level when finished. Get raw metrics Sometimes it's useful to get the list of available metrics and also to get the current value of an specific metric. To get the list of metrics available, run: bash Copy $ kubectl get --raw \"/apis/external.metrics.k8s.io/v1beta1/\" To get the value for a specific metric with a selector, run: bash Copy $ kubectl get --raw \"/apis/external.metrics.k8s.io/v1beta1/namespaces/*/<metric_name>?labelSelector=<selector_key>=<selector_value>\" Tip You must replace <metric_name>, <selector_key> and <selector_value> with your values. Metrics not working There are some usual errors that could cause a metric fail to retrieve the value. These errors are showed in the status of the metrics when you describe the HPA or are printed when you get the raw metrics directly. executing query: NRQL Syntax Error: Error at line...: The query that is being run has syntax errors. The same error message gives you the executed query and position of the error. You can try this query inside the New Relic query builder and correct the configuration from the adapter. extracting return value: expected first value to be of type \"float64\", got %!q(<nil>): The query doesn't return any value. The same error message gives you the executed query so you can try this query inside the New Relic query builder and correct the configuration from the adapter or the match selectors in the HPA.",

      "body": "New Relic's Kubernetes integration gives you full observability into the health and performance of your environment, no matter whether you run Kubernetes on-premises or in the cloud. With our cluster explorer, you can cut through layers of complexity to see how your cluster is performing, from the heights of the control plane down to applications running on a single pod. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer: The cluster explorer is our powerful, fully visual answer to the challenges associated with running Kubernetes at a large scale. You can see the power of the Kubernetes integration in the cluster explorer, where the full picture of a cluster is made available on a single screen: nodes and pods are visualized according to their health and performance, with pending and alerting nodes in the innermost circles. Predefined alert conditions help you troubleshoot issues right from the start. Clicking each node reveals its status and how each app is performing. Get started: Install the Kubernetes integration We have an automated installer to help you with many types of installations: servers, virtual machines, and unprivileged environments. It can also help you with installations in managed services or platforms, but you'll need to review a few preliminary notes before getting started. Our automated installer will generate either a helm command or a set of plain manifests for you to install. Our automated installer: Allows users to select the cluster name and namespace for the installation. Allows users to selectively enable or disable bundling of Kube-state-metrics, a dependency of the Kubernetes integration. Allows users to seamlessly install our other products related to Kubernetes such as: Kubernetes events monitoring In-cluster prometheus services monitoring Service instrumentation without code changes using Pixie Automatically fills the required properties with the license keys the integration needs to work. Read the install docs Start the installer Tip If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the automated installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Why it matters Governing the complexity of Kubernetes can be challenging; there's so much going on at any given moment, with containers being created and deleted in a matter of minutes, applications crashing, and resources being consumed unexpectedly. Our integration helps you navigate Kubernetes abstractions across on-premises, cloud, and hybrid deployments. In New Relic, you can build your own charts and query all your Kubernetes data, which our integration collects by instrumenting the container orchestration layer. This gives you additional insight into nodes, namespaces, deployments, replica sets, pods, and containers. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: Using the query builder you can turn any query on Kubernetes data to clear visuals. With the Kubernetes integration you can also: Link your APM data to Kubernetes to measure the performance of your web and mobile applications, with metrics such as request rate, throughput, error rate, and availability. Monitor services running on Kubernetes, such as Apache, NGINX, Cassandra, and many more (see our tutorial for monitoring Redis on Kubernetes). Create new alert policies and alert conditions based on your Kubernetes data, or extend the predefined alert conditions. These features are in addition to the data New Relic already reports for containerized processes running on instrumented hosts. Navigate all your Kubernetes events The Kubernetes events integration, which is installed separately, watches for events happening in your Kubernetes clusters and sends those events to New Relic. Events data is then visualized in the cluster explorer. To set it up, check the Kubernetes events box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer > Events: Browse and filter all your Kubernetes events, and dig into application logs and infrastructure data. Bring your cluster logs to New Relic Our Kubernetes plugin for log monitoring can collect all your cluster's logs and send them to our platform, so that you can set up new alerts and charts. To set it up, check the Log data box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or you can create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

Values files can contain all parameters needed to configure the metrics explained in the configuration section. Configuration You can configure multiple metrics in the metrics adapter and change some parameters to modify the behaviour of the metrics cache and filtering. To see the full list and descriptions of all parameters that can be modified, refer to the chart README.md and values.yaml files. How it works The following values enable the metrics adapter on the nri-bundle chart installation: metrics-adapter: enabled: true newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter: personalAPIKey: <Personal API Key> config: accountID: <Account ID> externalMetrics: nginx_average_requests: query: \"FROM Metric SELECT average(nginx.server.net.requestsPerSecond) SINCE 2 MINUTES AGO\" Copy Caution The default time span for metrics is 1h. Therefore, you should define queries with the SINCE clause to adjust the time span according to your environment and needs. There is an HPA consuming the external metric as follows: kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler apiVersion: autoscaling/v2beta2 metadata: name: nginx-scaler spec: scaleTargetRef: apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment name: nginx minReplicas: 1 maxReplicas: 10 metrics: - type: External external: metric: name: nginx_average_requests selector: matchLabels: k8s.namespaceName: nginx target: type: Value value: 10000 Copy Based on the HPA definition, the controller manager fetches the metrics from the external metrics API which are served by the New Relic metrics adapter. The New Relic metrics adapter receives the query including the nginx_average_requests metric name and all the selectors, and searches for a matching metric name in the internal memory based on the configured metrics. Then, it adds the selectors to the query to form a final query that is executed using NerdGraph to fetch the value from New Relic. The above example will generate a query like the following: FROM Metric SELECT average(nginx.server.net.requestsPerSecond) WHERE clusterName=<clusterName> AND `k8s.namespaceName`='nginx' SINCE 2 MINUTES AGO Copy Notice that a clusterName filter has been automatically added to the query to exclude metrics from other clusters in the same account. You can remove it by using the removeClusterFilter configuration parameter. Also the value is cached for a period of time defined by the cacheTTLSeconds configuration parameter, whose deafult is 30 seconds. Troubleshooting Get verbose logs Most common errors are displayed in the standard (non-verbose) logs. If you're doing a more in-depth investigation on your own or with New Relic Support, you can enable verbose mode. To get verbose logging details for an integration using Helm: Enable verbose logging: bash Copy $ helm upgrade -n <namespace> --reuse-values newrelic-bundle --set newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.verboseLog=true newrelic/nri-bundle Leave on verbose mode for a few minutes, or until enough activity has occurred. When you have the information you need, disable verbose logging: bash Copy $ helm upgrade --reuse-values newrelic-bundle --set newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.verboseLog=false newrelic/nri-bundle Caution Verbose mode increases significantly the amount of information sent to log files. Enable this mode temporarily, only for troubleshooting purposes, and reset the log level when finished. Get raw metrics Sometimes it's useful to get the list of available metrics and also to get the current value of an specific metric. To get the list of metrics available, run: bash Copy $ kubectl get --raw \"/apis/external.metrics.k8s.io/v1beta1/\" To get the value for a specific metric with a selector, run: bash Copy $ kubectl get --raw \"/apis/external.metrics.k8s.io/v1beta1/namespaces/*/<metric_name>?labelSelector=<selector_key>=<selector_value>\" Tip You must replace <metric_name>, <selector_key> and <selector_value> with your values. Metrics not working There are some usual errors that could cause a metric fail to retrieve the value. These errors are showed in the status of the metrics when you describe the HPA or are printed when you get the raw metrics directly. executing query: NRQL Syntax Error: Error at line...: The query that is being run has syntax errors. The same error message gives you the executed query and position of the error. You can try this query inside the New Relic query builder and correct the configuration from the adapter. extracting return value: expected first value to be of type \"float64\", got %!q(<nil>): The query doesn't return any value. The same error message gives you the executed query so you can try this query inside the New Relic query builder and correct the configuration from the adapter or the match selectors in the HPA.",

      "body": "New Relic's Kubernetes integration gives you full observability into the health and performance of your environment, no matter whether you run Kubernetes on-premises or in the cloud. With our cluster explorer, you can cut through layers of complexity to see how your cluster is performing, from the heights of the control plane down to applications running on a single pod. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer: The cluster explorer is our powerful, fully visual answer to the challenges associated with running Kubernetes at a large scale. You can see the power of the Kubernetes integration in the cluster explorer, where the full picture of a cluster is made available on a single screen: nodes and pods are visualized according to their health and performance, with pending and alerting nodes in the innermost circles. Predefined alert conditions help you troubleshoot issues right from the start. Clicking each node reveals its status and how each app is performing. Get started: Install the Kubernetes integration We have an automated installer to help you with many types of installations: servers, virtual machines, and unprivileged environments. It can also help you with installations in managed services or platforms, but you'll need to review a few preliminary notes before getting started. Our automated installer will generate either a helm command or a set of plain manifests for you to install. Our automated installer: Allows users to select the cluster name and namespace for the installation. Allows users to selectively enable or disable bundling of Kube-state-metrics, a dependency of the Kubernetes integration. Allows users to seamlessly install our other products related to Kubernetes such as: Kubernetes events monitoring In-cluster prometheus services monitoring Service instrumentation without code changes using Pixie Automatically fills the required properties with the license keys the integration needs to work. Read the install docs Start the installer Tip If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the automated installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Why it matters Governing the complexity of Kubernetes can be challenging; there's so much going on at any given moment, with containers being created and deleted in a matter of minutes, applications crashing, and resources being consumed unexpectedly. Our integration helps you navigate Kubernetes abstractions across on-premises, cloud, and hybrid deployments. In New Relic, you can build your own charts and query all your Kubernetes data, which our integration collects by instrumenting the container orchestration layer. This gives you additional insight into nodes, namespaces, deployments, replica sets, pods, and containers. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: Using the query builder you can turn any query on Kubernetes data to clear visuals. With the Kubernetes integration you can also: Link your APM data to Kubernetes to measure the performance of your web and mobile applications, with metrics such as request rate, throughput, error rate, and availability. Monitor services running on Kubernetes, such as Apache, NGINX, Cassandra, and many more (see our tutorial for monitoring Redis on Kubernetes). Create new alert policies and alert conditions based on your Kubernetes data, or extend the predefined alert conditions. These features are in addition to the data New Relic already reports for containerized processes running on instrumented hosts. Navigate all your Kubernetes events The Kubernetes events integration, which is installed separately, watches for events happening in your Kubernetes clusters and sends those events to New Relic. Events data is then visualized in the cluster explorer. To set it up, check the Kubernetes events box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer > Events: Browse and filter all your Kubernetes events, and dig into application logs and infrastructure data. Bring your cluster logs to New Relic Our Kubernetes plugin for log monitoring can collect all your cluster's logs and send them to our platform, so that you can set up new alerts and charts. To set it up, check the Log data box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or you can create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "BETA FEATURE This feature is still in development, but we encourage you to try it out! You can use metrics from your New Relic account to autoscale applications and services in your Kubernetes cluster by deploying the New Relic Metrics Adapter. This adapter fetches the metric values from New Relic and makes them available for the Horizontal Pod Autoscalers. The newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter implements the external.metrics.k8s.io API to support the use of external metrics based New Relic NRQL queries results. Once deployed, the value for each configured metric is fetched using the NerdGraph API based on the configured NRQL query. The metrics adapter exposes the metrics over a secured endpoint with TLS. New Relic metrics adapter in a cluster. Requirements Kubernetes 1.16 or higher. The New Relic Kubernetes integration. New Relic's user API key. No other External Metrics Adapter installed in the cluster. Installation To install the New Relic Metrics Adapter, we provide the newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter Helm chart, which is also included in the nri-bundle chart used to deploy all New Relic Kubernetes components.

Update the manifest file. Learn about the limitations of the integration. Compatibility and requirements Before you install New Relic's Kubernetes integration, review the compatibility and requirements. Important When using containers in Windows, the container host version and the container image version must be the same. Our Kubernetes integration supports Windows versions 1809 and 1909. To check your Windows version: Open a command window. Run the following command: Reg Query \"HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\" /v ReleaseIdcmd.exe Copy Example: Get Kubernetes for Windows from a BusyBox container. $ kubectl exec -it busybox1-766bb4d6cc-rmsnj -- Reg Query \"HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\" /v ReleaseId Copy HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion ReleaseId REG_SZ 1809 Copy Install You can install the Kubernetes integration for Windows using Helm. See an example on how to install the integration in a cluster with nodes having different build versions of Windows (1809 and 2004): Install kube-state-metrics and run it in your cluster using this snippet: curl -L -o kube-state-metrics-1.9.5.zip https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/archive/v1.9.5.zip && unzip kube-state-metrics-1.9.5.zip && kubectl apply -f kube-state-metrics-1.9.5/examples/standard Copy Create a values.yml file with the follow data to be used by Helm: global: licenseKey: <YOUR_LICENSE_KEY> cluster: <YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME> enableLinux: false enableWindows: true windowsOsList: - version: 1809 imageTag: 2.2.0-windows-1809-alpha buildNumber: 10.0.17763 - version: 2004 imageTag: 2.2.0-windows-2004-alpha buildNumber: 10.0.19041 Copy Install the integration with: helm install <YOUR_INSTALL_NAME> newrelic/newrelic-infrastructure -f values.yml Copy Confirm that the DaemonSet has been created successfully by looking for newrelic-infra in the results generated by this command: kubectl get daemonsets Copy The Helm chart will create one DeamonSet per each version of Windows that is in the list and use NodeSelector to deploy the corresponding Pod per Node. Limitations The following limitations apply to the Kubernetes integration for Windows: The Windows agent only sends the Kubernetes samples (K8sNodeSample, K8sPodSample, etc.) SystemSample, StorageSample, NetworkSample, and ProcessSample are not generated. Some Kubernetes metrics are missing because the Windows kubelet doesn’t have them: Node: fsInodes: not sent fsInodesFree: not sent fsInodesUsed: not sent memoryMajorPageFaultsPerSecond: always returns zero as a value memoryPageFaults: always returns zero as a value memoryRssBytes: always returns zero as a value runtimeInodes: not sent runtimeInodesFree: not sent runtimeInodesUsed: not sent Pod: net.errorsPerSecond: not sent net.rxBytesPerSecond: not sent net.txBytesPerSecond: not sent Container: containerID: not sent containerImageID: not sent memoryUsedBytes: in the UI, this is displayed in the pod card that appears when you click on a pod, and will show no data. We will soon fix this by updating our charts to use memoryWorkingSetBytes instead. Volume: fsUsedBytes: zero, so fsUsedPercent is zero Known issues with the Windows Kubelet There are a couple of issues with the Windows version of Kubelet that can prevent the integration from fetching data: Issue 90554: This issue makes the Kubelet return 500 errors when the integration makes a request to the /stats/summary endpoint. It will be included in the Kubernetes 1.19 release and has been backported to the releases 1.16.11, 1.17.7, and 1.18.4. There is no solution on the integration side for this problem, we advise you to update to one of the patch versions as soon as possible. You can see if you're being affected by this problem by enabling verbose logs and looking for messages of the type: error querying Kubelet. Get \"https://<KUBELET_IP>/stats/summary\": error calling kubelet endpoint. Got status code: 500 Copy Issue 87730: This issue makes the Kubelet metrics very slow when running minimal load. It makes the integration fail with a timeout error. A patch for this issue has been added for Kubernetes 1.18 and backported to 1.15.12, 1.16.9, and 1.17.5. We advise you to update to one of the patch versions as soon as possible. To mitigate this issue you can increase the integration timeout with the TIMEOUT config option. You can see if you're being affected by this problem by enabling verbose logs and looking for messages of the type: error querying Kubelet. Get \"https://<KUBELET_IP>/stats/summary\": context deadline exceeded (Client.Timeout exceeded while awaiting headers) Copy",

      "body": "New Relic's Kubernetes integration gives you full observability into the health and performance of your environment, no matter whether you run Kubernetes on-premises or in the cloud. With our cluster explorer, you can cut through layers of complexity to see how your cluster is performing, from the heights of the control plane down to applications running on a single pod. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer: The cluster explorer is our powerful, fully visual answer to the challenges associated with running Kubernetes at a large scale. You can see the power of the Kubernetes integration in the cluster explorer, where the full picture of a cluster is made available on a single screen: nodes and pods are visualized according to their health and performance, with pending and alerting nodes in the innermost circles. Predefined alert conditions help you troubleshoot issues right from the start. Clicking each node reveals its status and how each app is performing. Get started: Install the Kubernetes integration We have an automated installer to help you with many types of installations: servers, virtual machines, and unprivileged environments. It can also help you with installations in managed services or platforms, but you'll need to review a few preliminary notes before getting started. Our automated installer will generate either a helm command or a set of plain manifests for you to install. Our automated installer: Allows users to select the cluster name and namespace for the installation. Allows users to selectively enable or disable bundling of Kube-state-metrics, a dependency of the Kubernetes integration. Allows users to seamlessly install our other products related to Kubernetes such as: Kubernetes events monitoring In-cluster prometheus services monitoring Service instrumentation without code changes using Pixie Automatically fills the required properties with the license keys the integration needs to work. Read the install docs Start the installer Tip If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the automated installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Why it matters Governing the complexity of Kubernetes can be challenging; there's so much going on at any given moment, with containers being created and deleted in a matter of minutes, applications crashing, and resources being consumed unexpectedly. Our integration helps you navigate Kubernetes abstractions across on-premises, cloud, and hybrid deployments. In New Relic, you can build your own charts and query all your Kubernetes data, which our integration collects by instrumenting the container orchestration layer. This gives you additional insight into nodes, namespaces, deployments, replica sets, pods, and containers. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: Using the query builder you can turn any query on Kubernetes data to clear visuals. With the Kubernetes integration you can also: Link your APM data to Kubernetes to measure the performance of your web and mobile applications, with metrics such as request rate, throughput, error rate, and availability. Monitor services running on Kubernetes, such as Apache, NGINX, Cassandra, and many more (see our tutorial for monitoring Redis on Kubernetes). Create new alert policies and alert conditions based on your Kubernetes data, or extend the predefined alert conditions. These features are in addition to the data New Relic already reports for containerized processes running on instrumented hosts. Navigate all your Kubernetes events The Kubernetes events integration, which is installed separately, watches for events happening in your Kubernetes clusters and sends those events to New Relic. Events data is then visualized in the cluster explorer. To set it up, check the Kubernetes events box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer > Events: Browse and filter all your Kubernetes events, and dig into application logs and infrastructure data. Bring your cluster logs to New Relic Our Kubernetes plugin for log monitoring can collect all your cluster's logs and send them to our platform, so that you can set up new alerts and charts. To set it up, check the Log data box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or you can create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "BETA FEATURE This feature is still in development, but we encourage you to try it out! You can use metrics from your New Relic account to autoscale applications and services in your Kubernetes cluster by deploying the New Relic Metrics Adapter. This adapter fetches the metric values from New Relic and makes them available for the Horizontal Pod Autoscalers. The newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter implements the external.metrics.k8s.io API to support the use of external metrics based New Relic NRQL queries results. Once deployed, the value for each configured metric is fetched using the NerdGraph API based on the configured NRQL query. The metrics adapter exposes the metrics over a secured endpoint with TLS. New Relic metrics adapter in a cluster. Requirements Kubernetes 1.16 or higher. The New Relic Kubernetes integration. New Relic's user API key. No other External Metrics Adapter installed in the cluster. Installation To install the New Relic Metrics Adapter, we provide the newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter Helm chart, which is also included in the nri-bundle chart used to deploy all New Relic Kubernetes components. Install the New Relic Metrics Adapter by running the following command: helm upgrade --install newrelic newrelic/nri-bundle \\ --namespace newrelic --create-namespace \\ --set global.licenseKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY \\ --set global.cluster=K8S_CLUSTER_NAME \\ --set infrastructure.enabled=true \\ --set prometheus.enabled=true \\ --set webhook.enabled=true \\ --set ksm.enabled=true \\ --set kubeEvents.enabled=true \\ --set metrics-adapter.enabled=true \\ --set newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.personalAPIKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_PERSONAL_API_KEY \\ --set newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.config.accountID=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID \\ --set newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.config.externalMetrics.external_metric_name.query=NRQL query Copy Please notice and adjust the following flags: metrics-adapter.enabled: Must be set to true so the metrics adapter chart is installed. newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.personalAPIKey: Must be set to valid New Relic Personal API key. newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.accountID: Must be set to valid New Relic account where metrics are going to be fetched from. newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.config.externalMetrics.<var>external_metric_name</var>.<var>query</var>: Adds a new external metric where: <var>external_metric_name</var>: The metric name. <var>query</var>: The base NRQL query that is used to get the value for the metric. Tip Alternatively, you can use a values.yaml file that can be passed to the helm command with the --values flag. Values files can contain all parameters needed to configure the metrics explained in the configuration section. Configuration You can configure multiple metrics in the metrics adapter and change some parameters to modify the behaviour of the metrics cache and filtering. To see the full list and descriptions of all parameters that can be modified, refer to the chart README.md and values.yaml files. How it works The following values enable the metrics adapter on the nri-bundle chart installation: metrics-adapter: enabled: true newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter: personalAPIKey: <Personal API Key> config: accountID: <Account ID> externalMetrics: nginx_average_requests: query: \"FROM Metric SELECT average(nginx.server.net.requestsPerSecond) SINCE 2 MINUTES AGO\" Copy Caution The default time span for metrics is 1h. Therefore, you should define queries with the SINCE clause to adjust the time span according to your environment and needs. There is an HPA consuming the external metric as follows: kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler apiVersion: autoscaling/v2beta2 metadata: name: nginx-scaler spec: scaleTargetRef: apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment name: nginx minReplicas: 1 maxReplicas: 10 metrics: - type: External external: metric: name: nginx_average_requests selector: matchLabels: k8s.namespaceName: nginx target: type: Value value: 10000 Copy Based on the HPA definition, the controller manager fetches the metrics from the external metrics API which are served by the New Relic metrics adapter. The New Relic metrics adapter receives the query including the nginx_average_requests metric name and all the selectors, and searches for a matching metric name in the internal memory based on the configured metrics. Then, it adds the selectors to the query to form a final query that is executed using NerdGraph to fetch the value from New Relic. The above example will generate a query like the following: FROM Metric SELECT average(nginx.server.net.requestsPerSecond) WHERE clusterName=<clusterName> AND `k8s.namespaceName`='nginx' SINCE 2 MINUTES AGO Copy Notice that a clusterName filter has been automatically added to the query to exclude metrics from other clusters in the same account. You can remove it by using the removeClusterFilter configuration parameter. Also the value is cached for a period of time defined by the cacheTTLSeconds configuration parameter, whose deafult is 30 seconds. Troubleshooting Get verbose logs Most common errors are displayed in the standard (non-verbose) logs. If you're doing a more in-depth investigation on your own or with New Relic Support, you can enable verbose mode. To get verbose logging details for an integration using Helm: Enable verbose logging: bash Copy $ helm upgrade -n <namespace> --reuse-values newrelic-bundle --set newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.verboseLog=true newrelic/nri-bundle Leave on verbose mode for a few minutes, or until enough activity has occurred. When you have the information you need, disable verbose logging: bash Copy $ helm upgrade --reuse-values newrelic-bundle --set newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.verboseLog=false newrelic/nri-bundle Caution Verbose mode increases significantly the amount of information sent to log files. Enable this mode temporarily, only for troubleshooting purposes, and reset the log level when finished. Get raw metrics Sometimes it's useful to get the list of available metrics and also to get the current value of an specific metric. To get the list of metrics available, run: bash Copy $ kubectl get --raw \"/apis/external.metrics.k8s.io/v1beta1/\" To get the value for a specific metric with a selector, run: bash Copy $ kubectl get --raw \"/apis/external.metrics.k8s.io/v1beta1/namespaces/*/<metric_name>?labelSelector=<selector_key>=<selector_value>\" Tip You must replace <metric_name>, <selector_key> and <selector_value> with your values. Metrics not working There are some usual errors that could cause a metric fail to retrieve the value. These errors are showed in the status of the metrics when you describe the HPA or are printed when you get the raw metrics directly. executing query: NRQL Syntax Error: Error at line...: The query that is being run has syntax errors. The same error message gives you the executed query and position of the error. You can try this query inside the New Relic query builder and correct the configuration from the adapter. extracting return value: expected first value to be of type \"float64\", got %!q(<nil>): The query doesn't return any value. The same error message gives you the executed query so you can try this query inside the New Relic query builder and correct the configuration from the adapter or the match selectors in the HPA.",

Update the manifest file. Learn about the limitations of the integration. Compatibility and requirements Before you install New Relic's Kubernetes integration, review the compatibility and requirements. Important When using containers in Windows, the container host version and the container image version must be the same. Our Kubernetes integration supports Windows versions 1809 and 1909. To check your Windows version: Open a command window. Run the following command: Reg Query \"HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\" /v ReleaseIdcmd.exe Copy Example: Get Kubernetes for Windows from a BusyBox container. $ kubectl exec -it busybox1-766bb4d6cc-rmsnj -- Reg Query \"HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\" /v ReleaseId Copy HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion ReleaseId REG_SZ 1809 Copy Install You can install the Kubernetes integration for Windows using Helm. See an example on how to install the integration in a cluster with nodes having different build versions of Windows (1809 and 2004): Install kube-state-metrics and run it in your cluster using this snippet: curl -L -o kube-state-metrics-1.9.5.zip https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/archive/v1.9.5.zip && unzip kube-state-metrics-1.9.5.zip && kubectl apply -f kube-state-metrics-1.9.5/examples/standard Copy Create a values.yml file with the follow data to be used by Helm: global: licenseKey: <YOUR_LICENSE_KEY> cluster: <YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME> enableLinux: false enableWindows: true windowsOsList: - version: 1809 imageTag: 2.2.0-windows-1809-alpha buildNumber: 10.0.17763 - version: 2004 imageTag: 2.2.0-windows-2004-alpha buildNumber: 10.0.19041 Copy Install the integration with: helm install <YOUR_INSTALL_NAME> newrelic/newrelic-infrastructure -f values.yml Copy Confirm that the DaemonSet has been created successfully by looking for newrelic-infra in the results generated by this command: kubectl get daemonsets Copy The Helm chart will create one DeamonSet per each version of Windows that is in the list and use NodeSelector to deploy the corresponding Pod per Node. Limitations The following limitations apply to the Kubernetes integration for Windows: The Windows agent only sends the Kubernetes samples (K8sNodeSample, K8sPodSample, etc.) SystemSample, StorageSample, NetworkSample, and ProcessSample are not generated. Some Kubernetes metrics are missing because the Windows kubelet doesn’t have them: Node: fsInodes: not sent fsInodesFree: not sent fsInodesUsed: not sent memoryMajorPageFaultsPerSecond: always returns zero as a value memoryPageFaults: always returns zero as a value memoryRssBytes: always returns zero as a value runtimeInodes: not sent runtimeInodesFree: not sent runtimeInodesUsed: not sent Pod: net.errorsPerSecond: not sent net.rxBytesPerSecond: not sent net.txBytesPerSecond: not sent Container: containerID: not sent containerImageID: not sent memoryUsedBytes: in the UI, this is displayed in the pod card that appears when you click on a pod, and will show no data. We will soon fix this by updating our charts to use memoryWorkingSetBytes instead. Volume: fsUsedBytes: zero, so fsUsedPercent is zero Known issues with the Windows Kubelet There are a couple of issues with the Windows version of Kubelet that can prevent the integration from fetching data: Issue 90554: This issue makes the Kubelet return 500 errors when the integration makes a request to the /stats/summary endpoint. It will be included in the Kubernetes 1.19 release and has been backported to the releases 1.16.11, 1.17.7, and 1.18.4. There is no solution on the integration side for this problem, we advise you to update to one of the patch versions as soon as possible. You can see if you're being affected by this problem by enabling verbose logs and looking for messages of the type: error querying Kubelet. Get \"https://<KUBELET_IP>/stats/summary\": error calling kubelet endpoint. Got status code: 500 Copy Issue 87730: This issue makes the Kubelet metrics very slow when running minimal load. It makes the integration fail with a timeout error. A patch for this issue has been added for Kubernetes 1.18 and backported to 1.15.12, 1.16.9, and 1.17.5. We advise you to update to one of the patch versions as soon as possible. To mitigate this issue you can increase the integration timeout with the TIMEOUT config option. You can see if you're being affected by this problem by enabling verbose logs and looking for messages of the type: error querying Kubelet. Get \"https://<KUBELET_IP>/stats/summary\": context deadline exceeded (Client.Timeout exceeded while awaiting headers) Copy",

You can also monitor Amazon BottleRocket workloads: When running EC2 instances, use the containerized agent. On EKS, install the Kubernetes integration. For ECS clusters, deploy the ECS integration. Unique hostname The infrastructure agent uses the hostname to uniquely identify each server. To avoid inaccurate metrics from combining multiple servers under a single hostname, make sure that each monitored server has a unique hostname. You can use the optional display_name setting to override the default hostname. Servers named localhost are not reported because this is a default name and inherently non-unique. Permissions The infrastructure agent requires these permissions: Linux: By default, the agent runs and installs as root. You can also select privileged or unprivileged run modes. Windows: The agent must be installed from an Administrator account and requires Administrator privileges to run. macOS: The agent can be installed from any user account. Libraries For agent versions 1.1.19 or higher, you need the libcap library in order to install Infrastructure. It's available in the official repositories of your distribution. Network access In order to report data to New Relic, our infrastructure agent must have outbound access to certain domains and ports. If your system needs a proxy to connect to these domains, use the proxy setting. Container software The infrastructure agent instruments Docker containers when installed on the host server. We support Docker versions 1.12 or higher. CPU, memory, and disk usage The infrastructure agent is fairly lightweight. For typical CPU, memory, and disk usage, see our page on agent performance overhead. For more information on supported file systems, see Storage sample attributes. Configuration management tools The infrastructure agent can be deployed programmatically using several config management and deploy tools: Ansible Chef Elastic Beanstalk Puppet",

With our cluster explorer, you can cut through layers of complexity to see how your cluster is performing, from the heights of the control plane down to applications running on a single pod. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer: The cluster explorer is our powerful, fully visual answer to the challenges associated with running Kubernetes at a large scale. You can see the power of the Kubernetes integration in the cluster explorer, where the full picture of a cluster is made available on a single screen: nodes and pods are visualized according to their health and performance, with pending and alerting nodes in the innermost circles. Predefined alert conditions help you troubleshoot issues right from the start. Clicking each node reveals its status and how each app is performing. Get started: Install the Kubernetes integration We have an automated installer to help you with many types of installations: servers, virtual machines, and unprivileged environments. It can also help you with installations in managed services or platforms, but you'll need to review a few preliminary notes before getting started. Our automated installer will generate either a helm command or a set of plain manifests for you to install. Our automated installer: Allows users to select the cluster name and namespace for the installation. Allows users to selectively enable or disable bundling of Kube-state-metrics, a dependency of the Kubernetes integration. Allows users to seamlessly install our other products related to Kubernetes such as: Kubernetes events monitoring In-cluster prometheus services monitoring Service instrumentation without code changes using Pixie Automatically fills the required properties with the license keys the integration needs to work. Read the install docs Start the installer Tip If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the automated installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Why it matters Governing the complexity of Kubernetes can be challenging; there's so much going on at any given moment, with containers being created and deleted in a matter of minutes, applications crashing, and resources being consumed unexpectedly. Our integration helps you navigate Kubernetes abstractions across on-premises, cloud, and hybrid deployments. In New Relic, you can build your own charts and query all your Kubernetes data, which our integration collects by instrumenting the container orchestration layer. This gives you additional insight into nodes, namespaces, deployments, replica sets, pods, and containers. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: Using the query builder you can turn any query on Kubernetes data to clear visuals. With the Kubernetes integration you can also: Link your APM data to Kubernetes to measure the performance of your web and mobile applications, with metrics such as request rate, throughput, error rate, and availability. Monitor services running on Kubernetes, such as Apache, NGINX, Cassandra, and many more (see our tutorial for monitoring Redis on Kubernetes). Create new alert policies and alert conditions based on your Kubernetes data, or extend the predefined alert conditions. These features are in addition to the data New Relic already reports for containerized processes running on instrumented hosts. Navigate all your Kubernetes events The Kubernetes events integration, which is installed separately, watches for events happening in your Kubernetes clusters and sends those events to New Relic. Events data is then visualized in the cluster explorer. To set it up, check the Kubernetes events box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer > Events: Browse and filter all your Kubernetes events, and dig into application logs and infrastructure data. Bring your cluster logs to New Relic Our Kubernetes plugin for log monitoring can collect all your cluster's logs and send them to our platform, so that you can set up new alerts and charts. To set it up, check the Log data box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or you can create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "BETA FEATURE This feature is still in development, but we encourage you to try it out! You can use metrics from your New Relic account to autoscale applications and services in your Kubernetes cluster by deploying the New Relic Metrics Adapter. This adapter fetches the metric values from New Relic and makes them available for the Horizontal Pod Autoscalers. The newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter implements the external.metrics.k8s.io API to support the use of external metrics based New Relic NRQL queries results. Once deployed, the value for each configured metric is fetched using the NerdGraph API based on the configured NRQL query. The metrics adapter exposes the metrics over a secured endpoint with TLS. New Relic metrics adapter in a cluster. Requirements Kubernetes 1.16 or higher. The New Relic Kubernetes integration. New Relic's user API key. No other External Metrics Adapter installed in the cluster. Installation To install the New Relic Metrics Adapter, we provide the newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter Helm chart, which is also included in the nri-bundle chart used to deploy all New Relic Kubernetes components. Install the New Relic Metrics Adapter by running the following command: helm upgrade --install newrelic newrelic/nri-bundle \\ --namespace newrelic --create-namespace \\ --set global.licenseKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY \\ --set global.cluster=K8S_CLUSTER_NAME \\ --set infrastructure.enabled=true \\ --set prometheus.enabled=true \\ --set webhook.enabled=true \\ --set ksm.enabled=true \\ --set kubeEvents.enabled=true \\ --set metrics-adapter.enabled=true \\ --set newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.personalAPIKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_PERSONAL_API_KEY \\ --set newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.config.accountID=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID \\ --set newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.config.externalMetrics.external_metric_name.query=NRQL query Copy Please notice and adjust the following flags: metrics-adapter.enabled: Must be set to true so the metrics adapter chart is installed. newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.personalAPIKey: Must be set to valid New Relic Personal API key. newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.accountID: Must be set to valid New Relic account where metrics are going to be fetched from. newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.config.externalMetrics.<var>external_metric_name</var>.<var>query</var>: Adds a new external metric where: <var>external_metric_name</var>: The metric name. <var>query</var>: The base NRQL query that is used to get the value for the metric. Tip Alternatively, you can use a values.yaml file that can be passed to the helm command with the --values flag. Values files can contain all parameters needed to configure the metrics explained in the configuration section. Configuration You can configure multiple metrics in the metrics adapter and change some parameters to modify the behaviour of the metrics cache and filtering. To see the full list and descriptions of all parameters that can be modified, refer to the chart README.md and values.yaml files. How it works The following values enable the metrics adapter on the nri-bundle chart installation: metrics-adapter: enabled: true newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter: personalAPIKey: <Personal API Key> config: accountID: <Account ID> externalMetrics: nginx_average_requests: query: \"FROM Metric SELECT average(nginx.server.net.requestsPerSecond) SINCE 2 MINUTES AGO\" Copy Caution The default time span for metrics is 1h. Therefore, you should define queries with the SINCE clause to adjust the time span according to your environment and needs. There is an HPA consuming the external metric as follows: kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler apiVersion: autoscaling/v2beta2 metadata: name: nginx-scaler spec: scaleTargetRef: apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment name: nginx minReplicas: 1 maxReplicas: 10 metrics: - type: External external: metric: name: nginx_average_requests selector: matchLabels: k8s.namespaceName: nginx target: type: Value value: 10000 Copy Based on the HPA definition, the controller manager fetches the metrics from the external metrics API which are served by the New Relic metrics adapter. The New Relic metrics adapter receives the query including the nginx_average_requests metric name and all the selectors, and searches for a matching metric name in the internal memory based on the configured metrics. Then, it adds the selectors to the query to form a final query that is executed using NerdGraph to fetch the value from New Relic. The above example will generate a query like the following: FROM Metric SELECT average(nginx.server.net.requestsPerSecond) WHERE clusterName=<clusterName> AND `k8s.namespaceName`='nginx' SINCE 2 MINUTES AGO Copy Notice that a clusterName filter has been automatically added to the query to exclude metrics from other clusters in the same account. You can remove it by using the removeClusterFilter configuration parameter. Also the value is cached for a period of time defined by the cacheTTLSeconds configuration parameter, whose deafult is 30 seconds. Troubleshooting Get verbose logs Most common errors are displayed in the standard (non-verbose) logs. If you're doing a more in-depth investigation on your own or with New Relic Support, you can enable verbose mode. To get verbose logging details for an integration using Helm: Enable verbose logging: bash Copy $ helm upgrade -n <namespace> --reuse-values newrelic-bundle --set newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.verboseLog=true newrelic/nri-bundle Leave on verbose mode for a few minutes, or until enough activity has occurred. When you have the information you need, disable verbose logging: bash Copy $ helm upgrade --reuse-values newrelic-bundle --set newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.verboseLog=false newrelic/nri-bundle Caution Verbose mode increases significantly the amount of information sent to log files. Enable this mode temporarily, only for troubleshooting purposes, and reset the log level when finished. Get raw metrics Sometimes it's useful to get the list of available metrics and also to get the current value of an specific metric. To get the list of metrics available, run: bash Copy $ kubectl get --raw \"/apis/external.metrics.k8s.io/v1beta1/\" To get the value for a specific metric with a selector, run: bash Copy $ kubectl get --raw \"/apis/external.metrics.k8s.io/v1beta1/namespaces/*/<metric_name>?labelSelector=<selector_key>=<selector_value>\" Tip You must replace <metric_name>, <selector_key> and <selector_value> with your values. Metrics not working There are some usual errors that could cause a metric fail to retrieve the value. These errors are showed in the status of the metrics when you describe the HPA or are printed when you get the raw metrics directly. executing query: NRQL Syntax Error: Error at line...: The query that is being run has syntax errors. The same error message gives you the executed query and position of the error. You can try this query inside the New Relic query builder and correct the configuration from the adapter. extracting return value: expected first value to be of type \"float64\", got %!q(<nil>): The query doesn't return any value. The same error message gives you the executed query so you can try this query inside the New Relic query builder and correct the configuration from the adapter or the match selectors in the HPA.",

Update the manifest file. Learn about the limitations of the integration. Compatibility and requirements Before you install New Relic's Kubernetes integration, review the compatibility and requirements. Important When using containers in Windows, the container host version and the container image version must be the same. Our Kubernetes integration supports Windows versions 1809 and 1909. To check your Windows version: Open a command window. Run the following command: Reg Query \"HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\" /v ReleaseIdcmd.exe Copy Example: Get Kubernetes for Windows from a BusyBox container. $ kubectl exec -it busybox1-766bb4d6cc-rmsnj -- Reg Query \"HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\" /v ReleaseId Copy HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion ReleaseId REG_SZ 1809 Copy Install You can install the Kubernetes integration for Windows using Helm. See an example on how to install the integration in a cluster with nodes having different build versions of Windows (1809 and 2004): Install kube-state-metrics and run it in your cluster using this snippet: curl -L -o kube-state-metrics-1.9.5.zip https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/archive/v1.9.5.zip && unzip kube-state-metrics-1.9.5.zip && kubectl apply -f kube-state-metrics-1.9.5/examples/standard Copy Create a values.yml file with the follow data to be used by Helm: global: licenseKey: <YOUR_LICENSE_KEY> cluster: <YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME> enableLinux: false enableWindows: true windowsOsList: - version: 1809 imageTag: 2.2.0-windows-1809-alpha buildNumber: 10.0.17763 - version: 2004 imageTag: 2.2.0-windows-2004-alpha buildNumber: 10.0.19041 Copy Install the integration with: helm install <YOUR_INSTALL_NAME> newrelic/newrelic-infrastructure -f values.yml Copy Confirm that the DaemonSet has been created successfully by looking for newrelic-infra in the results generated by this command: kubectl get daemonsets Copy The Helm chart will create one DeamonSet per each version of Windows that is in the list and use NodeSelector to deploy the corresponding Pod per Node. Limitations The following limitations apply to the Kubernetes integration for Windows: The Windows agent only sends the Kubernetes samples (K8sNodeSample, K8sPodSample, etc.) SystemSample, StorageSample, NetworkSample, and ProcessSample are not generated. Some Kubernetes metrics are missing because the Windows kubelet doesn’t have them: Node: fsInodes: not sent fsInodesFree: not sent fsInodesUsed: not sent memoryMajorPageFaultsPerSecond: always returns zero as a value memoryPageFaults: always returns zero as a value memoryRssBytes: always returns zero as a value runtimeInodes: not sent runtimeInodesFree: not sent runtimeInodesUsed: not sent Pod: net.errorsPerSecond: not sent net.rxBytesPerSecond: not sent net.txBytesPerSecond: not sent Container: containerID: not sent containerImageID: not sent memoryUsedBytes: in the UI, this is displayed in the pod card that appears when you click on a pod, and will show no data. We will soon fix this by updating our charts to use memoryWorkingSetBytes instead. Volume: fsUsedBytes: zero, so fsUsedPercent is zero Known issues with the Windows Kubelet There are a couple of issues with the Windows version of Kubelet that can prevent the integration from fetching data: Issue 90554: This issue makes the Kubelet return 500 errors when the integration makes a request to the /stats/summary endpoint. It will be included in the Kubernetes 1.19 release and has been backported to the releases 1.16.11, 1.17.7, and 1.18.4. There is no solution on the integration side for this problem, we advise you to update to one of the patch versions as soon as possible. You can see if you're being affected by this problem by enabling verbose logs and looking for messages of the type: error querying Kubelet. Get \"https://<KUBELET_IP>/stats/summary\": error calling kubelet endpoint. Got status code: 500 Copy Issue 87730: This issue makes the Kubelet metrics very slow when running minimal load. It makes the integration fail with a timeout error. A patch for this issue has been added for Kubernetes 1.18 and backported to 1.15.12, 1.16.9, and 1.17.5. We advise you to update to one of the patch versions as soon as possible. To mitigate this issue you can increase the integration timeout with the TIMEOUT config option. You can see if you're being affected by this problem by enabling verbose logs and looking for messages of the type: error querying Kubelet.

It can also help you with installations in managed services or platforms, but you'll need to review a few preliminary notes before getting started. Our automated installer will generate either a helm command or a set of plain manifests for you to install. Our automated installer: Allows users to select the cluster name and namespace for the installation. Allows users to selectively enable or disable bundling of Kube-state-metrics, a dependency of the Kubernetes integration. Allows users to seamlessly install our other products related to Kubernetes such as: Kubernetes events monitoring In-cluster prometheus services monitoring Service instrumentation without code changes using Pixie Automatically fills the required properties with the license keys the integration needs to work. Read the install docs Start the installer Tip If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the automated installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Why it matters Governing the complexity of Kubernetes can be challenging; there's so much going on at any given moment, with containers being created and deleted in a matter of minutes, applications crashing, and resources being consumed unexpectedly. Our integration helps you navigate Kubernetes abstractions across on-premises, cloud, and hybrid deployments. In New Relic, you can build your own charts and query all your Kubernetes data, which our integration collects by instrumenting the container orchestration layer. This gives you additional insight into nodes, namespaces, deployments, replica sets, pods, and containers. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: Using the query builder you can turn any query on Kubernetes data to clear visuals. With the Kubernetes integration you can also: Link your APM data to Kubernetes to measure the performance of your web and mobile applications, with metrics such as request rate, throughput, error rate, and availability. Monitor services running on Kubernetes, such as Apache, NGINX, Cassandra, and many more (see our tutorial for monitoring Redis on Kubernetes). Create new alert policies and alert conditions based on your Kubernetes data, or extend the predefined alert conditions. These features are in addition to the data New Relic already reports for containerized processes running on instrumented hosts. Navigate all your Kubernetes events The Kubernetes events integration, which is installed separately, watches for events happening in your Kubernetes clusters and sends those events to New Relic. Events data is then visualized in the cluster explorer. To set it up, check the Kubernetes events box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer > Events: Browse and filter all your Kubernetes events, and dig into application logs and infrastructure data. Bring your cluster logs to New Relic Our Kubernetes plugin for log monitoring can collect all your cluster's logs and send them to our platform, so that you can set up new alerts and charts. To set it up, check the Log data box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or you can create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "BETA FEATURE This feature is still in development, but we encourage you to try it out! You can use metrics from your New Relic account to autoscale applications and services in your Kubernetes cluster by deploying the New Relic Metrics Adapter. This adapter fetches the metric values from New Relic and makes them available for the Horizontal Pod Autoscalers. The newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter implements the external.metrics.k8s.io API to support the use of external metrics based New Relic NRQL queries results. Once deployed, the value for each configured metric is fetched using the NerdGraph API based on the configured NRQL query. The metrics adapter exposes the metrics over a secured endpoint with TLS. New Relic metrics adapter in a cluster. Requirements Kubernetes 1.16 or higher. The New Relic Kubernetes integration. New Relic's user API key. No other External Metrics Adapter installed in the cluster. Installation To install the New Relic Metrics Adapter, we provide the newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter Helm chart, which is also included in the nri-bundle chart used to deploy all New Relic Kubernetes components. Install the New Relic Metrics Adapter by running the following command: helm upgrade --install newrelic newrelic/nri-bundle \\ --namespace newrelic --create-namespace \\ --set global.licenseKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY \\ --set global.cluster=K8S_CLUSTER_NAME \\ --set infrastructure.enabled=true \\ --set prometheus.enabled=true \\ --set webhook.enabled=true \\ --set ksm.enabled=true \\ --set kubeEvents.enabled=true \\ --set metrics-adapter.enabled=true \\ --set newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.personalAPIKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_PERSONAL_API_KEY \\ --set newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.config.accountID=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID \\ --set newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.config.externalMetrics.external_metric_name.query=NRQL query Copy Please notice and adjust the following flags: metrics-adapter.enabled: Must be set to true so the metrics adapter chart is installed. newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.personalAPIKey: Must be set to valid New Relic Personal API key. newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.accountID: Must be set to valid New Relic account where metrics are going to be fetched from. newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.config.externalMetrics.<var>external_metric_name</var>.<var>query</var>: Adds a new external metric where: <var>external_metric_name</var>: The metric name. <var>query</var>: The base NRQL query that is used to get the value for the metric. Tip Alternatively, you can use a values.yaml file that can be passed to the helm command with the --values flag. Values files can contain all parameters needed to configure the metrics explained in the configuration section. Configuration You can configure multiple metrics in the metrics adapter and change some parameters to modify the behaviour of the metrics cache and filtering. To see the full list and descriptions of all parameters that can be modified, refer to the chart README.md and values.yaml files. How it works The following values enable the metrics adapter on the nri-bundle chart installation: metrics-adapter: enabled: true newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter: personalAPIKey: <Personal API Key> config: accountID: <Account ID> externalMetrics: nginx_average_requests: query: \"FROM Metric SELECT average(nginx.server.net.requestsPerSecond) SINCE 2 MINUTES AGO\" Copy Caution The default time span for metrics is 1h. Therefore, you should define queries with the SINCE clause to adjust the time span according to your environment and needs. There is an HPA consuming the external metric as follows: kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler apiVersion: autoscaling/v2beta2 metadata: name: nginx-scaler spec: scaleTargetRef: apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment name: nginx minReplicas: 1 maxReplicas: 10 metrics: - type: External external: metric: name: nginx_average_requests selector: matchLabels: k8s.namespaceName: nginx target: type: Value value: 10000 Copy Based on the HPA definition, the controller manager fetches the metrics from the external metrics API which are served by the New Relic metrics adapter. The New Relic metrics adapter receives the query including the nginx_average_requests metric name and all the selectors, and searches for a matching metric name in the internal memory based on the configured metrics. Then, it adds the selectors to the query to form a final query that is executed using NerdGraph to fetch the value from New Relic. The above example will generate a query like the following: FROM Metric SELECT average(nginx.server.net.requestsPerSecond) WHERE clusterName=<clusterName> AND `k8s.namespaceName`='nginx' SINCE 2 MINUTES AGO Copy Notice that a clusterName filter has been automatically added to the query to exclude metrics from other clusters in the same account. You can remove it by using the removeClusterFilter configuration parameter. Also the value is cached for a period of time defined by the cacheTTLSeconds configuration parameter, whose deafult is 30 seconds. Troubleshooting Get verbose logs Most common errors are displayed in the standard (non-verbose) logs. If you're doing a more in-depth investigation on your own or with New Relic Support, you can enable verbose mode. To get verbose logging details for an integration using Helm: Enable verbose logging: bash Copy $ helm upgrade -n <namespace> --reuse-values newrelic-bundle --set newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.verboseLog=true newrelic/nri-bundle Leave on verbose mode for a few minutes, or until enough activity has occurred. When you have the information you need, disable verbose logging: bash Copy $ helm upgrade --reuse-values newrelic-bundle --set newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.verboseLog=false newrelic/nri-bundle Caution Verbose mode increases significantly the amount of information sent to log files. Enable this mode temporarily, only for troubleshooting purposes, and reset the log level when finished. Get raw metrics Sometimes it's useful to get the list of available metrics and also to get the current value of an specific metric. To get the list of metrics available, run: bash Copy $ kubectl get --raw \"/apis/external.metrics.k8s.io/v1beta1/\" To get the value for a specific metric with a selector, run: bash Copy $ kubectl get --raw \"/apis/external.metrics.k8s.io/v1beta1/namespaces/*/<metric_name>?labelSelector=<selector_key>=<selector_value>\" Tip You must replace <metric_name>, <selector_key> and <selector_value> with your values. Metrics not working There are some usual errors that could cause a metric fail to retrieve the value. These errors are showed in the status of the metrics when you describe the HPA or are printed when you get the raw metrics directly. executing query: NRQL Syntax Error: Error at line...: The query that is being run has syntax errors. The same error message gives you the executed query and position of the error. You can try this query inside the New Relic query builder and correct the configuration from the adapter. extracting return value: expected first value to be of type \"float64\", got %!q(<nil>): The query doesn't return any value. The same error message gives you the executed query so you can try this query inside the New Relic query builder and correct the configuration from the adapter or the match selectors in the HPA.",

When you have the information you need, disable verbose logging: bash Copy $ helm upgrade --reuse-values newrelic-bundle --set newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.verboseLog=false newrelic/nri-bundle Caution Verbose mode increases significantly the amount of information sent to log files. Enable this mode temporarily, only for troubleshooting purposes, and reset the log level when finished. Get raw metrics Sometimes it's useful to get the list of available metrics and also to get the current value of an specific metric. To get the list of metrics available, run: bash Copy $ kubectl get --raw \"/apis/external.metrics.k8s.io/v1beta1/\" To get the value for a specific metric with a selector, run: bash Copy $ kubectl get --raw \"/apis/external.metrics.k8s.io/v1beta1/namespaces/*/<metric_name>?labelSelector=<selector_key>=<selector_value>\" Tip You must replace <metric_name>, <selector_key> and <selector_value> with your values. Metrics not working There are some usual errors that could cause a metric fail to retrieve the value. These errors are showed in the status of the metrics when you describe the HPA or are printed when you get the raw metrics directly. executing query: NRQL Syntax Error: Error at line...: The query that is being run has syntax errors. The same error message gives you the executed query and position of the error.

Limitations The following limitations apply to the Kubernetes integration for Windows: The Windows agent only sends the Kubernetes samples (K8sNodeSample, K8sPodSample, etc.) SystemSample, StorageSample, NetworkSample, and ProcessSample are not generated. Some Kubernetes metrics are missing because the Windows kubelet doesn’t have them: Node: fsInodes: not sent fsInodesFree: not sent fsInodesUsed: not sent memoryMajorPageFaultsPerSecond: always returns zero as a value memoryPageFaults: always returns zero as a value memoryRssBytes: always returns zero as a value runtimeInodes: not sent runtimeInodesFree: not sent runtimeInodesUsed: not sent Pod: net.errorsPerSecond: not sent net.rxBytesPerSecond: not sent net.txBytesPerSecond: not sent Container: containerID: not sent containerImageID: not sent memoryUsedBytes: in the UI, this is displayed in the pod card that appears when you click on a pod, and will show no data. We will soon fix this by updating our charts to use memoryWorkingSetBytes instead. Volume: fsUsedBytes: zero, so fsUsedPercent is zero Known issues with the Windows Kubelet There are a couple of issues with the Windows version of Kubelet that can prevent the integration from fetching data: Issue 90554: This issue makes the Kubelet return 500 errors when the integration makes a request to the /stats/summary endpoint. It will be included in the Kubernetes 1.19 release and has been backported to the releases 1.16.11, 1.17.7, and 1.18.4. There is no solution on the integration side for this problem, we advise you to update to one of the patch versions as soon as possible. You can see if you're being affected by this problem by enabling verbose logs and looking for messages of the type: error querying Kubelet. Get \"https://<KUBELET_IP>/stats/summary\": error calling kubelet endpoint. Got status code: 500 Copy Issue 87730: This issue makes the Kubelet metrics very slow when running minimal load. It makes the integration fail with a timeout error. A patch for this issue has been added for Kubernetes 1.18 and backported to 1.15.12, 1.16.9, and 1.17.5. We advise you to update to one of the patch versions as soon as possible. To mitigate this issue you can increase the integration timeout with the TIMEOUT config option.

      "body": "New Relic's Kubernetes integration gives you full observability into the health and performance of your environment, no matter whether you run Kubernetes on-premises or in the cloud. With our cluster explorer, you can cut through layers of complexity to see how your cluster is performing, from the heights of the control plane down to applications running on a single pod. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer: The cluster explorer is our powerful, fully visual answer to the challenges associated with running Kubernetes at a large scale. You can see the power of the Kubernetes integration in the cluster explorer, where the full picture of a cluster is made available on a single screen: nodes and pods are visualized according to their health and performance, with pending and alerting nodes in the innermost circles. Predefined alert conditions help you troubleshoot issues right from the start. Clicking each node reveals its status and how each app is performing. Get started: Install the Kubernetes integration We have an automated installer to help you with many types of installations: servers, virtual machines, and unprivileged environments. It can also help you with installations in managed services or platforms, but you'll need to review a few preliminary notes before getting started. Our automated installer will generate either a helm command or a set of plain manifests for you to install. Our automated installer: Allows users to select the cluster name and namespace for the installation. Allows users to selectively enable or disable bundling of Kube-state-metrics, a dependency of the Kubernetes integration. Allows users to seamlessly install our other products related to Kubernetes such as: Kubernetes events monitoring In-cluster prometheus services monitoring Service instrumentation without code changes using Pixie Automatically fills the required properties with the license keys the integration needs to work. Read the install docs Start the installer Tip If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the automated installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Why it matters Governing the complexity of Kubernetes can be challenging; there's so much going on at any given moment, with containers being created and deleted in a matter of minutes, applications crashing, and resources being consumed unexpectedly. Our integration helps you navigate Kubernetes abstractions across on-premises, cloud, and hybrid deployments. In New Relic, you can build your own charts and query all your Kubernetes data, which our integration collects by instrumenting the container orchestration layer. This gives you additional insight into nodes, namespaces, deployments, replica sets, pods, and containers. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: Using the query builder you can turn any query on Kubernetes data to clear visuals. With the Kubernetes integration you can also: Link your APM data to Kubernetes to measure the performance of your web and mobile applications, with metrics such as request rate, throughput, error rate, and availability. Monitor services running on Kubernetes, such as Apache, NGINX, Cassandra, and many more (see our tutorial for monitoring Redis on Kubernetes). Create new alert policies and alert conditions based on your Kubernetes data, or extend the predefined alert conditions. These features are in addition to the data New Relic already reports for containerized processes running on instrumented hosts. Navigate all your Kubernetes events The Kubernetes events integration, which is installed separately, watches for events happening in your Kubernetes clusters and sends those events to New Relic. Events data is then visualized in the cluster explorer. To set it up, check the Kubernetes events box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer > Events: Browse and filter all your Kubernetes events, and dig into application logs and infrastructure data. Bring your cluster logs to New Relic Our Kubernetes plugin for log monitoring can collect all your cluster's logs and send them to our platform, so that you can set up new alerts and charts. To set it up, check the Log data box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or you can create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "BETA FEATURE This feature is still in development, but we encourage you to try it out! You can use metrics from your New Relic account to autoscale applications and services in your Kubernetes cluster by deploying the New Relic Metrics Adapter. This adapter fetches the metric values from New Relic and makes them available for the Horizontal Pod Autoscalers. The newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter implements the external.metrics.k8s.io API to support the use of external metrics based New Relic NRQL queries results. Once deployed, the value for each configured metric is fetched using the NerdGraph API based on the configured NRQL query. The metrics adapter exposes the metrics over a secured endpoint with TLS. New Relic metrics adapter in a cluster. Requirements Kubernetes 1.16 or higher. The New Relic Kubernetes integration. New Relic's user API key. No other External Metrics Adapter installed in the cluster. Installation To install the New Relic Metrics Adapter, we provide the newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter Helm chart, which is also included in the nri-bundle chart used to deploy all New Relic Kubernetes components. Install the New Relic Metrics Adapter by running the following command: helm upgrade --install newrelic newrelic/nri-bundle \\ --namespace newrelic --create-namespace \\ --set global.licenseKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY \\ --set global.cluster=K8S_CLUSTER_NAME \\ --set infrastructure.enabled=true \\ --set prometheus.enabled=true \\ --set webhook.enabled=true \\ --set ksm.enabled=true \\ --set kubeEvents.enabled=true \\ --set metrics-adapter.enabled=true \\ --set newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.personalAPIKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_PERSONAL_API_KEY \\ --set newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.config.accountID=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID \\ --set newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.config.externalMetrics.external_metric_name.query=NRQL query Copy Please notice and adjust the following flags: metrics-adapter.enabled: Must be set to true so the metrics adapter chart is installed. newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.personalAPIKey: Must be set to valid New Relic Personal API key. newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.accountID: Must be set to valid New Relic account where metrics are going to be fetched from. newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.config.externalMetrics.<var>external_metric_name</var>.<var>query</var>: Adds a new external metric where: <var>external_metric_name</var>: The metric name. <var>query</var>: The base NRQL query that is used to get the value for the metric. Tip Alternatively, you can use a values.yaml file that can be passed to the helm command with the --values flag. Values files can contain all parameters needed to configure the metrics explained in the configuration section. Configuration You can configure multiple metrics in the metrics adapter and change some parameters to modify the behaviour of the metrics cache and filtering. To see the full list and descriptions of all parameters that can be modified, refer to the chart README.md and values.yaml files. How it works The following values enable the metrics adapter on the nri-bundle chart installation: metrics-adapter: enabled: true newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter: personalAPIKey: <Personal API Key> config: accountID: <Account ID> externalMetrics: nginx_average_requests: query: \"FROM Metric SELECT average(nginx.server.net.requestsPerSecond) SINCE 2 MINUTES AGO\" Copy Caution The default time span for metrics is 1h. Therefore, you should define queries with the SINCE clause to adjust the time span according to your environment and needs. There is an HPA consuming the external metric as follows: kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler apiVersion: autoscaling/v2beta2 metadata: name: nginx-scaler spec: scaleTargetRef: apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment name: nginx minReplicas: 1 maxReplicas: 10 metrics: - type: External external: metric: name: nginx_average_requests selector: matchLabels: k8s.namespaceName: nginx target: type: Value value: 10000 Copy Based on the HPA definition, the controller manager fetches the metrics from the external metrics API which are served by the New Relic metrics adapter. The New Relic metrics adapter receives the query including the nginx_average_requests metric name and all the selectors, and searches for a matching metric name in the internal memory based on the configured metrics. Then, it adds the selectors to the query to form a final query that is executed using NerdGraph to fetch the value from New Relic. The above example will generate a query like the following: FROM Metric SELECT average(nginx.server.net.requestsPerSecond) WHERE clusterName=<clusterName> AND `k8s.namespaceName`='nginx' SINCE 2 MINUTES AGO Copy Notice that a clusterName filter has been automatically added to the query to exclude metrics from other clusters in the same account. You can remove it by using the removeClusterFilter configuration parameter. Also the value is cached for a period of time defined by the cacheTTLSeconds configuration parameter, whose deafult is 30 seconds. Troubleshooting Get verbose logs Most common errors are displayed in the standard (non-verbose) logs. If you're doing a more in-depth investigation on your own or with New Relic Support, you can enable verbose mode. To get verbose logging details for an integration using Helm: Enable verbose logging: bash Copy $ helm upgrade -n <namespace> --reuse-values newrelic-bundle --set newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.verboseLog=true newrelic/nri-bundle Leave on verbose mode for a few minutes, or until enough activity has occurred. When you have the information you need, disable verbose logging: bash Copy $ helm upgrade --reuse-values newrelic-bundle --set newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.verboseLog=false newrelic/nri-bundle Caution Verbose mode increases significantly the amount of information sent to log files. Enable this mode temporarily, only for troubleshooting purposes, and reset the log level when finished. Get raw metrics Sometimes it's useful to get the list of available metrics and also to get the current value of an specific metric. To get the list of metrics available, run: bash Copy $ kubectl get --raw \"/apis/external.metrics.k8s.io/v1beta1/\" To get the value for a specific metric with a selector, run: bash Copy $ kubectl get --raw \"/apis/external.metrics.k8s.io/v1beta1/namespaces/*/<metric_name>?labelSelector=<selector_key>=<selector_value>\" Tip You must replace <metric_name>, <selector_key> and <selector_value> with your values. Metrics not working There are some usual errors that could cause a metric fail to retrieve the value. These errors are showed in the status of the metrics when you describe the HPA or are printed when you get the raw metrics directly. executing query: NRQL Syntax Error: Error at line...: The query that is being run has syntax errors. The same error message gives you the executed query and position of the error. You can try this query inside the New Relic query builder and correct the configuration from the adapter. extracting return value: expected first value to be of type \"float64\", got %!q(<nil>): The query doesn't return any value.

Limitations The following limitations apply to the Kubernetes integration for Windows: The Windows agent only sends the Kubernetes samples (K8sNodeSample, K8sPodSample, etc.) SystemSample, StorageSample, NetworkSample, and ProcessSample are not generated. Some Kubernetes metrics are missing because the Windows kubelet doesn’t have them: Node: fsInodes: not sent fsInodesFree: not sent fsInodesUsed: not sent memoryMajorPageFaultsPerSecond: always returns zero as a value memoryPageFaults: always returns zero as a value memoryRssBytes: always returns zero as a value runtimeInodes: not sent runtimeInodesFree: not sent runtimeInodesUsed: not sent Pod: net.errorsPerSecond: not sent net.rxBytesPerSecond: not sent net.txBytesPerSecond: not sent Container: containerID: not sent containerImageID: not sent memoryUsedBytes: in the UI, this is displayed in the pod card that appears when you click on a pod, and will show no data. We will soon fix this by updating our charts to use memoryWorkingSetBytes instead. Volume: fsUsedBytes: zero, so fsUsedPercent is zero Known issues with the Windows Kubelet There are a couple of issues with the Windows version of Kubelet that can prevent the integration from fetching data: Issue 90554: This issue makes the Kubelet return 500 errors when the integration makes a request to the /stats/summary endpoint. It will be included in the Kubernetes 1.19 release and has been backported to the releases 1.16.11, 1.17.7, and 1.18.4. There is no solution on the integration side for this problem, we advise you to update to one of the patch versions as soon as possible. You can see if you're being affected by this problem by enabling verbose logs and looking for messages of the type: error querying Kubelet. Get \"https://<KUBELET_IP>/stats/summary\": error calling kubelet endpoint. Got status code: 500 Copy Issue 87730: This issue makes the Kubelet metrics very slow when running minimal load. It makes the integration fail with a timeout error. A patch for this issue has been added for Kubernetes 1.18 and backported to 1.15.12, 1.16.9, and 1.17.5. We advise you to update to one of the patch versions as soon as possible. To mitigate this issue you can increase the integration timeout with the TIMEOUT config option.

      "body": "New Relic's Kubernetes integration gives you full observability into the health and performance of your environment, no matter whether you run Kubernetes on-premises or in the cloud. With our cluster explorer, you can cut through layers of complexity to see how your cluster is performing, from the heights of the control plane down to applications running on a single pod. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer: The cluster explorer is our powerful, fully visual answer to the challenges associated with running Kubernetes at a large scale. You can see the power of the Kubernetes integration in the cluster explorer, where the full picture of a cluster is made available on a single screen: nodes and pods are visualized according to their health and performance, with pending and alerting nodes in the innermost circles. Predefined alert conditions help you troubleshoot issues right from the start. Clicking each node reveals its status and how each app is performing. Get started: Install the Kubernetes integration We have an automated installer to help you with many types of installations: servers, virtual machines, and unprivileged environments. It can also help you with installations in managed services or platforms, but you'll need to review a few preliminary notes before getting started. Our automated installer will generate either a helm command or a set of plain manifests for you to install. Our automated installer: Allows users to select the cluster name and namespace for the installation. Allows users to selectively enable or disable bundling of Kube-state-metrics, a dependency of the Kubernetes integration. Allows users to seamlessly install our other products related to Kubernetes such as: Kubernetes events monitoring In-cluster prometheus services monitoring Service instrumentation without code changes using Pixie Automatically fills the required properties with the license keys the integration needs to work. Read the install docs Start the installer Tip If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the automated installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Why it matters Governing the complexity of Kubernetes can be challenging; there's so much going on at any given moment, with containers being created and deleted in a matter of minutes, applications crashing, and resources being consumed unexpectedly. Our integration helps you navigate Kubernetes abstractions across on-premises, cloud, and hybrid deployments. In New Relic, you can build your own charts and query all your Kubernetes data, which our integration collects by instrumenting the container orchestration layer. This gives you additional insight into nodes, namespaces, deployments, replica sets, pods, and containers. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: Using the query builder you can turn any query on Kubernetes data to clear visuals. With the Kubernetes integration you can also: Link your APM data to Kubernetes to measure the performance of your web and mobile applications, with metrics such as request rate, throughput, error rate, and availability. Monitor services running on Kubernetes, such as Apache, NGINX, Cassandra, and many more (see our tutorial for monitoring Redis on Kubernetes). Create new alert policies and alert conditions based on your Kubernetes data, or extend the predefined alert conditions. These features are in addition to the data New Relic already reports for containerized processes running on instrumented hosts. Navigate all your Kubernetes events The Kubernetes events integration, which is installed separately, watches for events happening in your Kubernetes clusters and sends those events to New Relic. Events data is then visualized in the cluster explorer. To set it up, check the Kubernetes events box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer > Events: Browse and filter all your Kubernetes events, and dig into application logs and infrastructure data. Bring your cluster logs to New Relic Our Kubernetes plugin for log monitoring can collect all your cluster's logs and send them to our platform, so that you can set up new alerts and charts. To set it up, check the Log data box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or you can create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "BETA FEATURE This feature is still in development, but we encourage you to try it out! You can use metrics from your New Relic account to autoscale applications and services in your Kubernetes cluster by deploying the New Relic Metrics Adapter. This adapter fetches the metric values from New Relic and makes them available for the Horizontal Pod Autoscalers. The newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter implements the external.metrics.k8s.io API to support the use of external metrics based New Relic NRQL queries results. Once deployed, the value for each configured metric is fetched using the NerdGraph API based on the configured NRQL query. The metrics adapter exposes the metrics over a secured endpoint with TLS. New Relic metrics adapter in a cluster. Requirements Kubernetes 1.16 or higher. The New Relic Kubernetes integration. New Relic's user API key. No other External Metrics Adapter installed in the cluster. Installation To install the New Relic Metrics Adapter, we provide the newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter Helm chart, which is also included in the nri-bundle chart used to deploy all New Relic Kubernetes components. Install the New Relic Metrics Adapter by running the following command: helm upgrade --install newrelic newrelic/nri-bundle \\ --namespace newrelic --create-namespace \\ --set global.licenseKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY \\ --set global.cluster=K8S_CLUSTER_NAME \\ --set infrastructure.enabled=true \\ --set prometheus.enabled=true \\ --set webhook.enabled=true \\ --set ksm.enabled=true \\ --set kubeEvents.enabled=true \\ --set metrics-adapter.enabled=true \\ --set newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.personalAPIKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_PERSONAL_API_KEY \\ --set newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.config.accountID=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID \\ --set newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.config.externalMetrics.external_metric_name.query=NRQL query Copy Please notice and adjust the following flags: metrics-adapter.enabled: Must be set to true so the metrics adapter chart is installed. newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.personalAPIKey: Must be set to valid New Relic Personal API key. newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.accountID: Must be set to valid New Relic account where metrics are going to be fetched from. newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.config.externalMetrics.<var>external_metric_name</var>.<var>query</var>: Adds a new external metric where: <var>external_metric_name</var>: The metric name. <var>query</var>: The base NRQL query that is used to get the value for the metric. Tip Alternatively, you can use a values.yaml file that can be passed to the helm command with the --values flag. Values files can contain all parameters needed to configure the metrics explained in the configuration section. Configuration You can configure multiple metrics in the metrics adapter and change some parameters to modify the behaviour of the metrics cache and filtering. To see the full list and descriptions of all parameters that can be modified, refer to the chart README.md and values.yaml files. How it works The following values enable the metrics adapter on the nri-bundle chart installation: metrics-adapter: enabled: true newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter: personalAPIKey: <Personal API Key> config: accountID: <Account ID> externalMetrics: nginx_average_requests: query: \"FROM Metric SELECT average(nginx.server.net.requestsPerSecond) SINCE 2 MINUTES AGO\" Copy Caution The default time span for metrics is 1h. Therefore, you should define queries with the SINCE clause to adjust the time span according to your environment and needs. There is an HPA consuming the external metric as follows: kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler apiVersion: autoscaling/v2beta2 metadata: name: nginx-scaler spec: scaleTargetRef: apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment name: nginx minReplicas: 1 maxReplicas: 10 metrics: - type: External external: metric: name: nginx_average_requests selector: matchLabels: k8s.namespaceName: nginx target: type: Value value: 10000 Copy Based on the HPA definition, the controller manager fetches the metrics from the external metrics API which are served by the New Relic metrics adapter. The New Relic metrics adapter receives the query including the nginx_average_requests metric name and all the selectors, and searches for a matching metric name in the internal memory based on the configured metrics. Then, it adds the selectors to the query to form a final query that is executed using NerdGraph to fetch the value from New Relic. The above example will generate a query like the following: FROM Metric SELECT average(nginx.server.net.requestsPerSecond) WHERE clusterName=<clusterName> AND `k8s.namespaceName`='nginx' SINCE 2 MINUTES AGO Copy Notice that a clusterName filter has been automatically added to the query to exclude metrics from other clusters in the same account. You can remove it by using the removeClusterFilter configuration parameter. Also the value is cached for a period of time defined by the cacheTTLSeconds configuration parameter, whose deafult is 30 seconds. Troubleshooting Get verbose logs Most common errors are displayed in the standard (non-verbose) logs. If you're doing a more in-depth investigation on your own or with New Relic Support, you can enable verbose mode. To get verbose logging details for an integration using Helm: Enable verbose logging: bash Copy $ helm upgrade -n <namespace> --reuse-values newrelic-bundle --set newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.verboseLog=true newrelic/nri-bundle Leave on verbose mode for a few minutes, or until enough activity has occurred. When you have the information you need, disable verbose logging: bash Copy $ helm upgrade --reuse-values newrelic-bundle --set newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.verboseLog=false newrelic/nri-bundle Caution Verbose mode increases significantly the amount of information sent to log files. Enable this mode temporarily, only for troubleshooting purposes, and reset the log level when finished. Get raw metrics Sometimes it's useful to get the list of available metrics and also to get the current value of an specific metric. To get the list of metrics available, run: bash Copy $ kubectl get --raw \"/apis/external.metrics.k8s.io/v1beta1/\" To get the value for a specific metric with a selector, run: bash Copy $ kubectl get --raw \"/apis/external.metrics.k8s.io/v1beta1/namespaces/*/<metric_name>?labelSelector=<selector_key>=<selector_value>\" Tip You must replace <metric_name>, <selector_key> and <selector_value> with your values. Metrics not working There are some usual errors that could cause a metric fail to retrieve the value. These errors are showed in the status of the metrics when you describe the HPA or are printed when you get the raw metrics directly. executing query: NRQL Syntax Error: Error at line...: The query that is being run has syntax errors. The same error message gives you the executed query and position of the error. You can try this query inside the New Relic query builder and correct the configuration from the adapter. extracting return value: expected first value to be of type \"float64\", got %!q(<nil>): The query doesn't return any value. The same error message gives you the executed query so you can try this query inside the New Relic query builder and correct the configuration from the adapter or the match selectors in the HPA.",

      "body": "New Relic's Kubernetes integration gives you full observability into the health and performance of your environment, no matter whether you run Kubernetes on-premises or in the cloud. With our cluster explorer, you can cut through layers of complexity to see how your cluster is performing, from the heights of the control plane down to applications running on a single pod. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer: The cluster explorer is our powerful, fully visual answer to the challenges associated with running Kubernetes at a large scale. You can see the power of the Kubernetes integration in the cluster explorer, where the full picture of a cluster is made available on a single screen: nodes and pods are visualized according to their health and performance, with pending and alerting nodes in the innermost circles. Predefined alert conditions help you troubleshoot issues right from the start. Clicking each node reveals its status and how each app is performing. Get started: Install the Kubernetes integration We have an automated installer to help you with many types of installations: servers, virtual machines, and unprivileged environments. It can also help you with installations in managed services or platforms, but you'll need to review a few preliminary notes before getting started. Our automated installer will generate either a helm command or a set of plain manifests for you to install. Our automated installer: Allows users to select the cluster name and namespace for the installation. Allows users to selectively enable or disable bundling of Kube-state-metrics, a dependency of the Kubernetes integration. Allows users to seamlessly install our other products related to Kubernetes such as: Kubernetes events monitoring In-cluster prometheus services monitoring Service instrumentation without code changes using Pixie Automatically fills the required properties with the license keys the integration needs to work. Read the install docs Start the installer Tip If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the automated installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Why it matters Governing the complexity of Kubernetes can be challenging; there's so much going on at any given moment, with containers being created and deleted in a matter of minutes, applications crashing, and resources being consumed unexpectedly. Our integration helps you navigate Kubernetes abstractions across on-premises, cloud, and hybrid deployments. In New Relic, you can build your own charts and query all your Kubernetes data, which our integration collects by instrumenting the container orchestration layer. This gives you additional insight into nodes, namespaces, deployments, replica sets, pods, and containers. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: Using the query builder you can turn any query on Kubernetes data to clear visuals. With the Kubernetes integration you can also: Link your APM data to Kubernetes to measure the performance of your web and mobile applications, with metrics such as request rate, throughput, error rate, and availability. Monitor services running on Kubernetes, such as Apache, NGINX, Cassandra, and many more (see our tutorial for monitoring Redis on Kubernetes). Create new alert policies and alert conditions based on your Kubernetes data, or extend the predefined alert conditions. These features are in addition to the data New Relic already reports for containerized processes running on instrumented hosts. Navigate all your Kubernetes events The Kubernetes events integration, which is installed separately, watches for events happening in your Kubernetes clusters and sends those events to New Relic. Events data is then visualized in the cluster explorer. To set it up, check the Kubernetes events box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer > Events: Browse and filter all your Kubernetes events, and dig into application logs and infrastructure data. Bring your cluster logs to New Relic Our Kubernetes plugin for log monitoring can collect all your cluster's logs and send them to our platform, so that you can set up new alerts and charts. To set it up, check the Log data box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or you can create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "BETA FEATURE This feature is still in development, but we encourage you to try it out! You can use metrics from your New Relic account to autoscale applications and services in your Kubernetes cluster by deploying the New Relic Metrics Adapter. This adapter fetches the metric values from New Relic and makes them available for the Horizontal Pod Autoscalers. The newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter implements the external.metrics.k8s.io API to support the use of external metrics based New Relic NRQL queries results. Once deployed, the value for each configured metric is fetched using the NerdGraph API based on the configured NRQL query. The metrics adapter exposes the metrics over a secured endpoint with TLS. New Relic metrics adapter in a cluster. Requirements Kubernetes 1.16 or higher. The New Relic Kubernetes integration. New Relic's user API key. No other External Metrics Adapter installed in the cluster. Installation To install the New Relic Metrics Adapter, we provide the newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter Helm chart, which is also included in the nri-bundle chart used to deploy all New Relic Kubernetes components. Install the New Relic Metrics Adapter by running the following command: helm upgrade --install newrelic newrelic/nri-bundle \\ --namespace newrelic --create-namespace \\ --set global.licenseKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY \\ --set global.cluster=K8S_CLUSTER_NAME \\ --set infrastructure.enabled=true \\ --set prometheus.enabled=true \\ --set webhook.enabled=true \\ --set ksm.enabled=true \\ --set kubeEvents.enabled=true \\ --set metrics-adapter.enabled=true \\ --set newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.personalAPIKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_PERSONAL_API_KEY \\ --set newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.config.accountID=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID \\ --set newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.config.externalMetrics.external_metric_name.query=NRQL query Copy Please notice and adjust the following flags: metrics-adapter.enabled: Must be set to true so the metrics adapter chart is installed. newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.personalAPIKey: Must be set to valid New Relic Personal API key. newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.accountID: Must be set to valid New Relic account where metrics are going to be fetched from. newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.config.externalMetrics.<var>external_metric_name</var>.<var>query</var>: Adds a new external metric where: <var>external_metric_name</var>: The metric name. <var>query</var>: The base NRQL query that is used to get the value for the metric. Tip Alternatively, you can use a values.yaml file that can be passed to the helm command with the --values flag. Values files can contain all parameters needed to configure the metrics explained in the configuration section. Configuration You can configure multiple metrics in the metrics adapter and change some parameters to modify the behaviour of the metrics cache and filtering. To see the full list and descriptions of all parameters that can be modified, refer to the chart README.md and values.yaml files. How it works The following values enable the metrics adapter on the nri-bundle chart installation: metrics-adapter: enabled: true newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter: personalAPIKey: <Personal API Key> config: accountID: <Account ID> externalMetrics: nginx_average_requests: query: \"FROM Metric SELECT average(nginx.server.net.requestsPerSecond) SINCE 2 MINUTES AGO\" Copy Caution The default time span for metrics is 1h. Therefore, you should define queries with the SINCE clause to adjust the time span according to your environment and needs. There is an HPA consuming the external metric as follows: kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler apiVersion: autoscaling/v2beta2 metadata: name: nginx-scaler spec: scaleTargetRef: apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment name: nginx minReplicas: 1 maxReplicas: 10 metrics: - type: External external: metric: name: nginx_average_requests selector: matchLabels: k8s.namespaceName: nginx target: type: Value value: 10000 Copy Based on the HPA definition, the controller manager fetches the metrics from the external metrics API which are served by the New Relic metrics adapter. The New Relic metrics adapter receives the query including the nginx_average_requests metric name and all the selectors, and searches for a matching metric name in the internal memory based on the configured metrics. Then, it adds the selectors to the query to form a final query that is executed using NerdGraph to fetch the value from New Relic. The above example will generate a query like the following: FROM Metric SELECT average(nginx.server.net.requestsPerSecond) WHERE clusterName=<clusterName> AND `k8s.namespaceName`='nginx' SINCE 2 MINUTES AGO Copy Notice that a clusterName filter has been automatically added to the query to exclude metrics from other clusters in the same account. You can remove it by using the removeClusterFilter configuration parameter. Also the value is cached for a period of time defined by the cacheTTLSeconds configuration parameter, whose deafult is 30 seconds. Troubleshooting Get verbose logs Most common errors are displayed in the standard (non-verbose) logs. If you're doing a more in-depth investigation on your own or with New Relic Support, you can enable verbose mode. To get verbose logging details for an integration using Helm: Enable verbose logging: bash Copy $ helm upgrade -n <namespace> --reuse-values newrelic-bundle --set newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.verboseLog=true newrelic/nri-bundle Leave on verbose mode for a few minutes, or until enough activity has occurred. When you have the information you need, disable verbose logging: bash Copy $ helm upgrade --reuse-values newrelic-bundle --set newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.verboseLog=false newrelic/nri-bundle Caution Verbose mode increases significantly the amount of information sent to log files. Enable this mode temporarily, only for troubleshooting purposes, and reset the log level when finished. Get raw metrics Sometimes it's useful to get the list of available metrics and also to get the current value of an specific metric. To get the list of metrics available, run: bash Copy $ kubectl get --raw \"/apis/external.metrics.k8s.io/v1beta1/\" To get the value for a specific metric with a selector, run: bash Copy $ kubectl get --raw \"/apis/external.metrics.k8s.io/v1beta1/namespaces/*/<metric_name>?labelSelector=<selector_key>=<selector_value>\" Tip You must replace <metric_name>, <selector_key> and <selector_value> with your values. Metrics not working There are some usual errors that could cause a metric fail to retrieve the value. These errors are showed in the status of the metrics when you describe the HPA or are printed when you get the raw metrics directly. executing query: NRQL Syntax Error: Error at line...: The query that is being run has syntax errors. The same error message gives you the executed query and position of the error. You can try this query inside the New Relic query builder and correct the configuration from the adapter. extracting return value: expected first value to be of type \"float64\", got %!q(<nil>): The query doesn't return any value. The same error message gives you the executed query so you can try this query inside the New Relic query builder and correct the configuration from the adapter or the match selectors in the HPA.",

Update the manifest file. Learn about the limitations of the integration. Compatibility and requirements Before you install New Relic's Kubernetes integration, review the compatibility and requirements. Important When using containers in Windows, the container host version and the container image version must be the same. Our Kubernetes integration supports Windows versions 1809 and 1909. To check your Windows version: Open a command window. Run the following command: Reg Query \"HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\" /v ReleaseIdcmd.exe Copy Example: Get Kubernetes for Windows from a BusyBox container. $ kubectl exec -it busybox1-766bb4d6cc-rmsnj -- Reg Query \"HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\" /v ReleaseId Copy HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion ReleaseId REG_SZ 1809 Copy Install You can install the Kubernetes integration for Windows using Helm. See an example on how to install the integration in a cluster with nodes having different build versions of Windows (1809 and 2004): Install kube-state-metrics and run it in your cluster using this snippet: curl -L -o kube-state-metrics-1.9.5.zip https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/archive/v1.9.5.zip && unzip kube-state-metrics-1.9.5.zip && kubectl apply -f kube-state-metrics-1.9.5/examples/standard Copy Create a values.yml file with the follow data to be used by Helm: global: licenseKey: <YOUR_LICENSE_KEY> cluster: <YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME> enableLinux: false enableWindows: true windowsOsList: - version: 1809 imageTag: 2.2.0-windows-1809-alpha buildNumber: 10.0.17763 - version: 2004 imageTag: 2.2.0-windows-2004-alpha buildNumber: 10.0.19041 Copy Install the integration with: helm install <YOUR_INSTALL_NAME> newrelic/newrelic-infrastructure -f values.yml Copy Confirm that the DaemonSet has been created successfully by looking for newrelic-infra in the results generated by this command: kubectl get daemonsets Copy The Helm chart will create one DeamonSet per each version of Windows that is in the list and use NodeSelector to deploy the corresponding Pod per Node. Limitations The following limitations apply to the Kubernetes integration for Windows: The Windows agent only sends the Kubernetes samples (K8sNodeSample, K8sPodSample, etc.) SystemSample, StorageSample, NetworkSample, and ProcessSample are not generated. Some Kubernetes metrics are missing because the Windows kubelet doesn’t have them: Node: fsInodes: not sent fsInodesFree: not sent fsInodesUsed: not sent memoryMajorPageFaultsPerSecond: always returns zero as a value memoryPageFaults: always returns zero as a value memoryRssBytes: always returns zero as a value runtimeInodes: not sent runtimeInodesFree: not sent runtimeInodesUsed: not sent Pod: net.errorsPerSecond: not sent net.rxBytesPerSecond: not sent net.txBytesPerSecond: not sent Container: containerID: not sent containerImageID: not sent memoryUsedBytes: in the UI, this is displayed in the pod card that appears when you click on a pod, and will show no data. We will soon fix this by updating our charts to use memoryWorkingSetBytes instead. Volume: fsUsedBytes: zero, so fsUsedPercent is zero Known issues with the Windows Kubelet There are a couple of issues with the Windows version of Kubelet that can prevent the integration from fetching data: Issue 90554: This issue makes the Kubelet return 500 errors when the integration makes a request to the /stats/summary endpoint. It will be included in the Kubernetes 1.19 release and has been backported to the releases 1.16.11, 1.17.7, and 1.18.4. There is no solution on the integration side for this problem, we advise you to update to one of the patch versions as soon as possible. You can see if you're being affected by this problem by enabling verbose logs and looking for messages of the type: error querying Kubelet. Get \"https://<KUBELET_IP>/stats/summary\": error calling kubelet endpoint. Got status code: 500 Copy Issue 87730: This issue makes the Kubelet metrics very slow when running minimal load. It makes the integration fail with a timeout error. A patch for this issue has been added for Kubernetes 1.18 and backported to 1.15.12, 1.16.9, and 1.17.5. We advise you to update to one of the patch versions as soon as possible. To mitigate this issue you can increase the integration timeout with the TIMEOUT config option. You can see if you're being affected by this problem by enabling verbose logs and looking for messages of the type: error querying Kubelet. Get \"https://<KUBELET_IP>/stats/summary\": context deadline exceeded (Client.Timeout exceeded while awaiting headers) Copy",

Update the manifest file. Learn about the limitations of the integration. Compatibility and requirements Before you install New Relic's Kubernetes integration, review the compatibility and requirements. Important When using containers in Windows, the container host version and the container image version must be the same. Our Kubernetes integration supports Windows versions 1809 and 1909. To check your Windows version: Open a command window. Run the following command: Reg Query \"HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\" /v ReleaseIdcmd.exe Copy Example: Get Kubernetes for Windows from a BusyBox container. $ kubectl exec -it busybox1-766bb4d6cc-rmsnj -- Reg Query \"HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\" /v ReleaseId Copy HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion ReleaseId REG_SZ 1809 Copy Install You can install the Kubernetes integration for Windows using Helm. See an example on how to install the integration in a cluster with nodes having different build versions of Windows (1809 and 2004): Install kube-state-metrics and run it in your cluster using this snippet: curl -L -o kube-state-metrics-1.9.5.zip https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/archive/v1.9.5.zip && unzip kube-state-metrics-1.9.5.zip && kubectl apply -f kube-state-metrics-1.9.5/examples/standard Copy Create a values.yml file with the follow data to be used by Helm: global: licenseKey: <YOUR_LICENSE_KEY> cluster: <YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME> enableLinux: false enableWindows: true windowsOsList: - version: 1809 imageTag: 2.2.0-windows-1809-alpha buildNumber: 10.0.17763 - version: 2004 imageTag: 2.2.0-windows-2004-alpha buildNumber: 10.0.19041 Copy Install the integration with: helm install <YOUR_INSTALL_NAME> newrelic/newrelic-infrastructure -f values.yml Copy Confirm that the DaemonSet has been created successfully by looking for newrelic-infra in the results generated by this command: kubectl get daemonsets Copy The Helm chart will create one DeamonSet per each version of Windows that is in the list and use NodeSelector to deploy the corresponding Pod per Node. Limitations The following limitations apply to the Kubernetes integration for Windows: The Windows agent only sends the Kubernetes samples (K8sNodeSample, K8sPodSample, etc.) SystemSample, StorageSample, NetworkSample, and ProcessSample are not generated. Some Kubernetes metrics are missing because the Windows kubelet doesn’t have them: Node: fsInodes: not sent fsInodesFree: not sent fsInodesUsed: not sent memoryMajorPageFaultsPerSecond: always returns zero as a value memoryPageFaults: always returns zero as a value memoryRssBytes: always returns zero as a value runtimeInodes: not sent runtimeInodesFree: not sent runtimeInodesUsed: not sent Pod: net.errorsPerSecond: not sent net.rxBytesPerSecond: not sent net.txBytesPerSecond: not sent Container: containerID: not sent containerImageID: not sent memoryUsedBytes: in the UI, this is displayed in the pod card that appears when you click on a pod, and will show no data. We will soon fix this by updating our charts to use memoryWorkingSetBytes instead. Volume: fsUsedBytes: zero, so fsUsedPercent is zero Known issues with the Windows Kubelet There are a couple of issues with the Windows version of Kubelet that can prevent the integration from fetching data: Issue 90554: This issue makes the Kubelet return 500 errors when the integration makes a request to the /stats/summary endpoint. It will be included in the Kubernetes 1.19 release and has been backported to the releases 1.16.11, 1.17.7, and 1.18.4. There is no solution on the integration side for this problem, we advise you to update to one of the patch versions as soon as possible. You can see if you're being affected by this problem by enabling verbose logs and looking for messages of the type: error querying Kubelet. Get \"https://<KUBELET_IP>/stats/summary\": error calling kubelet endpoint. Got status code: 500 Copy Issue 87730: This issue makes the Kubelet metrics very slow when running minimal load. It makes the integration fail with a timeout error. A patch for this issue has been added for Kubernetes 1.18 and backported to 1.15.12, 1.16.9, and 1.17.5. We advise you to update to one of the patch versions as soon as possible. To mitigate this issue you can increase the integration timeout with the TIMEOUT config option. You can see if you're being affected by this problem by enabling verbose logs and looking for messages of the type: error querying Kubelet. Get \"https://<KUBELET_IP>/stats/summary\": context deadline exceeded (Client.Timeout exceeded while awaiting headers) Copy",

      "body": "BETA FEATURE This feature is still in development, but we encourage you to try it out! You can use metrics from your New Relic account to autoscale applications and services in your Kubernetes cluster by deploying the New Relic Metrics Adapter. This adapter fetches the metric values from New Relic and makes them available for the Horizontal Pod Autoscalers. The newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter implements the external.metrics.k8s.io API to support the use of external metrics based New Relic NRQL queries results. Once deployed, the value for each configured metric is fetched using the NerdGraph API based on the configured NRQL query. The metrics adapter exposes the metrics over a secured endpoint with TLS. New Relic metrics adapter in a cluster. Requirements Kubernetes 1.16 or higher. The New Relic Kubernetes integration. New Relic's user API key. No other External Metrics Adapter installed in the cluster. Installation To install the New Relic Metrics Adapter, we provide the newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter Helm chart, which is also included in the nri-bundle chart used to deploy all New Relic Kubernetes components. Install the New Relic Metrics Adapter by running the following command: helm upgrade --install newrelic newrelic/nri-bundle \\ --namespace newrelic --create-namespace \\ --set global.licenseKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY \\ --set global.cluster=K8S_CLUSTER_NAME \\ --set infrastructure.enabled=true \\ --set prometheus.enabled=true \\ --set webhook.enabled=true \\ --set ksm.enabled=true \\ --set kubeEvents.enabled=true \\ --set metrics-adapter.enabled=true \\ --set newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.personalAPIKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_PERSONAL_API_KEY \\ --set newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.config.accountID=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID \\ --set newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.config.externalMetrics.external_metric_name.query=NRQL query Copy Please notice and adjust the following flags: metrics-adapter.enabled: Must be set to true so the metrics adapter chart is installed. newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.personalAPIKey: Must be set to valid New Relic Personal API key. newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.accountID: Must be set to valid New Relic account where metrics are going to be fetched from. newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.config.externalMetrics.<var>external_metric_name</var>.<var>query</var>: Adds a new external metric where: <var>external_metric_name</var>: The metric name. <var>query</var>: The base NRQL query that is used to get the value for the metric. Tip Alternatively, you can use a values.yaml file that can be passed to the helm command with the --values flag. Values files can contain all parameters needed to configure the metrics explained in the configuration section. Configuration You can configure multiple metrics in the metrics adapter and change some parameters to modify the behaviour of the metrics cache and filtering. To see the full list and descriptions of all parameters that can be modified, refer to the chart README.md and values.yaml files. How it works The following values enable the metrics adapter on the nri-bundle chart installation: metrics-adapter: enabled: true newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter: personalAPIKey: <Personal API Key> config: accountID: <Account ID> externalMetrics: nginx_average_requests: query: \"FROM Metric SELECT average(nginx.server.net.requestsPerSecond) SINCE 2 MINUTES AGO\" Copy Caution The default time span for metrics is 1h. Therefore, you should define queries with the SINCE clause to adjust the time span according to your environment and needs. There is an HPA consuming the external metric as follows: kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler apiVersion: autoscaling/v2beta2 metadata: name: nginx-scaler spec: scaleTargetRef: apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment name: nginx minReplicas: 1 maxReplicas: 10 metrics: - type: External external: metric: name: nginx_average_requests selector: matchLabels: k8s.namespaceName: nginx target: type: Value value: 10000 Copy Based on the HPA definition, the controller manager fetches the metrics from the external metrics API which are served by the New Relic metrics adapter. The New Relic metrics adapter receives the query including the nginx_average_requests metric name and all the selectors, and searches for a matching metric name in the internal memory based on the configured metrics. Then, it adds the selectors to the query to form a final query that is executed using NerdGraph to fetch the value from New Relic. The above example will generate a query like the following: FROM Metric SELECT average(nginx.server.net.requestsPerSecond) WHERE clusterName=<clusterName> AND `k8s.namespaceName`='nginx' SINCE 2 MINUTES AGO Copy Notice that a clusterName filter has been automatically added to the query to exclude metrics from other clusters in the same account. You can remove it by using the removeClusterFilter configuration parameter. Also the value is cached for a period of time defined by the cacheTTLSeconds configuration parameter, whose deafult is 30 seconds. Troubleshooting Get verbose logs Most common errors are displayed in the standard (non-verbose) logs. If you're doing a more in-depth investigation on your own or with New Relic Support, you can enable verbose mode. To get verbose logging details for an integration using Helm: Enable verbose logging: bash Copy $ helm upgrade -n <namespace> --reuse-values newrelic-bundle --set newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.verboseLog=true newrelic/nri-bundle Leave on verbose mode for a few minutes, or until enough activity has occurred. When you have the information you need, disable verbose logging: bash Copy $ helm upgrade --reuse-values newrelic-bundle --set newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.verboseLog=false newrelic/nri-bundle Caution Verbose mode increases significantly the amount of information sent to log files. Enable this mode temporarily, only for troubleshooting purposes, and reset the log level when finished. Get raw metrics Sometimes it's useful to get the list of available metrics and also to get the current value of an specific metric. To get the list of metrics available, run: bash Copy $ kubectl get --raw \"/apis/external.metrics.k8s.io/v1beta1/\" To get the value for a specific metric with a selector, run: bash Copy $ kubectl get --raw \"/apis/external.metrics.k8s.io/v1beta1/namespaces/*/<metric_name>?labelSelector=<selector_key>=<selector_value>\" Tip You must replace <metric_name>, <selector_key> and <selector_value> with your values. Metrics not working There are some usual errors that could cause a metric fail to retrieve the value. These errors are showed in the status of the metrics when you describe the HPA or are printed when you get the raw metrics directly. executing query: NRQL Syntax Error: Error at line...: The query that is being run has syntax errors. The same error message gives you the executed query and position of the error. You can try this query inside the New Relic query builder and correct the configuration from the adapter. extracting return value: expected first value to be of type \"float64\", got %!q(<nil>): The query doesn't return any value. The same error message gives you the executed query so you can try this query inside the New Relic query builder and correct the configuration from the adapter or the match selectors in the HPA.",

      "body": "BETA FEATURE This feature is still in development, but we encourage you to try it out! You can use metrics from your New Relic account to autoscale applications and services in your Kubernetes cluster by deploying the New Relic Metrics Adapter. This adapter fetches the metric values from New Relic and makes them available for the Horizontal Pod Autoscalers. The newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter implements the external.metrics.k8s.io API to support the use of external metrics based New Relic NRQL queries results. Once deployed, the value for each configured metric is fetched using the NerdGraph API based on the configured NRQL query. The metrics adapter exposes the metrics over a secured endpoint with TLS. New Relic metrics adapter in a cluster. Requirements Kubernetes 1.16 or higher. The New Relic Kubernetes integration. New Relic's user API key. No other External Metrics Adapter installed in the cluster. Installation To install the New Relic Metrics Adapter, we provide the newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter Helm chart, which is also included in the nri-bundle chart used to deploy all New Relic Kubernetes components. Install the New Relic Metrics Adapter by running the following command: helm upgrade --install newrelic newrelic/nri-bundle \\ --namespace newrelic --create-namespace \\ --set global.licenseKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY \\ --set global.cluster=K8S_CLUSTER_NAME \\ --set infrastructure.enabled=true \\ --set prometheus.enabled=true \\ --set webhook.enabled=true \\ --set ksm.enabled=true \\ --set kubeEvents.enabled=true \\ --set metrics-adapter.enabled=true \\ --set newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.personalAPIKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_PERSONAL_API_KEY \\ --set newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.config.accountID=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID \\ --set newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.config.externalMetrics.external_metric_name.query=NRQL query Copy Please notice and adjust the following flags: metrics-adapter.enabled: Must be set to true so the metrics adapter chart is installed. newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.personalAPIKey: Must be set to valid New Relic Personal API key. newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.accountID: Must be set to valid New Relic account where metrics are going to be fetched from. newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.config.externalMetrics.<var>external_metric_name</var>.<var>query</var>: Adds a new external metric where: <var>external_metric_name</var>: The metric name. <var>query</var>: The base NRQL query that is used to get the value for the metric. Tip Alternatively, you can use a values.yaml file that can be passed to the helm command with the --values flag. Values files can contain all parameters needed to configure the metrics explained in the configuration section. Configuration You can configure multiple metrics in the metrics adapter and change some parameters to modify the behaviour of the metrics cache and filtering. To see the full list and descriptions of all parameters that can be modified, refer to the chart README.md and values.yaml files. How it works The following values enable the metrics adapter on the nri-bundle chart installation: metrics-adapter: enabled: true newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter: personalAPIKey: <Personal API Key> config: accountID: <Account ID> externalMetrics: nginx_average_requests: query: \"FROM Metric SELECT average(nginx.server.net.requestsPerSecond) SINCE 2 MINUTES AGO\" Copy Caution The default time span for metrics is 1h. Therefore, you should define queries with the SINCE clause to adjust the time span according to your environment and needs. There is an HPA consuming the external metric as follows: kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler apiVersion: autoscaling/v2beta2 metadata: name: nginx-scaler spec: scaleTargetRef: apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment name: nginx minReplicas: 1 maxReplicas: 10 metrics: - type: External external: metric: name: nginx_average_requests selector: matchLabels: k8s.namespaceName: nginx target: type: Value value: 10000 Copy Based on the HPA definition, the controller manager fetches the metrics from the external metrics API which are served by the New Relic metrics adapter. The New Relic metrics adapter receives the query including the nginx_average_requests metric name and all the selectors, and searches for a matching metric name in the internal memory based on the configured metrics. Then, it adds the selectors to the query to form a final query that is executed using NerdGraph to fetch the value from New Relic. The above example will generate a query like the following: FROM Metric SELECT average(nginx.server.net.requestsPerSecond) WHERE clusterName=<clusterName> AND `k8s.namespaceName`='nginx' SINCE 2 MINUTES AGO Copy Notice that a clusterName filter has been automatically added to the query to exclude metrics from other clusters in the same account. You can remove it by using the removeClusterFilter configuration parameter. Also the value is cached for a period of time defined by the cacheTTLSeconds configuration parameter, whose deafult is 30 seconds. Troubleshooting Get verbose logs Most common errors are displayed in the standard (non-verbose) logs. If you're doing a more in-depth investigation on your own or with New Relic Support, you can enable verbose mode. To get verbose logging details for an integration using Helm: Enable verbose logging: bash Copy $ helm upgrade -n <namespace> --reuse-values newrelic-bundle --set newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.verboseLog=true newrelic/nri-bundle Leave on verbose mode for a few minutes, or until enough activity has occurred. When you have the information you need, disable verbose logging: bash Copy $ helm upgrade --reuse-values newrelic-bundle --set newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.verboseLog=false newrelic/nri-bundle Caution Verbose mode increases significantly the amount of information sent to log files. Enable this mode temporarily, only for troubleshooting purposes, and reset the log level when finished. Get raw metrics Sometimes it's useful to get the list of available metrics and also to get the current value of an specific metric. To get the list of metrics available, run: bash Copy $ kubectl get --raw \"/apis/external.metrics.k8s.io/v1beta1/\" To get the value for a specific metric with a selector, run: bash Copy $ kubectl get --raw \"/apis/external.metrics.k8s.io/v1beta1/namespaces/*/<metric_name>?labelSelector=<selector_key>=<selector_value>\" Tip You must replace <metric_name>, <selector_key> and <selector_value> with your values. Metrics not working There are some usual errors that could cause a metric fail to retrieve the value. These errors are showed in the status of the metrics when you describe the HPA or are printed when you get the raw metrics directly. executing query: NRQL Syntax Error: Error at line...: The query that is being run has syntax errors. The same error message gives you the executed query and position of the error. You can try this query inside the New Relic query builder and correct the configuration from the adapter. extracting return value: expected first value to be of type \"float64\", got %!q(<nil>): The query doesn't return any value. The same error message gives you the executed query so you can try this query inside the New Relic query builder and correct the configuration from the adapter or the match selectors in the HPA.",

      "body": "New Relic's Kubernetes integration gives you full observability into the health and performance of your environment, no matter whether you run Kubernetes on-premises or in the cloud. With our cluster explorer, you can cut through layers of complexity to see how your cluster is performing, from the heights of the control plane down to applications running on a single pod. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer: The cluster explorer is our powerful, fully visual answer to the challenges associated with running Kubernetes at a large scale. You can see the power of the Kubernetes integration in the cluster explorer, where the full picture of a cluster is made available on a single screen: nodes and pods are visualized according to their health and performance, with pending and alerting nodes in the innermost circles. Predefined alert conditions help you troubleshoot issues right from the start. Clicking each node reveals its status and how each app is performing. Get started: Install the Kubernetes integration We have an automated installer to help you with many types of installations: servers, virtual machines, and unprivileged environments. It can also help you with installations in managed services or platforms, but you'll need to review a few preliminary notes before getting started. Our automated installer will generate either a helm command or a set of plain manifests for you to install. Our automated installer: Allows users to select the cluster name and namespace for the installation. Allows users to selectively enable or disable bundling of Kube-state-metrics, a dependency of the Kubernetes integration. Allows users to seamlessly install our other products related to Kubernetes such as: Kubernetes events monitoring In-cluster prometheus services monitoring Service instrumentation without code changes using Pixie Automatically fills the required properties with the license keys the integration needs to work. Read the install docs Start the installer Tip If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the automated installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Why it matters Governing the complexity of Kubernetes can be challenging; there's so much going on at any given moment, with containers being created and deleted in a matter of minutes, applications crashing, and resources being consumed unexpectedly. Our integration helps you navigate Kubernetes abstractions across on-premises, cloud, and hybrid deployments. In New Relic, you can build your own charts and query all your Kubernetes data, which our integration collects by instrumenting the container orchestration layer. This gives you additional insight into nodes, namespaces, deployments, replica sets, pods, and containers. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: Using the query builder you can turn any query on Kubernetes data to clear visuals. With the Kubernetes integration you can also: Link your APM data to Kubernetes to measure the performance of your web and mobile applications, with metrics such as request rate, throughput, error rate, and availability. Monitor services running on Kubernetes, such as Apache, NGINX, Cassandra, and many more (see our tutorial for monitoring Redis on Kubernetes). Create new alert policies and alert conditions based on your Kubernetes data, or extend the predefined alert conditions. These features are in addition to the data New Relic already reports for containerized processes running on instrumented hosts. Navigate all your Kubernetes events The Kubernetes events integration, which is installed separately, watches for events happening in your Kubernetes clusters and sends those events to New Relic. Events data is then visualized in the cluster explorer. To set it up, check the Kubernetes events box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer > Events: Browse and filter all your Kubernetes events, and dig into application logs and infrastructure data. Bring your cluster logs to New Relic Our Kubernetes plugin for log monitoring can collect all your cluster's logs and send them to our platform, so that you can set up new alerts and charts. To set it up, check the Log data box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or you can create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "New Relic's Kubernetes integration gives you full observability into the health and performance of your environment, no matter whether you run Kubernetes on-premises or in the cloud. With our cluster explorer, you can cut through layers of complexity to see how your cluster is performing, from the heights of the control plane down to applications running on a single pod. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer: The cluster explorer is our powerful, fully visual answer to the challenges associated with running Kubernetes at a large scale. You can see the power of the Kubernetes integration in the cluster explorer, where the full picture of a cluster is made available on a single screen: nodes and pods are visualized according to their health and performance, with pending and alerting nodes in the innermost circles. Predefined alert conditions help you troubleshoot issues right from the start. Clicking each node reveals its status and how each app is performing. Get started: Install the Kubernetes integration We have an automated installer to help you with many types of installations: servers, virtual machines, and unprivileged environments. It can also help you with installations in managed services or platforms, but you'll need to review a few preliminary notes before getting started. Our automated installer will generate either a helm command or a set of plain manifests for you to install. Our automated installer: Allows users to select the cluster name and namespace for the installation. Allows users to selectively enable or disable bundling of Kube-state-metrics, a dependency of the Kubernetes integration. Allows users to seamlessly install our other products related to Kubernetes such as: Kubernetes events monitoring In-cluster prometheus services monitoring Service instrumentation without code changes using Pixie Automatically fills the required properties with the license keys the integration needs to work. Read the install docs Start the installer Tip If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the automated installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Why it matters Governing the complexity of Kubernetes can be challenging; there's so much going on at any given moment, with containers being created and deleted in a matter of minutes, applications crashing, and resources being consumed unexpectedly. Our integration helps you navigate Kubernetes abstractions across on-premises, cloud, and hybrid deployments. In New Relic, you can build your own charts and query all your Kubernetes data, which our integration collects by instrumenting the container orchestration layer. This gives you additional insight into nodes, namespaces, deployments, replica sets, pods, and containers. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: Using the query builder you can turn any query on Kubernetes data to clear visuals. With the Kubernetes integration you can also: Link your APM data to Kubernetes to measure the performance of your web and mobile applications, with metrics such as request rate, throughput, error rate, and availability. Monitor services running on Kubernetes, such as Apache, NGINX, Cassandra, and many more (see our tutorial for monitoring Redis on Kubernetes). Create new alert policies and alert conditions based on your Kubernetes data, or extend the predefined alert conditions. These features are in addition to the data New Relic already reports for containerized processes running on instrumented hosts. Navigate all your Kubernetes events The Kubernetes events integration, which is installed separately, watches for events happening in your Kubernetes clusters and sends those events to New Relic. Events data is then visualized in the cluster explorer. To set it up, check the Kubernetes events box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer > Events: Browse and filter all your Kubernetes events, and dig into application logs and infrastructure data. Bring your cluster logs to New Relic Our Kubernetes plugin for log monitoring can collect all your cluster's logs and send them to our platform, so that you can set up new alerts and charts. To set it up, check the Log data box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or you can create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

Update the manifest file. Learn about the limitations of the integration. Compatibility and requirements Before you install New Relic's Kubernetes integration, review the compatibility and requirements. Important When using containers in Windows, the container host version and the container image version must be the same. Our Kubernetes integration supports Windows versions 1809 and 1909. To check your Windows version: Open a command window. Run the following command: Reg Query \"HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\" /v ReleaseIdcmd.exe Copy Example: Get Kubernetes for Windows from a BusyBox container. $ kubectl exec -it busybox1-766bb4d6cc-rmsnj -- Reg Query \"HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\" /v ReleaseId Copy HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion ReleaseId REG_SZ 1809 Copy Install You can install the Kubernetes integration for Windows using Helm. See an example on how to install the integration in a cluster with nodes having different build versions of Windows (1809 and 2004): Install kube-state-metrics and run it in your cluster using this snippet: curl -L -o kube-state-metrics-1.9.5.zip https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/archive/v1.9.5.zip && unzip kube-state-metrics-1.9.5.zip && kubectl apply -f kube-state-metrics-1.9.5/examples/standard Copy Create a values.yml file with the follow data to be used by Helm: global: licenseKey: <YOUR_LICENSE_KEY> cluster: <YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME> enableLinux: false enableWindows: true windowsOsList: - version: 1809 imageTag: 2.2.0-windows-1809-alpha buildNumber: 10.0.17763 - version: 2004 imageTag: 2.2.0-windows-2004-alpha buildNumber: 10.0.19041 Copy Install the integration with: helm install <YOUR_INSTALL_NAME> newrelic/newrelic-infrastructure -f values.yml Copy Confirm that the DaemonSet has been created successfully by looking for newrelic-infra in the results generated by this command: kubectl get daemonsets Copy The Helm chart will create one DeamonSet per each version of Windows that is in the list and use NodeSelector to deploy the corresponding Pod per Node. Limitations The following limitations apply to the Kubernetes integration for Windows: The Windows agent only sends the Kubernetes samples (K8sNodeSample, K8sPodSample, etc.) SystemSample, StorageSample, NetworkSample, and ProcessSample are not generated. Some Kubernetes metrics are missing because the Windows kubelet doesn’t have them: Node: fsInodes: not sent fsInodesFree: not sent fsInodesUsed: not sent memoryMajorPageFaultsPerSecond: always returns zero as a value memoryPageFaults: always returns zero as a value memoryRssBytes: always returns zero as a value runtimeInodes: not sent runtimeInodesFree: not sent runtimeInodesUsed: not sent Pod: net.errorsPerSecond: not sent net.rxBytesPerSecond: not sent net.txBytesPerSecond: not sent Container: containerID: not sent containerImageID: not sent memoryUsedBytes: in the UI, this is displayed in the pod card that appears when you click on a pod, and will show no data. We will soon fix this by updating our charts to use memoryWorkingSetBytes instead. Volume: fsUsedBytes: zero, so fsUsedPercent is zero Known issues with the Windows Kubelet There are a couple of issues with the Windows version of Kubelet that can prevent the integration from fetching data: Issue 90554: This issue makes the Kubelet return 500 errors when the integration makes a request to the /stats/summary endpoint. It will be included in the Kubernetes 1.19 release and has been backported to the releases 1.16.11, 1.17.7, and 1.18.4. There is no solution on the integration side for this problem, we advise you to update to one of the patch versions as soon as possible. You can see if you're being affected by this problem by enabling verbose logs and looking for messages of the type: error querying Kubelet. Get \"https://<KUBELET_IP>/stats/summary\": error calling kubelet endpoint. Got status code: 500 Copy Issue 87730: This issue makes the Kubelet metrics very slow when running minimal load. It makes the integration fail with a timeout error. A patch for this issue has been added for Kubernetes 1.18 and backported to 1.15.12, 1.16.9, and 1.17.5. We advise you to update to one of the patch versions as soon as possible. To mitigate this issue you can increase the integration timeout with the TIMEOUT config option. You can see if you're being affected by this problem by enabling verbose logs and looking for messages of the type: error querying Kubelet. Get \"https://<KUBELET_IP>/stats/summary\": context deadline exceeded (Client.Timeout exceeded while awaiting headers) Copy",

      "body": "BETA FEATURE This feature is still in development, but we encourage you to try it out! You can use metrics from your New Relic account to autoscale applications and services in your Kubernetes cluster by deploying the New Relic Metrics Adapter. This adapter fetches the metric values from New Relic and makes them available for the Horizontal Pod Autoscalers. The newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter implements the external.metrics.k8s.io API to support the use of external metrics based New Relic NRQL queries results. Once deployed, the value for each configured metric is fetched using the NerdGraph API based on the configured NRQL query. The metrics adapter exposes the metrics over a secured endpoint with TLS. New Relic metrics adapter in a cluster. Requirements Kubernetes 1.16 or higher. The New Relic Kubernetes integration. New Relic's user API key. No other External Metrics Adapter installed in the cluster. Installation To install the New Relic Metrics Adapter, we provide the newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter Helm chart, which is also included in the nri-bundle chart used to deploy all New Relic Kubernetes components. Install the New Relic Metrics Adapter by running the following command: helm upgrade --install newrelic newrelic/nri-bundle \\ --namespace newrelic --create-namespace \\ --set global.licenseKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY \\ --set global.cluster=K8S_CLUSTER_NAME \\ --set infrastructure.enabled=true \\ --set prometheus.enabled=true \\ --set webhook.enabled=true \\ --set ksm.enabled=true \\ --set kubeEvents.enabled=true \\ --set metrics-adapter.enabled=true \\ --set newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.personalAPIKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_PERSONAL_API_KEY \\ --set newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.config.accountID=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID \\ --set newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.config.externalMetrics.external_metric_name.query=NRQL query Copy Please notice and adjust the following flags: metrics-adapter.enabled: Must be set to true so the metrics adapter chart is installed. newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.personalAPIKey: Must be set to valid New Relic Personal API key. newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.accountID: Must be set to valid New Relic account where metrics are going to be fetched from. newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.config.externalMetrics.<var>external_metric_name</var>.<var>query</var>: Adds a new external metric where: <var>external_metric_name</var>: The metric name. <var>query</var>: The base NRQL query that is used to get the value for the metric. Tip Alternatively, you can use a values.yaml file that can be passed to the helm command with the --values flag. Values files can contain all parameters needed to configure the metrics explained in the configuration section. Configuration You can configure multiple metrics in the metrics adapter and change some parameters to modify the behaviour of the metrics cache and filtering. To see the full list and descriptions of all parameters that can be modified, refer to the chart README.md and values.yaml files. How it works The following values enable the metrics adapter on the nri-bundle chart installation: metrics-adapter: enabled: true newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter: personalAPIKey: <Personal API Key> config: accountID: <Account ID> externalMetrics: nginx_average_requests: query: \"FROM Metric SELECT average(nginx.server.net.requestsPerSecond) SINCE 2 MINUTES AGO\" Copy Caution The default time span for metrics is 1h. Therefore, you should define queries with the SINCE clause to adjust the time span according to your environment and needs. There is an HPA consuming the external metric as follows: kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler apiVersion: autoscaling/v2beta2 metadata: name: nginx-scaler spec: scaleTargetRef: apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment name: nginx minReplicas: 1 maxReplicas: 10 metrics: - type: External external: metric: name: nginx_average_requests selector: matchLabels: k8s.namespaceName: nginx target: type: Value value: 10000 Copy Based on the HPA definition, the controller manager fetches the metrics from the external metrics API which are served by the New Relic metrics adapter. The New Relic metrics adapter receives the query including the nginx_average_requests metric name and all the selectors, and searches for a matching metric name in the internal memory based on the configured metrics. Then, it adds the selectors to the query to form a final query that is executed using NerdGraph to fetch the value from New Relic. The above example will generate a query like the following: FROM Metric SELECT average(nginx.server.net.requestsPerSecond) WHERE clusterName=<clusterName> AND `k8s.namespaceName`='nginx' SINCE 2 MINUTES AGO Copy Notice that a clusterName filter has been automatically added to the query to exclude metrics from other clusters in the same account. You can remove it by using the removeClusterFilter configuration parameter. Also the value is cached for a period of time defined by the cacheTTLSeconds configuration parameter, whose deafult is 30 seconds. Troubleshooting Get verbose logs Most common errors are displayed in the standard (non-verbose) logs. If you're doing a more in-depth investigation on your own or with New Relic Support, you can enable verbose mode. To get verbose logging details for an integration using Helm: Enable verbose logging: bash Copy $ helm upgrade -n <namespace> --reuse-values newrelic-bundle --set newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.verboseLog=true newrelic/nri-bundle Leave on verbose mode for a few minutes, or until enough activity has occurred. When you have the information you need, disable verbose logging: bash Copy $ helm upgrade --reuse-values newrelic-bundle --set newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.verboseLog=false newrelic/nri-bundle Caution Verbose mode increases significantly the amount of information sent to log files. Enable this mode temporarily, only for troubleshooting purposes, and reset the log level when finished. Get raw metrics Sometimes it's useful to get the list of available metrics and also to get the current value of an specific metric. To get the list of metrics available, run: bash Copy $ kubectl get --raw \"/apis/external.metrics.k8s.io/v1beta1/\" To get the value for a specific metric with a selector, run: bash Copy $ kubectl get --raw \"/apis/external.metrics.k8s.io/v1beta1/namespaces/*/<metric_name>?labelSelector=<selector_key>=<selector_value>\" Tip You must replace <metric_name>, <selector_key> and <selector_value> with your values. Metrics not working There are some usual errors that could cause a metric fail to retrieve the value. These errors are showed in the status of the metrics when you describe the HPA or are printed when you get the raw metrics directly. executing query: NRQL Syntax Error: Error at line...: The query that is being run has syntax errors. The same error message gives you the executed query and position of the error. You can try this query inside the New Relic query builder and correct the configuration from the adapter. extracting return value: expected first value to be of type \"float64\", got %!q(<nil>): The query doesn't return any value. The same error message gives you the executed query so you can try this query inside the New Relic query builder and correct the configuration from the adapter or the match selectors in the HPA.",

      "body": "Problem You have completed the installation procedure for New Relic's Kubernetes integration, you are seeing Kubernetes data in your New Relic account but there is no data from any of the control plane components. Solution Check that the master nodes have the correct labels Execute the following commands to manually find the master nodes: kubectl get nodes -l node-role.kubernetes.io/master=\"\" Copy kubectl get nodes -l kubernetes.io/role=\"master\" Copy If the master nodes follow the labeling convention defined in the discovery of master nodes and control plane components documentation section, you should get some output like: NAME STATUS ROLES AGE VERSION ip-10-42-24-4.ec2.internal Ready master 42d v1.14.8 Copy If no nodes are found, there are two scenarios: Your master nodes don’t have the required labels that identify them as masters, in this case you need to add both labels to your master nodes. You’re in a managed cluster and your provider is handling the master nodes for you. In this case there is nothing you can do, since your provider is limiting the access to those nodes. Check that the integration is running on the master nodes Replace the placeholder in the following command with one of the node names returned in the previous step to get an integration pod running on a master node: kubectl get pods --field-selector spec.nodeName=NODE_NAME -l name=newrelic-infra --all-namespaces Copy The next command is the same, just that it selects the node for you: kubectl get pods --field-selector spec.nodeName=$(kubectl get nodes -l node-role.kubernetes.io/master=\"\" -o jsonpath=\"{.items[0].metadata.name}\") -l name=newrelic-infra --all-namespaces Copy If everything is correct you should get some output like: NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE newrelic-infra-whvzt 1/1 Running 0 6d20h Copy If the integration is not running on your master nodes, check that the daemonset has all the desired instances running and ready. kubectl get daemonsets -l app=newrelic-infra --all-namespaces Copy Check that the control plane components have the required labels Refer to the discovery of master nodes and control plane components documentation section and look for the labels the integration uses to discover the components. Then run the following commands to see if there are any pods with such labels and the nodes where they are running: kubectl get pods -l k8s-app=kube-apiserver --all-namespaces Copy If there is component with the given label you should see something like: NAMESPACE NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE kube-system kube-apiserver-ip-10-42-24-42.ec2.internal 1/1 Running 3 49d Copy The same should be done with the rest of the components: kubectl get pods -l k8s-app=etcd-manager-main --all-namespaces Copy kubectl get pods -l k8s-app=kube-scheduler --all-namespaces Copy kubectl get pods -l k8s-app=kube-kube-controller-manager --all-namespaces Copy Retrieve the verbose logs of one of the integrations running on a master node and check for the control plane components jobs To retrieve the logs, follow the instructions on get logs from pod running on a master node. The integration logs for every component the following message “Running job: COMPONENT_NAME”. Ex: Running job: scheduler Copy Running job: etcd Copy Running job: controller-manager Copy Running job: api-server Copy If you didn’t specify the ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAME configuration option you’ll find the following message in the logs: Skipping job creation for component etcd: etcd requires TLS configuration, none given Copy If any error occurs while querying the metrics of any component it will be logged after the Running job message. Manually query the metrics of the components Refer to the discovery of master nodes and control plane components documentation section to get the endpoint of the control plane component you want to query. With the endpoint we can use the integration pod that’s running on the same node as the component to query. The following are examples on how to query the Kubernetes scheduler: kubectl exec -ti POD_NAME -- wget -O - localhost:10251/metrics Copy The following command does the same, but also chooses the pod for you: kubectl exec -ti $(kubectl get pods --all-namespaces --field-selector spec.nodeName=$(kubectl get nodes -l node-role.kubernetes.io/master=\"\" -o jsonpath=\"{.items[0].metadata.name}\") -l name=newrelic-infra -o jsonpath=\"{.items[0].metadata.name}\") -- wget -O - localhost:10251/metrics Copy If everything is correct you should get some metrics on the Prometheus format, something like: Connecting to localhost:10251 (127.0.0.1:10251) # HELP apiserver_audit_event_total Counter of audit events generated and sent to the audit backend. # TYPE apiserver_audit_event_total counter apiserver_audit_event_total 0 # HELP apiserver_audit_requests_rejected_total Counter of apiserver requests rejected due to an error in audit logging backend. # TYPE apiserver_audit_requests_rejected_total counter apiserver_audit_requests_rejected_total 0 # HELP apiserver_client_certificate_expiration_seconds Distribution of the remaining lifetime on the certificate used to authenticate a request. # TYPE apiserver_client_certificate_expiration_seconds histogram apiserver_client_certificate_expiration_seconds_bucket{le=\"0\"} 0 apiserver_client_certificate_expiration_seconds_bucket{le=\"1800\"} 0 apiserver_client_certificate_expiration_seconds_bucket{le=\"3600\"} 0 Copy",

      "body": "BETA FEATURE This feature is still in development, but we encourage you to try it out! You can use metrics from your New Relic account to autoscale applications and services in your Kubernetes cluster by deploying the New Relic Metrics Adapter. This adapter fetches the metric values from New Relic and makes them available for the Horizontal Pod Autoscalers. The newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter implements the external.metrics.k8s.io API to support the use of external metrics based New Relic NRQL queries results. Once deployed, the value for each configured metric is fetched using the NerdGraph API based on the configured NRQL query. The metrics adapter exposes the metrics over a secured endpoint with TLS. New Relic metrics adapter in a cluster. Requirements Kubernetes 1.16 or higher. The New Relic Kubernetes integration. New Relic's user API key. No other External Metrics Adapter installed in the cluster. Installation To install the New Relic Metrics Adapter, we provide the newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter Helm chart, which is also included in the nri-bundle chart used to deploy all New Relic Kubernetes components. Install the New Relic Metrics Adapter by running the following command: helm upgrade --install newrelic newrelic/nri-bundle \\ --namespace newrelic --create-namespace \\ --set global.licenseKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY \\ --set global.cluster=K8S_CLUSTER_NAME \\ --set infrastructure.enabled=true \\ --set prometheus.enabled=true \\ --set webhook.enabled=true \\ --set ksm.enabled=true \\ --set kubeEvents.enabled=true \\ --set metrics-adapter.enabled=true \\ --set newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.personalAPIKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_PERSONAL_API_KEY \\ --set newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.config.accountID=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID \\ --set newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.config.externalMetrics.external_metric_name.query=NRQL query Copy Please notice and adjust the following flags: metrics-adapter.enabled: Must be set to true so the metrics adapter chart is installed. newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.personalAPIKey: Must be set to valid New Relic Personal API key. newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.accountID: Must be set to valid New Relic account where metrics are going to be fetched from. newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.config.externalMetrics.<var>external_metric_name</var>.<var>query</var>: Adds a new external metric where: <var>external_metric_name</var>: The metric name. <var>query</var>: The base NRQL query that is used to get the value for the metric. Tip Alternatively, you can use a values.yaml file that can be passed to the helm command with the --values flag. Values files can contain all parameters needed to configure the metrics explained in the configuration section. Configuration You can configure multiple metrics in the metrics adapter and change some parameters to modify the behaviour of the metrics cache and filtering. To see the full list and descriptions of all parameters that can be modified, refer to the chart README.md and values.yaml files. How it works The following values enable the metrics adapter on the nri-bundle chart installation: metrics-adapter: enabled: true newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter: personalAPIKey: <Personal API Key> config: accountID: <Account ID> externalMetrics: nginx_average_requests: query: \"FROM Metric SELECT average(nginx.server.net.requestsPerSecond) SINCE 2 MINUTES AGO\" Copy Caution The default time span for metrics is 1h. Therefore, you should define queries with the SINCE clause to adjust the time span according to your environment and needs. There is an HPA consuming the external metric as follows: kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler apiVersion: autoscaling/v2beta2 metadata: name: nginx-scaler spec: scaleTargetRef: apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment name: nginx minReplicas: 1 maxReplicas: 10 metrics: - type: External external: metric: name: nginx_average_requests selector: matchLabels: k8s.namespaceName: nginx target: type: Value value: 10000 Copy Based on the HPA definition, the controller manager fetches the metrics from the external metrics API which are served by the New Relic metrics adapter. The New Relic metrics adapter receives the query including the nginx_average_requests metric name and all the selectors, and searches for a matching metric name in the internal memory based on the configured metrics. Then, it adds the selectors to the query to form a final query that is executed using NerdGraph to fetch the value from New Relic. The above example will generate a query like the following: FROM Metric SELECT average(nginx.server.net.requestsPerSecond) WHERE clusterName=<clusterName> AND `k8s.namespaceName`='nginx' SINCE 2 MINUTES AGO Copy Notice that a clusterName filter has been automatically added to the query to exclude metrics from other clusters in the same account. You can remove it by using the removeClusterFilter configuration parameter. Also the value is cached for a period of time defined by the cacheTTLSeconds configuration parameter, whose deafult is 30 seconds. Troubleshooting Get verbose logs Most common errors are displayed in the standard (non-verbose) logs. If you're doing a more in-depth investigation on your own or with New Relic Support, you can enable verbose mode. To get verbose logging details for an integration using Helm: Enable verbose logging: bash Copy $ helm upgrade -n <namespace> --reuse-values newrelic-bundle --set newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.verboseLog=true newrelic/nri-bundle Leave on verbose mode for a few minutes, or until enough activity has occurred. When you have the information you need, disable verbose logging: bash Copy $ helm upgrade --reuse-values newrelic-bundle --set newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.verboseLog=false newrelic/nri-bundle Caution Verbose mode increases significantly the amount of information sent to log files. Enable this mode temporarily, only for troubleshooting purposes, and reset the log level when finished. Get raw metrics Sometimes it's useful to get the list of available metrics and also to get the current value of an specific metric. To get the list of metrics available, run: bash Copy $ kubectl get --raw \"/apis/external.metrics.k8s.io/v1beta1/\" To get the value for a specific metric with a selector, run: bash Copy $ kubectl get --raw \"/apis/external.metrics.k8s.io/v1beta1/namespaces/*/<metric_name>?labelSelector=<selector_key>=<selector_value>\" Tip You must replace <metric_name>, <selector_key> and <selector_value> with your values. Metrics not working There are some usual errors that could cause a metric fail to retrieve the value. These errors are showed in the status of the metrics when you describe the HPA or are printed when you get the raw metrics directly. executing query: NRQL Syntax Error: Error at line...: The query that is being run has syntax errors. The same error message gives you the executed query and position of the error. You can try this query inside the New Relic query builder and correct the configuration from the adapter. extracting return value: expected first value to be of type \"float64\", got %!q(<nil>): The query doesn't return any value. The same error message gives you the executed query so you can try this query inside the New Relic query builder and correct the configuration from the adapter or the match selectors in the HPA.",

      "body": "BETA FEATURE This feature is still in development, but we encourage you to try it out! You can use metrics from your New Relic account to autoscale applications and services in your Kubernetes cluster by deploying the New Relic Metrics Adapter. This adapter fetches the metric values from New Relic and makes them available for the Horizontal Pod Autoscalers. The newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter implements the external.metrics.k8s.io API to support the use of external metrics based New Relic NRQL queries results. Once deployed, the value for each configured metric is fetched using the NerdGraph API based on the configured NRQL query. The metrics adapter exposes the metrics over a secured endpoint with TLS. New Relic metrics adapter in a cluster. Requirements Kubernetes 1.16 or higher. The New Relic Kubernetes integration. New Relic's user API key. No other External Metrics Adapter installed in the cluster. Installation To install the New Relic Metrics Adapter, we provide the newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter Helm chart, which is also included in the nri-bundle chart used to deploy all New Relic Kubernetes components. Install the New Relic Metrics Adapter by running the following command: helm upgrade --install newrelic newrelic/nri-bundle \\ --namespace newrelic --create-namespace \\ --set global.licenseKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY \\ --set global.cluster=K8S_CLUSTER_NAME \\ --set infrastructure.enabled=true \\ --set prometheus.enabled=true \\ --set webhook.enabled=true \\ --set ksm.enabled=true \\ --set kubeEvents.enabled=true \\ --set metrics-adapter.enabled=true \\ --set newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.personalAPIKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_PERSONAL_API_KEY \\ --set newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.config.accountID=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID \\ --set newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.config.externalMetrics.external_metric_name.query=NRQL query Copy Please notice and adjust the following flags: metrics-adapter.enabled: Must be set to true so the metrics adapter chart is installed. newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.personalAPIKey: Must be set to valid New Relic Personal API key. newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.accountID: Must be set to valid New Relic account where metrics are going to be fetched from. newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.config.externalMetrics.<var>external_metric_name</var>.<var>query</var>: Adds a new external metric where: <var>external_metric_name</var>: The metric name. <var>query</var>: The base NRQL query that is used to get the value for the metric. Tip Alternatively, you can use a values.yaml file that can be passed to the helm command with the --values flag. Values files can contain all parameters needed to configure the metrics explained in the configuration section. Configuration You can configure multiple metrics in the metrics adapter and change some parameters to modify the behaviour of the metrics cache and filtering. To see the full list and descriptions of all parameters that can be modified, refer to the chart README.md and values.yaml files. How it works The following values enable the metrics adapter on the nri-bundle chart installation: metrics-adapter: enabled: true newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter: personalAPIKey: <Personal API Key> config: accountID: <Account ID> externalMetrics: nginx_average_requests: query: \"FROM Metric SELECT average(nginx.server.net.requestsPerSecond) SINCE 2 MINUTES AGO\" Copy Caution The default time span for metrics is 1h. Therefore, you should define queries with the SINCE clause to adjust the time span according to your environment and needs. There is an HPA consuming the external metric as follows: kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler apiVersion: autoscaling/v2beta2 metadata: name: nginx-scaler spec: scaleTargetRef: apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment name: nginx minReplicas: 1 maxReplicas: 10 metrics: - type: External external: metric: name: nginx_average_requests selector: matchLabels: k8s.namespaceName: nginx target: type: Value value: 10000 Copy Based on the HPA definition, the controller manager fetches the metrics from the external metrics API which are served by the New Relic metrics adapter. The New Relic metrics adapter receives the query including the nginx_average_requests metric name and all the selectors, and searches for a matching metric name in the internal memory based on the configured metrics. Then, it adds the selectors to the query to form a final query that is executed using NerdGraph to fetch the value from New Relic. The above example will generate a query like the following: FROM Metric SELECT average(nginx.server.net.requestsPerSecond) WHERE clusterName=<clusterName> AND `k8s.namespaceName`='nginx' SINCE 2 MINUTES AGO Copy Notice that a clusterName filter has been automatically added to the query to exclude metrics from other clusters in the same account. You can remove it by using the removeClusterFilter configuration parameter. Also the value is cached for a period of time defined by the cacheTTLSeconds configuration parameter, whose deafult is 30 seconds. Troubleshooting Get verbose logs Most common errors are displayed in the standard (non-verbose) logs. If you're doing a more in-depth investigation on your own or with New Relic Support, you can enable verbose mode. To get verbose logging details for an integration using Helm: Enable verbose logging: bash Copy $ helm upgrade -n <namespace> --reuse-values newrelic-bundle --set newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.verboseLog=true newrelic/nri-bundle Leave on verbose mode for a few minutes, or until enough activity has occurred. When you have the information you need, disable verbose logging: bash Copy $ helm upgrade --reuse-values newrelic-bundle --set newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.verboseLog=false newrelic/nri-bundle Caution Verbose mode increases significantly the amount of information sent to log files. Enable this mode temporarily, only for troubleshooting purposes, and reset the log level when finished. Get raw metrics Sometimes it's useful to get the list of available metrics and also to get the current value of an specific metric. To get the list of metrics available, run: bash Copy $ kubectl get --raw \"/apis/external.metrics.k8s.io/v1beta1/\" To get the value for a specific metric with a selector, run: bash Copy $ kubectl get --raw \"/apis/external.metrics.k8s.io/v1beta1/namespaces/*/<metric_name>?labelSelector=<selector_key>=<selector_value>\" Tip You must replace <metric_name>, <selector_key> and <selector_value> with your values. Metrics not working There are some usual errors that could cause a metric fail to retrieve the value. These errors are showed in the status of the metrics when you describe the HPA or are printed when you get the raw metrics directly. executing query: NRQL Syntax Error: Error at line...: The query that is being run has syntax errors. The same error message gives you the executed query and position of the error. You can try this query inside the New Relic query builder and correct the configuration from the adapter. extracting return value: expected first value to be of type \"float64\", got %!q(<nil>): The query doesn't return any value. The same error message gives you the executed query so you can try this query inside the New Relic query builder and correct the configuration from the adapter or the match selectors in the HPA.",

      "body": "New Relic's Kubernetes integration gives you full observability into the health and performance of your environment, no matter whether you run Kubernetes on-premises or in the cloud. With our cluster explorer, you can cut through layers of complexity to see how your cluster is performing, from the heights of the control plane down to applications running on a single pod. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer: The cluster explorer is our powerful, fully visual answer to the challenges associated with running Kubernetes at a large scale. You can see the power of the Kubernetes integration in the cluster explorer, where the full picture of a cluster is made available on a single screen: nodes and pods are visualized according to their health and performance, with pending and alerting nodes in the innermost circles. Predefined alert conditions help you troubleshoot issues right from the start. Clicking each node reveals its status and how each app is performing. Get started: Install the Kubernetes integration We have an automated installer to help you with many types of installations: servers, virtual machines, and unprivileged environments. It can also help you with installations in managed services or platforms, but you'll need to review a few preliminary notes before getting started. Our automated installer will generate either a helm command or a set of plain manifests for you to install. Our automated installer: Allows users to select the cluster name and namespace for the installation. Allows users to selectively enable or disable bundling of Kube-state-metrics, a dependency of the Kubernetes integration. Allows users to seamlessly install our other products related to Kubernetes such as: Kubernetes events monitoring In-cluster prometheus services monitoring Service instrumentation without code changes using Pixie Automatically fills the required properties with the license keys the integration needs to work. Read the install docs Start the installer Tip If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the automated installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Why it matters Governing the complexity of Kubernetes can be challenging; there's so much going on at any given moment, with containers being created and deleted in a matter of minutes, applications crashing, and resources being consumed unexpectedly. Our integration helps you navigate Kubernetes abstractions across on-premises, cloud, and hybrid deployments. In New Relic, you can build your own charts and query all your Kubernetes data, which our integration collects by instrumenting the container orchestration layer. This gives you additional insight into nodes, namespaces, deployments, replica sets, pods, and containers. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: Using the query builder you can turn any query on Kubernetes data to clear visuals. With the Kubernetes integration you can also: Link your APM data to Kubernetes to measure the performance of your web and mobile applications, with metrics such as request rate, throughput, error rate, and availability. Monitor services running on Kubernetes, such as Apache, NGINX, Cassandra, and many more (see our tutorial for monitoring Redis on Kubernetes). Create new alert policies and alert conditions based on your Kubernetes data, or extend the predefined alert conditions. These features are in addition to the data New Relic already reports for containerized processes running on instrumented hosts. Navigate all your Kubernetes events The Kubernetes events integration, which is installed separately, watches for events happening in your Kubernetes clusters and sends those events to New Relic. Events data is then visualized in the cluster explorer. To set it up, check the Kubernetes events box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer > Events: Browse and filter all your Kubernetes events, and dig into application logs and infrastructure data. Bring your cluster logs to New Relic Our Kubernetes plugin for log monitoring can collect all your cluster's logs and send them to our platform, so that you can set up new alerts and charts. To set it up, check the Log data box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or you can create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

Allows users to selectively enable or disable bundling of Kube-state-metrics, a dependency of the Kubernetes integration. Allows users to seamlessly install our other products related to Kubernetes such as: Kubernetes events monitoring In-cluster prometheus services monitoring Service instrumentation without code changes using Pixie Automatically fills the required properties with the license keys the integration needs to work. Read the install docs Start the installer Tip If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the automated installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Why it matters Governing the complexity of Kubernetes can be challenging; there's so much going on at any given moment, with containers being created and deleted in a matter of minutes, applications crashing, and resources being consumed unexpectedly. Our integration helps you navigate Kubernetes abstractions across on-premises, cloud, and hybrid deployments. In New Relic, you can build your own charts and query all your Kubernetes data, which our integration collects by instrumenting the container orchestration layer. This gives you additional insight into nodes, namespaces, deployments, replica sets, pods, and containers. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: Using the query builder you can turn any query on Kubernetes data to clear visuals. With the Kubernetes integration you can also: Link your APM data to Kubernetes to measure the performance of your web and mobile applications, with metrics such as request rate, throughput, error rate, and availability. Monitor services running on Kubernetes, such as Apache, NGINX, Cassandra, and many more (see our tutorial for monitoring Redis on Kubernetes). Create new alert policies and alert conditions based on your Kubernetes data, or extend the predefined alert conditions. These features are in addition to the data New Relic already reports for containerized processes running on instrumented hosts. Navigate all your Kubernetes events The Kubernetes events integration, which is installed separately, watches for events happening in your Kubernetes clusters and sends those events to New Relic. Events data is then visualized in the cluster explorer. To set it up, check the Kubernetes events box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer > Events: Browse and filter all your Kubernetes events, and dig into application logs and infrastructure data. Bring your cluster logs to New Relic Our Kubernetes plugin for log monitoring can collect all your cluster's logs and send them to our platform, so that you can set up new alerts and charts. To set it up, check the Log data box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or you can create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "BETA FEATURE This feature is still in development, but we encourage you to try it out! You can use metrics from your New Relic account to autoscale applications and services in your Kubernetes cluster by deploying the New Relic Metrics Adapter. This adapter fetches the metric values from New Relic and makes them available for the Horizontal Pod Autoscalers. The newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter implements the external.metrics.k8s.io API to support the use of external metrics based New Relic NRQL queries results. Once deployed, the value for each configured metric is fetched using the NerdGraph API based on the configured NRQL query. The metrics adapter exposes the metrics over a secured endpoint with TLS. New Relic metrics adapter in a cluster. Requirements Kubernetes 1.16 or higher. The New Relic Kubernetes integration. New Relic's user API key. No other External Metrics Adapter installed in the cluster. Installation To install the New Relic Metrics Adapter, we provide the newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter Helm chart, which is also included in the nri-bundle chart used to deploy all New Relic Kubernetes components. Install the New Relic Metrics Adapter by running the following command: helm upgrade --install newrelic newrelic/nri-bundle \\ --namespace newrelic --create-namespace \\ --set global.licenseKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY \\ --set global.cluster=K8S_CLUSTER_NAME \\ --set infrastructure.enabled=true \\ --set prometheus.enabled=true \\ --set webhook.enabled=true \\ --set ksm.enabled=true \\ --set kubeEvents.enabled=true \\ --set metrics-adapter.enabled=true \\ --set newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.personalAPIKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_PERSONAL_API_KEY \\ --set newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.config.accountID=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID \\ --set newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.config.externalMetrics.external_metric_name.query=NRQL query Copy Please notice and adjust the following flags: metrics-adapter.enabled: Must be set to true so the metrics adapter chart is installed. newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.personalAPIKey: Must be set to valid New Relic Personal API key. newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.accountID: Must be set to valid New Relic account where metrics are going to be fetched from. newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.config.externalMetrics.<var>external_metric_name</var>.<var>query</var>: Adds a new external metric where: <var>external_metric_name</var>: The metric name. <var>query</var>: The base NRQL query that is used to get the value for the metric. Tip Alternatively, you can use a values.yaml file that can be passed to the helm command with the --values flag. Values files can contain all parameters needed to configure the metrics explained in the configuration section. Configuration You can configure multiple metrics in the metrics adapter and change some parameters to modify the behaviour of the metrics cache and filtering. To see the full list and descriptions of all parameters that can be modified, refer to the chart README.md and values.yaml files. How it works The following values enable the metrics adapter on the nri-bundle chart installation: metrics-adapter: enabled: true newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter: personalAPIKey: <Personal API Key> config: accountID: <Account ID> externalMetrics: nginx_average_requests: query: \"FROM Metric SELECT average(nginx.server.net.requestsPerSecond) SINCE 2 MINUTES AGO\" Copy Caution The default time span for metrics is 1h. Therefore, you should define queries with the SINCE clause to adjust the time span according to your environment and needs. There is an HPA consuming the external metric as follows: kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler apiVersion: autoscaling/v2beta2 metadata: name: nginx-scaler spec: scaleTargetRef: apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment name: nginx minReplicas: 1 maxReplicas: 10 metrics: - type: External external: metric: name: nginx_average_requests selector: matchLabels: k8s.namespaceName: nginx target: type: Value value: 10000 Copy Based on the HPA definition, the controller manager fetches the metrics from the external metrics API which are served by the New Relic metrics adapter. The New Relic metrics adapter receives the query including the nginx_average_requests metric name and all the selectors, and searches for a matching metric name in the internal memory based on the configured metrics. Then, it adds the selectors to the query to form a final query that is executed using NerdGraph to fetch the value from New Relic. The above example will generate a query like the following: FROM Metric SELECT average(nginx.server.net.requestsPerSecond) WHERE clusterName=<clusterName> AND `k8s.namespaceName`='nginx' SINCE 2 MINUTES AGO Copy Notice that a clusterName filter has been automatically added to the query to exclude metrics from other clusters in the same account. You can remove it by using the removeClusterFilter configuration parameter. Also the value is cached for a period of time defined by the cacheTTLSeconds configuration parameter, whose deafult is 30 seconds. Troubleshooting Get verbose logs Most common errors are displayed in the standard (non-verbose) logs. If you're doing a more in-depth investigation on your own or with New Relic Support, you can enable verbose mode. To get verbose logging details for an integration using Helm: Enable verbose logging: bash Copy $ helm upgrade -n <namespace> --reuse-values newrelic-bundle --set newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.verboseLog=true newrelic/nri-bundle Leave on verbose mode for a few minutes, or until enough activity has occurred. When you have the information you need, disable verbose logging: bash Copy $ helm upgrade --reuse-values newrelic-bundle --set newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.verboseLog=false newrelic/nri-bundle Caution Verbose mode increases significantly the amount of information sent to log files. Enable this mode temporarily, only for troubleshooting purposes, and reset the log level when finished. Get raw metrics Sometimes it's useful to get the list of available metrics and also to get the current value of an specific metric. To get the list of metrics available, run: bash Copy $ kubectl get --raw \"/apis/external.metrics.k8s.io/v1beta1/\" To get the value for a specific metric with a selector, run: bash Copy $ kubectl get --raw \"/apis/external.metrics.k8s.io/v1beta1/namespaces/*/<metric_name>?labelSelector=<selector_key>=<selector_value>\" Tip You must replace <metric_name>, <selector_key> and <selector_value> with your values. Metrics not working There are some usual errors that could cause a metric fail to retrieve the value. These errors are showed in the status of the metrics when you describe the HPA or are printed when you get the raw metrics directly. executing query: NRQL Syntax Error: Error at line...: The query that is being run has syntax errors. The same error message gives you the executed query and position of the error. You can try this query inside the New Relic query builder and correct the configuration from the adapter. extracting return value: expected first value to be of type \"float64\", got %!q(<nil>): The query doesn't return any value. The same error message gives you the executed query so you can try this query inside the New Relic query builder and correct the configuration from the adapter or the match selectors in the HPA.",

The New Relic metrics adapter receives the query including the nginx_average_requests metric name and all the selectors, and searches for a matching metric name in the internal memory based on the configured metrics. Then, it adds the selectors to the query to form a final query that is executed using NerdGraph to fetch the value from New Relic. The above example will generate a query like the following: FROM Metric SELECT average(nginx.server.net.requestsPerSecond) WHERE clusterName=<clusterName> AND `k8s.namespaceName`='nginx' SINCE 2 MINUTES AGO Copy Notice that a clusterName filter has been automatically added to the query to exclude metrics from other clusters in the same account. You can remove it by using the removeClusterFilter configuration parameter. Also the value is cached for a period of time defined by the cacheTTLSeconds configuration parameter, whose deafult is 30 seconds. Troubleshooting Get verbose logs Most common errors are displayed in the standard (non-verbose) logs. If you're doing a more in-depth investigation on your own or with New Relic Support, you can enable verbose mode. To get verbose logging details for an integration using Helm: Enable verbose logging: bash Copy $ helm upgrade -n <namespace> --reuse-values newrelic-bundle --set newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.verboseLog=true newrelic/nri-bundle Leave on verbose mode for a few minutes, or until enough activity has occurred. When you have the information you need, disable verbose logging: bash Copy $ helm upgrade --reuse-values newrelic-bundle --set newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.verboseLog=false newrelic/nri-bundle Caution Verbose mode increases significantly the amount of information sent to log files. Enable this mode temporarily, only for troubleshooting purposes, and reset the log level when finished. Get raw metrics Sometimes it's useful to get the list of available metrics and also to get the current value of an specific metric. To get the list of metrics available, run: bash Copy $ kubectl get --raw \"/apis/external.metrics.k8s.io/v1beta1/\" To get the value for a specific metric with a selector, run: bash Copy $ kubectl get --raw \"/apis/external.metrics.k8s.io/v1beta1/namespaces/*/<metric_name>?labelSelector=<selector_key>=<selector_value>\" Tip You must replace <metric_name>, <selector_key> and <selector_value> with your values. Metrics not working There are some usual errors that could cause a metric fail to retrieve the value. These errors are showed in the status of the metrics when you describe the HPA or are printed when you get the raw metrics directly. executing query: NRQL Syntax Error: Error at line...: The query that is being run has syntax errors. The same error message gives you the executed query and position of the error. You can try this query inside the New Relic query builder and correct the configuration from the adapter. extracting return value: expected first value to be of type \"float64\", got %!q(<nil>): The query doesn't return any value. The same error message gives you the executed query so you can try this query inside the New Relic query builder and correct the configuration from the adapter or the match selectors in the HPA.",

Why it matters Governing the complexity of Kubernetes can be challenging; there's so much going on at any given moment, with containers being created and deleted in a matter of minutes, applications crashing, and resources being consumed unexpectedly. Our integration helps you navigate Kubernetes abstractions across on-premises, cloud, and hybrid deployments. In New Relic, you can build your own charts and query all your Kubernetes data, which our integration collects by instrumenting the container orchestration layer. This gives you additional insight into nodes, namespaces, deployments, replica sets, pods, and containers. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: Using the query builder you can turn any query on Kubernetes data to clear visuals. With the Kubernetes integration you can also: Link your APM data to Kubernetes to measure the performance of your web and mobile applications, with metrics such as request rate, throughput, error rate, and availability. Monitor services running on Kubernetes, such as Apache, NGINX, Cassandra, and many more (see our tutorial for monitoring Redis on Kubernetes). Create new alert policies and alert conditions based on your Kubernetes data, or extend the predefined alert conditions. These features are in addition to the data New Relic already reports for containerized processes running on instrumented hosts. Navigate all your Kubernetes events The Kubernetes events integration, which is installed separately, watches for events happening in your Kubernetes clusters and sends those events to New Relic.

      "body": "BETA FEATURE This feature is still in development, but we encourage you to try it out! You can use metrics from your New Relic account to autoscale applications and services in your Kubernetes cluster by deploying the New Relic Metrics Adapter. This adapter fetches the metric values from New Relic and makes them available for the Horizontal Pod Autoscalers. The newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter implements the external.metrics.k8s.io API to support the use of external metrics based New Relic NRQL queries results. Once deployed, the value for each configured metric is fetched using the NerdGraph API based on the configured NRQL query. The metrics adapter exposes the metrics over a secured endpoint with TLS. New Relic metrics adapter in a cluster. Requirements Kubernetes 1.16 or higher. The New Relic Kubernetes integration. New Relic's user API key. No other External Metrics Adapter installed in the cluster. Installation To install the New Relic Metrics Adapter, we provide the newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter Helm chart, which is also included in the nri-bundle chart used to deploy all New Relic Kubernetes components. Install the New Relic Metrics Adapter by running the following command: helm upgrade --install newrelic newrelic/nri-bundle \\ --namespace newrelic --create-namespace \\ --set global.licenseKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY \\ --set global.cluster=K8S_CLUSTER_NAME \\ --set infrastructure.enabled=true \\ --set prometheus.enabled=true \\ --set webhook.enabled=true \\ --set ksm.enabled=true \\ --set kubeEvents.enabled=true \\ --set metrics-adapter.enabled=true \\ --set newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.personalAPIKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_PERSONAL_API_KEY \\ --set newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.config.accountID=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID \\ --set newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.config.externalMetrics.external_metric_name.query=NRQL query Copy Please notice and adjust the following flags: metrics-adapter.enabled: Must be set to true so the metrics adapter chart is installed. newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.personalAPIKey: Must be set to valid New Relic Personal API key. newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.accountID: Must be set to valid New Relic account where metrics are going to be fetched from. newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.config.externalMetrics.<var>external_metric_name</var>.<var>query</var>: Adds a new external metric where: <var>external_metric_name</var>: The metric name. <var>query</var>: The base NRQL query that is used to get the value for the metric. Tip Alternatively, you can use a values.yaml file that can be passed to the helm command with the --values flag. Values files can contain all parameters needed to configure the metrics explained in the configuration section. Configuration You can configure multiple metrics in the metrics adapter and change some parameters to modify the behaviour of the metrics cache and filtering. To see the full list and descriptions of all parameters that can be modified, refer to the chart README.md and values.yaml files. How it works The following values enable the metrics adapter on the nri-bundle chart installation: metrics-adapter: enabled: true newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter: personalAPIKey: <Personal API Key> config: accountID: <Account ID> externalMetrics: nginx_average_requests: query: \"FROM Metric SELECT average(nginx.server.net.requestsPerSecond) SINCE 2 MINUTES AGO\" Copy Caution The default time span for metrics is 1h. Therefore, you should define queries with the SINCE clause to adjust the time span according to your environment and needs. There is an HPA consuming the external metric as follows: kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler apiVersion: autoscaling/v2beta2 metadata: name: nginx-scaler spec: scaleTargetRef: apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment name: nginx minReplicas: 1 maxReplicas: 10 metrics: - type: External external: metric: name: nginx_average_requests selector: matchLabels: k8s.namespaceName: nginx target: type: Value value: 10000 Copy Based on the HPA definition, the controller manager fetches the metrics from the external metrics API which are served by the New Relic metrics adapter. The New Relic metrics adapter receives the query including the nginx_average_requests metric name and all the selectors, and searches for a matching metric name in the internal memory based on the configured metrics. Then, it adds the selectors to the query to form a final query that is executed using NerdGraph to fetch the value from New Relic. The above example will generate a query like the following: FROM Metric SELECT average(nginx.server.net.requestsPerSecond) WHERE clusterName=<clusterName> AND `k8s.namespaceName`='nginx' SINCE 2 MINUTES AGO Copy Notice that a clusterName filter has been automatically added to the query to exclude metrics from other clusters in the same account. You can remove it by using the removeClusterFilter configuration parameter. Also the value is cached for a period of time defined by the cacheTTLSeconds configuration parameter, whose deafult is 30 seconds. Troubleshooting Get verbose logs Most common errors are displayed in the standard (non-verbose) logs. If you're doing a more in-depth investigation on your own or with New Relic Support, you can enable verbose mode. To get verbose logging details for an integration using Helm: Enable verbose logging: bash Copy $ helm upgrade -n <namespace> --reuse-values newrelic-bundle --set newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.verboseLog=true newrelic/nri-bundle Leave on verbose mode for a few minutes, or until enough activity has occurred.

Update the manifest file. Learn about the limitations of the integration. Compatibility and requirements Before you install New Relic's Kubernetes integration, review the compatibility and requirements. Important When using containers in Windows, the container host version and the container image version must be the same. Our Kubernetes integration supports Windows versions 1809 and 1909. To check your Windows version: Open a command window. Run the following command: Reg Query \"HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\" /v ReleaseIdcmd.exe Copy Example: Get Kubernetes for Windows from a BusyBox container. $ kubectl exec -it busybox1-766bb4d6cc-rmsnj -- Reg Query \"HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\" /v ReleaseId Copy HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion ReleaseId REG_SZ 1809 Copy Install You can install the Kubernetes integration for Windows using Helm. See an example on how to install the integration in a cluster with nodes having different build versions of Windows (1809 and 2004): Install kube-state-metrics and run it in your cluster using this snippet: curl -L -o kube-state-metrics-1.9.5.zip https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/archive/v1.9.5.zip && unzip kube-state-metrics-1.9.5.zip && kubectl apply -f kube-state-metrics-1.9.5/examples/standard Copy Create a values.yml file with the follow data to be used by Helm: global: licenseKey: <YOUR_LICENSE_KEY> cluster: <YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME> enableLinux: false enableWindows: true windowsOsList: - version: 1809 imageTag: 2.2.0-windows-1809-alpha buildNumber: 10.0.17763 - version: 2004 imageTag: 2.2.0-windows-2004-alpha buildNumber: 10.0.19041 Copy Install the integration with: helm install <YOUR_INSTALL_NAME> newrelic/newrelic-infrastructure -f values.yml Copy Confirm that the DaemonSet has been created successfully by looking for newrelic-infra in the results generated by this command: kubectl get daemonsets Copy The Helm chart will create one DeamonSet per each version of Windows that is in the list and use NodeSelector to deploy the corresponding Pod per Node. Limitations The following limitations apply to the Kubernetes integration for Windows: The Windows agent only sends the Kubernetes samples (K8sNodeSample, K8sPodSample, etc.) SystemSample, StorageSample, NetworkSample, and ProcessSample are not generated. Some Kubernetes metrics are missing because the Windows kubelet doesn’t have them: Node: fsInodes: not sent fsInodesFree: not sent fsInodesUsed: not sent memoryMajorPageFaultsPerSecond: always returns zero as a value memoryPageFaults: always returns zero as a value memoryRssBytes: always returns zero as a value runtimeInodes: not sent runtimeInodesFree: not sent runtimeInodesUsed: not sent Pod: net.errorsPerSecond: not sent net.rxBytesPerSecond: not sent net.txBytesPerSecond: not sent Container: containerID: not sent containerImageID: not sent memoryUsedBytes: in the UI, this is displayed in the pod card that appears when you click on a pod, and will show no data. We will soon fix this by updating our charts to use memoryWorkingSetBytes instead. Volume: fsUsedBytes: zero, so fsUsedPercent is zero Known issues with the Windows Kubelet There are a couple of issues with the Windows version of Kubelet that can prevent the integration from fetching data: Issue 90554: This issue makes the Kubelet return 500 errors when the integration makes a request to the /stats/summary endpoint. It will be included in the Kubernetes 1.19 release and has been backported to the releases 1.16.11, 1.17.7, and 1.18.4. There is no solution on the integration side for this problem, we advise you to update to one of the patch versions as soon as possible. You can see if you're being affected by this problem by enabling verbose logs and looking for messages of the type: error querying Kubelet. Get \"https://<KUBELET_IP>/stats/summary\": error calling kubelet endpoint. Got status code: 500 Copy Issue 87730: This issue makes the Kubelet metrics very slow when running minimal load. It makes the integration fail with a timeout error. A patch for this issue has been added for Kubernetes 1.18 and backported to 1.15.12, 1.16.9, and 1.17.5. We advise you to update to one of the patch versions as soon as possible. To mitigate this issue you can increase the integration timeout with the TIMEOUT config option.

      "body": "New Relic's Kubernetes integration gives you full observability into the health and performance of your environment, no matter whether you run Kubernetes on-premises or in the cloud. With our cluster explorer, you can cut through layers of complexity to see how your cluster is performing, from the heights of the control plane down to applications running on a single pod. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer: The cluster explorer is our powerful, fully visual answer to the challenges associated with running Kubernetes at a large scale. You can see the power of the Kubernetes integration in the cluster explorer, where the full picture of a cluster is made available on a single screen: nodes and pods are visualized according to their health and performance, with pending and alerting nodes in the innermost circles. Predefined alert conditions help you troubleshoot issues right from the start. Clicking each node reveals its status and how each app is performing. Get started: Install the Kubernetes integration We have an automated installer to help you with many types of installations: servers, virtual machines, and unprivileged environments. It can also help you with installations in managed services or platforms, but you'll need to review a few preliminary notes before getting started. Our automated installer will generate either a helm command or a set of plain manifests for you to install. Our automated installer: Allows users to select the cluster name and namespace for the installation. Allows users to selectively enable or disable bundling of Kube-state-metrics, a dependency of the Kubernetes integration. Allows users to seamlessly install our other products related to Kubernetes such as: Kubernetes events monitoring In-cluster prometheus services monitoring Service instrumentation without code changes using Pixie Automatically fills the required properties with the license keys the integration needs to work. Read the install docs Start the installer Tip If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the automated installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Why it matters Governing the complexity of Kubernetes can be challenging; there's so much going on at any given moment, with containers being created and deleted in a matter of minutes, applications crashing, and resources being consumed unexpectedly. Our integration helps you navigate Kubernetes abstractions across on-premises, cloud, and hybrid deployments. In New Relic, you can build your own charts and query all your Kubernetes data, which our integration collects by instrumenting the container orchestration layer. This gives you additional insight into nodes, namespaces, deployments, replica sets, pods, and containers. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: Using the query builder you can turn any query on Kubernetes data to clear visuals. With the Kubernetes integration you can also: Link your APM data to Kubernetes to measure the performance of your web and mobile applications, with metrics such as request rate, throughput, error rate, and availability. Monitor services running on Kubernetes, such as Apache, NGINX, Cassandra, and many more (see our tutorial for monitoring Redis on Kubernetes). Create new alert policies and alert conditions based on your Kubernetes data, or extend the predefined alert conditions. These features are in addition to the data New Relic already reports for containerized processes running on instrumented hosts. Navigate all your Kubernetes events The Kubernetes events integration, which is installed separately, watches for events happening in your Kubernetes clusters and sends those events to New Relic. Events data is then visualized in the cluster explorer. To set it up, check the Kubernetes events box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer > Events: Browse and filter all your Kubernetes events, and dig into application logs and infrastructure data. Bring your cluster logs to New Relic Our Kubernetes plugin for log monitoring can collect all your cluster's logs and send them to our platform, so that you can set up new alerts and charts. To set it up, check the Log data box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or you can create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "BETA FEATURE This feature is still in development, but we encourage you to try it out! You can use metrics from your New Relic account to autoscale applications and services in your Kubernetes cluster by deploying the New Relic Metrics Adapter. This adapter fetches the metric values from New Relic and makes them available for the Horizontal Pod Autoscalers. The newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter implements the external.metrics.k8s.io API to support the use of external metrics based New Relic NRQL queries results. Once deployed, the value for each configured metric is fetched using the NerdGraph API based on the configured NRQL query. The metrics adapter exposes the metrics over a secured endpoint with TLS. New Relic metrics adapter in a cluster. Requirements Kubernetes 1.16 or higher. The New Relic Kubernetes integration. New Relic's user API key. No other External Metrics Adapter installed in the cluster. Installation To install the New Relic Metrics Adapter, we provide the newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter Helm chart, which is also included in the nri-bundle chart used to deploy all New Relic Kubernetes components. Install the New Relic Metrics Adapter by running the following command: helm upgrade --install newrelic newrelic/nri-bundle \\ --namespace newrelic --create-namespace \\ --set global.licenseKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY \\ --set global.cluster=K8S_CLUSTER_NAME \\ --set infrastructure.enabled=true \\ --set prometheus.enabled=true \\ --set webhook.enabled=true \\ --set ksm.enabled=true \\ --set kubeEvents.enabled=true \\ --set metrics-adapter.enabled=true \\ --set newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.personalAPIKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_PERSONAL_API_KEY \\ --set newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.config.accountID=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID \\ --set newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.config.externalMetrics.external_metric_name.query=NRQL query Copy Please notice and adjust the following flags: metrics-adapter.enabled: Must be set to true so the metrics adapter chart is installed. newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.personalAPIKey: Must be set to valid New Relic Personal API key. newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.accountID: Must be set to valid New Relic account where metrics are going to be fetched from. newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.config.externalMetrics.<var>external_metric_name</var>.<var>query</var>: Adds a new external metric where: <var>external_metric_name</var>: The metric name. <var>query</var>: The base NRQL query that is used to get the value for the metric. Tip Alternatively, you can use a values.yaml file that can be passed to the helm command with the --values flag. Values files can contain all parameters needed to configure the metrics explained in the configuration section. Configuration You can configure multiple metrics in the metrics adapter and change some parameters to modify the behaviour of the metrics cache and filtering. To see the full list and descriptions of all parameters that can be modified, refer to the chart README.md and values.yaml files. How it works The following values enable the metrics adapter on the nri-bundle chart installation: metrics-adapter: enabled: true newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter: personalAPIKey: <Personal API Key> config: accountID: <Account ID> externalMetrics: nginx_average_requests: query: \"FROM Metric SELECT average(nginx.server.net.requestsPerSecond) SINCE 2 MINUTES AGO\" Copy Caution The default time span for metrics is 1h. Therefore, you should define queries with the SINCE clause to adjust the time span according to your environment and needs. There is an HPA consuming the external metric as follows: kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler apiVersion: autoscaling/v2beta2 metadata: name: nginx-scaler spec: scaleTargetRef: apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment name: nginx minReplicas: 1 maxReplicas: 10 metrics: - type: External external: metric: name: nginx_average_requests selector: matchLabels: k8s.namespaceName: nginx target: type: Value value: 10000 Copy Based on the HPA definition, the controller manager fetches the metrics from the external metrics API which are served by the New Relic metrics adapter. The New Relic metrics adapter receives the query including the nginx_average_requests metric name and all the selectors, and searches for a matching metric name in the internal memory based on the configured metrics. Then, it adds the selectors to the query to form a final query that is executed using NerdGraph to fetch the value from New Relic. The above example will generate a query like the following: FROM Metric SELECT average(nginx.server.net.requestsPerSecond) WHERE clusterName=<clusterName> AND `k8s.namespaceName`='nginx' SINCE 2 MINUTES AGO Copy Notice that a clusterName filter has been automatically added to the query to exclude metrics from other clusters in the same account. You can remove it by using the removeClusterFilter configuration parameter. Also the value is cached for a period of time defined by the cacheTTLSeconds configuration parameter, whose deafult is 30 seconds. Troubleshooting Get verbose logs Most common errors are displayed in the standard (non-verbose) logs. If you're doing a more in-depth investigation on your own or with New Relic Support, you can enable verbose mode. To get verbose logging details for an integration using Helm: Enable verbose logging: bash Copy $ helm upgrade -n <namespace> --reuse-values newrelic-bundle --set newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.verboseLog=true newrelic/nri-bundle Leave on verbose mode for a few minutes, or until enough activity has occurred. When you have the information you need, disable verbose logging: bash Copy $ helm upgrade --reuse-values newrelic-bundle --set newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.verboseLog=false newrelic/nri-bundle Caution Verbose mode increases significantly the amount of information sent to log files. Enable this mode temporarily, only for troubleshooting purposes, and reset the log level when finished. Get raw metrics Sometimes it's useful to get the list of available metrics and also to get the current value of an specific metric. To get the list of metrics available, run: bash Copy $ kubectl get --raw \"/apis/external.metrics.k8s.io/v1beta1/\" To get the value for a specific metric with a selector, run: bash Copy $ kubectl get --raw \"/apis/external.metrics.k8s.io/v1beta1/namespaces/*/<metric_name>?labelSelector=<selector_key>=<selector_value>\" Tip You must replace <metric_name>, <selector_key> and <selector_value> with your values. Metrics not working There are some usual errors that could cause a metric fail to retrieve the value. These errors are showed in the status of the metrics when you describe the HPA or are printed when you get the raw metrics directly. executing query: NRQL Syntax Error: Error at line...: The query that is being run has syntax errors. The same error message gives you the executed query and position of the error. You can try this query inside the New Relic query builder and correct the configuration from the adapter. extracting return value: expected first value to be of type \"float64\", got %!q(<nil>): The query doesn't return any value. The same error message gives you the executed query so you can try this query inside the New Relic query builder and correct the configuration from the adapter or the match selectors in the HPA.",

For more information about service levels, please refer to our Support Plan. Community forum The New Relic Community Forum is 100% free and open to anyone with a New Relic account. The community is a place where many customer questions have already been asked and answered. Answers come from our community of experienced users, New Relic Support Engineers, and dozens of other Relics who help answer questions and solve problems. If you want to ask a question, check the community - if your question has not already been answered, members of the community can help. Github We want everyone to monitor their systems, and we're contributing our technology back to the open-source community to make that happen. You can find all our open source projects in our Github repo. We're committed to open standards, open-sourcing all of our instrumentation, and engaging engineers where they are, in the communities they already belong to. For more information on support for Open Source projects, visit our Open Source Support Policy. Diagnostic tools New Relic offers a diagnostics utility that can automatically detect common problems with New Relic agents. If Diagnostics detects a problem, it suggests troubleshooting steps. New Relic Diagnostics can also automatically attach troubleshooting data to a New Relic Support ticket. We have also made available Troubleshooting Frameworks that step users through common troubleshooting questions. Support ticket Support is now available in the New Relic One Platform! Just click on the question mark at the top right of your New Relic One screen to surface contextual documentation and resources. Depending on the Service Level associated with your New Relic account, you may be eligible for ticketed support and can open a ticket without leaving the New Relic One Platform. As an alternative, customers eligible for ticketed support may also open a support ticket from the New Relic Support page We are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year to help you troubleshoot issues related to the New Relic One Platform and generally available New Relic Products as outlined below. Scope of support You can have confidence that the Products we make Generally Available are fully tested with the compatible environments outlined in New Relic Documentation. New Relic’s Global Technical Support provides assistance for: the New Relic One platform and its features and capabilities, New Relic's monitoring and observability solutions, and our alerting and Applied Intelligence features. For issues within Third Party tools, or when tools in your infrastructure aren't working together properly, Global Technical Support may reach a point where we must refer New Relic users to such Third Party or community for assistance. Support includes Troubleshooting problems on the New Relic One Platform Assistance with issues during installation & upgrade in compatible environments Guidance on implementation and configuration in compatible environments Troubleshooting problems with ingesting data into New Relic General usage and best practice guidelines Identifying bugs with New Relic Products Assistance in English or Japanese Only (Japanese customer Terms of Service) Support does not include Unsupported or incompatible environments & frameworks Our Products are fully tested with the compatible environments and installation frameworks, and we’re here to help you through issues that may arise with our Products within these compatible environments and frameworks. We cannot support installation or configuration of our Products in environments or frameworks that do not meet established compatibility requirements. But if you're looking for help customizing New Relic for your particular environment, New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can assist with unique configurations or environments. Software customizations We are eager to help troubleshoot issues with the Products and features we make generally available, and those categorized as New Relic’s Open Source Community Plus Projects. New Relic’s Global Technical Support does not support customizations, modifications, or extensions to our code. Customizations or extensions to New Relic’s Open Source Projects in other Project categories are supported by the developer community in GitHub. New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can assist with unique configurations or environments. Custom applications With New Relic One, users have the ability to extend beyond the curated dashboards and design custom applications tailored to your business. New Relic’s Global Technical Support team does not support custom applications. The New Relic Developer site provides guidance on building custom apps, and here are a growing number of open source apps that you can use to get started. Custom scripts & queries We are happy to help troubleshoot issues related to the New Relic One platform that may be causing issues with a script or query. We cannot provide solutions for specific script or query use cases. New Relic Documentation and New Relic University offer resources on how to construct custom scripts and queries. End of Life New Relic may EOL products in accordance with the EOL policy. We recommend upgrading to our newest versions so you can take advantage of recent capabilities and bug fixes. More details are available in our published End of Life Policy. Beta or Limited Release Our support team covers generally available New Relic Products. Products that are in Beta or Limited Release status are not considered “generally available.” If you are invited to participate in a Beta program, or are using a Limited Release component, your account team will be your point of contact for questions. Please contact your account representative directly. Troubleshooting of customer environment We want to help every customer get the most of their New Relic experience within what are increasingly complex environments. However, we can’t help with things we didn’t build. We cannot assist with administration, configuration, or troubleshooting of a customer environment. When in doubt, you can get in touch with us, and we’ll help verify whether an issue is with our Product within a supported environment so you know where to go next. Troubleshooting third-party tools & services New Relic integrates well with many Third Party tools and services; however, we cannot support tools and services not provided or licensed by New Relic. We’ll do our best to determine whether an issue is with New Relic’s Products or caused by something outside of our control and purview. Issues with installation or configuration of the Third Party tools and services themselves should be directed to the respective owner of that Third Party tool or service or to the developer community. The Community and GitHub are great resources for assistance with Third Party tools and services as well. Some account-related functions For security reasons, some account-related Product functions must be conducted by the New Relic user designated as the “account owner,” such as Enabling SSO and High-Security Mode, adding users, and upgrading user permissions. Product training We are here to help you solve problems you may encounter on the road to instrumenting everything. Global Technical Support cannot provide user training on New Relic Products. New Relic offers a well-curated library of documentation and in-depth tutorials organized by Product, skill level, learning format, and solutions to help you navigate the observability journey. Check out New Relic University! Consultancy services Global Technical Support is here to help our valued customers as outlined in these support offerings. If you need help with something that falls outside of the Scope of Support, New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can help you navigate the challenges of building modern software and adopting the latest technologies, so you can focus on what you do best: delivering an incredible experience to your customers. Important As of March 10, 2021, you're no longer able to create a New Relic support ticket by emailing support@newrelic.com.

We're committed to open standards, open-sourcing all of our instrumentation, and engaging engineers where they are, in the communities they already belong to.

      "body": "This document is about the New Relic One pricing plan. For an explanation of how that plan works, see New Relic One pricing. The document below goes into license-level details. The Usage Plan applies to (i) your Pay As You Go subscription, or (ii) your Commitment Term for the Annual Pool of Funds subscription (see a description of these two plans). New Relic may modify the Usage Plan from time to time. Any changes to the Usage Plan will become effective immediately for changes that provide a benefit or right to the Customer, all other changes will become effective if Customer assents or upon any new or renewal Commitment Term. Usage Plan - Effective as October 21, 2021: The Order and Usage Plan may contain defined terms that are denoted by capitalization. In the event that a capitalized term is not defined in either the Order or the Usage Plan, such terms shall have the meaning set forth in the New Relic One pricing definitions page. Pay As You Go By electing and subscribing to the Pay As You Go subscription model (“Pay As You Go” or “PAYG”), Customer commits to paying for the New Relic Products on a month-to-month consumption basis. Monthly Product Usage will be invoiced regardless if a PO is required or not. Any Customer dispute to Monthly Product Usage from the prior month must be in good-faith and received by New Relic in writing within three (3) business days of the start of the next month or such dispute notice will be considered invalid. The dispute notice will set forth in reasonable detail the information concerning the disputed charges. The parties will use good-faith efforts to promptly resolve any disputed charges. Customer’s usage of the Products in excess of the Free Tier each month shall be billed in arrears on the first business day of the following month based on the Customer’s Per Unit usage of each Product each month multiplied by the corresponding rates set forth in an Order and summed (“Monthly Product Usage”). Annual Pool of Funds By electing and subscribing to the Annual Pool of Funds subscription model (“Annual Pool of Funds” or “APoF”) for the Commitment Term, Customer commits in an Order to: (i) paying the Commitment Fee amounts described in the Subscription table and any additional commitment fees set forth; and (ii) the Monthly Discounted Fee Rates applying to Customer’s Monthly Product Usage. New Relic will invoice the Commitment Fee as per the ‘Billing Terms’ described in an Order. On a monthly cadence during the Commitment Term, Customer’s Per Unit usage of the Products will be multiplied by the corresponding Monthly Discounted Rate and summed (“Monthly Product Usage”). Monthly Product Usage will be deducted from the Commitment Fee amounts that are paid in advance. If Monthly Product Usage exceeds any such remaining unconsumed amounts, Customer will be invoiced for the difference (“Additional Usage”), including for any Monthly Product Usage during the last month of the Commitment Term. Payment of such invoices will be governed as set forth in the Terms. Any Customer dispute to Monthly Product Usage from the prior month must be in good-faith and received by New Relic in writing within three (3) business days of the start of the next month (including for any Monthly Product Usage for the last month of the Commitment Term) or such dispute notice will be considered invalid. The dispute notice will set forth in reasonable detail the information concerning the disputed charges. The parties will use good-faith efforts to promptly resolve any disputed charges. Any unconsumed balances from the Customer payment of each annual Commitment Fee and any additional payments, if applicable, as set out in an Order will expire and lapse at the end of each year of the Commitment Term. Applicable Invoicing and Order Terms All amounts stated in an Order are non-cancelable payment obligations of the Customer for the Commitment Term regardless of usage. Any fees paid are non-refundable and do not represent a deposit for, or a credit towards, the purchase of other products not specified in an Order or for any purchase after the Commitment Term. Customer acknowledges that a final payment for the full outstanding amount of any remaining unpaid Commitment Fee and/or Monthly Product Usage Fee may be invoiced upon each anniversary date of the term start date. Tax will be added where applicable. New Relic may review Customer's use of the Products at any time. If New Relic identifies any Customer usage of the Product(s) that is not in accordance with the Terms or Documentation, New Relic may suspend such unauthorized usage. All existing purchases and related pricing in effect prior to the execution of an Order shall remain in force. Unless otherwise stated in an Order, an Order does not modify or amend any existing purchases. Additional future products or quantities are not subject to promotional pricing unless otherwise stated in an Order. In the event that a Customer indicates in an Order that it requires a purchase order (“PO”) for its subscription, Customer agrees to provide the required PO prior to the provisioning of the Products. If a Customer does not indicate a PO is required, Customer agrees that New Relic may issue invoice(s) and is entitled to such payment without a PO reference. All Additional Usage fees will be invoiced regardless of a PO requirement. The Product(s) are deemed accepted upon its provisioning. User Accounts Use of the Products require Customer users to create Login Credentials. Customer user Login Credential information must be accurate, current, and complete. New Relic’s use and collection of Login Credentials (in accordance with its General Data Privacy Notice) is for account and product management and support of its customers. Customer and Customer users must abide by the New Relic Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) and Login Credentials may not be shared. Each Customer user must have their own user account. Entry into an Order indicates your agreement that the amount of provisioned users (at the rate specified in the Order) applies in lieu of and supersedes any other amount of users of the Products that may be specified in the agreement between Customer and New Relic. New Relic One Pro and Enterprise Service Level Availability Commitment With a subscription to \"New Relic One - Pro Users\" or \"New Relic One - Enterprise Users,\" you agree that during the Commitment Term the applicable service level availability commitment set forth on the ‘Service level availability commitment’ page in the Documentation shall apply to the Products. For clarity, if your agreement with New Relic contains a different service level availability commitment or remedies, the above does not apply to your subscription to the \"New Relic One - Pro Users\" or \"New Relic One - Enterprise Users\". If you subscribe to any other New Relic Products with New Relic One pricing, any service level availability commitment or related remedies contained within your agreement with New Relic are vacated and nullified, and New Relic will use commercially reasonable efforts to make \"New Relic One - Standard Users\" available in line with industry standards. New Relic One Pro and Enterprise Support Plans With a subscription to New Relic One Users, New Relic provides an updated support plan commitment. By subscribing to New Relic One Users, you agree that during the Commitment Term the applicable Support Plan set forth on the ‘Support plan’ page in the Documentation shall apply in lieu of, and supersedes and replaces, any other support related commitments that may be contained within your agreement with New Relic. For New Relic K.K. customers (Japan), the above does not currently apply to the support offerings provided by New Relic to you. Free tier, ‘lite’, no-charge, preview access, New Relic One - Data, New Relic One - Standard User subscriptions If you are using New Relic’s Products in the free tier only, or on a no-charge, or a ‘lite’ or ‘preview access’ basis you agree that the Unpaid Terms of Service will apply to such Product usage and replace and supersede any other terms. In addition, if your subscription contains the \"New Relic One - Standard Users Product,\" you agree that the Paid Terms of Service will apply to your subscription to the Products set forth in an Order and replace and supersede any other terms. Separate Platforms Customer access to any separate platforms for purposes of applicability of governing terms, such as Community Cloud for Pixie or CodeStream, is subject to their respective terms of service. If you enable a separate platform with New Relic One, New Relic may access and exchange Customer Data with the separate platform on your behalf. For clarity, such other platforms do not form part of the New Relic One offering and, unless otherwise expressly provided in the terms and then only to the extent provided, New Relic One warranties, indemnities, etc., do not apply to use of any other platforms for purposes of applicability of governing terms. Separate platforms are not intended to meet any legal obligations for Prohibited Data uses. Further, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by New Relic, (a) for users of separate platforms, New Relic is neither a Business Associate or a subcontractor (as defined under HIPAA), nor a payment card processor, and (b) separate platforms are neither HIPAA nor PCI DSS compliant.",

New Relic One Pro and Enterprise Service Level Availability Commitment With a subscription to \"New Relic One - Pro Users\" or \"New Relic One - Enterprise Users,\" you agree that during the Commitment Term the applicable service level availability commitment set forth on the ‘Service level availability commitment’ page in the Documentation shall apply to the Products. For clarity, if your agreement with New Relic contains a different service level availability commitment or remedies, the above does not apply to your subscription to the \"New Relic One - Pro Users\" or \"New Relic One - Enterprise Users\". If you subscribe to any other New Relic Products with New Relic One pricing, any service level availability commitment or related remedies contained within your agreement with New Relic are vacated and nullified, and New Relic will use commercially reasonable efforts to make \"New Relic One - Standard Users\" available in line with industry standards. New Relic One Pro and Enterprise Support Plans With a subscription to New Relic One Users, New Relic provides an updated support plan commitment. By subscribing to New Relic One Users, you agree that during the Commitment Term the applicable Support Plan set forth on the ‘Support plan’ page in the Documentation shall apply in lieu of, and supersedes and replaces, any other support related commitments that may be contained within your agreement with New Relic. For New Relic K.K. customers (Japan), the above does not currently apply to the support offerings provided by New Relic to you. Free tier, ‘lite’, no-charge, preview access, New Relic One - Data, New Relic One - Standard User subscriptions If you are using New Relic’s Products in the free tier only, or on a no-charge, or a ‘lite’ or ‘preview access’ basis you agree that the Unpaid Terms of Service will apply to such Product usage and replace and supersede any other terms. In addition, if your subscription contains the \"New Relic One - Standard Users Product,\" you agree that the Paid Terms of Service will apply to your subscription to the Products set forth in an Order and replace and supersede any other terms. Separate Platforms Customer access to any separate platforms for purposes of applicability of governing terms, such as Community Cloud for Pixie or CodeStream, is subject to their respective terms of service. If you enable a separate platform with New Relic One, New Relic may access and exchange Customer Data with the separate platform on your behalf. For clarity, such other platforms do not form part of the New Relic One offering and, unless otherwise expressly provided in the terms and then only to the extent provided, New Relic One warranties, indemnities, etc., do not apply to use of any other platforms for purposes of applicability of governing terms. Separate platforms are not intended to meet any legal obligations for Prohibited Data uses. Further, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by New Relic, (a) for users of separate platforms, New Relic is neither a Business Associate or a subcontractor (as defined under HIPAA), nor a payment card processor, and (b) separate platforms are neither HIPAA nor PCI DSS compliant.",

      "body": "This document is about the New Relic One pricing plan. For an explanation of how that plan works, see New Relic One pricing. The document below goes into license-level details. The Usage Plan applies to (i) your Pay As You Go subscription, or (ii) your Commitment Term for the Annual Pool of Funds subscription (see a description of these two plans). New Relic may modify the Usage Plan from time to time. Any changes to the Usage Plan will become effective immediately for changes that provide a benefit or right to the Customer, all other changes will become effective if Customer assents or upon any new or renewal Commitment Term. Usage Plan - Effective as October 21, 2021: The Order and Usage Plan may contain defined terms that are denoted by capitalization. In the event that a capitalized term is not defined in either the Order or the Usage Plan, such terms shall have the meaning set forth in the New Relic One pricing definitions page. Pay As You Go By electing and subscribing to the Pay As You Go subscription model (“Pay As You Go” or “PAYG”), Customer commits to paying for the New Relic Products on a month-to-month consumption basis. Monthly Product Usage will be invoiced regardless if a PO is required or not. Any Customer dispute to Monthly Product Usage from the prior month must be in good-faith and received by New Relic in writing within three (3) business days of the start of the next month or such dispute notice will be considered invalid. The dispute notice will set forth in reasonable detail the information concerning the disputed charges. The parties will use good-faith efforts to promptly resolve any disputed charges. Customer’s usage of the Products in excess of the Free Tier each month shall be billed in arrears on the first business day of the following month based on the Customer’s Per Unit usage of each Product each month multiplied by the corresponding rates set forth in an Order and summed (“Monthly Product Usage”). Annual Pool of Funds By electing and subscribing to the Annual Pool of Funds subscription model (“Annual Pool of Funds” or “APoF”) for the Commitment Term, Customer commits in an Order to: (i) paying the Commitment Fee amounts described in the Subscription table and any additional commitment fees set forth; and (ii) the Monthly Discounted Fee Rates applying to Customer’s Monthly Product Usage. New Relic will invoice the Commitment Fee as per the ‘Billing Terms’ described in an Order. On a monthly cadence during the Commitment Term, Customer’s Per Unit usage of the Products will be multiplied by the corresponding Monthly Discounted Rate and summed (“Monthly Product Usage”). Monthly Product Usage will be deducted from the Commitment Fee amounts that are paid in advance. If Monthly Product Usage exceeds any such remaining unconsumed amounts, Customer will be invoiced for the difference (“Additional Usage”), including for any Monthly Product Usage during the last month of the Commitment Term. Payment of such invoices will be governed as set forth in the Terms. Any Customer dispute to Monthly Product Usage from the prior month must be in good-faith and received by New Relic in writing within three (3) business days of the start of the next month (including for any Monthly Product Usage for the last month of the Commitment Term) or such dispute notice will be considered invalid. The dispute notice will set forth in reasonable detail the information concerning the disputed charges. The parties will use good-faith efforts to promptly resolve any disputed charges. Any unconsumed balances from the Customer payment of each annual Commitment Fee and any additional payments, if applicable, as set out in an Order will expire and lapse at the end of each year of the Commitment Term. Applicable Invoicing and Order Terms All amounts stated in an Order are non-cancelable payment obligations of the Customer for the Commitment Term regardless of usage. Any fees paid are non-refundable and do not represent a deposit for, or a credit towards, the purchase of other products not specified in an Order or for any purchase after the Commitment Term. Customer acknowledges that a final payment for the full outstanding amount of any remaining unpaid Commitment Fee and/or Monthly Product Usage Fee may be invoiced upon each anniversary date of the term start date. Tax will be added where applicable. New Relic may review Customer's use of the Products at any time. If New Relic identifies any Customer usage of the Product(s) that is not in accordance with the Terms or Documentation, New Relic may suspend such unauthorized usage. All existing purchases and related pricing in effect prior to the execution of an Order shall remain in force. Unless otherwise stated in an Order, an Order does not modify or amend any existing purchases. Additional future products or quantities are not subject to promotional pricing unless otherwise stated in an Order. In the event that a Customer indicates in an Order that it requires a purchase order (“PO”) for its subscription, Customer agrees to provide the required PO prior to the provisioning of the Products. If a Customer does not indicate a PO is required, Customer agrees that New Relic may issue invoice(s) and is entitled to such payment without a PO reference. All Additional Usage fees will be invoiced regardless of a PO requirement. The Product(s) are deemed accepted upon its provisioning. User Accounts Use of the Products require Customer users to create Login Credentials. Customer user Login Credential information must be accurate, current, and complete. New Relic’s use and collection of Login Credentials (in accordance with its General Data Privacy Notice) is for account and product management and support of its customers. Customer and Customer users must abide by the New Relic Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) and Login Credentials may not be shared. Each Customer user must have their own user account. Entry into an Order indicates your agreement that the amount of provisioned users (at the rate specified in the Order) applies in lieu of and supersedes any other amount of users of the Products that may be specified in the agreement between Customer and New Relic. New Relic One Pro and Enterprise Service Level Availability Commitment With a subscription to \"New Relic One - Pro Users\" or \"New Relic One - Enterprise Users,\" you agree that during the Commitment Term the applicable service level availability commitment set forth on the ‘Service level availability commitment’ page in the Documentation shall apply to the Products.

Any changes to the Usage Plan will become effective immediately for changes that provide a benefit or right to the Customer, all other changes will become effective if Customer assents or upon any new or renewal Commitment Term. Usage Plan - Effective as October 21, 2021: The Order and Usage Plan may contain defined terms that are denoted by capitalization. In the event that a capitalized term is not defined in either the Order or the Usage Plan, such terms shall have the meaning set forth in the New Relic One pricing definitions page. Pay As You Go By electing and subscribing to the Pay As You Go subscription model (“Pay As You Go” or “PAYG”), Customer commits to paying for the New Relic Products on a month-to-month consumption basis. Monthly Product Usage will be invoiced regardless if a PO is required or not. Any Customer dispute to Monthly Product Usage from the prior month must be in good-faith and received by New Relic in writing within three (3) business days of the start of the next month or such dispute notice will be considered invalid. The dispute notice will set forth in reasonable detail the information concerning the disputed charges. The parties will use good-faith efforts to promptly resolve any disputed charges. Customer’s usage of the Products in excess of the Free Tier each month shall be billed in arrears on the first business day of the following month based on the Customer’s Per Unit usage of each Product each month multiplied by the corresponding rates set forth in an Order and summed (“Monthly Product Usage”). Annual Pool of Funds By electing and subscribing to the Annual Pool of Funds subscription model (“Annual Pool of Funds” or “APoF”) for the Commitment Term, Customer commits in an Order to: (i) paying the Commitment Fee amounts described in the Subscription table and any additional commitment fees set forth; and (ii) the Monthly Discounted Fee Rates applying to Customer’s Monthly Product Usage. New Relic will invoice the Commitment Fee as per the ‘Billing Terms’ described in an Order. On a monthly cadence during the Commitment Term, Customer’s Per Unit usage of the Products will be multiplied by the corresponding Monthly Discounted Rate and summed (“Monthly Product Usage”). Monthly Product Usage will be deducted from the Commitment Fee amounts that are paid in advance. If Monthly Product Usage exceeds any such remaining unconsumed amounts, Customer will be invoiced for the difference (“Additional Usage”), including for any Monthly Product Usage during the last month of the Commitment Term. Payment of such invoices will be governed as set forth in the Terms. Any Customer dispute to Monthly Product Usage from the prior month must be in good-faith and received by New Relic in writing within three (3) business days of the start of the next month (including for any Monthly Product Usage for the last month of the Commitment Term) or such dispute notice will be considered invalid. The dispute notice will set forth in reasonable detail the information concerning the disputed charges. The parties will use good-faith efforts to promptly resolve any disputed charges. Any unconsumed balances from the Customer payment of each annual Commitment Fee and any additional payments, if applicable, as set out in an Order will expire and lapse at the end of each year of the Commitment Term. Applicable Invoicing and Order Terms All amounts stated in an Order are non-cancelable payment obligations of the Customer for the Commitment Term regardless of usage. Any fees paid are non-refundable and do not represent a deposit for, or a credit towards, the purchase of other products not specified in an Order or for any purchase after the Commitment Term. Customer acknowledges that a final payment for the full outstanding amount of any remaining unpaid Commitment Fee and/or Monthly Product Usage Fee may be invoiced upon each anniversary date of the term start date. Tax will be added where applicable. New Relic may review Customer's use of the Products at any time. If New Relic identifies any Customer usage of the Product(s) that is not in accordance with the Terms or Documentation, New Relic may suspend such unauthorized usage. All existing purchases and related pricing in effect prior to the execution of an Order shall remain in force. Unless otherwise stated in an Order, an Order does not modify or amend any existing purchases. Additional future products or quantities are not subject to promotional pricing unless otherwise stated in an Order. In the event that a Customer indicates in an Order that it requires a purchase order (“PO”) for its subscription, Customer agrees to provide the required PO prior to the provisioning of the Products. If a Customer does not indicate a PO is required, Customer agrees that New Relic may issue invoice(s) and is entitled to such payment without a PO reference. All Additional Usage fees will be invoiced regardless of a PO requirement. The Product(s) are deemed accepted upon its provisioning. User Accounts Use of the Products require Customer users to create Login Credentials. Customer user Login Credential information must be accurate, current, and complete. New Relic’s use and collection of Login Credentials (in accordance with its General Data Privacy Notice) is for account and product management and support of its customers. Customer and Customer users must abide by the New Relic Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) and Login Credentials may not be shared. Each Customer user must have their own user account. Entry into an Order indicates your agreement that the amount of provisioned users (at the rate specified in the Order) applies in lieu of and supersedes any other amount of users of the Products that may be specified in the agreement between Customer and New Relic. New Relic One Pro and Enterprise Service Level Availability Commitment With a subscription to \"New Relic One - Pro Users\" or \"New Relic One - Enterprise Users,\" you agree that during the Commitment Term the applicable service level availability commitment set forth on the ‘Service level availability commitment’ page in the Documentation shall apply to the Products. For clarity, if your agreement with New Relic contains a different service level availability commitment or remedies, the above does not apply to your subscription to the \"New Relic One - Pro Users\" or \"New Relic One - Enterprise Users\". If you subscribe to any other New Relic Products with New Relic One pricing, any service level availability commitment or related remedies contained within your agreement with New Relic are vacated and nullified, and New Relic will use commercially reasonable efforts to make \"New Relic One - Standard Users\" available in line with industry standards. New Relic One Pro and Enterprise Support Plans With a subscription to New Relic One Users, New Relic provides an updated support plan commitment. By subscribing to New Relic One Users, you agree that during the Commitment Term the applicable Support Plan set forth on the ‘Support plan’ page in the Documentation shall apply in lieu of, and supersedes and replaces, any other support related commitments that may be contained within your agreement with New Relic. For New Relic K.K. customers (Japan), the above does not currently apply to the support offerings provided by New Relic to you. Free tier, ‘lite’, no-charge, preview access, New Relic One - Data, New Relic One - Standard User subscriptions If you are using New Relic’s Products in the free tier only, or on a no-charge, or a ‘lite’ or ‘preview access’ basis you agree that the Unpaid Terms of Service will apply to such Product usage and replace and supersede any other terms. In addition, if your subscription contains the \"New Relic One - Standard Users Product,\" you agree that the Paid Terms of Service will apply to your subscription to the Products set forth in an Order and replace and supersede any other terms. Separate Platforms Customer access to any separate platforms for purposes of applicability of governing terms, such as Community Cloud for Pixie or CodeStream, is subject to their respective terms of service. If you enable a separate platform with New Relic One, New Relic may access and exchange Customer Data with the separate platform on your behalf. For clarity, such other platforms do not form part of the New Relic One offering and, unless otherwise expressly provided in the terms and then only to the extent provided, New Relic One warranties, indemnities, etc., do not apply to use of any other platforms for purposes of applicability of governing terms. Separate platforms are not intended to meet any legal obligations for Prohibited Data uses. Further, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by New Relic, (a) for users of separate platforms, New Relic is neither a Business Associate or a subcontractor (as defined under HIPAA), nor a payment card processor, and (b) separate platforms are neither HIPAA nor PCI DSS compliant.",

The community is a place where many customer questions have already been asked and answered. Answers come from our community of experienced users, New Relic Support Engineers, and dozens of other Relics who help answer questions and solve problems. If you want to ask a question, check the community - if your question has not already been answered, members of the community can help. Github We want everyone to monitor their systems, and we're contributing our technology back to the open-source community to make that happen. You can find all our open source projects in our Github repo. We're committed to open standards, open-sourcing all of our instrumentation, and engaging engineers where they are, in the communities they already belong to. For more information on support for Open Source projects, visit our Open Source Support Policy. Diagnostic tools New Relic offers a diagnostics utility that can automatically detect common problems with New Relic agents. If Diagnostics detects a problem, it suggests troubleshooting steps. New Relic Diagnostics can also automatically attach troubleshooting data to a New Relic Support ticket. We have also made available Troubleshooting Frameworks that step users through common troubleshooting questions. Support ticket Support is now available in the New Relic One Platform! Just click on the question mark at the top right of your New Relic One screen to surface contextual documentation and resources. Depending on the Service Level associated with your New Relic account, you may be eligible for ticketed support and can open a ticket without leaving the New Relic One Platform. As an alternative, customers eligible for ticketed support may also open a support ticket from the New Relic Support page We are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year to help you troubleshoot issues related to the New Relic One Platform and generally available New Relic Products as outlined below. Scope of support You can have confidence that the Products we make Generally Available are fully tested with the compatible environments outlined in New Relic Documentation. New Relic’s Global Technical Support provides assistance for: the New Relic One platform and its features and capabilities, New Relic's monitoring and observability solutions, and our alerting and Applied Intelligence features. For issues within Third Party tools, or when tools in your infrastructure aren't working together properly, Global Technical Support may reach a point where we must refer New Relic users to such Third Party or community for assistance. Support includes Troubleshooting problems on the New Relic One Platform Assistance with issues during installation & upgrade in compatible environments Guidance on implementation and configuration in compatible environments Troubleshooting problems with ingesting data into New Relic General usage and best practice guidelines Identifying bugs with New Relic Products Assistance in English or Japanese Only (Japanese customer Terms of Service) Support does not include Unsupported or incompatible environments & frameworks Our Products are fully tested with the compatible environments and installation frameworks, and we’re here to help you through issues that may arise with our Products within these compatible environments and frameworks. We cannot support installation or configuration of our Products in environments or frameworks that do not meet established compatibility requirements. But if you're looking for help customizing New Relic for your particular environment, New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can assist with unique configurations or environments. Software customizations We are eager to help troubleshoot issues with the Products and features we make generally available, and those categorized as New Relic’s Open Source Community Plus Projects. New Relic’s Global Technical Support does not support customizations, modifications, or extensions to our code. Customizations or extensions to New Relic’s Open Source Projects in other Project categories are supported by the developer community in GitHub. New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can assist with unique configurations or environments. Custom applications With New Relic One, users have the ability to extend beyond the curated dashboards and design custom applications tailored to your business. New Relic’s Global Technical Support team does not support custom applications. The New Relic Developer site provides guidance on building custom apps, and here are a growing number of open source apps that you can use to get started. Custom scripts & queries We are happy to help troubleshoot issues related to the New Relic One platform that may be causing issues with a script or query. We cannot provide solutions for specific script or query use cases. New Relic Documentation and New Relic University offer resources on how to construct custom scripts and queries. End of Life New Relic may EOL products in accordance with the EOL policy. We recommend upgrading to our newest versions so you can take advantage of recent capabilities and bug fixes. More details are available in our published End of Life Policy. Beta or Limited Release Our support team covers generally available New Relic Products. Products that are in Beta or Limited Release status are not considered “generally available.” If you are invited to participate in a Beta program, or are using a Limited Release component, your account team will be your point of contact for questions. Please contact your account representative directly. Troubleshooting of customer environment We want to help every customer get the most of their New Relic experience within what are increasingly complex environments. However, we can’t help with things we didn’t build. We cannot assist with administration, configuration, or troubleshooting of a customer environment. When in doubt, you can get in touch with us, and we’ll help verify whether an issue is with our Product within a supported environment so you know where to go next. Troubleshooting third-party tools & services New Relic integrates well with many Third Party tools and services; however, we cannot support tools and services not provided or licensed by New Relic. We’ll do our best to determine whether an issue is with New Relic’s Products or caused by something outside of our control and purview. Issues with installation or configuration of the Third Party tools and services themselves should be directed to the respective owner of that Third Party tool or service or to the developer community. The Community and GitHub are great resources for assistance with Third Party tools and services as well. Some account-related functions For security reasons, some account-related Product functions must be conducted by the New Relic user designated as the “account owner,” such as Enabling SSO and High-Security Mode, adding users, and upgrading user permissions. Product training We are here to help you solve problems you may encounter on the road to instrumenting everything. Global Technical Support cannot provide user training on New Relic Products. New Relic offers a well-curated library of documentation and in-depth tutorials organized by Product, skill level, learning format, and solutions to help you navigate the observability journey. Check out New Relic University! Consultancy services Global Technical Support is here to help our valued customers as outlined in these support offerings. If you need help with something that falls outside of the Scope of Support, New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can help you navigate the challenges of building modern software and adopting the latest technologies, so you can focus on what you do best: delivering an incredible experience to your customers.

For more information on support for Open Source projects, visit our Open Source Support Policy. Diagnostic tools New Relic offers a diagnostics utility that can automatically detect common problems with New Relic agents. If Diagnostics detects a problem, it suggests troubleshooting steps. New Relic Diagnostics can also automatically attach troubleshooting data to a New Relic Support ticket. We have also made available Troubleshooting Frameworks that step users through common troubleshooting questions. Support ticket Support is now available in the New Relic One Platform! Just click on the question mark at the top right of your New Relic One screen to surface contextual documentation and resources. Depending on the Service Level associated with your New Relic account, you may be eligible for ticketed support and can open a ticket without leaving the New Relic One Platform. As an alternative, customers eligible for ticketed support may also open a support ticket from the New Relic Support page We are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year to help you troubleshoot issues related to the New Relic One Platform and generally available New Relic Products as outlined below. Scope of support You can have confidence that the Products we make Generally Available are fully tested with the compatible environments outlined in New Relic Documentation. New Relic’s Global Technical Support provides assistance for: the New Relic One platform and its features and capabilities, New Relic's monitoring and observability solutions, and our alerting and Applied Intelligence features. For issues within Third Party tools, or when tools in your infrastructure aren't working together properly, Global Technical Support may reach a point where we must refer New Relic users to such Third Party or community for assistance. Support includes Troubleshooting problems on the New Relic One Platform Assistance with issues during installation & upgrade in compatible environments Guidance on implementation and configuration in compatible environments Troubleshooting problems with ingesting data into New Relic General usage and best practice guidelines Identifying bugs with New Relic Products Assistance in English or Japanese Only (Japanese customer Terms of Service) Support does not include Unsupported or incompatible environments & frameworks Our Products are fully tested with the compatible environments and installation frameworks, and we’re here to help you through issues that may arise with our Products within these compatible environments and frameworks. We cannot support installation or configuration of our Products in environments or frameworks that do not meet established compatibility requirements. But if you're looking for help customizing New Relic for your particular environment, New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can assist with unique configurations or environments. Software customizations We are eager to help troubleshoot issues with the Products and features we make generally available, and those categorized as New Relic’s Open Source Community Plus Projects. New Relic’s Global Technical Support does not support customizations, modifications, or extensions to our code. Customizations or extensions to New Relic’s Open Source Projects in other Project categories are supported by the developer community in GitHub. New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can assist with unique configurations or environments. Custom applications With New Relic One, users have the ability to extend beyond the curated dashboards and design custom applications tailored to your business. New Relic’s Global Technical Support team does not support custom applications. The New Relic Developer site provides guidance on building custom apps, and here are a growing number of open source apps that you can use to get started. Custom scripts & queries We are happy to help troubleshoot issues related to the New Relic One platform that may be causing issues with a script or query. We cannot provide solutions for specific script or query use cases. New Relic Documentation and New Relic University offer resources on how to construct custom scripts and queries. End of Life New Relic may EOL products in accordance with the EOL policy. We recommend upgrading to our newest versions so you can take advantage of recent capabilities and bug fixes. More details are available in our published End of Life Policy. Beta or Limited Release Our support team covers generally available New Relic Products. Products that are in Beta or Limited Release status are not considered “generally available.” If you are invited to participate in a Beta program, or are using a Limited Release component, your account team will be your point of contact for questions. Please contact your account representative directly. Troubleshooting of customer environment We want to help every customer get the most of their New Relic experience within what are increasingly complex environments. However, we can’t help with things we didn’t build. We cannot assist with administration, configuration, or troubleshooting of a customer environment. When in doubt, you can get in touch with us, and we’ll help verify whether an issue is with our Product within a supported environment so you know where to go next. Troubleshooting third-party tools & services New Relic integrates well with many Third Party tools and services; however, we cannot support tools and services not provided or licensed by New Relic. We’ll do our best to determine whether an issue is with New Relic’s Products or caused by something outside of our control and purview. Issues with installation or configuration of the Third Party tools and services themselves should be directed to the respective owner of that Third Party tool or service or to the developer community. The Community and GitHub are great resources for assistance with Third Party tools and services as well. Some account-related functions For security reasons, some account-related Product functions must be conducted by the New Relic user designated as the “account owner,” such as Enabling SSO and High-Security Mode, adding users, and upgrading user permissions. Product training We are here to help you solve problems you may encounter on the road to instrumenting everything. Global Technical Support cannot provide user training on New Relic Products. New Relic offers a well-curated library of documentation and in-depth tutorials organized by Product, skill level, learning format, and solutions to help you navigate the observability journey. Check out New Relic University! Consultancy services Global Technical Support is here to help our valued customers as outlined in these support offerings. If you need help with something that falls outside of the Scope of Support, New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can help you navigate the challenges of building modern software and adopting the latest technologies, so you can focus on what you do best: delivering an incredible experience to your customers.

Or by mail at: Attn: Legal New Relic, Inc. 188 Spear Street, Suite 1200 San Francisco, CA 94105 This AUP, and our customers’ compliance with it, is essential for enabling us to provide you and our other customers with the New Relic Properties, which we take very seriously. You are wholly and solely responsible for appropriate configuration of systems and software that you own or can control to ensure your compliance with this AUP. So, if we determine in our sole discretion that you have violated this AUP, we may, without limiting any other remedies available to us, permanently or temporarily suspend, limit, or terminate your access to the New Relic Properties without notice or liability. This right applies even if the breach is unintentional or unauthorized if we believe that any such suspension, limitation, or termination is necessary to ensure compliance with laws, or to protect the rights, safety, privacy, security, or property of us or others.

For more information about service levels, please refer to our Support Plan. Community forum The New Relic Community Forum is 100% free and open to anyone with a New Relic account. The community is a place where many customer questions have already been asked and answered. Answers come from our community of experienced users, New Relic Support Engineers, and dozens of other Relics who help answer questions and solve problems. If you want to ask a question, check the community - if your question has not already been answered, members of the community can help. Github We want everyone to monitor their systems, and we're contributing our technology back to the open-source community to make that happen. You can find all our open source projects in our Github repo. We're committed to open standards, open-sourcing all of our instrumentation, and engaging engineers where they are, in the communities they already belong to. For more information on support for Open Source projects, visit our Open Source Support Policy. Diagnostic tools New Relic offers a diagnostics utility that can automatically detect common problems with New Relic agents. If Diagnostics detects a problem, it suggests troubleshooting steps. New Relic Diagnostics can also automatically attach troubleshooting data to a New Relic Support ticket. We have also made available Troubleshooting Frameworks that step users through common troubleshooting questions. Support ticket Support is now available in the New Relic One Platform! Just click on the question mark at the top right of your New Relic One screen to surface contextual documentation and resources. Depending on the Service Level associated with your New Relic account, you may be eligible for ticketed support and can open a ticket without leaving the New Relic One Platform. As an alternative, customers eligible for ticketed support may also open a support ticket from the New Relic Support page We are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year to help you troubleshoot issues related to the New Relic One Platform and generally available New Relic Products as outlined below. Scope of support You can have confidence that the Products we make Generally Available are fully tested with the compatible environments outlined in New Relic Documentation. New Relic’s Global Technical Support provides assistance for: the New Relic One platform and its features and capabilities, New Relic's monitoring and observability solutions, and our alerting and Applied Intelligence features. For issues within Third Party tools, or when tools in your infrastructure aren't working together properly, Global Technical Support may reach a point where we must refer New Relic users to such Third Party or community for assistance. Support includes Troubleshooting problems on the New Relic One Platform Assistance with issues during installation & upgrade in compatible environments Guidance on implementation and configuration in compatible environments Troubleshooting problems with ingesting data into New Relic General usage and best practice guidelines Identifying bugs with New Relic Products Assistance in English or Japanese Only (Japanese customer Terms of Service) Support does not include Unsupported or incompatible environments & frameworks Our Products are fully tested with the compatible environments and installation frameworks, and we’re here to help you through issues that may arise with our Products within these compatible environments and frameworks. We cannot support installation or configuration of our Products in environments or frameworks that do not meet established compatibility requirements. But if you're looking for help customizing New Relic for your particular environment, New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can assist with unique configurations or environments. Software customizations We are eager to help troubleshoot issues with the Products and features we make generally available, and those categorized as New Relic’s Open Source Community Plus Projects. New Relic’s Global Technical Support does not support customizations, modifications, or extensions to our code. Customizations or extensions to New Relic’s Open Source Projects in other Project categories are supported by the developer community in GitHub. New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can assist with unique configurations or environments. Custom applications With New Relic One, users have the ability to extend beyond the curated dashboards and design custom applications tailored to your business. New Relic’s Global Technical Support team does not support custom applications. The New Relic Developer site provides guidance on building custom apps, and here are a growing number of open source apps that you can use to get started. Custom scripts & queries We are happy to help troubleshoot issues related to the New Relic One platform that may be causing issues with a script or query. We cannot provide solutions for specific script or query use cases. New Relic Documentation and New Relic University offer resources on how to construct custom scripts and queries. End of Life New Relic may EOL products in accordance with the EOL policy. We recommend upgrading to our newest versions so you can take advantage of recent capabilities and bug fixes. More details are available in our published End of Life Policy. Beta or Limited Release Our support team covers generally available New Relic Products. Products that are in Beta or Limited Release status are not considered “generally available.” If you are invited to participate in a Beta program, or are using a Limited Release component, your account team will be your point of contact for questions. Please contact your account representative directly. Troubleshooting of customer environment We want to help every customer get the most of their New Relic experience within what are increasingly complex environments. However, we can’t help with things we didn’t build. We cannot assist with administration, configuration, or troubleshooting of a customer environment. When in doubt, you can get in touch with us, and we’ll help verify whether an issue is with our Product within a supported environment so you know where to go next. Troubleshooting third-party tools & services New Relic integrates well with many Third Party tools and services; however, we cannot support tools and services not provided or licensed by New Relic. We’ll do our best to determine whether an issue is with New Relic’s Products or caused by something outside of our control and purview. Issues with installation or configuration of the Third Party tools and services themselves should be directed to the respective owner of that Third Party tool or service or to the developer community. The Community and GitHub are great resources for assistance with Third Party tools and services as well. Some account-related functions For security reasons, some account-related Product functions must be conducted by the New Relic user designated as the “account owner,” such as Enabling SSO and High-Security Mode, adding users, and upgrading user permissions. Product training We are here to help you solve problems you may encounter on the road to instrumenting everything. Global Technical Support cannot provide user training on New Relic Products. New Relic offers a well-curated library of documentation and in-depth tutorials organized by Product, skill level, learning format, and solutions to help you navigate the observability journey. Check out New Relic University! Consultancy services Global Technical Support is here to help our valued customers as outlined in these support offerings. If you need help with something that falls outside of the Scope of Support, New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can help you navigate the challenges of building modern software and adopting the latest technologies, so you can focus on what you do best: delivering an incredible experience to your customers.

We're committed to open standards, open-sourcing all of our instrumentation, and engaging engineers where they are, in the communities they already belong to.

For more information about service levels, please refer to our Support Plan. Community forum The New Relic Community Forum is 100% free and open to anyone with a New Relic account. The community is a place where many customer questions have already been asked and answered. Answers come from our community of experienced users, New Relic Support Engineers, and dozens of other Relics who help answer questions and solve problems. If you want to ask a question, check the community - if your question has not already been answered, members of the community can help. Github We want everyone to monitor their systems, and we're contributing our technology back to the open-source community to make that happen. You can find all our open source projects in our Github repo. We're committed to open standards, open-sourcing all of our instrumentation, and engaging engineers where they are, in the communities they already belong to. For more information on support for Open Source projects, visit our Open Source Support Policy. Diagnostic tools New Relic offers a diagnostics utility that can automatically detect common problems with New Relic agents. If Diagnostics detects a problem, it suggests troubleshooting steps. New Relic Diagnostics can also automatically attach troubleshooting data to a New Relic Support ticket. We have also made available Troubleshooting Frameworks that step users through common troubleshooting questions. Support ticket Support is now available in the New Relic One Platform! Just click on the question mark at the top right of your New Relic One screen to surface contextual documentation and resources. Depending on the Service Level associated with your New Relic account, you may be eligible for ticketed support and can open a ticket without leaving the New Relic One Platform. As an alternative, customers eligible for ticketed support may also open a support ticket from the New Relic Support page We are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year to help you troubleshoot issues related to the New Relic One Platform and generally available New Relic Products as outlined below. Scope of support You can have confidence that the Products we make Generally Available are fully tested with the compatible environments outlined in New Relic Documentation. New Relic’s Global Technical Support provides assistance for: the New Relic One platform and its features and capabilities, New Relic's monitoring and observability solutions, and our alerting and Applied Intelligence features. For issues within Third Party tools, or when tools in your infrastructure aren't working together properly, Global Technical Support may reach a point where we must refer New Relic users to such Third Party or community for assistance. Support includes Troubleshooting problems on the New Relic One Platform Assistance with issues during installation & upgrade in compatible environments Guidance on implementation and configuration in compatible environments Troubleshooting problems with ingesting data into New Relic General usage and best practice guidelines Identifying bugs with New Relic Products Assistance in English or Japanese Only (Japanese customer Terms of Service) Support does not include Unsupported or incompatible environments & frameworks Our Products are fully tested with the compatible environments and installation frameworks, and we’re here to help you through issues that may arise with our Products within these compatible environments and frameworks. We cannot support installation or configuration of our Products in environments or frameworks that do not meet established compatibility requirements. But if you're looking for help customizing New Relic for your particular environment, New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can assist with unique configurations or environments. Software customizations We are eager to help troubleshoot issues with the Products and features we make generally available, and those categorized as New Relic’s Open Source Community Plus Projects. New Relic’s Global Technical Support does not support customizations, modifications, or extensions to our code. Customizations or extensions to New Relic’s Open Source Projects in other Project categories are supported by the developer community in GitHub. New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can assist with unique configurations or environments. Custom applications With New Relic One, users have the ability to extend beyond the curated dashboards and design custom applications tailored to your business. New Relic’s Global Technical Support team does not support custom applications. The New Relic Developer site provides guidance on building custom apps, and here are a growing number of open source apps that you can use to get started. Custom scripts & queries We are happy to help troubleshoot issues related to the New Relic One platform that may be causing issues with a script or query. We cannot provide solutions for specific script or query use cases. New Relic Documentation and New Relic University offer resources on how to construct custom scripts and queries. End of Life New Relic may EOL products in accordance with the EOL policy. We recommend upgrading to our newest versions so you can take advantage of recent capabilities and bug fixes. More details are available in our published End of Life Policy. Beta or Limited Release Our support team covers generally available New Relic Products. Products that are in Beta or Limited Release status are not considered “generally available.” If you are invited to participate in a Beta program, or are using a Limited Release component, your account team will be your point of contact for questions. Please contact your account representative directly. Troubleshooting of customer environment We want to help every customer get the most of their New Relic experience within what are increasingly complex environments. However, we can’t help with things we didn’t build. We cannot assist with administration, configuration, or troubleshooting of a customer environment. When in doubt, you can get in touch with us, and we’ll help verify whether an issue is with our Product within a supported environment so you know where to go next. Troubleshooting third-party tools & services New Relic integrates well with many Third Party tools and services; however, we cannot support tools and services not provided or licensed by New Relic. We’ll do our best to determine whether an issue is with New Relic’s Products or caused by something outside of our control and purview. Issues with installation or configuration of the Third Party tools and services themselves should be directed to the respective owner of that Third Party tool or service or to the developer community. The Community and GitHub are great resources for assistance with Third Party tools and services as well. Some account-related functions For security reasons, some account-related Product functions must be conducted by the New Relic user designated as the “account owner,” such as Enabling SSO and High-Security Mode, adding users, and upgrading user permissions. Product training We are here to help you solve problems you may encounter on the road to instrumenting everything. Global Technical Support cannot provide user training on New Relic Products. New Relic offers a well-curated library of documentation and in-depth tutorials organized by Product, skill level, learning format, and solutions to help you navigate the observability journey. Check out New Relic University! Consultancy services Global Technical Support is here to help our valued customers as outlined in these support offerings. If you need help with something that falls outside of the Scope of Support, New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can help you navigate the challenges of building modern software and adopting the latest technologies, so you can focus on what you do best: delivering an incredible experience to your customers. Important As of March 10, 2021, you're no longer able to create a New Relic support ticket by emailing support@newrelic.com.

Once you're there, follow these steps: Click the ? icon in the upper right hand corner. Click I need more help. Select Create a Support Ticket. By creating a support ticket directly within your account, it will speed up the support process and improve our team’s ability to troubleshoot your issue more effectively.

We're committed to open standards, open-sourcing all of our instrumentation, and engaging engineers where they are, in the communities they already belong to.

You can find all our open source projects in our Github repo. We're committed to open standards, open-sourcing all of our instrumentation, and engaging engineers where they are, in the communities they already belong to. For more information on support for Open Source projects, visit our Open Source Support Policy. Diagnostic tools New Relic offers a diagnostics utility that can automatically detect common problems with New Relic agents. If Diagnostics detects a problem, it suggests troubleshooting steps. New Relic Diagnostics can also automatically attach troubleshooting data to a New Relic Support ticket. We have also made available Troubleshooting Frameworks that step users through common troubleshooting questions. Support ticket Support is now available in the New Relic One Platform! Just click on the question mark at the top right of your New Relic One screen to surface contextual documentation and resources. Depending on the Service Level associated with your New Relic account, you may be eligible for ticketed support and can open a ticket without leaving the New Relic One Platform. As an alternative, customers eligible for ticketed support may also open a support ticket from the New Relic Support page We are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year to help you troubleshoot issues related to the New Relic One Platform and generally available New Relic Products as outlined below. Scope of support You can have confidence that the Products we make Generally Available are fully tested with the compatible environments outlined in New Relic Documentation. New Relic’s Global Technical Support provides assistance for: the New Relic One platform and its features and capabilities, New Relic's monitoring and observability solutions, and our alerting and Applied Intelligence features. For issues within Third Party tools, or when tools in your infrastructure aren't working together properly, Global Technical Support may reach a point where we must refer New Relic users to such Third Party or community for assistance. Support includes Troubleshooting problems on the New Relic One Platform Assistance with issues during installation & upgrade in compatible environments Guidance on implementation and configuration in compatible environments Troubleshooting problems with ingesting data into New Relic General usage and best practice guidelines Identifying bugs with New Relic Products Assistance in English or Japanese Only (Japanese customer Terms of Service) Support does not include Unsupported or incompatible environments & frameworks Our Products are fully tested with the compatible environments and installation frameworks, and we’re here to help you through issues that may arise with our Products within these compatible environments and frameworks. We cannot support installation or configuration of our Products in environments or frameworks that do not meet established compatibility requirements. But if you're looking for help customizing New Relic for your particular environment, New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can assist with unique configurations or environments. Software customizations We are eager to help troubleshoot issues with the Products and features we make generally available, and those categorized as New Relic’s Open Source Community Plus Projects. New Relic’s Global Technical Support does not support customizations, modifications, or extensions to our code. Customizations or extensions to New Relic’s Open Source Projects in other Project categories are supported by the developer community in GitHub. New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can assist with unique configurations or environments. Custom applications With New Relic One, users have the ability to extend beyond the curated dashboards and design custom applications tailored to your business. New Relic’s Global Technical Support team does not support custom applications. The New Relic Developer site provides guidance on building custom apps, and here are a growing number of open source apps that you can use to get started. Custom scripts & queries We are happy to help troubleshoot issues related to the New Relic One platform that may be causing issues with a script or query. We cannot provide solutions for specific script or query use cases. New Relic Documentation and New Relic University offer resources on how to construct custom scripts and queries. End of Life New Relic may EOL products in accordance with the EOL policy. We recommend upgrading to our newest versions so you can take advantage of recent capabilities and bug fixes. More details are available in our published End of Life Policy. Beta or Limited Release Our support team covers generally available New Relic Products. Products that are in Beta or Limited Release status are not considered “generally available.” If you are invited to participate in a Beta program, or are using a Limited Release component, your account team will be your point of contact for questions. Please contact your account representative directly. Troubleshooting of customer environment We want to help every customer get the most of their New Relic experience within what are increasingly complex environments. However, we can’t help with things we didn’t build. We cannot assist with administration, configuration, or troubleshooting of a customer environment. When in doubt, you can get in touch with us, and we’ll help verify whether an issue is with our Product within a supported environment so you know where to go next. Troubleshooting third-party tools & services New Relic integrates well with many Third Party tools and services; however, we cannot support tools and services not provided or licensed by New Relic. We’ll do our best to determine whether an issue is with New Relic’s Products or caused by something outside of our control and purview. Issues with installation or configuration of the Third Party tools and services themselves should be directed to the respective owner of that Third Party tool or service or to the developer community. The Community and GitHub are great resources for assistance with Third Party tools and services as well. Some account-related functions For security reasons, some account-related Product functions must be conducted by the New Relic user designated as the “account owner,” such as Enabling SSO and High-Security Mode, adding users, and upgrading user permissions. Product training We are here to help you solve problems you may encounter on the road to instrumenting everything. Global Technical Support cannot provide user training on New Relic Products. New Relic offers a well-curated library of documentation and in-depth tutorials organized by Product, skill level, learning format, and solutions to help you navigate the observability journey. Check out New Relic University! Consultancy services Global Technical Support is here to help our valued customers as outlined in these support offerings. If you need help with something that falls outside of the Scope of Support, New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can help you navigate the challenges of building modern software and adopting the latest technologies, so you can focus on what you do best: delivering an incredible experience to your customers.

We strive to keep our resources operating efficiently, so our services are available to all subscribers. Because you have access to shared resources, we have put these rules in place to ensure everyone has a great experience. For example, you as a tenant would not want other tenants to engage in the types of activities described below. To help us do this, we have put some rules in place regarding your use of the New Relic Properties and created this Acceptable Use Policy (“AUP”). This AUP applies if you use any New Relic product, service, software, website, forum, page or system (collectively, the “New Relic Properties”) and is part of the technical guides documentation that New Relic makes available at dedicated 'Documentation' pages on New Relic websites, including, but not limited to, https://docs.newrelic.com, https://docs.pixielabs.ai/, and https://docs.codestream.com/userguide/ (the “Documentation”).

You represent and warrant to New Relic that you have all necessary rights, consents, and permissions to use and submit data that you send to the New Relic Properties, all without violating or infringing any applicable laws, third-party rights (including intellectual property, publicity, or privacy rights), or any terms or policies governing such data. New Relic Properties do not include Third-Party Services If you choose to use any Third Party Services, your use of Third-Party Services is wholly subject to your separate agreement with the relevant provider. New Relic bears no responsibility or liability for Third-Party Services. If you enable a Third-Party Service with the New Relic Properties, New Relic may access and exchange Customer Data with the Third-Party Service on your behalf and instruction. “Third-Party Services” means any third party platform, add-on, service, or product not provided by New Relic and that a User integrates or enables for use with the Service, including third-party applications and plug-ins. Open source software that New Relic makes separately available for download (e.g. community tools) is, as required, governed by the terms of the applicable open source license. The license for any open source software identified as included in New Relic Properties will, as required, wholly apply to your use of that open source software. Updates, Contact Information and Violations We will occasionally need to modify this AUP to help us continue to provide you with a great experience while using the New Relic Properties. In the event we modify this AUP, we will do so by posting a revised version, and any changes will be effective immediately if you’re a new user of the New Relic Properties and thirty (30) days after posting for all other users. If you continue using the New Relic Properties after we update this AUP, you agree to the latest version of this AUP. You can report a violation of this AUP to: AUP@newrelic.com. Or by mail at: Attn: Legal New Relic, Inc. 188 Spear Street, Suite 1200 San Francisco, CA 94105 This AUP, and our customers’ compliance with it, is essential for enabling us to provide you and our other customers with the New Relic Properties, which we take very seriously. You are wholly and solely responsible for appropriate configuration of systems and software that you own or can control to ensure your compliance with this AUP. So, if we determine in our sole discretion that you have violated this AUP, we may, without limiting any other remedies available to us, permanently or temporarily suspend, limit, or terminate your access to the New Relic Properties without notice or liability. This right applies even if the breach is unintentional or unauthorized if we believe that any such suspension, limitation, or termination is necessary to ensure compliance with laws, or to protect the rights, safety, privacy, security, or property of us or others. In this AUP, the term “content” means: (1) any information, data, text, software, code, scripts, music, sound, photos, graphics, videos, messages, tags, interactive features, or other materials that you post, upload, share, submit, or otherwise provide in any manner to the services and (2) any other materials, content, or data you provide to New Relic or use with the New Relic Properties. As used in this AUP, “you” may refer to an individual user or the legal entity an individual user is employed by that has contracted with New Relic, and “we” means New Relic.",

Answers come from our community of experienced users, New Relic Support Engineers, and dozens of other Relics who help answer questions and solve problems. If you want to ask a question, check the community - if your question has not already been answered, members of the community can help. Github We want everyone to monitor their systems, and we're contributing our technology back to the open-source community to make that happen. You can find all our open source projects in our Github repo. We're committed to open standards, open-sourcing all of our instrumentation, and engaging engineers where they are, in the communities they already belong to. For more information on support for Open Source projects, visit our Open Source Support Policy. Diagnostic tools New Relic offers a diagnostics utility that can automatically detect common problems with New Relic agents. If Diagnostics detects a problem, it suggests troubleshooting steps. New Relic Diagnostics can also automatically attach troubleshooting data to a New Relic Support ticket. We have also made available Troubleshooting Frameworks that step users through common troubleshooting questions. Support ticket Support is now available in the New Relic One Platform! Just click on the question mark at the top right of your New Relic One screen to surface contextual documentation and resources. Depending on the Service Level associated with your New Relic account, you may be eligible for ticketed support and can open a ticket without leaving the New Relic One Platform. As an alternative, customers eligible for ticketed support may also open a support ticket from the New Relic Support page We are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year to help you troubleshoot issues related to the New Relic One Platform and generally available New Relic Products as outlined below. Scope of support You can have confidence that the Products we make Generally Available are fully tested with the compatible environments outlined in New Relic Documentation. New Relic’s Global Technical Support provides assistance for: the New Relic One platform and its features and capabilities, New Relic's monitoring and observability solutions, and our alerting and Applied Intelligence features. For issues within Third Party tools, or when tools in your infrastructure aren't working together properly, Global Technical Support may reach a point where we must refer New Relic users to such Third Party or community for assistance. Support includes Troubleshooting problems on the New Relic One Platform Assistance with issues during installation & upgrade in compatible environments Guidance on implementation and configuration in compatible environments Troubleshooting problems with ingesting data into New Relic General usage and best practice guidelines Identifying bugs with New Relic Products Assistance in English or Japanese Only (Japanese customer Terms of Service) Support does not include Unsupported or incompatible environments & frameworks Our Products are fully tested with the compatible environments and installation frameworks, and we’re here to help you through issues that may arise with our Products within these compatible environments and frameworks. We cannot support installation or configuration of our Products in environments or frameworks that do not meet established compatibility requirements. But if you're looking for help customizing New Relic for your particular environment, New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can assist with unique configurations or environments. Software customizations We are eager to help troubleshoot issues with the Products and features we make generally available, and those categorized as New Relic’s Open Source Community Plus Projects. New Relic’s Global Technical Support does not support customizations, modifications, or extensions to our code. Customizations or extensions to New Relic’s Open Source Projects in other Project categories are supported by the developer community in GitHub. New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can assist with unique configurations or environments. Custom applications With New Relic One, users have the ability to extend beyond the curated dashboards and design custom applications tailored to your business. New Relic’s Global Technical Support team does not support custom applications. The New Relic Developer site provides guidance on building custom apps, and here are a growing number of open source apps that you can use to get started. Custom scripts & queries We are happy to help troubleshoot issues related to the New Relic One platform that may be causing issues with a script or query. We cannot provide solutions for specific script or query use cases. New Relic Documentation and New Relic University offer resources on how to construct custom scripts and queries. End of Life New Relic may EOL products in accordance with the EOL policy. We recommend upgrading to our newest versions so you can take advantage of recent capabilities and bug fixes. More details are available in our published End of Life Policy. Beta or Limited Release Our support team covers generally available New Relic Products. Products that are in Beta or Limited Release status are not considered “generally available.” If you are invited to participate in a Beta program, or are using a Limited Release component, your account team will be your point of contact for questions. Please contact your account representative directly. Troubleshooting of customer environment We want to help every customer get the most of their New Relic experience within what are increasingly complex environments. However, we can’t help with things we didn’t build. We cannot assist with administration, configuration, or troubleshooting of a customer environment. When in doubt, you can get in touch with us, and we’ll help verify whether an issue is with our Product within a supported environment so you know where to go next. Troubleshooting third-party tools & services New Relic integrates well with many Third Party tools and services; however, we cannot support tools and services not provided or licensed by New Relic. We’ll do our best to determine whether an issue is with New Relic’s Products or caused by something outside of our control and purview. Issues with installation or configuration of the Third Party tools and services themselves should be directed to the respective owner of that Third Party tool or service or to the developer community. The Community and GitHub are great resources for assistance with Third Party tools and services as well. Some account-related functions For security reasons, some account-related Product functions must be conducted by the New Relic user designated as the “account owner,” such as Enabling SSO and High-Security Mode, adding users, and upgrading user permissions. Product training We are here to help you solve problems you may encounter on the road to instrumenting everything. Global Technical Support cannot provide user training on New Relic Products. New Relic offers a well-curated library of documentation and in-depth tutorials organized by Product, skill level, learning format, and solutions to help you navigate the observability journey. Check out New Relic University! Consultancy services Global Technical Support is here to help our valued customers as outlined in these support offerings. If you need help with something that falls outside of the Scope of Support, New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can help you navigate the challenges of building modern software and adopting the latest technologies, so you can focus on what you do best: delivering an incredible experience to your customers.

We strive to keep our resources operating efficiently, so our services are available to all subscribers. Because you have access to shared resources, we have put these rules in place to ensure everyone has a great experience. For example, you as a tenant would not want other tenants to engage in the types of activities described below. To help us do this, we have put some rules in place regarding your use of the New Relic Properties and created this Acceptable Use Policy (“AUP”). This AUP applies if you use any New Relic product, service, software, website, forum, page or system (collectively, the “New Relic Properties”) and is part of the technical guides documentation that New Relic makes available at dedicated 'Documentation' pages on New Relic websites, including, but not limited to, https://docs.newrelic.com, https://docs.pixielabs.ai/, and https://docs.codestream.com/userguide/ (the “Documentation”). You will not, and not to allow third parties, in connection with your use of the New Relic Properties to: Harm New Relic’s Properties and interests, such as: Uploading, transmitting or otherwise provide content that infringes New Relic’s or a third party’s intellectual property, privacy or other rights, violates applicable laws or regulations or contains viruses, worms, harmful code, malware or other harmful materials; Hosting, selling, reselling, renting, exploiting, sublicensing, leasing, or otherwise providing the New Relic Properties or any portion thereof or use such for time sharing purposes or on a service bureau basis without our express written permission; Modifying, disabling, or compromising the integrity or performance of the New Relic Properties or related systems, networks, or data; including by: Attempting to compromise the integrity of the New Relic Properties, including probing, scanning or testing the vulnerability of any part of the New Relic Properties without proper authorization; Overwhelming our infrastructure (such as by using “botnets”, “robots,” “spiders” and “offline readers”); Going beyond the use parameters for any given service as described in the corresponding Documentation; Using metatags or other “hidden text”; Drastically exceeding your contracted rate of use as set forth in your order or the Documentation; or Consuming an unreasonable amount of storage.

The license for any open source software identified as included in New Relic Properties will, as required, wholly apply to your use of that open source software. Updates, Contact Information and Violations We will occasionally need to modify this AUP to help us continue to provide you with a great experience while using the New Relic Properties. In the event we modify this AUP, we will do so by posting a revised version, and any changes will be effective immediately if you’re a new user of the New Relic Properties and thirty (30) days after posting for all other users.

Or by mail at: Attn: Legal New Relic, Inc. 188 Spear Street, Suite 1200 San Francisco, CA 94105 This AUP, and our customers’ compliance with it, is essential for enabling us to provide you and our other customers with the New Relic Properties, which we take very seriously. You are wholly and solely responsible for appropriate configuration of systems and software that you own or can control to ensure your compliance with this AUP. So, if we determine in our sole discretion that you have violated this AUP, we may, without limiting any other remedies available to us, permanently or temporarily suspend, limit, or terminate your access to the New Relic Properties without notice or liability. This right applies even if the breach is unintentional or unauthorized if we believe that any such suspension, limitation, or termination is necessary to ensure compliance with laws, or to protect the rights, safety, privacy, security, or property of us or others. In this AUP, the term “content” means: (1) any information, data, text, software, code, scripts, music, sound, photos, graphics, videos, messages, tags, interactive features, or other materials that you post, upload, share, submit, or otherwise provide in any manner to the services and (2) any other materials, content, or data you provide to New Relic or use with the New Relic Properties.

      "body": "This document is about the New Relic One pricing plan. For an explanation of how that plan works, see New Relic One pricing. The document below goes into license-level details. The Usage Plan applies to (i) your Pay As You Go subscription, or (ii) your Commitment Term for the Annual Pool of Funds subscription (see a description of these two plans). New Relic may modify the Usage Plan from time to time. Any changes to the Usage Plan will become effective immediately for changes that provide a benefit or right to the Customer, all other changes will become effective if Customer assents or upon any new or renewal Commitment Term. Usage Plan - Effective as October 21, 2021: The Order and Usage Plan may contain defined terms that are denoted by capitalization. In the event that a capitalized term is not defined in either the Order or the Usage Plan, such terms shall have the meaning set forth in the New Relic One pricing definitions page. Pay As You Go By electing and subscribing to the Pay As You Go subscription model (“Pay As You Go” or “PAYG”), Customer commits to paying for the New Relic Products on a month-to-month consumption basis. Monthly Product Usage will be invoiced regardless if a PO is required or not. Any Customer dispute to Monthly Product Usage from the prior month must be in good-faith and received by New Relic in writing within three (3) business days of the start of the next month or such dispute notice will be considered invalid. The dispute notice will set forth in reasonable detail the information concerning the disputed charges. The parties will use good-faith efforts to promptly resolve any disputed charges. Customer’s usage of the Products in excess of the Free Tier each month shall be billed in arrears on the first business day of the following month based on the Customer’s Per Unit usage of each Product each month multiplied by the corresponding rates set forth in an Order and summed (“Monthly Product Usage”). Annual Pool of Funds By electing and subscribing to the Annual Pool of Funds subscription model (“Annual Pool of Funds” or “APoF”) for the Commitment Term, Customer commits in an Order to: (i) paying the Commitment Fee amounts described in the Subscription table and any additional commitment fees set forth; and (ii) the Monthly Discounted Fee Rates applying to Customer’s Monthly Product Usage. New Relic will invoice the Commitment Fee as per the ‘Billing Terms’ described in an Order. On a monthly cadence during the Commitment Term, Customer’s Per Unit usage of the Products will be multiplied by the corresponding Monthly Discounted Rate and summed (“Monthly Product Usage”). Monthly Product Usage will be deducted from the Commitment Fee amounts that are paid in advance. If Monthly Product Usage exceeds any such remaining unconsumed amounts, Customer will be invoiced for the difference (“Additional Usage”), including for any Monthly Product Usage during the last month of the Commitment Term. Payment of such invoices will be governed as set forth in the Terms. Any Customer dispute to Monthly Product Usage from the prior month must be in good-faith and received by New Relic in writing within three (3) business days of the start of the next month (including for any Monthly Product Usage for the last month of the Commitment Term) or such dispute notice will be considered invalid. The dispute notice will set forth in reasonable detail the information concerning the disputed charges. The parties will use good-faith efforts to promptly resolve any disputed charges. Any unconsumed balances from the Customer payment of each annual Commitment Fee and any additional payments, if applicable, as set out in an Order will expire and lapse at the end of each year of the Commitment Term. Applicable Invoicing and Order Terms All amounts stated in an Order are non-cancelable payment obligations of the Customer for the Commitment Term regardless of usage. Any fees paid are non-refundable and do not represent a deposit for, or a credit towards, the purchase of other products not specified in an Order or for any purchase after the Commitment Term. Customer acknowledges that a final payment for the full outstanding amount of any remaining unpaid Commitment Fee and/or Monthly Product Usage Fee may be invoiced upon each anniversary date of the term start date. Tax will be added where applicable. New Relic may review Customer's use of the Products at any time. If New Relic identifies any Customer usage of the Product(s) that is not in accordance with the Terms or Documentation, New Relic may suspend such unauthorized usage. All existing purchases and related pricing in effect prior to the execution of an Order shall remain in force. Unless otherwise stated in an Order, an Order does not modify or amend any existing purchases. Additional future products or quantities are not subject to promotional pricing unless otherwise stated in an Order. In the event that a Customer indicates in an Order that it requires a purchase order (“PO”) for its subscription, Customer agrees to provide the required PO prior to the provisioning of the Products. If a Customer does not indicate a PO is required, Customer agrees that New Relic may issue invoice(s) and is entitled to such payment without a PO reference. All Additional Usage fees will be invoiced regardless of a PO requirement. The Product(s) are deemed accepted upon its provisioning. User Accounts Use of the Products require Customer users to create Login Credentials. Customer user Login Credential information must be accurate, current, and complete. New Relic’s use and collection of Login Credentials (in accordance with its General Data Privacy Notice) is for account and product management and support of its customers. Customer and Customer users must abide by the New Relic Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) and Login Credentials may not be shared. Each Customer user must have their own user account.

      "body": "This document is about the New Relic One pricing plan. For an explanation of how that plan works, see New Relic One pricing. The document below goes into license-level details. The Usage Plan applies to (i) your Pay As You Go subscription, or (ii) your Commitment Term for the Annual Pool of Funds subscription (see a description of these two plans). New Relic may modify the Usage Plan from time to time. Any changes to the Usage Plan will become effective immediately for changes that provide a benefit or right to the Customer, all other changes will become effective if Customer assents or upon any new or renewal Commitment Term. Usage Plan - Effective as October 21, 2021: The Order and Usage Plan may contain defined terms that are denoted by capitalization. In the event that a capitalized term is not defined in either the Order or the Usage Plan, such terms shall have the meaning set forth in the New Relic One pricing definitions page. Pay As You Go By electing and subscribing to the Pay As You Go subscription model (“Pay As You Go” or “PAYG”), Customer commits to paying for the New Relic Products on a month-to-month consumption basis. Monthly Product Usage will be invoiced regardless if a PO is required or not. Any Customer dispute to Monthly Product Usage from the prior month must be in good-faith and received by New Relic in writing within three (3) business days of the start of the next month or such dispute notice will be considered invalid. The dispute notice will set forth in reasonable detail the information concerning the disputed charges. The parties will use good-faith efforts to promptly resolve any disputed charges. Customer’s usage of the Products in excess of the Free Tier each month shall be billed in arrears on the first business day of the following month based on the Customer’s Per Unit usage of each Product each month multiplied by the corresponding rates set forth in an Order and summed (“Monthly Product Usage”). Annual Pool of Funds By electing and subscribing to the Annual Pool of Funds subscription model (“Annual Pool of Funds” or “APoF”) for the Commitment Term, Customer commits in an Order to: (i) paying the Commitment Fee amounts described in the Subscription table and any additional commitment fees set forth; and (ii) the Monthly Discounted Fee Rates applying to Customer’s Monthly Product Usage. New Relic will invoice the Commitment Fee as per the ‘Billing Terms’ described in an Order. On a monthly cadence during the Commitment Term, Customer’s Per Unit usage of the Products will be multiplied by the corresponding Monthly Discounted Rate and summed (“Monthly Product Usage”). Monthly Product Usage will be deducted from the Commitment Fee amounts that are paid in advance. If Monthly Product Usage exceeds any such remaining unconsumed amounts, Customer will be invoiced for the difference (“Additional Usage”), including for any Monthly Product Usage during the last month of the Commitment Term. Payment of such invoices will be governed as set forth in the Terms. Any Customer dispute to Monthly Product Usage from the prior month must be in good-faith and received by New Relic in writing within three (3) business days of the start of the next month (including for any Monthly Product Usage for the last month of the Commitment Term) or such dispute notice will be considered invalid. The dispute notice will set forth in reasonable detail the information concerning the disputed charges. The parties will use good-faith efforts to promptly resolve any disputed charges. Any unconsumed balances from the Customer payment of each annual Commitment Fee and any additional payments, if applicable, as set out in an Order will expire and lapse at the end of each year of the Commitment Term. Applicable Invoicing and Order Terms All amounts stated in an Order are non-cancelable payment obligations of the Customer for the Commitment Term regardless of usage. Any fees paid are non-refundable and do not represent a deposit for, or a credit towards, the purchase of other products not specified in an Order or for any purchase after the Commitment Term. Customer acknowledges that a final payment for the full outstanding amount of any remaining unpaid Commitment Fee and/or Monthly Product Usage Fee may be invoiced upon each anniversary date of the term start date. Tax will be added where applicable. New Relic may review Customer's use of the Products at any time. If New Relic identifies any Customer usage of the Product(s) that is not in accordance with the Terms or Documentation, New Relic may suspend such unauthorized usage. All existing purchases and related pricing in effect prior to the execution of an Order shall remain in force. Unless otherwise stated in an Order, an Order does not modify or amend any existing purchases. Additional future products or quantities are not subject to promotional pricing unless otherwise stated in an Order. In the event that a Customer indicates in an Order that it requires a purchase order (“PO”) for its subscription, Customer agrees to provide the required PO prior to the provisioning of the Products. If a Customer does not indicate a PO is required, Customer agrees that New Relic may issue invoice(s) and is entitled to such payment without a PO reference. All Additional Usage fees will be invoiced regardless of a PO requirement. The Product(s) are deemed accepted upon its provisioning. User Accounts Use of the Products require Customer users to create Login Credentials. Customer user Login Credential information must be accurate, current, and complete. New Relic’s use and collection of Login Credentials (in accordance with its General Data Privacy Notice) is for account and product management and support of its customers. Customer and Customer users must abide by the New Relic Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) and Login Credentials may not be shared. Each Customer user must have their own user account. Entry into an Order indicates your agreement that the amount of provisioned users (at the rate specified in the Order) applies in lieu of and supersedes any other amount of users of the Products that may be specified in the agreement between Customer and New Relic. New Relic One Pro and Enterprise Service Level Availability Commitment With a subscription to \"New Relic One - Pro Users\" or \"New Relic One - Enterprise Users,\" you agree that during the Commitment Term the applicable service level availability commitment set forth on the ‘Service level availability commitment’ page in the Documentation shall apply to the Products. For clarity, if your agreement with New Relic contains a different service level availability commitment or remedies, the above does not apply to your subscription to the \"New Relic One - Pro Users\" or \"New Relic One - Enterprise Users\".

App An app means the application software designed to run on smartphones, tablet computers, and other mobile devices. Each app includes a predefined number of users. App transaction An app transaction is an APM application's attempt to process a web or non-web request. In New Relic APM these manifest as throughput TIMESERIES or individually as events in the Transaction event type. AWS Lambda event An AWS Lambda event means the row of data collected from the customer's AWS Lambda function by the New Relic agent or sent from an external service into the New Relic platform. It consists of the AwsLambdaInvocation, AwsLambdaInvocationError, or custom event types. Check A check means the single instance of a Synthetics monitor running in New Relic's monitoring network and reporting back response time, and whether the check was a success or failure. Compute unit A compute unit means the measure of resources associated with a unit of computation on a physical or virtual host. Datapoints per minute Datapoints per minute (DPM) refers to the per-minute rate at which individual metric values are sent to the New Relic Metric Ingest API. For billing purposes, datapoints per minute are calculated as a monthly average value by summing the datapoints ingested during a 30 day period and dividing by the number of minutes in that period (43,200). Event An event means the row of data collected from the customer's application by the New Relic agent or sent from an external service into our database. Host A host means the physical computer or virtual machine instance running a single copy of an operating system. Host usage is tracked monthly by summing the hours that every host in the account is connected to New Relic and dividing by 750. A host is counted if it is connected any time during an hour. Incident event An incident event is an alerting event (open, closed, etc.) created by an alerting engine that is sent into the New Relic Applied Intelligence platform (non-unique) for de-duplication, flapping detection, smart suppression, enrichment, and correlation. Page view A page view means the full page load (triggering an onLoad event) or a recorded URL change (state change). Per GB daily Per GB daily represents a daily average of Log data sent to New Relic over a 30 day period. Span A span represents an operation summary collected from the customer's application via the New Relic APM agent or New Relic Serverless for AWS Lambda agent, or sent from other tracing tools to the New Relic Trace API. User A user means the individual that connects to your app from a single device. Each unique device is considered as a unique user.",

Capitalized terms not defined below shall take on the meaning set forth in your Terms. New Relic Service Level Availability The Service will be considered available so long as Customer is able to log in to its interface and view Customer Data (\"Service Availability\"). The applicable Service Availability will be calculated as a percentage of: (1) the total number of minutes in a month after (2) subtracting any periods of unavailability during such month from the total number of minutes in a month. New Relic will use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain Service Availability of at least 99.8% during any calendar month. In the event the Service Availability drops below: (i) 98.5% for two consecutive calendar months during the Subscription Term, or (ii) 96.5% in any single calendar month, Customer may request to terminate the relevant Service with no penalty. Such termination will be effective as of the end of the then-current billing period and no additional fees will be charged. The service level within New Relic's control is the Service Availability, not, for example, the transmission of data over the public Internet. Service Availability calculations will exclude unavailability arising from any: (a) planned maintenance periods; (b) emergency maintenance that is necessary to prevent imminent harm to the Service; (c) force majeure events; (d) Third-Party Services, Customer application, equipment, software or other technology, or Customer or its User's use of the Service, in violation of the Agreement or not in accordance with the Documentation; or (e) suspension, limitation, and/or termination of Customer’s access or use of the Service in accordance with this Agreement. This describes Customer’s sole and exclusive remedy for failures of Service Availability. Customer may request the Service Availability attainment for the previous month by filing a support ticket on the New Relic support site.",

New Relic will have and maintain policies and practices that include, at a minimum, the following controls and safeguards applied to New Relic employees and contractors who may access Customer Data: 6.1. For U.S. New Relic employees and subject to applicable law, a criminal background screening of each of its new employees to whom it gives access to Customer Data at the federal, state, and county levels. For non-U.S. New Relic employees, New Relic will use commercially reasonable efforts to meet the same criteria as established for U.S.-based New Relic employees, subject to general business practices in the respective country and in compliance with applicable local law requirements; 6.2. All New Relic employees with access to Customer Data will undergo adequate training, such as annual security awareness training, in the care, protection and handling of Customer Data, and will align with the privacy and security measures set out in this Addendum by following the guidance provided in their welcome package, which includes New Relic’s security policies and a security acknowledgement; 6.3. A disciplinary policy and process, to be used when New Relic employees violate New Relic security or privacy policies or access Customer Data without prior authorization; 6.4. Administrative or remote access to New Relic systems that process Customer Data will align with industry standard practices, including multi-factor authentication; 6.5. Restricted access to New Relic proprietary source code to prevent unauthorized access; 6.6. Controls designed to ensure that only those New Relic employees with an actual need-to-know will have access to New Relic systems including, but not limited to, the use of a formal access management process for the request, review, approval, and provisioning; 6.7. Controls designed to ensure that New Relic employees are granted access to New Relic systems based on least-privilege principles; and 6.8. Revoke access to New Relic employees no longer requiring access. 7. Security Incident and Data Breach Response 7.1. New Relic will take appropriate physical, technical, and administrative security measures that are commercially reasonable and consistent with industry standards to prevent a Data Breach, and as required by any applicable law or regulation. “Data Breach” means the theft, loss, or unauthorized access of Customer Data. Without limiting the foregoing, New Relic will implement security measures at least as stringent as those set out in this Addendum. New Relic will designate a senior representative to provide incident briefings, as needed in case of a Data Breach, and to respond to reasonable requests by Customer pertaining to privacy and data security issues within a commercially reasonable time frame. 7.2. New Relic will: 7.2.1. Notify Customer without undue delay if New Relic becomes aware of a Data Breach; 7.2.2. Maintain a security incident response plan, including procedures and means to respond in a manner consistent with industry standards; 7.2.3. Reasonably cooperate with Customer to investigate and remediate a Data Breach and mitigate any further risk to the Customer Data, or risk to data subjects and/or Customer’s reputation or brand; 7.2.4. Provide reasonable assistance to Customer at New Relic’s sole cost and expense; and 7.2.5. Make commercially reasonable efforts to preserve evidence and reasonably cooperate with Customer and legal authorities (as applicable and legally permissible) during an investigation of a Data Breach. 8. Network and Systems Security 8.1. All extranet connectivity by New Relic personnel to systems processing Customer Data will be through secure remote connections. 8.2. Network segments connected to the Internet will be protected by secure access control mechanisms, such as a firewall configured to secure all devices behind it and properly addresses security concerns according to industry standard practices. 8.3. New Relic will have industry standard measures in place to actively monitor its systems and help detect a potential hostile attack, such as Network Intrusion Detection (NID) or Host Intrusion Detection (HID)/Prevention. 8.4. Applications, ports, services, and similar access points installed on a computer or network facility, which are not specifically required for business functionality, will be disabled or removed. 8.5. New Relic maintains configuration standards for authorized operating systems and software for systems that support processing of Customer Data. New Relic will establish and follow server configuration guidelines and processes for preventing unauthorized access to Customer Data. New Relic maintains secure images or templates for systems based on the organization’s approved configuration standards. 8.6. Development, test, and operational environments will be logically separated to reduce the risks of unauthorized access or changes to the operational system. 8.7. New Relic network architecture will be designed to limit site access and restrict the availability of information systems that are considered to be vulnerable to attack. 8.8. New Relic provides appropriate TLS certificates when users access and view Customer Data in the Service. New Relic’s software for sending Customer Data to New Relic will encrypt Customer Data in transit by default. 9. Authentication and Access Management If you subscribe to the requisite New Relic One Service, New Relic will provide industry standard authentication and access controls to protect Customer Data, including industry standard authentication methods utilized to help prevent unauthorized access to the Service. New Relic’s access control methods will clearly state the rules and rights for each user or group of users including applications and information sharing and will include a process for granting and removing access to all information systems processing Customer Data. A record of all privileges allocated will be maintained pursuant to the requirements herein. 9.1. In the event the New Relic is required by law, regulation, or legal process to disclose any Customer Data, New Relic shall (a) give Customer, to the extent possible, reasonable advance notice prior to disclosure so Customer may contest the disclosure or seek a protective order, and (b) reasonably limit the disclosure to the minimum amount that is legally required to be disclosed. 10. Vulnerability Management New Relic will have and maintain the following vulnerability management processes for all devices used to connect to the New Relic network and Services. 10.1. New Relic will align to industry standard practices for build out, minimization of services and secure configuration, in accordance with, industry-recognized minimum security baselines for the New Relic platform and subcontractor systems connected to the New Relic platform in relation to the provision of the Services. 10.2. New Relic will employ industry-recognized standards and tools to conduct frequent infrastructure vulnerability scanning to test New Relic’s network and infrastructure and application penetration testing to test the New Relic Services. New Relic applies “Medium”, “High” and “Critical” security patches for all components in production and development environments as soon as commercially possible in accordance with its vulnerability management protocol, and consistent with industry standard practices and standards; 10.3. New Relic will have processes in place designed to ensure adherence to industry standard security development practices for development and testing for all code, APIs, and applications deployed and implemented in support of the Service; 10.4. New Relic will have and maintain solutions to identify and prevent malicious attackers or code from accessing or compromising Customer Data or systems that process Customer Data. These include, but are not limited to, software that identifies and removes malware and detects attempted intrusions. New Relic will have a security event and incident monitoring system and supporting processes to notify appropriate personnel in response to threats. 11. System Access and Logging 11.1. Access to New Relic’s systems will not be granted to employees of New Relic unless they have been uniquely identified and have sufficient credentials. 11.2. Access to New Relic’s systems will be logged and retained for no less than 6 months to assist in investigations and access control monitoring, including, but not limited to, end user access and activities, and information security events. 11.3. New Relic agrees to provide Customer the capability to access log records relating to Customer Accounts and the New Relic systems that process Customer Data in the event of a Data Breach or if required in connection with a law enforcement request. 12. Disaster Recovery and Data Backup 12.1. New Relic will have plans designed to respond to loss of services, which are tested and reviewed at least annually. This plan will include documented policies and procedures to restore service in the event of a service failure. 12.2. New Relic will establish and follow backup and restore procedures for Customer Data. 12.3. New Relic business continuity plan identifies critical systems. Annual disaster recovery tests are performed to check and restore customer data in the event of an incident. 12.4. New Relic will provide Customer with redacted copies of its plan(s) and evidence of tests/reviews upon request, but not more frequently than once annually, and subject to confidentiality requirements. 12.5. Additional information for Customer Data control and encryption are available on New Relic’s Security Guide. 13. Copies and Removal 13.1. In addition to any obligations of New Relic in the Agreement, upon expiration or termination of the Agreement for any reason: (a) New Relic will, and will cause its personnel, to cease all access and use of any Customer Data, and (b) New Relic will delete all copies of Customer Data within ninety (90) days. 13.2. New Relic will maintain a process of ensuring secure destruction and deletion of all Customer Data, when reasonably requested by Customer or as otherwise provided in the Agreement. The process will include industry standard processes so that: (i) Customer Data cannot be practicably read or reconstructed, and (ii) the systems that store Customer Data are securely erased and/or decommissioned disks are destroyed. 14. Third Party Vendor Management New Relic may use third party vendors to provide the Services. New Relic performs a security risk-based assessment of prospective vendors before working with them to validate they meet New Relic’s security and business continuity standards, including the type of access and classification of data being accessed (if any), controls necessary to protect data, and legal/regulatory requirements. New Relic enters into written agreements with its vendors that process Customer Data which include confidentiality, privacy, and security obligations that provide an appropriate level of protection for Customer Data that these vendors may process for New Relic to maintain the security posture in this Policy, including following industry security standards. 15. Disclosure by Law In the event the New Relic is required by law, regulation, or legal process to disclose any Customer Data, New Relic will (a) give Customer, to the extent possible, reasonable advance notice prior to disclosure so Customer may contest the disclosure or seek a protective order, and (b) reasonably limit the disclosure to the minimum amount that is legally required to be disclosed. New Relic publishes its law enforcement requests report on New Relic’s Security Guide. 16. Updates As New Relic releases new products, services, functionality, and features, New Relic may update this Policy to account for such products, services, functionality, and features.

New Relic Service Level Availability The Service will be considered available so long as Customer is able to log in to its interface and view Customer Data (\"Service Availability\"). The applicable Service Availability will be calculated as a percentage of: (1) the total number of minutes in a month after (2) subtracting any periods of unavailability during such month from the total number of minutes in a month. New Relic will use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain Service Availability of at least 99.8% during any calendar month. In the event the Service Availability drops below: (i) 98.5% for two consecutive calendar months during the Subscription Term, or (ii) 96.5% in any single calendar month, Customer may request to terminate the relevant Service with no penalty. Such termination will be effective as of the end of the then-current billing period and no additional fees will be charged. The service level within New Relic's control is the Service Availability, not, for example, the transmission of data over the public Internet. Service Availability calculations will exclude unavailability arising from any: (a) planned maintenance periods; (b) emergency maintenance that is necessary to prevent imminent harm to the Service; (c) force majeure events; (d) Third-Party Services, Customer application, equipment, software or other technology, or Customer or its User's use of the Service, in violation of the Agreement or not in accordance with the Documentation; or (e) suspension, limitation, and/or termination of Customer’s access or use of the Service in accordance with this Agreement. This describes Customer’s sole and exclusive remedy for failures of Service Availability. Customer may request the Service Availability attainment for the previous month by filing a support ticket on the New Relic support site.",

      "body": "This document is about the New Relic One pricing plan. For an explanation of how that plan works, see New Relic One pricing. The document below goes into license-level details. The Usage Plan applies to (i) your Pay As You Go subscription, or (ii) your Commitment Term for the Annual Pool of Funds subscription (see a description of these two plans). New Relic may modify the Usage Plan from time to time. Any changes to the Usage Plan will become effective immediately for changes that provide a benefit or right to the Customer, all other changes will become effective if Customer assents or upon any new or renewal Commitment Term. Usage Plan - Effective as October 21, 2021: The Order and Usage Plan may contain defined terms that are denoted by capitalization. In the event that a capitalized term is not defined in either the Order or the Usage Plan, such terms shall have the meaning set forth in the New Relic One pricing definitions page. Pay As You Go By electing and subscribing to the Pay As You Go subscription model (“Pay As You Go” or “PAYG”), Customer commits to paying for the New Relic Products on a month-to-month consumption basis. Monthly Product Usage will be invoiced regardless if a PO is required or not. Any Customer dispute to Monthly Product Usage from the prior month must be in good-faith and received by New Relic in writing within three (3) business days of the start of the next month or such dispute notice will be considered invalid. The dispute notice will set forth in reasonable detail the information concerning the disputed charges. The parties will use good-faith efforts to promptly resolve any disputed charges. Customer’s usage of the Products in excess of the Free Tier each month shall be billed in arrears on the first business day of the following month based on the Customer’s Per Unit usage of each Product each month multiplied by the corresponding rates set forth in an Order and summed (“Monthly Product Usage”). Annual Pool of Funds By electing and subscribing to the Annual Pool of Funds subscription model (“Annual Pool of Funds” or “APoF”) for the Commitment Term, Customer commits in an Order to: (i) paying the Commitment Fee amounts described in the Subscription table and any additional commitment fees set forth; and (ii) the Monthly Discounted Fee Rates applying to Customer’s Monthly Product Usage. New Relic will invoice the Commitment Fee as per the ‘Billing Terms’ described in an Order. On a monthly cadence during the Commitment Term, Customer’s Per Unit usage of the Products will be multiplied by the corresponding Monthly Discounted Rate and summed (“Monthly Product Usage”). Monthly Product Usage will be deducted from the Commitment Fee amounts that are paid in advance. If Monthly Product Usage exceeds any such remaining unconsumed amounts, Customer will be invoiced for the difference (“Additional Usage”), including for any Monthly Product Usage during the last month of the Commitment Term. Payment of such invoices will be governed as set forth in the Terms. Any Customer dispute to Monthly Product Usage from the prior month must be in good-faith and received by New Relic in writing within three (3) business days of the start of the next month (including for any Monthly Product Usage for the last month of the Commitment Term) or such dispute notice will be considered invalid. The dispute notice will set forth in reasonable detail the information concerning the disputed charges. The parties will use good-faith efforts to promptly resolve any disputed charges. Any unconsumed balances from the Customer payment of each annual Commitment Fee and any additional payments, if applicable, as set out in an Order will expire and lapse at the end of each year of the Commitment Term. Applicable Invoicing and Order Terms All amounts stated in an Order are non-cancelable payment obligations of the Customer for the Commitment Term regardless of usage. Any fees paid are non-refundable and do not represent a deposit for, or a credit towards, the purchase of other products not specified in an Order or for any purchase after the Commitment Term. Customer acknowledges that a final payment for the full outstanding amount of any remaining unpaid Commitment Fee and/or Monthly Product Usage Fee may be invoiced upon each anniversary date of the term start date. Tax will be added where applicable. New Relic may review Customer's use of the Products at any time. If New Relic identifies any Customer usage of the Product(s) that is not in accordance with the Terms or Documentation, New Relic may suspend such unauthorized usage. All existing purchases and related pricing in effect prior to the execution of an Order shall remain in force. Unless otherwise stated in an Order, an Order does not modify or amend any existing purchases. Additional future products or quantities are not subject to promotional pricing unless otherwise stated in an Order. In the event that a Customer indicates in an Order that it requires a purchase order (“PO”) for its subscription, Customer agrees to provide the required PO prior to the provisioning of the Products. If a Customer does not indicate a PO is required, Customer agrees that New Relic may issue invoice(s) and is entitled to such payment without a PO reference. All Additional Usage fees will be invoiced regardless of a PO requirement. The Product(s) are deemed accepted upon its provisioning. User Accounts Use of the Products require Customer users to create Login Credentials. Customer user Login Credential information must be accurate, current, and complete. New Relic’s use and collection of Login Credentials (in accordance with its General Data Privacy Notice) is for account and product management and support of its customers. Customer and Customer users must abide by the New Relic Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) and Login Credentials may not be shared. Each Customer user must have their own user account. Entry into an Order indicates your agreement that the amount of provisioned users (at the rate specified in the Order) applies in lieu of and supersedes any other amount of users of the Products that may be specified in the agreement between Customer and New Relic. New Relic One Pro and Enterprise Service Level Availability Commitment With a subscription to \"New Relic One - Pro Users\" or \"New Relic One - Enterprise Users,\" you agree that during the Commitment Term the applicable service level availability commitment set forth on the ‘Service level availability commitment’ page in the Documentation shall apply to the Products. For clarity, if your agreement with New Relic contains a different service level availability commitment or remedies, the above does not apply to your subscription to the \"New Relic One - Pro Users\" or \"New Relic One - Enterprise Users\". If you subscribe to any other New Relic Products with New Relic One pricing, any service level availability commitment or related remedies contained within your agreement with New Relic are vacated and nullified, and New Relic will use commercially reasonable efforts to make \"New Relic One - Standard Users\" available in line with industry standards. New Relic One Pro and Enterprise Support Plans With a subscription to New Relic One Users, New Relic provides an updated support plan commitment. By subscribing to New Relic One Users, you agree that during the Commitment Term the applicable Support Plan set forth on the ‘Support plan’ page in the Documentation shall apply in lieu of, and supersedes and replaces, any other support related commitments that may be contained within your agreement with New Relic. For New Relic K.K. customers (Japan), the above does not currently apply to the support offerings provided by New Relic to you. Free tier, ‘lite’, no-charge, preview access, New Relic One - Data, New Relic One - Standard User subscriptions If you are using New Relic’s Products in the free tier only, or on a no-charge, or a ‘lite’ or ‘preview access’ basis you agree that the Unpaid Terms of Service will apply to such Product usage and replace and supersede any other terms. In addition, if your subscription contains the \"New Relic One - Standard Users Product,\" you agree that the Paid Terms of Service will apply to your subscription to the Products set forth in an Order and replace and supersede any other terms. Separate Platforms Customer access to any separate platforms for purposes of applicability of governing terms, such as Community Cloud for Pixie or CodeStream, is subject to their respective terms of service. If you enable a separate platform with New Relic One, New Relic may access and exchange Customer Data with the separate platform on your behalf. For clarity, such other platforms do not form part of the New Relic One offering and, unless otherwise expressly provided in the terms and then only to the extent provided, New Relic One warranties, indemnities, etc., do not apply to use of any other platforms for purposes of applicability of governing terms. Separate platforms are not intended to meet any legal obligations for Prohibited Data uses. Further, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by New Relic, (a) for users of separate platforms, New Relic is neither a Business Associate or a subcontractor (as defined under HIPAA), nor a payment card processor, and (b) separate platforms are neither HIPAA nor PCI DSS compliant.",

      "body": "This document is about the New Relic One pricing plan. For an explanation of how that plan works, see New Relic One pricing. The document below goes into license-level details. The Usage Plan applies to (i) your Pay As You Go subscription, or (ii) your Commitment Term for the Annual Pool of Funds subscription (see a description of these two plans). New Relic may modify the Usage Plan from time to time. Any changes to the Usage Plan will become effective immediately for changes that provide a benefit or right to the Customer, all other changes will become effective if Customer assents or upon any new or renewal Commitment Term. Usage Plan - Effective as October 21, 2021: The Order and Usage Plan may contain defined terms that are denoted by capitalization. In the event that a capitalized term is not defined in either the Order or the Usage Plan, such terms shall have the meaning set forth in the New Relic One pricing definitions page. Pay As You Go By electing and subscribing to the Pay As You Go subscription model (“Pay As You Go” or “PAYG”), Customer commits to paying for the New Relic Products on a month-to-month consumption basis. Monthly Product Usage will be invoiced regardless if a PO is required or not. Any Customer dispute to Monthly Product Usage from the prior month must be in good-faith and received by New Relic in writing within three (3) business days of the start of the next month or such dispute notice will be considered invalid. The dispute notice will set forth in reasonable detail the information concerning the disputed charges. The parties will use good-faith efforts to promptly resolve any disputed charges. Customer’s usage of the Products in excess of the Free Tier each month shall be billed in arrears on the first business day of the following month based on the Customer’s Per Unit usage of each Product each month multiplied by the corresponding rates set forth in an Order and summed (“Monthly Product Usage”). Annual Pool of Funds By electing and subscribing to the Annual Pool of Funds subscription model (“Annual Pool of Funds” or “APoF”) for the Commitment Term, Customer commits in an Order to: (i) paying the Commitment Fee amounts described in the Subscription table and any additional commitment fees set forth; and (ii) the Monthly Discounted Fee Rates applying to Customer’s Monthly Product Usage. New Relic will invoice the Commitment Fee as per the ‘Billing Terms’ described in an Order. On a monthly cadence during the Commitment Term, Customer’s Per Unit usage of the Products will be multiplied by the corresponding Monthly Discounted Rate and summed (“Monthly Product Usage”). Monthly Product Usage will be deducted from the Commitment Fee amounts that are paid in advance. If Monthly Product Usage exceeds any such remaining unconsumed amounts, Customer will be invoiced for the difference (“Additional Usage”), including for any Monthly Product Usage during the last month of the Commitment Term. Payment of such invoices will be governed as set forth in the Terms. Any Customer dispute to Monthly Product Usage from the prior month must be in good-faith and received by New Relic in writing within three (3) business days of the start of the next month (including for any Monthly Product Usage for the last month of the Commitment Term) or such dispute notice will be considered invalid. The dispute notice will set forth in reasonable detail the information concerning the disputed charges. The parties will use good-faith efforts to promptly resolve any disputed charges. Any unconsumed balances from the Customer payment of each annual Commitment Fee and any additional payments, if applicable, as set out in an Order will expire and lapse at the end of each year of the Commitment Term. Applicable Invoicing and Order Terms All amounts stated in an Order are non-cancelable payment obligations of the Customer for the Commitment Term regardless of usage. Any fees paid are non-refundable and do not represent a deposit for, or a credit towards, the purchase of other products not specified in an Order or for any purchase after the Commitment Term. Customer acknowledges that a final payment for the full outstanding amount of any remaining unpaid Commitment Fee and/or Monthly Product Usage Fee may be invoiced upon each anniversary date of the term start date. Tax will be added where applicable. New Relic may review Customer's use of the Products at any time. If New Relic identifies any Customer usage of the Product(s) that is not in accordance with the Terms or Documentation, New Relic may suspend such unauthorized usage. All existing purchases and related pricing in effect prior to the execution of an Order shall remain in force. Unless otherwise stated in an Order, an Order does not modify or amend any existing purchases. Additional future products or quantities are not subject to promotional pricing unless otherwise stated in an Order. In the event that a Customer indicates in an Order that it requires a purchase order (“PO”) for its subscription, Customer agrees to provide the required PO prior to the provisioning of the Products. If a Customer does not indicate a PO is required, Customer agrees that New Relic may issue invoice(s) and is entitled to such payment without a PO reference. All Additional Usage fees will be invoiced regardless of a PO requirement. The Product(s) are deemed accepted upon its provisioning. User Accounts Use of the Products require Customer users to create Login Credentials. Customer user Login Credential information must be accurate, current, and complete. New Relic’s use and collection of Login Credentials (in accordance with its General Data Privacy Notice) is for account and product management and support of its customers. Customer and Customer users must abide by the New Relic Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) and Login Credentials may not be shared. Each Customer user must have their own user account. Entry into an Order indicates your agreement that the amount of provisioned users (at the rate specified in the Order) applies in lieu of and supersedes any other amount of users of the Products that may be specified in the agreement between Customer and New Relic. New Relic One Pro and Enterprise Service Level Availability Commitment With a subscription to \"New Relic One - Pro Users\" or \"New Relic One - Enterprise Users,\" you agree that during the Commitment Term the applicable service level availability commitment set forth on the ‘Service level availability commitment’ page in the Documentation shall apply to the Products. For clarity, if your agreement with New Relic contains a different service level availability commitment or remedies, the above does not apply to your subscription to the \"New Relic One - Pro Users\" or \"New Relic One - Enterprise Users\". If you subscribe to any other New Relic Products with New Relic One pricing, any service level availability commitment or related remedies contained within your agreement with New Relic are vacated and nullified, and New Relic will use commercially reasonable efforts to make \"New Relic One - Standard Users\" available in line with industry standards. New Relic One Pro and Enterprise Support Plans With a subscription to New Relic One Users, New Relic provides an updated support plan commitment. By subscribing to New Relic One Users, you agree that during the Commitment Term the applicable Support Plan set forth on the ‘Support plan’ page in the Documentation shall apply in lieu of, and supersedes and replaces, any other support related commitments that may be contained within your agreement with New Relic. For New Relic K.K. customers (Japan), the above does not currently apply to the support offerings provided by New Relic to you. Free tier, ‘lite’, no-charge, preview access, New Relic One - Data, New Relic One - Standard User subscriptions If you are using New Relic’s Products in the free tier only, or on a no-charge, or a ‘lite’ or ‘preview access’ basis you agree that the Unpaid Terms of Service will apply to such Product usage and replace and supersede any other terms. In addition, if your subscription contains the \"New Relic One - Standard Users Product,\" you agree that the Paid Terms of Service will apply to your subscription to the Products set forth in an Order and replace and supersede any other terms.

If you enable a separate platform with New Relic One, New Relic may access and exchange Customer Data with the separate platform on your behalf. For clarity, such other platforms do not form part of the New Relic One offering and, unless otherwise expressly provided in the terms and then only to the extent provided, New Relic One warranties, indemnities, etc., do not apply to use of any other platforms for purposes of applicability of governing terms.

      "body": "This document is about the New Relic One pricing plan. For an explanation of how that plan works, see New Relic One pricing. The document below goes into license-level details. The Usage Plan applies to (i) your Pay As You Go subscription, or (ii) your Commitment Term for the Annual Pool of Funds subscription (see a description of these two plans). New Relic may modify the Usage Plan from time to time. Any changes to the Usage Plan will become effective immediately for changes that provide a benefit or right to the Customer, all other changes will become effective if Customer assents or upon any new or renewal Commitment Term. Usage Plan - Effective as October 21, 2021: The Order and Usage Plan may contain defined terms that are denoted by capitalization. In the event that a capitalized term is not defined in either the Order or the Usage Plan, such terms shall have the meaning set forth in the New Relic One pricing definitions page. Pay As You Go By electing and subscribing to the Pay As You Go subscription model (“Pay As You Go” or “PAYG”), Customer commits to paying for the New Relic Products on a month-to-month consumption basis. Monthly Product Usage will be invoiced regardless if a PO is required or not. Any Customer dispute to Monthly Product Usage from the prior month must be in good-faith and received by New Relic in writing within three (3) business days of the start of the next month or such dispute notice will be considered invalid. The dispute notice will set forth in reasonable detail the information concerning the disputed charges. The parties will use good-faith efforts to promptly resolve any disputed charges. Customer’s usage of the Products in excess of the Free Tier each month shall be billed in arrears on the first business day of the following month based on the Customer’s Per Unit usage of each Product each month multiplied by the corresponding rates set forth in an Order and summed (“Monthly Product Usage”). Annual Pool of Funds By electing and subscribing to the Annual Pool of Funds subscription model (“Annual Pool of Funds” or “APoF”) for the Commitment Term, Customer commits in an Order to: (i) paying the Commitment Fee amounts described in the Subscription table and any additional commitment fees set forth; and (ii) the Monthly Discounted Fee Rates applying to Customer’s Monthly Product Usage. New Relic will invoice the Commitment Fee as per the ‘Billing Terms’ described in an Order. On a monthly cadence during the Commitment Term, Customer’s Per Unit usage of the Products will be multiplied by the corresponding Monthly Discounted Rate and summed (“Monthly Product Usage”). Monthly Product Usage will be deducted from the Commitment Fee amounts that are paid in advance. If Monthly Product Usage exceeds any such remaining unconsumed amounts, Customer will be invoiced for the difference (“Additional Usage”), including for any Monthly Product Usage during the last month of the Commitment Term. Payment of such invoices will be governed as set forth in the Terms. Any Customer dispute to Monthly Product Usage from the prior month must be in good-faith and received by New Relic in writing within three (3) business days of the start of the next month (including for any Monthly Product Usage for the last month of the Commitment Term) or such dispute notice will be considered invalid. The dispute notice will set forth in reasonable detail the information concerning the disputed charges. The parties will use good-faith efforts to promptly resolve any disputed charges. Any unconsumed balances from the Customer payment of each annual Commitment Fee and any additional payments, if applicable, as set out in an Order will expire and lapse at the end of each year of the Commitment Term. Applicable Invoicing and Order Terms All amounts stated in an Order are non-cancelable payment obligations of the Customer for the Commitment Term regardless of usage. Any fees paid are non-refundable and do not represent a deposit for, or a credit towards, the purchase of other products not specified in an Order or for any purchase after the Commitment Term. Customer acknowledges that a final payment for the full outstanding amount of any remaining unpaid Commitment Fee and/or Monthly Product Usage Fee may be invoiced upon each anniversary date of the term start date. Tax will be added where applicable. New Relic may review Customer's use of the Products at any time. If New Relic identifies any Customer usage of the Product(s) that is not in accordance with the Terms or Documentation, New Relic may suspend such unauthorized usage. All existing purchases and related pricing in effect prior to the execution of an Order shall remain in force. Unless otherwise stated in an Order, an Order does not modify or amend any existing purchases. Additional future products or quantities are not subject to promotional pricing unless otherwise stated in an Order. In the event that a Customer indicates in an Order that it requires a purchase order (“PO”) for its subscription, Customer agrees to provide the required PO prior to the provisioning of the Products. If a Customer does not indicate a PO is required, Customer agrees that New Relic may issue invoice(s) and is entitled to such payment without a PO reference. All Additional Usage fees will be invoiced regardless of a PO requirement. The Product(s) are deemed accepted upon its provisioning. User Accounts Use of the Products require Customer users to create Login Credentials. Customer user Login Credential information must be accurate, current, and complete. New Relic’s use and collection of Login Credentials (in accordance with its General Data Privacy Notice) is for account and product management and support of its customers. Customer and Customer users must abide by the New Relic Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) and Login Credentials may not be shared. Each Customer user must have their own user account. Entry into an Order indicates your agreement that the amount of provisioned users (at the rate specified in the Order) applies in lieu of and supersedes any other amount of users of the Products that may be specified in the agreement between Customer and New Relic. New Relic One Pro and Enterprise Service Level Availability Commitment With a subscription to \"New Relic One - Pro Users\" or \"New Relic One - Enterprise Users,\" you agree that during the Commitment Term the applicable service level availability commitment set forth on the ‘Service level availability commitment’ page in the Documentation shall apply to the Products. For clarity, if your agreement with New Relic contains a different service level availability commitment or remedies, the above does not apply to your subscription to the \"New Relic One - Pro Users\" or \"New Relic One - Enterprise Users\". If you subscribe to any other New Relic Products with New Relic One pricing, any service level availability commitment or related remedies contained within your agreement with New Relic are vacated and nullified, and New Relic will use commercially reasonable efforts to make \"New Relic One - Standard Users\" available in line with industry standards. New Relic One Pro and Enterprise Support Plans With a subscription to New Relic One Users, New Relic provides an updated support plan commitment. By subscribing to New Relic One Users, you agree that during the Commitment Term the applicable Support Plan set forth on the ‘Support plan’ page in the Documentation shall apply in lieu of, and supersedes and replaces, any other support related commitments that may be contained within your agreement with New Relic. For New Relic K.K. customers (Japan), the above does not currently apply to the support offerings provided by New Relic to you. Free tier, ‘lite’, no-charge, preview access, New Relic One - Data, New Relic One - Standard User subscriptions If you are using New Relic’s Products in the free tier only, or on a no-charge, or a ‘lite’ or ‘preview access’ basis you agree that the Unpaid Terms of Service will apply to such Product usage and replace and supersede any other terms. In addition, if your subscription contains the \"New Relic One - Standard Users Product,\" you agree that the Paid Terms of Service will apply to your subscription to the Products set forth in an Order and replace and supersede any other terms. Separate Platforms Customer access to any separate platforms for purposes of applicability of governing terms, such as Community Cloud for Pixie or CodeStream, is subject to their respective terms of service. If you enable a separate platform with New Relic One, New Relic may access and exchange Customer Data with the separate platform on your behalf. For clarity, such other platforms do not form part of the New Relic One offering and, unless otherwise expressly provided in the terms and then only to the extent provided, New Relic One warranties, indemnities, etc., do not apply to use of any other platforms for purposes of applicability of governing terms. Separate platforms are not intended to meet any legal obligations for Prohibited Data uses. Further, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by New Relic, (a) for users of separate platforms, New Relic is neither a Business Associate or a subcontractor (as defined under HIPAA), nor a payment card processor, and (b) separate platforms are neither HIPAA nor PCI DSS compliant.",

For more in-depth information, see New Relic One pricing. Q: Is there a limit on the number of concurrent sessions or IP addresses that may be used with a user account? A: Yes. See Manage users. Q: What terms govern my use of the Products? A: If a Customer has paid New Relic during a rolling 12-month period, then Customer’s usage of the Products is covered by the Paid Terms of Service.

Q: How are the number of full users (also referred to as Monthly Provisioned Users) calculated for each month? A: Please see Calculation details. Q: Can I mix and match New Relic One Standard, Pro, and Enterprise users in a billing account?

Note: Minimum requirement for Extended Retention requires an Annual Pool of Funds subscription. Q: What is included in New Relic's Free Tier of Products? A: Please see this pricing doc for a description of what's included. Customer’s use of the Free Tier shall be governed by the terms and conditions described in the Unpaid Terms of Service.

To begin with, we recommend that all New Relic users become familiar with these resources: New Relic Status Page: Get updates on any incidents New Relic Documentation: Comprehensive guidance for using our platform New Relic Community forum: Thousands of customer questions asked and answered New Relic Diagnostics: Diagnose and troubleshoot installation and configuration New Relic Open Source: Discover, research, and contribute to our open source projects New Relic Security Overview: Our approach to handling security issues You may find these resources helpful too: New Relic Developers: Resources for building custom observability applications New Relic University: A range of online training for New Relic users of every level New Relic on GitHub: Discuss issues and features related to our Open Source projects We are committed to providing documentation and tools to assist with installation, configuration, and diagnostics of New Relic’s distributed software as described here: New Relic Installation, configuration, and requirements Support channels If you need assistance with New Relic Products, you are in good hands with several support channels available to you depending on the service level associated with your New Relic account. For more information about service levels, please refer to our Support Plan. Community forum The New Relic Community Forum is 100% free and open to anyone with a New Relic account. The community is a place where many customer questions have already been asked and answered. Answers come from our community of experienced users, New Relic Support Engineers, and dozens of other Relics who help answer questions and solve problems. If you want to ask a question, check the community - if your question has not already been answered, members of the community can help. Github We want everyone to monitor their systems, and we're contributing our technology back to the open-source community to make that happen. You can find all our open source projects in our Github repo. We're committed to open standards, open-sourcing all of our instrumentation, and engaging engineers where they are, in the communities they already belong to. For more information on support for Open Source projects, visit our Open Source Support Policy. Diagnostic tools New Relic offers a diagnostics utility that can automatically detect common problems with New Relic agents. If Diagnostics detects a problem, it suggests troubleshooting steps. New Relic Diagnostics can also automatically attach troubleshooting data to a New Relic Support ticket. We have also made available Troubleshooting Frameworks that step users through common troubleshooting questions. Support ticket Support is now available in the New Relic One Platform! Just click on the question mark at the top right of your New Relic One screen to surface contextual documentation and resources. Depending on the Service Level associated with your New Relic account, you may be eligible for ticketed support and can open a ticket without leaving the New Relic One Platform. As an alternative, customers eligible for ticketed support may also open a support ticket from the New Relic Support page We are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year to help you troubleshoot issues related to the New Relic One Platform and generally available New Relic Products as outlined below. Scope of support You can have confidence that the Products we make Generally Available are fully tested with the compatible environments outlined in New Relic Documentation. New Relic’s Global Technical Support provides assistance for: the New Relic One platform and its features and capabilities, New Relic's monitoring and observability solutions, and our alerting and Applied Intelligence features. For issues within Third Party tools, or when tools in your infrastructure aren't working together properly, Global Technical Support may reach a point where we must refer New Relic users to such Third Party or community for assistance. Support includes Troubleshooting problems on the New Relic One Platform Assistance with issues during installation & upgrade in compatible environments Guidance on implementation and configuration in compatible environments Troubleshooting problems with ingesting data into New Relic General usage and best practice guidelines Identifying bugs with New Relic Products Assistance in English or Japanese Only (Japanese customer Terms of Service) Support does not include Unsupported or incompatible environments & frameworks Our Products are fully tested with the compatible environments and installation frameworks, and we’re here to help you through issues that may arise with our Products within these compatible environments and frameworks. We cannot support installation or configuration of our Products in environments or frameworks that do not meet established compatibility requirements. But if you're looking for help customizing New Relic for your particular environment, New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can assist with unique configurations or environments. Software customizations We are eager to help troubleshoot issues with the Products and features we make generally available, and those categorized as New Relic’s Open Source Community Plus Projects. New Relic’s Global Technical Support does not support customizations, modifications, or extensions to our code. Customizations or extensions to New Relic’s Open Source Projects in other Project categories are supported by the developer community in GitHub. New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can assist with unique configurations or environments. Custom applications With New Relic One, users have the ability to extend beyond the curated dashboards and design custom applications tailored to your business. New Relic’s Global Technical Support team does not support custom applications. The New Relic Developer site provides guidance on building custom apps, and here are a growing number of open source apps that you can use to get started. Custom scripts & queries We are happy to help troubleshoot issues related to the New Relic One platform that may be causing issues with a script or query. We cannot provide solutions for specific script or query use cases. New Relic Documentation and New Relic University offer resources on how to construct custom scripts and queries. End of Life New Relic may EOL products in accordance with the EOL policy. We recommend upgrading to our newest versions so you can take advantage of recent capabilities and bug fixes. More details are available in our published End of Life Policy. Beta or Limited Release Our support team covers generally available New Relic Products. Products that are in Beta or Limited Release status are not considered “generally available.” If you are invited to participate in a Beta program, or are using a Limited Release component, your account team will be your point of contact for questions. Please contact your account representative directly. Troubleshooting of customer environment We want to help every customer get the most of their New Relic experience within what are increasingly complex environments. However, we can’t help with things we didn’t build. We cannot assist with administration, configuration, or troubleshooting of a customer environment. When in doubt, you can get in touch with us, and we’ll help verify whether an issue is with our Product within a supported environment so you know where to go next. Troubleshooting third-party tools & services New Relic integrates well with many Third Party tools and services; however, we cannot support tools and services not provided or licensed by New Relic. We’ll do our best to determine whether an issue is with New Relic’s Products or caused by something outside of our control and purview. Issues with installation or configuration of the Third Party tools and services themselves should be directed to the respective owner of that Third Party tool or service or to the developer community. The Community and GitHub are great resources for assistance with Third Party tools and services as well. Some account-related functions For security reasons, some account-related Product functions must be conducted by the New Relic user designated as the “account owner,” such as Enabling SSO and High-Security Mode, adding users, and upgrading user permissions. Product training We are here to help you solve problems you may encounter on the road to instrumenting everything. Global Technical Support cannot provide user training on New Relic Products. New Relic offers a well-curated library of documentation and in-depth tutorials organized by Product, skill level, learning format, and solutions to help you navigate the observability journey. Check out New Relic University! Consultancy services Global Technical Support is here to help our valued customers as outlined in these support offerings. If you need help with something that falls outside of the Scope of Support, New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can help you navigate the challenges of building modern software and adopting the latest technologies, so you can focus on what you do best: delivering an incredible experience to your customers.

      "body": "This document is about the New Relic One pricing plan. For an explanation of how that plan works, see New Relic One pricing. The document below goes into license-level details. The Usage Plan applies to (i) your Pay As You Go subscription, or (ii) your Commitment Term for the Annual Pool of Funds subscription (see a description of these two plans). New Relic may modify the Usage Plan from time to time. Any changes to the Usage Plan will become effective immediately for changes that provide a benefit or right to the Customer, all other changes will become effective if Customer assents or upon any new or renewal Commitment Term. Usage Plan - Effective as October 21, 2021: The Order and Usage Plan may contain defined terms that are denoted by capitalization. In the event that a capitalized term is not defined in either the Order or the Usage Plan, such terms shall have the meaning set forth in the New Relic One pricing definitions page. Pay As You Go By electing and subscribing to the Pay As You Go subscription model (“Pay As You Go” or “PAYG”), Customer commits to paying for the New Relic Products on a month-to-month consumption basis. Monthly Product Usage will be invoiced regardless if a PO is required or not. Any Customer dispute to Monthly Product Usage from the prior month must be in good-faith and received by New Relic in writing within three (3) business days of the start of the next month or such dispute notice will be considered invalid. The dispute notice will set forth in reasonable detail the information concerning the disputed charges. The parties will use good-faith efforts to promptly resolve any disputed charges. Customer’s usage of the Products in excess of the Free Tier each month shall be billed in arrears on the first business day of the following month based on the Customer’s Per Unit usage of each Product each month multiplied by the corresponding rates set forth in an Order and summed (“Monthly Product Usage”). Annual Pool of Funds By electing and subscribing to the Annual Pool of Funds subscription model (“Annual Pool of Funds” or “APoF”) for the Commitment Term, Customer commits in an Order to: (i) paying the Commitment Fee amounts described in the Subscription table and any additional commitment fees set forth; and (ii) the Monthly Discounted Fee Rates applying to Customer’s Monthly Product Usage. New Relic will invoice the Commitment Fee as per the ‘Billing Terms’ described in an Order. On a monthly cadence during the Commitment Term, Customer’s Per Unit usage of the Products will be multiplied by the corresponding Monthly Discounted Rate and summed (“Monthly Product Usage”). Monthly Product Usage will be deducted from the Commitment Fee amounts that are paid in advance. If Monthly Product Usage exceeds any such remaining unconsumed amounts, Customer will be invoiced for the difference (“Additional Usage”), including for any Monthly Product Usage during the last month of the Commitment Term. Payment of such invoices will be governed as set forth in the Terms. Any Customer dispute to Monthly Product Usage from the prior month must be in good-faith and received by New Relic in writing within three (3) business days of the start of the next month (including for any Monthly Product Usage for the last month of the Commitment Term) or such dispute notice will be considered invalid. The dispute notice will set forth in reasonable detail the information concerning the disputed charges. The parties will use good-faith efforts to promptly resolve any disputed charges. Any unconsumed balances from the Customer payment of each annual Commitment Fee and any additional payments, if applicable, as set out in an Order will expire and lapse at the end of each year of the Commitment Term. Applicable Invoicing and Order Terms All amounts stated in an Order are non-cancelable payment obligations of the Customer for the Commitment Term regardless of usage. Any fees paid are non-refundable and do not represent a deposit for, or a credit towards, the purchase of other products not specified in an Order or for any purchase after the Commitment Term. Customer acknowledges that a final payment for the full outstanding amount of any remaining unpaid Commitment Fee and/or Monthly Product Usage Fee may be invoiced upon each anniversary date of the term start date. Tax will be added where applicable. New Relic may review Customer's use of the Products at any time. If New Relic identifies any Customer usage of the Product(s) that is not in accordance with the Terms or Documentation, New Relic may suspend such unauthorized usage. All existing purchases and related pricing in effect prior to the execution of an Order shall remain in force. Unless otherwise stated in an Order, an Order does not modify or amend any existing purchases. Additional future products or quantities are not subject to promotional pricing unless otherwise stated in an Order. In the event that a Customer indicates in an Order that it requires a purchase order (“PO”) for its subscription, Customer agrees to provide the required PO prior to the provisioning of the Products. If a Customer does not indicate a PO is required, Customer agrees that New Relic may issue invoice(s) and is entitled to such payment without a PO reference. All Additional Usage fees will be invoiced regardless of a PO requirement. The Product(s) are deemed accepted upon its provisioning. User Accounts Use of the Products require Customer users to create Login Credentials. Customer user Login Credential information must be accurate, current, and complete. New Relic’s use and collection of Login Credentials (in accordance with its General Data Privacy Notice) is for account and product management and support of its customers. Customer and Customer users must abide by the New Relic Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) and Login Credentials may not be shared. Each Customer user must have their own user account. Entry into an Order indicates your agreement that the amount of provisioned users (at the rate specified in the Order) applies in lieu of and supersedes any other amount of users of the Products that may be specified in the agreement between Customer and New Relic. New Relic One Pro and Enterprise Service Level Availability Commitment With a subscription to \"New Relic One - Pro Users\" or \"New Relic One - Enterprise Users,\" you agree that during the Commitment Term the applicable service level availability commitment set forth on the ‘Service level availability commitment’ page in the Documentation shall apply to the Products. For clarity, if your agreement with New Relic contains a different service level availability commitment or remedies, the above does not apply to your subscription to the \"New Relic One - Pro Users\" or \"New Relic One - Enterprise Users\". If you subscribe to any other New Relic Products with New Relic One pricing, any service level availability commitment or related remedies contained within your agreement with New Relic are vacated and nullified, and New Relic will use commercially reasonable efforts to make \"New Relic One - Standard Users\" available in line with industry standards. New Relic One Pro and Enterprise Support Plans With a subscription to New Relic One Users, New Relic provides an updated support plan commitment. By subscribing to New Relic One Users, you agree that during the Commitment Term the applicable Support Plan set forth on the ‘Support plan’ page in the Documentation shall apply in lieu of, and supersedes and replaces, any other support related commitments that may be contained within your agreement with New Relic. For New Relic K.K. customers (Japan), the above does not currently apply to the support offerings provided by New Relic to you. Free tier, ‘lite’, no-charge, preview access, New Relic One - Data, New Relic One - Standard User subscriptions If you are using New Relic’s Products in the free tier only, or on a no-charge, or a ‘lite’ or ‘preview access’ basis you agree that the Unpaid Terms of Service will apply to such Product usage and replace and supersede any other terms. In addition, if your subscription contains the \"New Relic One - Standard Users Product,\" you agree that the Paid Terms of Service will apply to your subscription to the Products set forth in an Order and replace and supersede any other terms. Separate Platforms Customer access to any separate platforms for purposes of applicability of governing terms, such as Community Cloud for Pixie or CodeStream, is subject to their respective terms of service. If you enable a separate platform with New Relic One, New Relic may access and exchange Customer Data with the separate platform on your behalf. For clarity, such other platforms do not form part of the New Relic One offering and, unless otherwise expressly provided in the terms and then only to the extent provided, New Relic One warranties, indemnities, etc., do not apply to use of any other platforms for purposes of applicability of governing terms. Separate platforms are not intended to meet any legal obligations for Prohibited Data uses. Further, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by New Relic, (a) for users of separate platforms, New Relic is neither a Business Associate or a subcontractor (as defined under HIPAA), nor a payment card processor, and (b) separate platforms are neither HIPAA nor PCI DSS compliant.",

      "body": "This document is about the New Relic One pricing plan. For an explanation of how that plan works, see New Relic One pricing. The document below goes into license-level details. The Usage Plan applies to (i) your Pay As You Go subscription, or (ii) your Commitment Term for the Annual Pool of Funds subscription (see a description of these two plans). New Relic may modify the Usage Plan from time to time. Any changes to the Usage Plan will become effective immediately for changes that provide a benefit or right to the Customer, all other changes will become effective if Customer assents or upon any new or renewal Commitment Term. Usage Plan - Effective as October 21, 2021: The Order and Usage Plan may contain defined terms that are denoted by capitalization. In the event that a capitalized term is not defined in either the Order or the Usage Plan, such terms shall have the meaning set forth in the New Relic One pricing definitions page. Pay As You Go By electing and subscribing to the Pay As You Go subscription model (“Pay As You Go” or “PAYG”), Customer commits to paying for the New Relic Products on a month-to-month consumption basis. Monthly Product Usage will be invoiced regardless if a PO is required or not. Any Customer dispute to Monthly Product Usage from the prior month must be in good-faith and received by New Relic in writing within three (3) business days of the start of the next month or such dispute notice will be considered invalid. The dispute notice will set forth in reasonable detail the information concerning the disputed charges. The parties will use good-faith efforts to promptly resolve any disputed charges. Customer’s usage of the Products in excess of the Free Tier each month shall be billed in arrears on the first business day of the following month based on the Customer’s Per Unit usage of each Product each month multiplied by the corresponding rates set forth in an Order and summed (“Monthly Product Usage”). Annual Pool of Funds By electing and subscribing to the Annual Pool of Funds subscription model (“Annual Pool of Funds” or “APoF”) for the Commitment Term, Customer commits in an Order to: (i) paying the Commitment Fee amounts described in the Subscription table and any additional commitment fees set forth; and (ii) the Monthly Discounted Fee Rates applying to Customer’s Monthly Product Usage. New Relic will invoice the Commitment Fee as per the ‘Billing Terms’ described in an Order. On a monthly cadence during the Commitment Term, Customer’s Per Unit usage of the Products will be multiplied by the corresponding Monthly Discounted Rate and summed (“Monthly Product Usage”). Monthly Product Usage will be deducted from the Commitment Fee amounts that are paid in advance. If Monthly Product Usage exceeds any such remaining unconsumed amounts, Customer will be invoiced for the difference (“Additional Usage”), including for any Monthly Product Usage during the last month of the Commitment Term. Payment of such invoices will be governed as set forth in the Terms. Any Customer dispute to Monthly Product Usage from the prior month must be in good-faith and received by New Relic in writing within three (3) business days of the start of the next month (including for any Monthly Product Usage for the last month of the Commitment Term) or such dispute notice will be considered invalid. The dispute notice will set forth in reasonable detail the information concerning the disputed charges. The parties will use good-faith efforts to promptly resolve any disputed charges. Any unconsumed balances from the Customer payment of each annual Commitment Fee and any additional payments, if applicable, as set out in an Order will expire and lapse at the end of each year of the Commitment Term. Applicable Invoicing and Order Terms All amounts stated in an Order are non-cancelable payment obligations of the Customer for the Commitment Term regardless of usage. Any fees paid are non-refundable and do not represent a deposit for, or a credit towards, the purchase of other products not specified in an Order or for any purchase after the Commitment Term. Customer acknowledges that a final payment for the full outstanding amount of any remaining unpaid Commitment Fee and/or Monthly Product Usage Fee may be invoiced upon each anniversary date of the term start date. Tax will be added where applicable. New Relic may review Customer's use of the Products at any time. If New Relic identifies any Customer usage of the Product(s) that is not in accordance with the Terms or Documentation, New Relic may suspend such unauthorized usage. All existing purchases and related pricing in effect prior to the execution of an Order shall remain in force. Unless otherwise stated in an Order, an Order does not modify or amend any existing purchases. Additional future products or quantities are not subject to promotional pricing unless otherwise stated in an Order. In the event that a Customer indicates in an Order that it requires a purchase order (“PO”) for its subscription, Customer agrees to provide the required PO prior to the provisioning of the Products. If a Customer does not indicate a PO is required, Customer agrees that New Relic may issue invoice(s) and is entitled to such payment without a PO reference. All Additional Usage fees will be invoiced regardless of a PO requirement. The Product(s) are deemed accepted upon its provisioning. User Accounts Use of the Products require Customer users to create Login Credentials. Customer user Login Credential information must be accurate, current, and complete. New Relic’s use and collection of Login Credentials (in accordance with its General Data Privacy Notice) is for account and product management and support of its customers. Customer and Customer users must abide by the New Relic Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) and Login Credentials may not be shared. Each Customer user must have their own user account. Entry into an Order indicates your agreement that the amount of provisioned users (at the rate specified in the Order) applies in lieu of and supersedes any other amount of users of the Products that may be specified in the agreement between Customer and New Relic. New Relic One Pro and Enterprise Service Level Availability Commitment With a subscription to \"New Relic One - Pro Users\" or \"New Relic One - Enterprise Users,\" you agree that during the Commitment Term the applicable service level availability commitment set forth on the ‘Service level availability commitment’ page in the Documentation shall apply to the Products. For clarity, if your agreement with New Relic contains a different service level availability commitment or remedies, the above does not apply to your subscription to the \"New Relic One - Pro Users\" or \"New Relic One - Enterprise Users\". If you subscribe to any other New Relic Products with New Relic One pricing, any service level availability commitment or related remedies contained within your agreement with New Relic are vacated and nullified, and New Relic will use commercially reasonable efforts to make \"New Relic One - Standard Users\" available in line with industry standards. New Relic One Pro and Enterprise Support Plans With a subscription to New Relic One Users, New Relic provides an updated support plan commitment. By subscribing to New Relic One Users, you agree that during the Commitment Term the applicable Support Plan set forth on the ‘Support plan’ page in the Documentation shall apply in lieu of, and supersedes and replaces, any other support related commitments that may be contained within your agreement with New Relic. For New Relic K.K. customers (Japan), the above does not currently apply to the support offerings provided by New Relic to you. Free tier, ‘lite’, no-charge, preview access, New Relic One - Data, New Relic One - Standard User subscriptions If you are using New Relic’s Products in the free tier only, or on a no-charge, or a ‘lite’ or ‘preview access’ basis you agree that the Unpaid Terms of Service will apply to such Product usage and replace and supersede any other terms. In addition, if your subscription contains the \"New Relic One - Standard Users Product,\" you agree that the Paid Terms of Service will apply to your subscription to the Products set forth in an Order and replace and supersede any other terms. Separate Platforms Customer access to any separate platforms for purposes of applicability of governing terms, such as Community Cloud for Pixie or CodeStream, is subject to their respective terms of service. If you enable a separate platform with New Relic One, New Relic may access and exchange Customer Data with the separate platform on your behalf. For clarity, such other platforms do not form part of the New Relic One offering and, unless otherwise expressly provided in the terms and then only to the extent provided, New Relic One warranties, indemnities, etc., do not apply to use of any other platforms for purposes of applicability of governing terms. Separate platforms are not intended to meet any legal obligations for Prohibited Data uses. Further, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by New Relic, (a) for users of separate platforms, New Relic is neither a Business Associate or a subcontractor (as defined under HIPAA), nor a payment card processor, and (b) separate platforms are neither HIPAA nor PCI DSS compliant.",
