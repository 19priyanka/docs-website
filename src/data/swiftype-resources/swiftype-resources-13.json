Solution If some metrics are not being collected regularly, do the following: Check if the CPU is being throttled, and if the memory allocated to the container is enough. In case the container doesn't have enough resources available, it may send data with a longer interval between samples. Low memory limit may cause the integration to be killed and restarted. The correct limits and requests of resources can vary according to the number of targets monitored, and the number of metrics exposed by each target.For more information, see the guidelines in the large environment configuration documentation. Check for the following error message in the logs of the integration: {\"err\":\"unexpected post response code: 413: Request Entity Too Large\"} Copy This issue causes some payloads to be dropped, and it is currently fixed in new releases. If present, update the image to the most recent version. If some /metrics endpoints that are monitored by the integration time out or take several seconds to answer, they may slow down the scraping of data. The integration's performance can degrade if multiple endpoints take a huge amount of time to answer. This leads to intermittent and missing data.

Fix the endpoints with a latency above 1s, or exclude them from the monitoring removing the Prometheus scraping label. If it's not feasible to remove these endpoints, and the latency in the answer can't be avoided, configure the integration to run more workers in parallel. This allows the integration to fetch more endpoints at the same time. To do so, update the integration to the most recent version, and apply the new configuration option worker_threads. We advise to do it gradually, from 4, 6, 8 and up to 16. This workaround only minimizes the issue, and if multiple endpoints are misbehaving, performances will still be degraded. Moreover, memory and CPU consumption will increase with the number of workers, so memory and CPU must be increased accordingly.

SELECT latest(nr_stats_integration_process_duration_seconds) FROM Metric where clusterName=’clustername' SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy First, update the integration to the latest image published. Then, to reduce the time needed to scrape all the targets, increase the number of workers with the configuration option worker_threads. We advise is to do it gradually, from 4 to 6, 8, and up to 16 until r_stats_integration_process_duration_seconds approaches the defined scrape_duration.

Solution If some metrics are not being collected regularly, do the following: Check if the CPU is being throttled, and if the memory allocated to the container is enough. In case the container doesn't have enough resources available, it may send data with a longer interval between samples. Low memory limit may cause the integration to be killed and restarted. The correct limits and requests of resources can vary according to the number of targets monitored, and the number of metrics exposed by each target.For more information, see the guidelines in the large environment configuration documentation. Check for the following error message in the logs of the integration: {\"err\":\"unexpected post response code: 413: Request Entity Too Large\"} Copy This issue causes some payloads to be dropped, and it is currently fixed in new releases. If present, update the image to the most recent version. If some /metrics endpoints that are monitored by the integration time out or take several seconds to answer, they may slow down the scraping of data. The integration's performance can degrade if multiple endpoints take a huge amount of time to answer. This leads to intermittent and missing data. To detect those endpoints, run: SELECT average(nr_stats_integration_fetch_target_duration_seconds) FROM Metric where clusterName=’clustername' SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO FACET target LIMIT 30 Copy This query retrieves the data exposed by the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration, and it shows the time required to fetch each endpoint. Fix the endpoints with a latency above 1s, or exclude them from the monitoring removing the Prometheus scraping label. If it's not feasible to remove these endpoints, and the latency in the answer can't be avoided, configure the integration to run more workers in parallel. This allows the integration to fetch more endpoints at the same time. To do so, update the integration to the most recent version, and apply the new configuration option worker_threads. We advise to do it gradually, from 4, 6, 8 and up to 16. This workaround only minimizes the issue, and if multiple endpoints are misbehaving, performances will still be degraded. Moreover, memory and CPU consumption will increase with the number of workers, so memory and CPU must be increased accordingly. In case all the endpoints monitored have a low latency, and the container is not being throttled, run the following query. This helps you verify how much time the integration is taking to scrape all the targets, and to send the data if it's exceeding the configured scrape_duration.

To detect those endpoints, run: SELECT average(nr_stats_integration_fetch_target_duration_seconds) FROM Metric where clusterName=’clustername' SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO FACET target LIMIT 30 Copy This query retrieves the data exposed by the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration, and it shows the time required to fetch each endpoint. Fix the endpoints with a latency above 1s, or exclude them from the monitoring removing the Prometheus scraping label. If it's not feasible to remove these endpoints, and the latency in the answer can't be avoided, configure the integration to run more workers in parallel. This allows the integration to fetch more endpoints at the same time. To do so, update the integration to the most recent version, and apply the new configuration option worker_threads. We advise to do it gradually, from 4, 6, 8 and up to 16. This workaround only minimizes the issue, and if multiple endpoints are misbehaving, performances will still be degraded. Moreover, memory and CPU consumption will increase with the number of workers, so memory and CPU must be increased accordingly. In case all the endpoints monitored have a low latency, and the container is not being throttled, run the following query. This helps you verify how much time the integration is taking to scrape all the targets, and to send the data if it's exceeding the configured scrape_duration. SELECT latest(nr_stats_integration_process_duration_seconds) FROM Metric where clusterName=’clustername' SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy First, update the integration to the latest image published. Then, to reduce the time needed to scrape all the targets, increase the number of workers with the configuration option worker_threads. We advise is to do it gradually, from 4 to 6, 8, and up to 16 until r_stats_integration_process_duration_seconds approaches the defined scrape_duration. Note that memory consumption and CPU usage will increase.",

You can also translate your PromQL-style queries to NRQL using either Grafana or the query builder. All metrics for Docker and Kubernetes are stored in the Metric type. Default attributes for the OpenMetrics integration By default, the following attributes will be added to all metrics for Docker and Kubernetes integrations: Default attributes (all integrations) Description clusterName The name of the cluster provided in the scraper configuration. integrationName The name of this integration (nri-prometheus). integrationVersion The version of the integration; for example, 0.2.0. metricName The name of the metric itself. nrMetricType The type of the New Relic Metric type; for example, Gauges. promMetricType The metric type of the Prometheus metric scrapedEndpoint The URL of the endpoint is being scraped. Kubernetes: If the scraper is running in Kubernetes, New Relic also adds the following attributes to all the metrics: Additional Kubernetes attributes Description deploymentName Name of the deployment, if scraping a pod. label The Kubernetes labels of the object being scraped, prefixed by \"label\". namespaceName Name of the namespace. nodeName Name of the node where the pod being scraped is running, if applicable. podName Name of the pod being scraped, if applicable. serviceName Name of the service being scraped, if applicable Default attributes for the remote write integration By default, the following attributes will be added to Prometheus remote write metrics: Default attributes (all integrations) Description prometheus_server A user supplied label specified as a Prometheus remote write URL parameter. The value supplied should be unique as it is intended to differentiate between source Prometheus servers at query time. Unspecified by default. newrelic.source The name of the New Relic ingest point (prometheusAPI). instrumentation.provider prometheus instrumentation.name remote-write instrumentation.source A user supplied identifier for the source of the Prometheus data that matches the value of prometheus_server. instrumentation.version Used to identify the version of the remote write API; for example, 0.0.1. NRQL query examples When you build queries, be aware that there is no linking between the metrics, entities, and attributes. Use the following NRQL queries to find out which metrics are available and which attributes are present on these metrics: Get metric names To get all metric names for OpenMetrics: FROM Metric SELECT uniques(metricName) Copy To get metric names for a remote write integration: FROM Metric SELECT uniques(metricName) WHERE instrumentation.provider='prometheus' AND instrumentation.name='remote-write' Copy To get metric names for a remote write integration from a single Prometheus source: FROM Metric SELECT uniques(metricName) WHERE instrumentation.provider='prometheus' AND instrumentation.name='remote-write' AND instrumentation.source='<ds>' Copy To get metric names for a specific OpenMetrics endpoint: FROM Metric SELECT uniques(metricName) WHERE scrapedEndpoint='<ep>' Copy To get metric names for a specific OpenMetrics cluster, namespace, or pod: FROM Metric SELECT uniques(metricName) WHERE clusterName='<cn>' Copy FROM Metric SELECT uniques(metricName) WHERE namespaceName='<ns>' Copy FROM Metric SELECT uniques(metricName) WHERE podName='<pod>' Copy Get the attributes for a metric To get all attributes for the selected metric: FROM Metric SELECT keyset() WHERE metricName='<mn>' Copy Get the values for an attribute in OpenMetrics The autocomplete will show all values of the attribute, regardless of the pod. To determine the attribute values for a specific pod: FROM Metric SELECT uniques(<attribute>) WHERE metricName='<mn>' AND podName='<pod>' Copy Build the query Using metric name and attributes, you can query your data. For more information about facets, time series, and time selection, see the NRQL documentation. To build PromQL-style queries, see our docs. Get metric values To get raw metric values: FROM Metric SELECT <metricName> WHERE <attribute>='<value>' Copy Get a chart of the metric To get a chart of the metric with an aggregator of average, min, max, or sum: FROM Metric SELECT <aggregator>(<metricname>) WHERE <attribute>='<value>' TIMESERIES Copy Query counter metrics (deltas) Currently the integration calculates the deltas for counter metrics. This is why queries on counter metrics will show the deltas of the counter instead of the absolute value of the counter. View connected Redis clients per pod with OpenMetrics Docker: This example assumes you are scraping Redis exporters. To view the number of connected Redis clients per endpoint in a cluster: FROM Metric SELECT latest(redis_connected_clients) WHERE clusterName='my-cluster' FACET scrapedEndpoint TIMESERIES Copy Kubernetes: This example assumes that you have Redis pods with the Redis exporter installed. To view the number of connected Redis clients per pod in the default namespace: FROM Metric SELECT latest(redis_connected_clients) WHERE namespaceName='default' FACET podName TIMESERIES Copy Docker: View average memory free for scraped endpoints This example assumes you are scraping node exporters for Docker and want to use OpenMetrics. To view average memory free for all scraped endpoints in a cluster: FROM Metric SELECT average(node_memory_MemFree_bytes) WHERE clusterName='my-cluster' Copy Kubernetes: View average memory usage for pods in a deployment To view average memory usage for all pods in a Kubernetes deployment using OpenMetrics: FROM Metric SELECT average(container_memory_usage_bytes) WHERE deploymentName='my-app-deployment' AND namespaceName='default' Copy View data in New Relic When you query the data, you can view the results in the New Relic UI. You can also visualize the data as charts, histograms, etc. To view the NRQL query results for your Prometheus integration's data: Go to one.newrelic.com > Query your data. For more information, see New Relic's query builder documentation. Generate histograms and calculate percentiles Using Prometheus remote write or version 2.0.0 and higher of the Prometheus OpenMetrics Integration (POMI), you can generate histograms and calculate percentiles from your data. For Prometheus histograms, a bucket <basename>_bucket{le=\"42\"} will be sent as the metric <basename>_bucket, and the dimension will be {histogram.bucket.le=\"42\"}. NRQL has two functions that work on Prometheus histograms ingested via remote write or the Prometheus OpenMetrics Integration (starting with version 2.0.0): bucketPercentile(), and histogram().

      "body": "Do you have a PromQL query you’d like to convert to NRQL? This document provides examples that show you how to convert some common PromQL queries to NRQL queries. You can use our PromQL-style query language to explore your Prometheus OpenMetrics integration data along with other data sent to New Relic. Tip To run PromQL-style queries in New Relic One, go to the query builder advanced PromQL-style mode. Prometheus and New Relic metric types The different metric types supported by Prometheus and New Relic are related to each other: New Relic Prometheus Description Count Counter The Prometheus counter is a cumulative sum while the New Relic count is a delta sum. For example, if you see 2 requests in the first reporting period and 3 requests in the second reporting period. The Prometheus counter will report 2 and then 5, while the New Relic count will report 2 and then 3. Gauge Gauge A Prometheus gauge is similar to a New Relic gauge. Multiple counts Histogram Prometheus automatically maps a histogram to a set of counters. In New Relic, these counters should be changed to deltas and reported as counts. Gauges and counts Summary Prometheus represents a Summary with a given basename as the following time series: a basename_sum a basename_count and 0 or more of basename{quantile=\".xx\"...} metrics New Relic maps the _sum as a Summary, the _count as a Counter, and each quantile metric as a Gauge. Summary (No equivalent in Prometheus) New Relic has a distinct metric type called a summary that is different than the Prometheus summary. It is designed for reporting aggregated discrete events so that you can query the count, sum, min, max, and average values. Mapping between NRQL and our PromQL-style queries Tip To see how New Relic translates PromQL-style queries to NRQL, write a query in the query builder PromQL-style tab, then switch to the NRQL tab. This table shows the mapping between NRQL and our PromQL-style queries when exploring data. For more contextual information, see the examples. Description Mapping between NRQL and PromQL-style queries Search for attributes: Explore the attributes on the container_memory_usage_bytes metric. PromQL: container_memory_usage_bytes Copy NRQL: FROM Metric SELECT keyset() WHERE metricName = 'container_memory_usage_bytes' Copy Find attribute's value: Explore the current value of the container_memory_usage_bytes metric for unique id attributes. PromQL: sum(container_memory_usage_bytes) by (id) Copy NRQL: FROM Metric SELECT latest(container_memory_usage_bytes) FACET id Copy Visualize the attribute's value: Chart the value of the container_memory_usage_bytes metric with the given id attribute value. PromQL: container_memory_usage_bytes{id=\"/\"} Copy NRQL: FROM Metric SELECT latest(container_memory_usage_bytes) WHERE id = '/' TIMESERIES Copy PromQL-style query example 1. Start your query. When exploring your data for a particular metric in PromQL, such as memory by container usage in bytes, you can start with a query such as: container_memory_usage_bytes Copy This will chart all the unique metric timeseries for the input metric. 2. Filter the query results. Looking at the data, you can add more query parameters to filter down the number of metric timeseries. For example, if you only want timeseries where the id is /, the PromQL-style query will be: container_memory_usage_bytes{id=\"/\"} Copy PromQL-style example: To filter the data, run this PromQL-style query: container_memory_usage_bytes { id=\"/\"}. NRQL query example 1. Query available metrics. To explore your data, start by looking at all the available metrics. Use the following NRQL query: FROM Metric SELECT uniques(metricName) Copy 2. Find unique attributes. Once you have found the metric you want to review, such as container_memory_usage_bytes, you can find the unique attributes with the following query: FROM Metric SELECT keyset() WHERE metricName = 'container_memory_usage_bytes' Copy The results will show each available attribute key and the value type (string, boolean, or number). 3. Aggregate and chart the metrics. To chart metrics using NRQL, you first need an aggregation function. For example, you can use latest for gauges, sum for counts, and average for summaries. As the following chart shows, all the unique timeseries are aggregated into one unique timeseries by default: one.newrelic.com > Query your data: This example shows the data you see after running FROM Metric SELECT keyset() WHERE metricName = 'container_memory_usage_bytes'. 4. View metrics by ID. To view the unique metric timeseries with various id values, run the following query: FROM Metric SELECT latest(container_memory_usage_bytes) FACET id Copy one.newrelic.com > Query your data: This example shows the data you see after running FROM Metric SELECT latest(container_memory_usage_bytes) FACET id. 5. Add the selected ID to the query. Next you can select an id value and put it in the NRQL where clause. FROM Metric SELECT latest(container_memory_usage_bytes) WHERE id = \"/\" timeseries Copy one.newrelic.com > Query your data: This example shows the data displayed after running From Metric select latest(container_memory_usage_bytes) where id = \"/\" timeseries. Filter examples Both our PromQL-style query language and NRQL provide syntax to filter down the number of unique metric timeseries. PromQL-style uses brackets to filter. NRQL uses a WHERE clause. Here are some example queries: Description PromQL-style and NRQL queries Select data with specific values. PromQL: go_memstats_heap_alloc_bytes{job=\"apiserver\", instance=\"1234\"}) Copy NRQL: To only select data with specific values in NRQL, use the WHERE clause with =. In this example, all data must have the selected value for job and handler. FROM Metric SELECT latest(go_memstats_heap_alloc_bytes) WHERE job = 'apiserver' AND instance = '1234' TIMESERIES Copy Select data with multiple values. PromQL: go_memstats_heap_alloc_bytes{environment=~\"staging|testing|development\",method!=\"GET\"} Copy NRQL: In NRQL use the in clause to select multiple values for an attribute and the != sign to select all values but the one listed. In this example, the environment can be staging, testing, or development, and the method cannot be GET. FROM Metric SELECT latest(go_memstats_heap_alloc_bytes) WHERE environment IN ('staging', 'testing', 'development') AND method != 'GET' TIMESERIES Copy Select data using partial string values. PromQL: go_memstats_heap_alloc_bytes{job=~\"api.*\"} Copy NRQL: In NRQL use the LIKE clause to match part of a string value. In this example, all data will be returned where the job attributes start with api. FROM Metric SELECT latest(go_memstats_heap_alloc_bytes) WHEREe job LIKE 'api%' TIMESERIES Copy PromQL-style to NRQL query examples You can simulate the following PromQL-style queries with NRQL queries: Description PromQL-style and NRQL queries Measure the per second rate over the last minute of the http_request_total metric. PromQL: sum(rate(http_requests_total[1m])) Copy NRQL: FROM Metric SELECT rate(sum(http_request_total), 1 second) TIMESERIES 1 minute Copy Chart the difference of the two metrics, then divide by 1024. PromQL: (instance_memory_limit_bytes - instance_memory_usage_bytes) / 1024 Copy NRQL: FROM Metric SELECT (latest(instance_memory_limit_bytes) - latest(instance_memory_usage_bytes)) / 1024 TIMESERIES Copy Provide the summed rate per 30-second interval by each handler. PromQL: sum(rate(http_requests_total[30s])) by (handler) Copy NRQL: FROM Metric SELECT rate(sum(http_requests_total), 30 seconds) FACET handler TIMESERIES Copy Chart the difference in the two metrics where the instance is named foo and the fstype is either ext4 or xfs. PromQL: (node_filesystem_free_bytes{instance='foo',fstype=~\"ext4|xfs\"} / node_filesystem_size_bytes{instance='foo',fstype=~\"ext4|xfs\"}) Copy NRQL: FROM Metric SELECT latest(node_filesystem_free_bytes) / latest(node_filesystem_size_bytes) WHERE instance = 'foo' AND fstype IN ('ext4', 'xfs') Copy",

      "body": "Problem You have installed the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration for Docker or Kubernetes, but you notice sparse data, missing metrics, and data gaps in New Relic's UI. Solution If some metrics are not being collected regularly, do the following: Check if the CPU is being throttled, and if the memory allocated to the container is enough. In case the container doesn't have enough resources available, it may send data with a longer interval between samples. Low memory limit may cause the integration to be killed and restarted. The correct limits and requests of resources can vary according to the number of targets monitored, and the number of metrics exposed by each target.For more information, see the guidelines in the large environment configuration documentation. Check for the following error message in the logs of the integration: {\"err\":\"unexpected post response code: 413: Request Entity Too Large\"} Copy This issue causes some payloads to be dropped, and it is currently fixed in new releases. If present, update the image to the most recent version. If some /metrics endpoints that are monitored by the integration time out or take several seconds to answer, they may slow down the scraping of data. The integration's performance can degrade if multiple endpoints take a huge amount of time to answer. This leads to intermittent and missing data. To detect those endpoints, run: SELECT average(nr_stats_integration_fetch_target_duration_seconds) FROM Metric where clusterName=’clustername' SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO FACET target LIMIT 30 Copy This query retrieves the data exposed by the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration, and it shows the time required to fetch each endpoint. Fix the endpoints with a latency above 1s, or exclude them from the monitoring removing the Prometheus scraping label. If it's not feasible to remove these endpoints, and the latency in the answer can't be avoided, configure the integration to run more workers in parallel. This allows the integration to fetch more endpoints at the same time. To do so, update the integration to the most recent version, and apply the new configuration option worker_threads. We advise to do it gradually, from 4, 6, 8 and up to 16. This workaround only minimizes the issue, and if multiple endpoints are misbehaving, performances will still be degraded. Moreover, memory and CPU consumption will increase with the number of workers, so memory and CPU must be increased accordingly. In case all the endpoints monitored have a low latency, and the container is not being throttled, run the following query. This helps you verify how much time the integration is taking to scrape all the targets, and to send the data if it's exceeding the configured scrape_duration. SELECT latest(nr_stats_integration_process_duration_seconds) FROM Metric where clusterName=’clustername' SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy First, update the integration to the latest image published. Then, to reduce the time needed to scrape all the targets, increase the number of workers with the configuration option worker_threads. We advise is to do it gradually, from 4 to 6, 8, and up to 16 until r_stats_integration_process_duration_seconds approaches the defined scrape_duration. Note that memory consumption and CPU usage will increase.",

You can also translate your PromQL-style queries to NRQL using either Grafana or the query builder. All metrics for Docker and Kubernetes are stored in the Metric type. Default attributes for the OpenMetrics integration By default, the following attributes will be added to all metrics for Docker and Kubernetes integrations: Default attributes (all integrations) Description clusterName The name of the cluster provided in the scraper configuration. integrationName The name of this integration (nri-prometheus). integrationVersion The version of the integration; for example, 0.2.0. metricName The name of the metric itself. nrMetricType The type of the New Relic Metric type; for example, Gauges. promMetricType The metric type of the Prometheus metric scrapedEndpoint The URL of the endpoint is being scraped. Kubernetes: If the scraper is running in Kubernetes, New Relic also adds the following attributes to all the metrics: Additional Kubernetes attributes Description deploymentName Name of the deployment, if scraping a pod. label The Kubernetes labels of the object being scraped, prefixed by \"label\". namespaceName Name of the namespace. nodeName Name of the node where the pod being scraped is running, if applicable. podName Name of the pod being scraped, if applicable. serviceName Name of the service being scraped, if applicable Default attributes for the remote write integration By default, the following attributes will be added to Prometheus remote write metrics: Default attributes (all integrations) Description prometheus_server A user supplied label specified as a Prometheus remote write URL parameter. The value supplied should be unique as it is intended to differentiate between source Prometheus servers at query time. Unspecified by default. newrelic.source The name of the New Relic ingest point (prometheusAPI). instrumentation.provider prometheus instrumentation.name remote-write instrumentation.source A user supplied identifier for the source of the Prometheus data that matches the value of prometheus_server. instrumentation.version Used to identify the version of the remote write API; for example, 0.0.1. NRQL query examples When you build queries, be aware that there is no linking between the metrics, entities, and attributes. Use the following NRQL queries to find out which metrics are available and which attributes are present on these metrics: Get metric names To get all metric names for OpenMetrics: FROM Metric SELECT uniques(metricName) Copy To get metric names for a remote write integration: FROM Metric SELECT uniques(metricName) WHERE instrumentation.provider='prometheus' AND instrumentation.name='remote-write' Copy To get metric names for a remote write integration from a single Prometheus source: FROM Metric SELECT uniques(metricName) WHERE instrumentation.provider='prometheus' AND instrumentation.name='remote-write' AND instrumentation.source='<ds>' Copy To get metric names for a specific OpenMetrics endpoint: FROM Metric SELECT uniques(metricName) WHERE scrapedEndpoint='<ep>' Copy To get metric names for a specific OpenMetrics cluster, namespace, or pod: FROM Metric SELECT uniques(metricName) WHERE clusterName='<cn>' Copy FROM Metric SELECT uniques(metricName) WHERE namespaceName='<ns>' Copy FROM Metric SELECT uniques(metricName) WHERE podName='<pod>' Copy Get the attributes for a metric To get all attributes for the selected metric: FROM Metric SELECT keyset() WHERE metricName='<mn>' Copy Get the values for an attribute in OpenMetrics The autocomplete will show all values of the attribute, regardless of the pod. To determine the attribute values for a specific pod: FROM Metric SELECT uniques(<attribute>) WHERE metricName='<mn>' AND podName='<pod>' Copy Build the query Using metric name and attributes, you can query your data. For more information about facets, time series, and time selection, see the NRQL documentation. To build PromQL-style queries, see our docs. Get metric values To get raw metric values: FROM Metric SELECT <metricName> WHERE <attribute>='<value>' Copy Get a chart of the metric To get a chart of the metric with an aggregator of average, min, max, or sum: FROM Metric SELECT <aggregator>(<metricname>) WHERE <attribute>='<value>' TIMESERIES Copy Query counter metrics (deltas) Currently the integration calculates the deltas for counter metrics. This is why queries on counter metrics will show the deltas of the counter instead of the absolute value of the counter. View connected Redis clients per pod with OpenMetrics Docker: This example assumes you are scraping Redis exporters.

      "body": "New Relic supports PromQL-style queries, and our query builder offers a PromQL-style query mode that translates PromQL syntax queries into the closest NRQL approximation. Although the method of approximation means that a handful of edge cases are not fully supported, it provides coverage for an overwhelming majority of queries, supporting over 99.5% of queries across the 7.8 million top Grafana dashboard downloads. Read on to learn about how we work with PromQL queries, as well as differences between standard PromQL and our PromQL-like query language we want you to be aware of. Important For general information about Prometheus queries and operators, see the Prometheus.io documentation. Supported features We support the following aggregation, arithmetic, mathematical, and rate-like functions. As we continue to expand support for Prometheus and PromQL, this list will be updated.

PromQL troubleshooting This section describes differences in behavior between PromQL and our PromQL-style query behavior and how to work with and around these differences. This is particularly relevant if you want to use advanced queries and our PromQL-style mode in the query builder. Metric types Prometheus recommendations note that you should only use some functions, like delta(), on gauges, and only use others like rate() and increase() on counters, but queries in Prometheus still work most of the time even if they don’t follow those instructions. However, because NRDB converts PromQL-style accumulating counters to delta counters, our implementation is unforgiving when using these functions on the wrong data type and will produce different or incorrect answers. For this reason, it's best to follow all Prometheus recommendations when working with our PromQL-style queries, even if you don't follow these recommendations in Prometheus. Limits In order to ensure the stability and performance of our system for all users, we place some limits on what queries can be run. In all cases, we enforce a limit of 366 steps in range queries. We also default to only returning 100 timeseries from queries by default. If you want to see more (or fewer), you need to explicitly add a topk() to your query. (Note that the topk() implementation in our PromQL-style query is different from that of Prometheus.) We limit the total memory a query can use. This means that requests for large numbers of time steps or large numbers of time series may be rejected, particularly if they are combined with an aggregation like unique count or quantile which require significantly more memory to compute than simple arithmetic aggregations. Range vector selectors (sliding windows and smoothing behavior) We provide support for sliding window timeseries aggregations. For more information, see our NRQL syntax, clauses, and functions resource and our sliding windows deep dive. For information on translating between NRQL and our PromQL-style language, see Translate PromQL queries to NRQL. Query range and data scraping intervals The range of your query in PromQL must be larger than the duration of the step size of the query to avoid the error \"TIMESERIES bucket size is larger than the current time window\". We inspect data up to one minute old when servicing instant queries. If your scrape interval is greater than 1 minute, some queries may result in No data found. Avoid this by sending data at least once per minute. If the timeseries unit for your NRQL query is less than the scrape interval for your application, some periods will lack data, and the resulting graph may be jagged or contain peaks and valleys. In general, set the step size to your scrape interval, or higher.",

      "body": "Do you have a PromQL query you’d like to convert to NRQL? This document provides examples that show you how to convert some common PromQL queries to NRQL queries. You can use our PromQL-style query language to explore your Prometheus OpenMetrics integration data along with other data sent to New Relic. Tip To run PromQL-style queries in New Relic One, go to the query builder advanced PromQL-style mode. Prometheus and New Relic metric types The different metric types supported by Prometheus and New Relic are related to each other: New Relic Prometheus Description Count Counter The Prometheus counter is a cumulative sum while the New Relic count is a delta sum. For example, if you see 2 requests in the first reporting period and 3 requests in the second reporting period. The Prometheus counter will report 2 and then 5, while the New Relic count will report 2 and then 3. Gauge Gauge A Prometheus gauge is similar to a New Relic gauge. Multiple counts Histogram Prometheus automatically maps a histogram to a set of counters. In New Relic, these counters should be changed to deltas and reported as counts. Gauges and counts Summary Prometheus represents a Summary with a given basename as the following time series: a basename_sum a basename_count and 0 or more of basename{quantile=\".xx\"...} metrics New Relic maps the _sum as a Summary, the _count as a Counter, and each quantile metric as a Gauge. Summary (No equivalent in Prometheus) New Relic has a distinct metric type called a summary that is different than the Prometheus summary. It is designed for reporting aggregated discrete events so that you can query the count, sum, min, max, and average values. Mapping between NRQL and our PromQL-style queries Tip To see how New Relic translates PromQL-style queries to NRQL, write a query in the query builder PromQL-style tab, then switch to the NRQL tab. This table shows the mapping between NRQL and our PromQL-style queries when exploring data. For more contextual information, see the examples. Description Mapping between NRQL and PromQL-style queries Search for attributes: Explore the attributes on the container_memory_usage_bytes metric. PromQL: container_memory_usage_bytes Copy NRQL: FROM Metric SELECT keyset() WHERE metricName = 'container_memory_usage_bytes' Copy Find attribute's value: Explore the current value of the container_memory_usage_bytes metric for unique id attributes. PromQL: sum(container_memory_usage_bytes) by (id) Copy NRQL: FROM Metric SELECT latest(container_memory_usage_bytes) FACET id Copy Visualize the attribute's value: Chart the value of the container_memory_usage_bytes metric with the given id attribute value. PromQL: container_memory_usage_bytes{id=\"/\"} Copy NRQL: FROM Metric SELECT latest(container_memory_usage_bytes) WHERE id = '/' TIMESERIES Copy PromQL-style query example 1. Start your query. When exploring your data for a particular metric in PromQL, such as memory by container usage in bytes, you can start with a query such as: container_memory_usage_bytes Copy This will chart all the unique metric timeseries for the input metric. 2. Filter the query results. Looking at the data, you can add more query parameters to filter down the number of metric timeseries. For example, if you only want timeseries where the id is /, the PromQL-style query will be: container_memory_usage_bytes{id=\"/\"} Copy PromQL-style example: To filter the data, run this PromQL-style query: container_memory_usage_bytes { id=\"/\"}. NRQL query example 1. Query available metrics. To explore your data, start by looking at all the available metrics. Use the following NRQL query: FROM Metric SELECT uniques(metricName) Copy 2. Find unique attributes. Once you have found the metric you want to review, such as container_memory_usage_bytes, you can find the unique attributes with the following query: FROM Metric SELECT keyset() WHERE metricName = 'container_memory_usage_bytes' Copy The results will show each available attribute key and the value type (string, boolean, or number). 3. Aggregate and chart the metrics. To chart metrics using NRQL, you first need an aggregation function. For example, you can use latest for gauges, sum for counts, and average for summaries. As the following chart shows, all the unique timeseries are aggregated into one unique timeseries by default: one.newrelic.com > Query your data: This example shows the data you see after running FROM Metric SELECT keyset() WHERE metricName = 'container_memory_usage_bytes'. 4. View metrics by ID. To view the unique metric timeseries with various id values, run the following query: FROM Metric SELECT latest(container_memory_usage_bytes) FACET id Copy one.newrelic.com > Query your data: This example shows the data you see after running FROM Metric SELECT latest(container_memory_usage_bytes) FACET id. 5. Add the selected ID to the query. Next you can select an id value and put it in the NRQL where clause. FROM Metric SELECT latest(container_memory_usage_bytes) WHERE id = \"/\" timeseries Copy one.newrelic.com > Query your data: This example shows the data displayed after running From Metric select latest(container_memory_usage_bytes) where id = \"/\" timeseries. Filter examples Both our PromQL-style query language and NRQL provide syntax to filter down the number of unique metric timeseries. PromQL-style uses brackets to filter. NRQL uses a WHERE clause. Here are some example queries: Description PromQL-style and NRQL queries Select data with specific values. PromQL: go_memstats_heap_alloc_bytes{job=\"apiserver\", instance=\"1234\"}) Copy NRQL: To only select data with specific values in NRQL, use the WHERE clause with =. In this example, all data must have the selected value for job and handler. FROM Metric SELECT latest(go_memstats_heap_alloc_bytes) WHERE job = 'apiserver' AND instance = '1234' TIMESERIES Copy Select data with multiple values. PromQL: go_memstats_heap_alloc_bytes{environment=~\"staging|testing|development\",method!=\"GET\"} Copy NRQL: In NRQL use the in clause to select multiple values for an attribute and the != sign to select all values but the one listed. In this example, the environment can be staging, testing, or development, and the method cannot be GET. FROM Metric SELECT latest(go_memstats_heap_alloc_bytes) WHERE environment IN ('staging', 'testing', 'development') AND method != 'GET' TIMESERIES Copy Select data using partial string values. PromQL: go_memstats_heap_alloc_bytes{job=~\"api.*\"} Copy NRQL: In NRQL use the LIKE clause to match part of a string value. In this example, all data will be returned where the job attributes start with api. FROM Metric SELECT latest(go_memstats_heap_alloc_bytes) WHEREe job LIKE 'api%' TIMESERIES Copy PromQL-style to NRQL query examples You can simulate the following PromQL-style queries with NRQL queries: Description PromQL-style and NRQL queries Measure the per second rate over the last minute of the http_request_total metric. PromQL: sum(rate(http_requests_total[1m])) Copy NRQL: FROM Metric SELECT rate(sum(http_request_total), 1 second) TIMESERIES 1 minute Copy Chart the difference of the two metrics, then divide by 1024. PromQL: (instance_memory_limit_bytes - instance_memory_usage_bytes) / 1024 Copy NRQL: FROM Metric SELECT (latest(instance_memory_limit_bytes) - latest(instance_memory_usage_bytes)) / 1024 TIMESERIES Copy Provide the summed rate per 30-second interval by each handler. PromQL: sum(rate(http_requests_total[30s])) by (handler) Copy NRQL: FROM Metric SELECT rate(sum(http_requests_total), 30 seconds) FACET handler TIMESERIES Copy Chart the difference in the two metrics where the instance is named foo and the fstype is either ext4 or xfs. PromQL: (node_filesystem_free_bytes{instance='foo',fstype=~\"ext4|xfs\"} / node_filesystem_size_bytes{instance='foo',fstype=~\"ext4|xfs\"}) Copy NRQL: FROM Metric SELECT latest(node_filesystem_free_bytes) / latest(node_filesystem_size_bytes) WHERE instance = 'foo' AND fstype IN ('ext4', 'xfs') Copy",

      "body": "New Relic supports PromQL-style queries, and our query builder offers a PromQL-style query mode that translates PromQL syntax queries into the closest NRQL approximation. Although the method of approximation means that a handful of edge cases are not fully supported, it provides coverage for an overwhelming majority of queries, supporting over 99.5% of queries across the 7.8 million top Grafana dashboard downloads. Read on to learn about how we work with PromQL queries, as well as differences between standard PromQL and our PromQL-like query language we want you to be aware of.

PromQL troubleshooting This section describes differences in behavior between PromQL and our PromQL-style query behavior and how to work with and around these differences. This is particularly relevant if you want to use advanced queries and our PromQL-style mode in the query builder. Metric types Prometheus recommendations note that you should only use some functions, like delta(), on gauges, and only use others like rate() and increase() on counters, but queries in Prometheus still work most of the time even if they don’t follow those instructions. However, because NRDB converts PromQL-style accumulating counters to delta counters, our implementation is unforgiving when using these functions on the wrong data type and will produce different or incorrect answers. For this reason, it's best to follow all Prometheus recommendations when working with our PromQL-style queries, even if you don't follow these recommendations in Prometheus. Limits In order to ensure the stability and performance of our system for all users, we place some limits on what queries can be run. In all cases, we enforce a limit of 366 steps in range queries. We also default to only returning 100 timeseries from queries by default. If you want to see more (or fewer), you need to explicitly add a topk() to your query. (Note that the topk() implementation in our PromQL-style query is different from that of Prometheus.) We limit the total memory a query can use. This means that requests for large numbers of time steps or large numbers of time series may be rejected, particularly if they are combined with an aggregation like unique count or quantile which require significantly more memory to compute than simple arithmetic aggregations. Range vector selectors (sliding windows and smoothing behavior) We provide support for sliding window timeseries aggregations. For more information, see our NRQL syntax, clauses, and functions resource and our sliding windows deep dive. For information on translating between NRQL and our PromQL-style language, see Translate PromQL queries to NRQL. Query range and data scraping intervals The range of your query in PromQL must be larger than the duration of the step size of the query to avoid the error \"TIMESERIES bucket size is larger than the current time window\". We inspect data up to one minute old when servicing instant queries. If your scrape interval is greater than 1 minute, some queries may result in No data found. Avoid this by sending data at least once per minute. If the timeseries unit for your NRQL query is less than the scrape interval for your application, some periods will lack data, and the resulting graph may be jagged or contain peaks and valleys. In general, set the step size to your scrape interval, or higher.",

      "body": "New Relic's default APM agent settings provide a high level of security. However, you may need to guarantee that even if the default APM agent settings are overridden to be more permissive, no sensitive data will ever be sent to New Relic. If this is the case, then you will want to turn on APM's high security mode (also known as enterprise security mode). For more information about our security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Requirements Customers on our New Relic One pricing model require Enterprise edition. Customers on our original pricing model have access depending on their subscription level. Account level If you choose to turn on high security, you must enable high security for all applications reporting to the account. High security must be set on each individual account. For organizations that have a parent/child account structure, child accounts don't automatically inherit the high security setting when enabled on the parent account. Currently there are two versions of high security mode. Version 1 is deprecated and is only available if you already have it. If you are enabling high security mode for the first time, the only option is version 2 (v2). Agent Version 2 support C SDK n/a Go All versions Java 3.7 or higher (enabled by default) .NET 3.3 or higher Node.js 1.7.0 or higher PHP 4.9 or higher Python 2.22.0.0 or higher Ruby 3.9.1 or higher Enable high security mode (version 2) To enable high security, you must update both the local configuration on your server and the remote configuration in the UI. Caution Once you enable high security for an account, high security cannot be turned off without assistance from New Relic Support. Setting location Description Set in UI For users on our original user model: Only the account owner can configure this. Go to one.newrelic.com, click the account dropdown and select Account settings. On that page, select High security mode. For users on the New Relic One user model: Get the account ID for the account you want to enable. Then use that to go to this URL: https://rpm.newrelic.com/accounts/YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID. On that page, you can configure high security mode. If the agent is configured for high security via the UI but not locally, then the agent connections are rejected, and the agent will shut down. However, this won't shut down your application. Local, via agent Enable high security mode in your agent configuration file. High security mode is disabled by default, and the exact procedure to enable it varies by agent: C SDK: n/a Go Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby If the agent is configured for high security locally but not via the UI, then the agent connections will be rejected, and the agent will shut down. This will not shut down your application. Results of enabling high security mode (version 2) Once enabled, high security mode (v2) ensures the following for your account: Feature Comments Requires agents to use a secure connection (HTTPS) High security mode requires a secure (HTTPS) connection. Non-secure connection attempts will be rejected. The latest version of all New Relic agents support HTTPS. If the configuration is not set appropriately, the agent will override the property to ensure all data in transit per the latest industry standards. Prevents HTTP param capture High security mode does not allow HTTP params, which may contain sensitive customer data, to be sent to the New Relic collector. If the agent is configured to send HTTP params locally or through server-side configuration, high security mode will override the configuration to never capture HTTP params. Prevents message queue param capture High security mode does not allow message queue params, which may contain sensitive customer data, to be sent to the New Relic collector. If the agent is configured to send message queue params locally or through server-side configuration, then high security mode will override the configuration to never capture message queue params. Prevents raw query statement capture High security mode does not allow raw database query statements, which may contain sensitive customer data, to be captured. If the agent is configured to capture raw queries locally or through server-side configuration, then high security mode will override the configuration to never capture raw queries. Prevents user attribute capture High security mode does not allow attributes set using each agent's API to be captured, as these may contain sensitive customer data. For example, in the Java agent, attributes passed in through the following NewRelic agent API calls will be blocked: NewRelic.addCustomParameter(String key, String value) Copy NewRelic.addCustomParameter(String key, Number value) Copy NewRelic.setUserName(String name) Copy NewRelic.setAccountName(String name) Copy NewRelic.setProductName(String name) Copy Prevents noticeError attribute capture High security mode does not allow attributes set using each agent's noticeError API call to be captured as these may contain sensitive customer data. For example, in the Java agent, attributes passed in through the following NewRelic agent API calls will be blocked: NewRelic.noticeError(String message, Map<String, String> params) Copy NewRelic.noticeError(Throwable throwable, Map<String, String> params) Copy Prevents custom events High security mode does not allow custom events to be created using the agent API, as these may contain sensitive customer data. For example, in the .NET agent, the API call RecordCustomEvent will be blocked. Prevents deploying Custom Instrumentation via CIE High security mode does not allow deploying custom instrumentation when using the Custom Instrumentation Editor. If you have high security mode enabled, you must export the instrumentation and manually import it to your app server. Results of enabling high security mode v1 (deprecated) High security mode version 1 is deprecated and only available if you enabled it prior to version 2 being available. High security mode version 1 ensures the following for your account: Feature Comments Requires agents to use a secure connection (HTTPS) High security mode requires an encrypted connection (HTTPS). Non-secure connection attempts will be rejected. The latest version of all New Relic agents support HTTPS. If the configuration is not set appropriately, the agent will override the property to ensure that all data in transit is encrypted as per the latest industry standards. Prevents HTTP param capture Agents configured to capture HTTP params, which may contain sensitive customer data, are not allowed to connect to New Relic. If the local configuration is set to capture request parameters, then New Relic's collector will reject the connection, and the agent will shut down. Prevents raw query statement capture Agents configured to capture raw database query statements, which may contain sensitive customer data, are not allowed to connect to New Relic. If the agent is configured to capture raw queries locally or through server-side configuration, New Relic's collector will reject the connection and the agent will shut down. Prevents deploying Custom Instrumentation via CIE High security mode does not allow deploying custom instrumentation when using the Custom Instrumentation Editor. If you have high security mode enabled, you must export the instrumentation and manually import it to your app server. Migrate from version 1 to version 2 These are the main differences between the two versions of high security: In order to make high security even more secure, high security must be enabled in the New Relic user interface and in the local New Relic configuration file. High security v1 only required high security to be set in the New Relic UI. User attributes, noticeError attributes, and message queue parameters are turned off with high security in version 2, but not in version 1. To update from v1 to v2, add high_security: true to your local agent configuration file.",

      "body": "New Relic's custom instrumentation editor allows Java app users to implement custom instrumentation via the New Relic user interface. The editor is the preferred choice when you cannot modify your application code and don't have that many methods to instrument. See Java custom instrumentation for other instrumentation options and the reasons for using each. To use the custom instrumentation editor: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select a Java app) > Settings > Instrumentation. Use the custom instrumentation editor to: Instrument an unsupported framework. Gain additional insight into uninstrumented methods. Ignore particular transactions. Requirements To use the custom instrumentation editor, you must meet the following requirements: Requirement Comments Agent Java agent version 3.17.0 or higher Security Users of high security mode must export their instrumentation and manually import it to their app server. Define custom instrumentation To define custom instrumentation from the New Relic user interface, use a thread profiling session to collect detailed stack traces of each thread in your application. If possible, test your custom instrumentation in a pre-production environment before changing the instrumentation rules in your production app. In either environment, use the custom instrumentation editor to define the methods you want instrumented, and apply your changes: Create a new thread profiler session. To ensure you collect sufficient data, set the length of the session to at least two minutes. Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Settings > Instrumentation. Scroll down to the bottom of the page until you see the Recently collected thread profiles list, then select the most recent thread profile. Expand individual methods to locate uninstrumented methods. To define instrumentation rules for particular nodes, select Instrument or Ignore, and customize the rules if necessary. To save your settings, select Confirm instrumentation changes. Deploy your changes from the Instrumentation page: To deploy your changes automatically, select Deploy instrumentation changes. To deploy your changes manually, select Export XML, and see exporting your instrumentation. Caution Avoid over-instrumenting whenever possible. With each additional method that is instrumented, the agent will be using more resources and your application will incur more overhead. In addition, deploying your instrumentation will cause a brief period of higher overhead. This can noticeably slow application requests for several seconds. If you applied your changes from the UI, the agent will begin instrumenting your methods within a few harvest cycles (typically a few minutes). Manual instrumentation using the editor You can also create instrumentation points directly in the editor without using a thread profile: From the custom instrumentation editor, select Add manual instrumentation to manually enter a class and method to be instrumented or ignored. Follow the custom instrumentation by XML rules when defining your instrumentation points. Deploy your changes from the instrumentation editor. Using this method to add instrumentation exposes additional functionality beyond what is available from a thread profile. In addition to matching methods by signature, you can also instrument methods by return type, methods on interfaces, and by Java annotation. These more complex instrumentation types can be created and deleted in the editor, but not edited. Important If a method is marked Instrumentation not allowed, follow New Relic's troubleshooting procedures for custom instrumentation. Deploy changes manually You can also use the custom instrumentation editor to build a custom instrumentation set, then export an instrumentation file and manually import it to your app server. This is required for users of high security mode. To export your instrumentation, define custom instrumentation via the UI. Then select Export xml from the Instrumentation page, and import the file on your app server. Page functions The Instrumentation page supports the following features: If you want to... Do this... Pause or disable custom instrumentation Select Disable instrumentation to temporarily disable all UI-defined custom instrumentation. Select Enable instrumentation to re-enable your instrumentation settings. Import existing instrumentation You can import an existing custom instrumentation xml file by selecting Import xml. You can also Export xml if you do not want to deploy your changes automatically. Edit or delete instrumentation points You cannot edit manual instrumentation, only delete it. Select Remove to stop instrumenting a particular method. Select Edit to change the instrumentation rules. View instrumentation history You can view each previous iteration of your custom instrumentation from the Instrumentation history tab, including who deployed changes and when. You can restore an old version by selecting export to download a copy of the custom instrumentation file, then importing it to the instrumentation editor. Instrumentation options You can define the following options with the custom instrumentation editor: Instrumentation options Comments Instrument methods Begin instrumenting the selected method. Instrumented methods will be visible in the New Relic UI. Instrument supports the following child options: Name the transaction (transaction name): Override the standard transaction name, defined by the automatic naming rules. The UI will instead use the listed name. Start the transaction when this method executes: Rather than including metrics from this metric inside its parent transaction, create a new transaction for this method. Agent behavior with this option depends on whether there is a pre-existing transaction on the thread. Report custom attributes Method parameters can be captured as attributes on a transaction. New Relic reports these attributes to transaction traces, traced errors, and New Relic One Transaction events. For security reasons, capturing custom attributes using the Custom Instrumentation Editor is disabled by default and cannot be enabled while you are using high security mode. If you want to report custom attributes using the custom instrumentation editor and you do not want the Java agent to be in High security mode, disable High security mode and then add the following text in the common: block of your newrelic.yml: reinstrument: attributes_enabled: true Copy Ignore transactions Ignore this method entirely. The agent will not report metrics from this method, and the method will not contribute to Apdex calculations. Results with \"start\" option If you select Instrument methods > Start the transaction when this method executes, agent behavior depends on whether there is a pre-existing transaction on the thread. When the class or method is instrumented: Is the \"Start the transaction\" flag checked? Yes No If a pre-existing transaction is on that thread and the Start the transaction flag is checked: The agent ignores the Start the transaction flag. The agent includes the class/method into the pre-existing transaction. If a pre-existing transaction is on that thread and the Start the transaction flag is not checked, the agent includes the class/method into the pre-existing transaction. If a transaction is not on that thread and the Start the transaction flag is checked: The agent discovers there is no current transaction. The agent creates a new transaction starting with the class/method you have instrumented. If a transaction is not on that thread and the Start the transaction flag is not checked: The agent looks for a transaction on that thread and does not find one. The metric is dropped.",

      "body": "APM for Java will typically produce useful performance data automatically. However, if New Relic does not support your framework, or if you want to set up additional monitoring, you will want to implement custom instrumentation. Custom instrumentation allows you to track interactions that aren't captured by New Relic's automatic instrumentation, and lets you add detail to your transaction traces, to help you identify key issues. New Relic collects metrics and events from many frameworks automatically. If you are using a supported framework or component, you may see some transaction information out of the box, and custom instrumentation can be used to supplement the information the Agent reports by default. Important If you are using a supported framework, but are not seeing transactions, get support at support.newrelic.com to ensure the framework instrumentation is working. When to choose custom instrumentation Choose custom instrumentation in these situations: New Relic does not support your framework and transactions do not appear in the UI You would like to add detail to your transaction traces Transaction traces include large blocks of application code time without sufficient detail Implement custom instrumentation You can implement custom instrumentation with one of these methods: Method Description The New Relic UI New Relic for Java includes an option in the UI for custom instrumentation called the Custom Instrumentation Editor. This option doesn't require any direct modification of your application code, so is a good choice if you don't want to or can't modify your code. The editor is, however, fairly limited in functionality compared to the Java agent API. API annotation Using the New Relic Java agent API, you can annotate the methods in your application code that you want to monitor. The annotation method is robust and easy to troubleshoot. If you are willing to modify your source code, annotation is the recommended method. If you have many methods you want to instrument, you might prefer XML instrumentation. For more about the API and its other functions, see Intro to the Java agent API. XML If you can't modify your code, or if you need to instrument many methods, XML instrumentation is the best custom instrumentation method. With this method, you specify the classes you want to instrument in an external XML file. While XML instrumentation is powerful, it is also more difficult to use than the other instrumentation methods. For simpler instrumentation needs, New Relic recommends annotation or instrumentation via the UI. For more information, see Java instrumentation by XML. You can also monitor Java Management Extensions (JMX) via custom instrumentation. JMX is a way to monitor and manage applications, devices, and services. You can implement JMX monitoring via an external YAML file.",

      "body": "When we say auto-telemetry, we’re not talking about cars — we're talking about instant baseline visibility into your Kubernetes clusters. With the New Relic One integration with Pixie, you get similar data to traditional language agents, but without manually instrumenting your code or redeploying your application. Pixie auto-telemetry is powered by eBPF, a virtual machine-like construct that enables Pixie to seamlessly collect fine-grained telemetry data — service-level metrics, unsampled requests, and more. With one install command, you get deeper insight into your Kubernetes clusters and workloads. No language agents required. Live debugging with Pixie shows a service graph listing the namespaces and the node that are available on the current cluster. Simply put, Auto-telemetry with Pixie offers the quickest option for getting observability into your Kubernetes services. Ready to get started? You'll be able to configure Pixie to suit your environnment after you create a New Relic account (it's free, forever!) and install our Pixie integration. Quickly start observing and debugging Kubernetes clusters Our Pixie integration gives you the best of both worlds: Pixie’s fast and simple Kubernetes observability coupled with New Relic One’s incident correlation, intelligent alerting, and long-term retention. You’ll get visibility into HTTP services using golden signals, HTTP transactions, database transactions, distributed tracing, and JVM metrics. You can operate, debug, and scale your Kubernetes clusters based on the information you learn about how your clusters and services are running. Using the New Relic Explorer, you can see key metrics and events at every level, starting with the cluster, and diving down into namespaces, deployments, and pods. You can quickly spot anomalous behavior, and where it’s happening. And then dive deeper using embedded visualizations of your Pixie data. Quickly identify hot spots with a flame graph display. On the Live debugging with Pixie tab, answer questions like what SQL requests your app is making or which services are talking to each other. Important Auto-Telemetry with Pixie leverages Community Cloud with Pixie, a separate platform from New Relic One. Use of Community Cloud with Pixie is subject to separate terms of service. Explore your cluster Access the Pixie UI via New Relic's Live debugging with Pixie area of your Kubernetes clusters. The cluster explorer provides a quick overview of the nodes in your cluster, including CPU, memory, and storage, as well as the status of each pod (healthy, warning, or critical). You can also find out what services are running in each container, their latency, throughput, and error rate. For more information about using the cluster explorer, see Navigate the Kubernetes cluster explorer. Note that you cannot log directly into the Pixie UI unless you have created a separate Pixie login. Tip Containers might be listed for up to four hours after they get decommissioned. You can query the Pixie data in New Relic One and create dashboards for at-a-glance monitoring. Find the data model and sample queries here. Investigate usage spikes using the flame graph Debugging is orders of magnitude easier when you can quickly see what your application is doing. The Pixie flame graph display requires no instrumentation, redeploying, or recompiling. It works for compiled languages like Go, C+, Rust, to name a few. And at a glance, the flame graph tells you what functions your application is spending time on and where you have hot spots. Flame graphs are especially useful for hierarchical resource use, like disk usage and CPU utilization. For more information on how to read a flame graph, see the Pixie flame graph docs. Debug live On the Live debugging with Pixie tab, run PxL scripts — scripts written in Pixie's PxL language — to view live data captured through eBPF. Select the script drop-down and then select a script to run in the tab. (For best results, select a time range that is recent in the time picker.) Scripts enable you to debug: Traffic in multiple formats: HTTP and HTTPs (including encrypted), DNS, Postgres, MySQL, Cassandra, Redis (currently supporting SQL and HTTP in beta).

The guided installation deploys Pixie with New Relic's Kubernetes integration on your cluster. You don't need to do any further configuration or installation to start using Pixie. If you want to install Auto-telemetry with Pixie on multiple clusters, re-run the guided install for each additional cluster. General prerequisites for using Pixie Ready to get started? If you don't already have one, sign up for a New Relic account. It's free, forever! You must be a New Relic full platform user. Other user-related requirements: Users on our New Relic One user model must be assigned to a group that has a role with Pixie-related capabilities. Users on our original user model cannot be Restricted. In addition: Review this Pixie data security overview for actions to take to secure your data. Make sure you have sufficient memory: Pixie requires, at least, 2Gb of memory on each node in your cluster. More memory may be required for larger clusters. Review the other Pixie technical requirements. Setup steps depend on your account status Use the following table to find out where to start installing Auto-telemetry with Pixie. Where you start the installation depends on whether you already have a New Relic or Pixie account, or both. New Relic Pixie Next steps Start the guided install at the beginning of the process. If you already have both types of accounts, and used the same email address for each of them, click the New Relic icon in the Pixie UI. This brings you to the Configure the HELM command/manifest (yaml) file section of the guided installation. Then, follow the steps. If you're using different email addresses in Pixie and New Relic, create a new account for either Pixie or New Relic to match email addresses across both products. You can also contact New Relic support to manually link your existing New Relic account with your Pixie account. If you follow a link to New Relic from the Pixie UI and do not have a New Relic account, you must first create one. Click the New Relic icon in the Pixie UI, and follow the steps to create a New Relic account. When you do so, your Pixie account is linked to it. Then, continue the guided install process with these steps. Sign up for a free New Relic account. Then, start the guided install at the beginning of the process. Install from the beginning of the guided install process Open our New Relic One guided install. Select the account you want to use for the guided install, and click Continue. Note: if you have a single account, you won't see this option. Select Kubernetes and then continue with step one in the next section. Install from the Configure the HELM command/manifest (yaml) file If you arrived in the guided installation process by following a link from Pixie or from within New Relic, your steps begin here. Select the account and cluster for the install. If needed, select a namespace. Important Currently, Pixie performs best on clusters with up to 100 nodes (exceeding 100 nodes can lead to excessive memory usage and scripts failing to run). Friendly reminder: autoscaling can quickly drive up your node numbers. Click Continue. Select the data you want to gather, observe, and debug, and click Continue. On the Choose install method page, select either Helm or manifest. Helm method Run the provided Helm command on your command line. If you're concerned about the amount of Pixie data you'll ingest, check out strategies for reducing ingest. Helm installs a bundle containing the New Relic infrastructure agent, an integration to gather Prometheus metrics and Kubernetes events, and the Pixie integration. The deployment takes a few minutes to complete. To see the status of the install to the cluster, run kubectl get pods -n newrelic. For general information about installing a Kubernetes integration, see this Helm install info. manifest method Run the provided command in your console, and insert the path to your downloaded manifest. If you're running your Kubernetes cluster in the cloud, see the additional steps in the Kubernetes docs. Click Continue to open the Listening for data page. When you get the message, See your data, click Kubernetes Cluster Explorer to see your cluster. Auto-telemetry with Pixie might restart after installation. This is caused by the auto update feature. If you link the wrong Pixie and New Relic account Contact support to unlink a Pixie account from your New Relic account. Be aware that if you unlink a Pixie account that was created automatically through the guided install, you'll lose access to that Pixie account.",

Auto-telemetry with Pixie therefore benefits from Pixie's approach to keeping data secure. The data that Pixie collects is stored entirely within your Kubernetes cluster. This data does not persist outside of your environment, and will never be stored by Community Cloud for Pixie. This means that your sensitive data remains within your environment and control. Community Cloud for Pixie makes queries directly to your Kubernetes cluster to access the data. In order for the query results to be shown in the Community Cloud for Pixie UI, CLI, and API, the data is sent to the client from your cluster using a reverse proxy. Community Cloud for Pixie’s reverse proxy is designed to ensure: Data is ephemeral. It only passes through the Community Cloud for Pixie's cloud proxy in transit. This ensures data locality. Data is encrypted while in transit. Only you are able to read your data. New Relic One fetches and stores data that related to an application's performance. With Auto-telemetry with Pixie, a predefined subset of data persists outside of your cluster. This data is stored in our database, in your selected region.

      "body": "When we say auto-telemetry, we’re not talking about cars — we're talking about instant baseline visibility into your Kubernetes clusters. With the New Relic One integration with Pixie, you get similar data to traditional language agents, but without manually instrumenting your code or redeploying your application. Pixie auto-telemetry is powered by eBPF, a virtual machine-like construct that enables Pixie to seamlessly collect fine-grained telemetry data — service-level metrics, unsampled requests, and more. With one install command, you get deeper insight into your Kubernetes clusters and workloads. No language agents required. Live debugging with Pixie shows a service graph listing the namespaces and the node that are available on the current cluster. Simply put, Auto-telemetry with Pixie offers the quickest option for getting observability into your Kubernetes services. Ready to get started? You'll be able to configure Pixie to suit your environnment after you create a New Relic account (it's free, forever!) and install our Pixie integration. Quickly start observing and debugging Kubernetes clusters Our Pixie integration gives you the best of both worlds: Pixie’s fast and simple Kubernetes observability coupled with New Relic One’s incident correlation, intelligent alerting, and long-term retention. You’ll get visibility into HTTP services using golden signals, HTTP transactions, database transactions, distributed tracing, and JVM metrics. You can operate, debug, and scale your Kubernetes clusters based on the information you learn about how your clusters and services are running. Using the New Relic Explorer, you can see key metrics and events at every level, starting with the cluster, and diving down into namespaces, deployments, and pods. You can quickly spot anomalous behavior, and where it’s happening. And then dive deeper using embedded visualizations of your Pixie data. Quickly identify hot spots with a flame graph display. On the Live debugging with Pixie tab, answer questions like what SQL requests your app is making or which services are talking to each other. Important Auto-Telemetry with Pixie leverages Community Cloud with Pixie, a separate platform from New Relic One. Use of Community Cloud with Pixie is subject to separate terms of service. Explore your cluster Access the Pixie UI via New Relic's Live debugging with Pixie area of your Kubernetes clusters. The cluster explorer provides a quick overview of the nodes in your cluster, including CPU, memory, and storage, as well as the status of each pod (healthy, warning, or critical). You can also find out what services are running in each container, their latency, throughput, and error rate. For more information about using the cluster explorer, see Navigate the Kubernetes cluster explorer. Note that you cannot log directly into the Pixie UI unless you have created a separate Pixie login. Tip Containers might be listed for up to four hours after they get decommissioned. You can query the Pixie data in New Relic One and create dashboards for at-a-glance monitoring. Find the data model and sample queries here. Investigate usage spikes using the flame graph Debugging is orders of magnitude easier when you can quickly see what your application is doing. The Pixie flame graph display requires no instrumentation, redeploying, or recompiling. It works for compiled languages like Go, C+, Rust, to name a few. And at a glance, the flame graph tells you what functions your application is spending time on and where you have hot spots. Flame graphs are especially useful for hierarchical resource use, like disk usage and CPU utilization. For more information on how to read a flame graph, see the Pixie flame graph docs. Debug live On the Live debugging with Pixie tab, run PxL scripts — scripts written in Pixie's PxL language — to view live data captured through eBPF. Select the script drop-down and then select a script to run in the tab. (For best results, select a time range that is recent in the time picker.) Scripts enable you to debug: Traffic in multiple formats: HTTP and HTTPs (including encrypted), DNS, Postgres, MySQL, Cassandra, Redis (currently supporting SQL and HTTP in beta).

Auto-telemetry with Pixie therefore benefits from Pixie's approach to keeping data secure. The data that Pixie collects is stored entirely within your Kubernetes cluster. This data does not persist outside of your environment, and will never be stored by Community Cloud for Pixie. This means that your sensitive data remains within your environment and control. Community Cloud for Pixie makes queries directly to your Kubernetes cluster to access the data. In order for the query results to be shown in the Community Cloud for Pixie UI, CLI, and API, the data is sent to the client from your cluster using a reverse proxy. Community Cloud for Pixie’s reverse proxy is designed to ensure: Data is ephemeral. It only passes through the Community Cloud for Pixie's cloud proxy in transit. This ensures data locality. Data is encrypted while in transit. Only you are able to read your data. New Relic One fetches and stores data that related to an application's performance. With Auto-telemetry with Pixie, a predefined subset of data persists outside of your cluster. This data is stored in our database, in your selected region. This data persists in order to give you long-term storage, alerting, correlation with additional data, and the ability to use advanced New Relic platform capabilities, such as anomaly detection. The persisted performance metrics include, but are not limited to: Golden metrics (throughput, latency, error rate) for HTTP-based services HTTP transaction data Database transaction data (for MySQL & PostgreSQL) Distributed tracing JVM metrics The data you view on the Live debugging tab comes through Community Cloud for Pixie, and is therefore potentially sensitive. It is not stored by New Relic and is ephemeral and queryable for less than 24 hours. Control who has access to Pixie data If you want to manage which members of your organization can view Pixie data in New Relic One, as well as install and delete Pixie links, you can create a custom role. Note that this option is available only to Enterprise and Pro level customers. For more information, see New Relic's user model. Manage auto-update and two-way communication Pixie maintains an active two-way communication channel from your host system to Community Cloud with Pixie at withpixie.ai. Pixie uses this communication channel to query data, push updates, and retrieve metadata and health checks about Pixie and your Kubernetes cluster. By default, Pixie queries withpixie.ai to check if new updates have been pushed and then automatically installs them if they’re present. To disable auto updates, you must set a flag prior to the install process using either Helm or in the newrelic-manifest.yaml file. To disable automatic updates, choose one: Helm option Add --set pixie-chart.disableAutoUpdate=true to your Helm command. newrelic-manifest.yaml option in your newrelic-manifest.yaml file under the pl-cluster-config section, add PL_DISABLE_AUTO_UPDATE: \"true\" to the data directive.

      "body": "Helm is a package manager on top of Kubernetes. It facilitates installation, upgrades, or revision tracking, and it manages dependencies for the services that you install in Kubernetes. To install the integration using Helm, we recommend our Kubernetes automated installer, which will prompt for almost all configuration options and autopopulate secrets and values for you. Additionally, our automated installer also allows to install our integration as plain manifests rather than a Helm release. See Kubernetes integration: install and configure for more details about how to use our automated installer. Start the installer This page describes in more depth how to install and configure the New Relic integration without using the automated installer. Compatibility and requirements Make sure Helm is installed on your machine. We strongly recommend using Helm 3 to manage the Kubernetes integration. Our charts are also compatible with Helm 2, but support for it might be removed in the future. To install the Kubernetes integration using Helm, you will need your New Relic account license key and your Kubernetes cluster's name: Find and copy your New Relic license key. Find the name of your cluster with this command: kubectl config current-context Copy Note this values somewhere safe as you will need them later during the installation process. Install Kubernetes integration with Helm Install with Helm 3 and nri-bundle (recommended) New Relic has several charts for the different components which offer different features for the platform: newrelic-infrastructure: Contains the main Kubernetes integration and the infrastructure agent. This is the core component for the New Relic Kubernetes experience, responsible of reporting most of the data that is surfaced in dashboard and the Kubernetes Cluster Explorer. newrelic-logging: Provides a DaemonSet with New Relic's Fluent Bit output plugin to easily forward your logs to New Relic. nri-kube-events: Collects and reports cluster events (such as kubectl get events) to New Relic. nri-prometheus: New Relic's Prometheus OpenMetrics Integration, automatically scrapes Prometheus endpoints present in the cluser and reports metrics to New Relic. nri-metadata-injection: Sets up a minimal MutatingAdmissionWebhook that injects a couple of environment to containers. These contain metadata about the cluster and New Relic installation and will be later picked up by applications instrumented using APM, allowing to correlate APM and infrastructure data. nri-statsd: New Relic StatsD integration. Additionally, New Relic provides nri-bundle, a chart which pulls a selectable set of the charts mentioned above. nri-bundle can also install Kube State Metrics and Pixie for you if needed. While it is possible to install those charts separately, we strongly recommend using the nri-bundle chart for Kubernetes deployments, as it ensures that values across all the charts are consistent and provides full control over which components are installed, as well as the possibility to configure all of them as Helm dependencies. This is the same chart that is used and referenced by our automated installer. Installing and configuring nri-bundle with Helm Ensure you are using the appropriate context in the machine where you will run Helm and kubectl: You can check the available contexts with: kubectl config get-contexts Copy And switch to the desired context using: kubectl config use-context CONTEXT_NAME Copy Add the New Relic Helm charts repo: helm repo add newrelic https://helm-charts.newrelic.com Copy Make sure everything is configured properly in the chart by running the following command. Notice that we are specifying --dry-run and --debug, so nothing will be installed in this step: helm upgrade --install newrelic newrelic/nri-bundle \\ --dry-run \\ --debug \\ --namespace newrelic --create-namespace \\ --set global.licenseKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY \\ --set global.cluster=K8S_CLUSTER_NAME \\ --set ksm.enabled= true \\ --set newrelic-infrastructure.privileged= true \\ --set infrastructure.enabled=true \\ --set prometheus.enabled=true \\ --set webhook.enabled=true \\ --set kubeEvents.enabled=true \\ --set logging.enabled=true Copy Please notice and adjust the following flags: global.licenseKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY: Must be set to a valid License Key for your account. global.cluster=K8S_CLUSTER_NAME: Is used to identify the cluster in the New Relic UI, so should be a descriptive value not used by any other Kubernetes cluster configured in your New Relic account. ksm.enabled=true: Setting this to true will automatically install Kube State Metrics (KSM) for you, which is required for our integration to run. You can set this to false if KSM is already present in your cluster, even if it is on a different namespace. newrelic-infrastructure.privileged=true: Can be set to false to install a trimmed down version of our integration that does not require extra privileges, such as hostPath mounts or running containers as root. Please note that this will disable detailed process collection from the host. For performance reasons, our logging solution still requires hostPath mounts, regardless of the value of this flag. If this is not allowedin your cluster, you will need to disable the logging solution by specifying logging.enabled=false. prometheus.enabled=true: Will deploy our Prometheus OpenMetrics integration, which automatically collects data from prometheus endpoints present in the cluster. webhook.enabled=true: Will install our minimal webhook, which adds environment variables that, in turn, allows linking applications instrumented with APM with infrastructure data. Our chart has a comprehensive set of flags and tunables that can be edited to configure our solution to your particular needs. For a full list of all the flags that can be configured, please check the chart's README and the default values.yaml file. Install the Kubernetes integration by running the customized command without --debug and --dry-run: helm upgrade --install newrelic newrelic/nri-bundle \\ --namespace newrelic --create-namespace \\ --set global.licenseKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY \\ --set global.cluster=K8S_CLUSTER_NAME \\ --set ksm.enabled= true \\ --set newrelic-infrastructure.privileged= true \\ --set infrastructure.enabled=true \\ --set prometheus.enabled=true \\ --set webhook.enabled=true \\ --set kubeEvents.enabled=true \\ --set logging.enabled=true Copy Wait a few seconds, then check that the DaemonSet and pods have been created: kubectl -n newrelic get daemonsets,pods Copy Make sure you see a DaemonSet, and one pod per node for newrelic-infrastructure, as well as one Deployment and one pod for any other component that you have enabled. Install with Helm 2 and nri-bundle (legacy) Installation instructions for Helm 2 Important Helm 2 has been deprecated and New Relic does not recommend using it for deployments. Instructions in this section are provided for legacy systems only. To install using Helm 2: Ensure that Helm 2, including their cluster-side components (such as Tiller) are properly installed and configured. Please check the official documentation for more details. Set the cluster where you want to install the agent: kubectl config set-cluster DESIRED_CLUSTER Copy To see the available clusters, run kubectl config get-clusters Make sure that kube-state-metrics is installed on your machine: kubectl get deployment --all-namespaces | grep kube-state-metrics Copy If it's not installed, follow the instructions in the kube-state-metrics GitHub repo to install it. Add the New Relic Helm charts repo: helm repo add newrelic https://helm-charts.newrelic.com Copy Make sure everything is configured properly in the chart by running the following command. This step uses the --dry-run and --debug switches and therefore the agent is not installed. helm install newrelic/newrelic-infrastructure \\ --dry-run \\ --debug \\ --set licenseKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY \\ --set cluster=K8S_CLUSTER_NAME \\ --set config.custom_attributes.cluster=K8S_CLUSTER_NAME Copy Install the New Relic Kubernetes integration: helm install newrelic/newrelic-infrastructure \\ --set licenseKey=your_new_relic_license_key \\ --set cluster=K8S_CLUSTER_NAME \\ --set config.custom_attributes.cluster=K8S_CLUSTER_NAME Copy Tip Note that the --dry-run and --debug switches have been removed. Wait a few seconds, then check that the DaemonSet and pods have been created: kubectl get daemonsets,pods Copy Make sure you see a DaemonSet, and one pod per node. Helm configuration options When you install or upgrade the Kubernetes integration with Helm using the command line, you can pass your configuration variables with the --set flag. helm install newrelic/newrelic-infrastructure \\ --set licenseKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY \\ --set cluster=YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME Copy A full list of the configuration parameters can be found in the newrelic-infrastructure chart README Upgrade using Helm To update your Kubernetes integration installed via Helm: Update the local chart repository: helm repo update Copy Update the release by running again the appropriate helm upgrade --install ... command in the section above. Monitor services running on Kubernetes After having installed our Kubernetes integration, you can start instrumenting the services than run in your cluster. To learn more about how to do this, please check our Monitor services running on Kubernetes page. Use your Kubernetes data To learn more about how to use your Kubernetes data, please head to our detailed Find and use your Kubernetes data pages. Reduce data ingest Our charts support setting an option to reduce the amount of data ingest at the cost of dropping detailed information. To enable it, set global.lowDataMode=true in the nri-bundle chart. lowDataMode affects three specific components of the nri-bundle chart outlined below. Prometheus OpenMetrics Integration If lowDataMode is enabled, the following metrics are excluded by default as they are already collected and used by the New Relic Kubernetes Integration. - kube_ - container_ - machine_ - cadvisor_ Copy New Relic Logging If lowDataMode is enabled, Labels and Annotations are set to Off in the Filter section of the fluent-bit.conf file.

      "body": "When we say auto-telemetry, we’re not talking about cars — we're talking about instant baseline visibility into your Kubernetes clusters. With the New Relic One integration with Pixie, you get similar data to traditional language agents, but without manually instrumenting your code or redeploying your application. Pixie auto-telemetry is powered by eBPF, a virtual machine-like construct that enables Pixie to seamlessly collect fine-grained telemetry data — service-level metrics, unsampled requests, and more. With one install command, you get deeper insight into your Kubernetes clusters and workloads. No language agents required. Live debugging with Pixie shows a service graph listing the namespaces and the node that are available on the current cluster. Simply put, Auto-telemetry with Pixie offers the quickest option for getting observability into your Kubernetes services. Ready to get started? You'll be able to configure Pixie to suit your environnment after you create a New Relic account (it's free, forever!) and install our Pixie integration. Quickly start observing and debugging Kubernetes clusters Our Pixie integration gives you the best of both worlds: Pixie’s fast and simple Kubernetes observability coupled with New Relic One’s incident correlation, intelligent alerting, and long-term retention. You’ll get visibility into HTTP services using golden signals, HTTP transactions, database transactions, distributed tracing, and JVM metrics. You can operate, debug, and scale your Kubernetes clusters based on the information you learn about how your clusters and services are running. Using the New Relic Explorer, you can see key metrics and events at every level, starting with the cluster, and diving down into namespaces, deployments, and pods. You can quickly spot anomalous behavior, and where it’s happening. And then dive deeper using embedded visualizations of your Pixie data. Quickly identify hot spots with a flame graph display. On the Live debugging with Pixie tab, answer questions like what SQL requests your app is making or which services are talking to each other. Important Auto-Telemetry with Pixie leverages Community Cloud with Pixie, a separate platform from New Relic One. Use of Community Cloud with Pixie is subject to separate terms of service. Explore your cluster Access the Pixie UI via New Relic's Live debugging with Pixie area of your Kubernetes clusters. The cluster explorer provides a quick overview of the nodes in your cluster, including CPU, memory, and storage, as well as the status of each pod (healthy, warning, or critical). You can also find out what services are running in each container, their latency, throughput, and error rate. For more information about using the cluster explorer, see Navigate the Kubernetes cluster explorer. Note that you cannot log directly into the Pixie UI unless you have created a separate Pixie login. Tip Containers might be listed for up to four hours after they get decommissioned. You can query the Pixie data in New Relic One and create dashboards for at-a-glance monitoring. Find the data model and sample queries here. Investigate usage spikes using the flame graph Debugging is orders of magnitude easier when you can quickly see what your application is doing. The Pixie flame graph display requires no instrumentation, redeploying, or recompiling. It works for compiled languages like Go, C+, Rust, to name a few. And at a glance, the flame graph tells you what functions your application is spending time on and where you have hot spots. Flame graphs are especially useful for hierarchical resource use, like disk usage and CPU utilization. For more information on how to read a flame graph, see the Pixie flame graph docs. Debug live On the Live debugging with Pixie tab, run PxL scripts — scripts written in Pixie's PxL language — to view live data captured through eBPF. Select the script drop-down and then select a script to run in the tab. (For best results, select a time range that is recent in the time picker.)

      "body": "New Relic provides Control Plane support for your Kubernetes integration, allowing you to monitor and collect metrics from your cluster's Control Plane components. That data can then be found in New Relic and used to create queries and charts. Features We monitor and collect metrics from the following control plane components: ETCD: leader information, resident memory size, number of OS threads, consensus proposals data, etc. For a list of supported metrics, see ETCD data. API server: rate of apiserver requests, breakdown of apiserver requests by HTTP method and response code, etc. For the complete list of supported metrics, see API server data. Scheduler: requested CPU/memory vs available on the node, tolerations to taints, any set affinity or anti-affinity, etc. For the complete list of supported metrics, see Scheduler data. Controller manager: resident memory size, number of OS threads created, goroutines currently existing, etc. For the complete list of supported metrics, see Controller manager data. Compatibility and requirements Control plane monitoring requires Kubernetes integration version 1.16.0 or higher. Control plane monitoring support is not enabled for managed clusters. This is because providers (EKS, GKE, AKS, etc.) abstract away the concept of master nodes and control plane components, so that access to them is limited or non-existent. External control planes are not supported. The unprivileged version of the Kubernetes integration does not support control plane monitoring. OpenShift 4.x uses control plane component metric endpoints that are different than the default. Discovery of master nodes and control plane components The Kubernetes integration relies on the kubeadm labeling conventions to discover the master nodes and the control plane components. This means that master nodes should be labeled with node-role.kubernetes.io/master=\"\" or kubernetes.io/role=\"master\". The control plane components should have either the k8s-app or the tier and component labels. Refer to the following table for accepted label combinations and values: Component Label Endpoint API server Kubeadm / Kops / ClusterAPI k8s-app=kube-apiserver tier=control-plane component=kube-apiserver OpenShift app=openshift-kube-apiserver apiserver=true localhost:443/metrics by default (can be configured) if the request fails falls back to localhost:8080/metrics ETCD Kubeadm / Kops / ClusterAPI k8s-app=etcd-manager-main tier=control-plane component=etcd OpenShift k8s-app=etcd localhost:4001/metrics Scheduler Kubeadm / Kops / ClusterAPI k8s-app=kube-scheduler tier=control-plane component=kube-scheduler OpenShift app=openshift-kube-scheduler scheduler=true localhost:10251/metrics Controller manager Kubeadm / Kops / ClusterAPI k8s-app=kube-controller-manager tier=control-plane component=kube-controller-manager​ OpenShift app=kube-controller-manager kube-controller-manager=true localhost:10252/metrics When the integration detects that it is running inside a master node, it tries to find which components are running on the node by looking for pods that match the labels listed in the table above. For every running component, the integration makes a request to its metrics endpoint. Configuration Control plane monitoring is automatic for agents running inside master nodes. The only component that requires an extra step to run is ETCD, because it uses mutual TLS authentication (mTLS) for client requests. The API Server can also be configured to be queried using the Secure Port. Important Control plane monitoring for OpenShift 4.x requires additional configuration. For more information, see the OpenShift 4.x Configuration section. ETCD In order to set mTLS for querying ETCD, there are two configuration options that need to be set: Option Value ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAME Name of a Kubernetes secret that contains the mTLS configuration. The secret should contain the following keys: cert: the certificate that identifies the client making the request. It should be signed by an ETCD trusted CA. key: the private key used to generate the client certificate. cacert: the root CA used to identify the ETCD server certificate. If the ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAME option is not set, ETCD metrics won't be fetched. For step by step instructions on how to create a certificate and sign it with the ETCD client CA, see Set up mTLS from the ETCD client CA. ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAMESPACE The namespace where the secret specified in the ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAME was created. If not set, the default namespace is used. API server By default, the API server metrics are queried using the localhost:8080 unsecured endpoint. If this port is disabled, you can also query these metrics over the secure port. To enable this, set the following configuration option in the Kubernetes integration manifest file: Option Value API_SERVER_ENDPOINT_URL The (secure) URL to query the metrics. The API server uses localhost:443 by default Ensure that the ClusterRole has been updated to the newest version found in the manifest Added in version 1.15.0 Important Note that the port can be different according to the secure port used by the API server. For example, in Minikube the API server secure port is 8443 and therefore API_SERVER_ENDPOINT_URL should be set to https://localhost:8443 OpenShift configuration Control plane components on OpenShift 4.x use endpoint URLs that require SSL and service account based authentication. Therefore, the default endpoint URLs can not be used. To configure control plane monitoring on OpenShift, uncomment the following environment variables in the customized manifest. URL values are pre-configured to the default base URLs for the control plane monitoring metrics endpoints in OpenShift 4.x. - name: \"SCHEDULER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10259 - name: \"ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:9979\" - name: \"CONTROLLER_MANAGER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10257\" - name: \"API_SERVER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:6443\" Copy Important Even though the custom ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL is defined, ETCD requires HTTPS and mTLS authentication to be configured. For more on configuring mTLS for ETCD in OpenShift, see Set up mTLS for ETCD in OpenShift. Important When installing through Helm openshift, specify the config to automatically include these endpoints. Setting openshift.enabled=true and openshift.version=\"4.x\" will include the secure endpoints and enable the /var/run/crio.sock runtime. Set up mTLS from the ETCD client CA The instructions below are based on the Kubernetes documentation. For more information, see Managing TLS certificates in a cluster. For OpenShift, see Set up mTLS for ETCD in OpenShift. To set up mTLS from the ETCD client CA: Download and install the tool cfssl, selecting the correct binaries for your OS from the list. Once installed, execute the following command: cat <<EOF | cfssl genkey - | cfssljson -bare server { \"hosts\": [ \"localhost\" ], \"CN\": \"newrelic-infra.pod.cluster.local\", \"key\": { \"algo\": \"ecdsa\", \"size\": 256 } } EOF Copy This command generates two files; server.csr containing the PEM encoded pkcs#10 certification request and server-key.pem containing the PEM encoded key to the certificate to be created. Use the generated certificate authority (CA) of ETCD to sign your CSR. Depending on your cluster configuration, you may already have this information. For default install configuration, download the CA certificate and the private key directly from ETCD with the following commands: kubectl cp $(kubectl get pods -l k8s-app=etcd-manager-main -n kube-system -o jsonpath=\"{.items[0].metadata.name}\"):/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd-manager/etcd-clients-ca.crt ./cacert -n kube-system kubectl cp $(kubectl get pods -l k8s-app=etcd-manager-main -n kube-system -o jsonpath=\"{.items[0].metadata.name}\"):/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd-manager/etcd-clients-ca.key ./cacert.key -n kube-system Copy Tip This requires that the etcd-manager-main pod has the label k8s-app=etcd-manager-main, which is a requirement for control plane monitoring . If your etc-manager-main pod is located in a different namespace, change the -n kube-system flags accordingly. With those files downloaded, use the following command to sign your CSRF: cfssl sign -ca cacert -ca-key cacert.key server.csr | cfssljson -bare cert Copy Create the secret that is used to retrieve the TLS config for making requests to ETC. We recommend renaming the certificate and the private key: cp cert.pem cert && cp server-key.pem key Copy kubectl -n default create secret generic newrelic-infra-etcd-tls-secret --from-file=./cert --from-file=./key --from-file=./cacert Copy To ease future installations Use the following commands to simultaneously create the CSR, retrieve the CA, generate the certificate by signing the CSR, and create the secret with all the required fields: cat <<EOF | cfssl genkey - | cfssljson -bare server && \\ kubectl cp $(kubectl get pods -l k8s-app=etcd-manager-main -n kube-system -o jsonpath=\"{.items[0].metadata.name}\"):/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd-manager/etcd-clients-ca.crt ./cacert -n kube-system && \\ kubectl cp $(kubectl get pods -l k8s-app=etcd-manager-main -n kube-system -o jsonpath=\"{.items[0].metadata.name}\"):/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd-manager/etcd-clients-ca.key ./cacert.key -n kube-system && \\ cp server-key.pem key && \\ cfssl sign -ca cacert -ca-key cacert.key server.csr | cfssljson -bare cert && \\ cp cert.pem cert && \\ kubectl -n default create secret generic newrelic-infra-etcd-tls-secret --from-file=./cert --from-file=./key --from-file=./cacert { \"hosts\": [ \"localhost\" ], \"CN\": \"newrelic-infra.pod.cluster.local\", \"key\": { \"algo\": \"ecdsa\", \"size\": 256 } } EOF Copy The last step is to update the configuration in the manifest and apply it. In the configuration section, there are two options related to ETCD mTLS: ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAME with the name of the secret that we just created. ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAMESPACE with the namespace that we used to create the secret. To complete the installation, add these variables to the container spec of the integration DaemonSet and apply the changes: - name: \"ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAME” value: \"newrelic-infra-etcd-tls-secret\" - name: \"ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAMESPACE\" value: \"default\" Copy Set up mTLS for ETCD in OpenShift Follow these instructions to set up mutual TLS authentication for ETCD in OpenShift 4.x: Export the ETCD client certificates from the cluster to an opaque secret. In a default managed OpenShift cluster, the secret is named kube-etcd-client-certs and it is stored in the openshift-monitoring namespace. kubectl get secret/kube-etcd-client-certs -n openshift-monitoring -o yaml > etcd-secret.yaml Copy Open the secret file and change the keys: Rename the certificate authority to cacert. Rename the client certificate to cert. Rename the client key to key. Optional: change the secret name and namespace to something meaningful. Remove these unnecessary keys in the metadata section: creationTimestamp resourceVersion selfLink uid Install the manifest with its new name and namespace: kubectl apply -f etcd-secret.yaml Copy Go to Update manifest configuration (the last step under Set up MTL from ETCD client) to configure the required environment variables. See your data If the integration has been been set up correctly, the Kubernetes cluster explorer contains all the Control Plane components and their status in a dedicated section, as shown below. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes Cluster Explorer: Use the Kubernetes cluster explorer to monitor and collect metrics from your cluster's Control Plane components You can also check for Control Plane data with this NRQL query: SELECT latest(timestamp) FROM K8sApiServerSample, K8sEtcdSample, K8sSchedulerSample, K8sControllerManagerSample FACET entityName where clusterName = 'MY_CLUSTER_NAME' Copy Tip If you still can't see Control Plane data, try the solution described in Kubernetes integration troubleshooting: Not seeing data.",

      "body": "New Relic's Kubernetes integration gives you full observability into the health and performance of your environment, no matter whether you run Kubernetes on-premises or in the cloud. With our cluster explorer, you can cut through layers of complexity to see how your cluster is performing, from the heights of the control plane down to applications running on a single pod. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer: The cluster explorer is our powerful, fully visual answer to the challenges associated with running Kubernetes at a large scale. You can see the power of the Kubernetes integration in the cluster explorer, where the full picture of a cluster is made available on a single screen: nodes and pods are visualized according to their health and performance, with pending and alerting nodes in the innermost circles. Predefined alert conditions help you troubleshoot issues right from the start. Clicking each node reveals its status and how each app is performing. You'll be able to configure Kubernetes to suit your environnment after you create a New Relic account (it's free, forever!) and install our Kubernetes integration. Get started: Install the Kubernetes integration We have an automated installer to help you with many types of installations: servers, virtual machines, and unprivileged environments. It can also help you with installations in managed services or platforms, but you'll need to review a few preliminary notes before getting started. Our automated installer will generate either a helm command or a set of plain manifests for you to install. Our automated installer: Allows users to select the cluster name and namespace for the installation. Allows users to selectively enable or disable bundling of Kube-state-metrics, a dependency of the Kubernetes integration. Allows users to seamlessly install our other products related to Kubernetes such as: Kubernetes events monitoring In-cluster prometheus services monitoring Service instrumentation without code changes using Pixie Automatically fills the required properties with the license keys the integration needs to work. Read the install docs Start the installer Tip If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the automated installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Why it matters Governing the complexity of Kubernetes can be challenging; there's so much going on at any given moment, with containers being created and deleted in a matter of minutes, applications crashing, and resources being consumed unexpectedly. Our integration helps you navigate Kubernetes abstractions across on-premises, cloud, and hybrid deployments. In New Relic, you can build your own charts and query all your Kubernetes data, which our integration collects by instrumenting the container orchestration layer. This gives you additional insight into nodes, namespaces, deployments, replica sets, pods, and containers. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: Using the query builder you can turn any query on Kubernetes data to clear visuals. With the Kubernetes integration you can also: Link your APM data to Kubernetes to measure the performance of your web and mobile applications, with metrics such as request rate, throughput, error rate, and availability. Monitor services running on Kubernetes, such as Apache, NGINX, Cassandra, and many more (see our tutorial for monitoring Redis on Kubernetes). Create new alert policies and alert conditions based on your Kubernetes data, or extend the predefined alert conditions. These features are in addition to the data New Relic already reports for containerized processes running on instrumented hosts. Navigate all your Kubernetes events The Kubernetes events integration, which is installed separately, watches for events happening in your Kubernetes clusters and sends those events to New Relic. Events data is then visualized in the cluster explorer. To set it up, check the Kubernetes events box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer > Events: Browse and filter all your Kubernetes events, and dig into application logs and infrastructure data. Bring your cluster logs to New Relic Our Kubernetes plugin for log monitoring can collect all your cluster's logs and send them to our platform, so that you can set up new alerts and charts. To set it up, check the Log data box in step 3 of our install wizard. For detailed information, see our log forwarding documentation for Kubernetes. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or you can create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "New Relic provides Control Plane support for your Kubernetes integration, allowing you to monitor and collect metrics from your cluster's Control Plane components. That data can then be found in New Relic and used to create queries and charts. Features We monitor and collect metrics from the following control plane components: ETCD: leader information, resident memory size, number of OS threads, consensus proposals data, etc. For a list of supported metrics, see ETCD data. API server: rate of apiserver requests, breakdown of apiserver requests by HTTP method and response code, etc. For the complete list of supported metrics, see API server data. Scheduler: requested CPU/memory vs available on the node, tolerations to taints, any set affinity or anti-affinity, etc. For the complete list of supported metrics, see Scheduler data. Controller manager: resident memory size, number of OS threads created, goroutines currently existing, etc. For the complete list of supported metrics, see Controller manager data. Compatibility and requirements Control plane monitoring requires Kubernetes integration version 1.16.0 or higher. Control plane monitoring support is not enabled for managed clusters. This is because providers (EKS, GKE, AKS, etc.) abstract away the concept of master nodes and control plane components, so that access to them is limited or non-existent. External control planes are not supported. The unprivileged version of the Kubernetes integration does not support control plane monitoring. OpenShift 4.x uses control plane component metric endpoints that are different than the default. Discovery of master nodes and control plane components The Kubernetes integration relies on the kubeadm labeling conventions to discover the master nodes and the control plane components. This means that master nodes should be labeled with node-role.kubernetes.io/master=\"\" or kubernetes.io/role=\"master\". The control plane components should have either the k8s-app or the tier and component labels. Refer to the following table for accepted label combinations and values: Component Label Endpoint API server Kubeadm / Kops / ClusterAPI k8s-app=kube-apiserver tier=control-plane component=kube-apiserver OpenShift app=openshift-kube-apiserver apiserver=true localhost:443/metrics by default (can be configured) if the request fails falls back to localhost:8080/metrics ETCD Kubeadm / Kops / ClusterAPI k8s-app=etcd-manager-main tier=control-plane component=etcd OpenShift k8s-app=etcd localhost:4001/metrics Scheduler Kubeadm / Kops / ClusterAPI k8s-app=kube-scheduler tier=control-plane component=kube-scheduler OpenShift app=openshift-kube-scheduler scheduler=true localhost:10251/metrics Controller manager Kubeadm / Kops / ClusterAPI k8s-app=kube-controller-manager tier=control-plane component=kube-controller-manager​ OpenShift app=kube-controller-manager kube-controller-manager=true localhost:10252/metrics When the integration detects that it is running inside a master node, it tries to find which components are running on the node by looking for pods that match the labels listed in the table above. For every running component, the integration makes a request to its metrics endpoint. Configuration Control plane monitoring is automatic for agents running inside master nodes. The only component that requires an extra step to run is ETCD, because it uses mutual TLS authentication (mTLS) for client requests. The API Server can also be configured to be queried using the Secure Port. Important Control plane monitoring for OpenShift 4.x requires additional configuration. For more information, see the OpenShift 4.x Configuration section. ETCD In order to set mTLS for querying ETCD, there are two configuration options that need to be set: Option Value ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAME Name of a Kubernetes secret that contains the mTLS configuration. The secret should contain the following keys: cert: the certificate that identifies the client making the request. It should be signed by an ETCD trusted CA. key: the private key used to generate the client certificate. cacert: the root CA used to identify the ETCD server certificate. If the ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAME option is not set, ETCD metrics won't be fetched. For step by step instructions on how to create a certificate and sign it with the ETCD client CA, see Set up mTLS from the ETCD client CA. ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAMESPACE The namespace where the secret specified in the ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAME was created. If not set, the default namespace is used. API server By default, the API server metrics are queried using the localhost:8080 unsecured endpoint. If this port is disabled, you can also query these metrics over the secure port. To enable this, set the following configuration option in the Kubernetes integration manifest file: Option Value API_SERVER_ENDPOINT_URL The (secure) URL to query the metrics. The API server uses localhost:443 by default Ensure that the ClusterRole has been updated to the newest version found in the manifest Added in version 1.15.0 Important Note that the port can be different according to the secure port used by the API server. For example, in Minikube the API server secure port is 8443 and therefore API_SERVER_ENDPOINT_URL should be set to https://localhost:8443 OpenShift configuration Control plane components on OpenShift 4.x use endpoint URLs that require SSL and service account based authentication. Therefore, the default endpoint URLs can not be used. To configure control plane monitoring on OpenShift, uncomment the following environment variables in the customized manifest. URL values are pre-configured to the default base URLs for the control plane monitoring metrics endpoints in OpenShift 4.x. - name: \"SCHEDULER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10259 - name: \"ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:9979\" - name: \"CONTROLLER_MANAGER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10257\" - name: \"API_SERVER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:6443\" Copy Important Even though the custom ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL is defined, ETCD requires HTTPS and mTLS authentication to be configured. For more on configuring mTLS for ETCD in OpenShift, see Set up mTLS for ETCD in OpenShift. Important When installing through Helm openshift, specify the config to automatically include these endpoints. Setting openshift.enabled=true and openshift.version=\"4.x\" will include the secure endpoints and enable the /var/run/crio.sock runtime. Set up mTLS from the ETCD client CA The instructions below are based on the Kubernetes documentation. For more information, see Managing TLS certificates in a cluster. For OpenShift, see Set up mTLS for ETCD in OpenShift. To set up mTLS from the ETCD client CA: Download and install the tool cfssl, selecting the correct binaries for your OS from the list. Once installed, execute the following command: cat <<EOF | cfssl genkey - | cfssljson -bare server { \"hosts\": [ \"localhost\" ], \"CN\": \"newrelic-infra.pod.cluster.local\", \"key\": { \"algo\": \"ecdsa\", \"size\": 256 } } EOF Copy This command generates two files; server.csr containing the PEM encoded pkcs#10 certification request and server-key.pem containing the PEM encoded key to the certificate to be created. Use the generated certificate authority (CA) of ETCD to sign your CSR. Depending on your cluster configuration, you may already have this information. For default install configuration, download the CA certificate and the private key directly from ETCD with the following commands: kubectl cp $(kubectl get pods -l k8s-app=etcd-manager-main -n kube-system -o jsonpath=\"{.items[0].metadata.name}\"):/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd-manager/etcd-clients-ca.crt ./cacert -n kube-system kubectl cp $(kubectl get pods -l k8s-app=etcd-manager-main -n kube-system -o jsonpath=\"{.items[0].metadata.name}\"):/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd-manager/etcd-clients-ca.key ./cacert.key -n kube-system Copy Tip This requires that the etcd-manager-main pod has the label k8s-app=etcd-manager-main, which is a requirement for control plane monitoring . If your etc-manager-main pod is located in a different namespace, change the -n kube-system flags accordingly. With those files downloaded, use the following command to sign your CSRF: cfssl sign -ca cacert -ca-key cacert.key server.csr | cfssljson -bare cert Copy Create the secret that is used to retrieve the TLS config for making requests to ETC. We recommend renaming the certificate and the private key: cp cert.pem cert && cp server-key.pem key Copy kubectl -n default create secret generic newrelic-infra-etcd-tls-secret --from-file=./cert --from-file=./key --from-file=./cacert Copy To ease future installations Use the following commands to simultaneously create the CSR, retrieve the CA, generate the certificate by signing the CSR, and create the secret with all the required fields: cat <<EOF | cfssl genkey - | cfssljson -bare server && \\ kubectl cp $(kubectl get pods -l k8s-app=etcd-manager-main -n kube-system -o jsonpath=\"{.items[0].metadata.name}\"):/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd-manager/etcd-clients-ca.crt ./cacert -n kube-system && \\ kubectl cp $(kubectl get pods -l k8s-app=etcd-manager-main -n kube-system -o jsonpath=\"{.items[0].metadata.name}\"):/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd-manager/etcd-clients-ca.key ./cacert.key -n kube-system && \\ cp server-key.pem key && \\ cfssl sign -ca cacert -ca-key cacert.key server.csr | cfssljson -bare cert && \\ cp cert.pem cert && \\ kubectl -n default create secret generic newrelic-infra-etcd-tls-secret --from-file=./cert --from-file=./key --from-file=./cacert { \"hosts\": [ \"localhost\" ], \"CN\": \"newrelic-infra.pod.cluster.local\", \"key\": { \"algo\": \"ecdsa\", \"size\": 256 } } EOF Copy The last step is to update the configuration in the manifest and apply it. In the configuration section, there are two options related to ETCD mTLS: ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAME with the name of the secret that we just created. ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAMESPACE with the namespace that we used to create the secret. To complete the installation, add these variables to the container spec of the integration DaemonSet and apply the changes: - name: \"ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAME” value: \"newrelic-infra-etcd-tls-secret\" - name: \"ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAMESPACE\" value: \"default\" Copy Set up mTLS for ETCD in OpenShift Follow these instructions to set up mutual TLS authentication for ETCD in OpenShift 4.x: Export the ETCD client certificates from the cluster to an opaque secret. In a default managed OpenShift cluster, the secret is named kube-etcd-client-certs and it is stored in the openshift-monitoring namespace. kubectl get secret/kube-etcd-client-certs -n openshift-monitoring -o yaml > etcd-secret.yaml Copy Open the secret file and change the keys: Rename the certificate authority to cacert. Rename the client certificate to cert. Rename the client key to key. Optional: change the secret name and namespace to something meaningful. Remove these unnecessary keys in the metadata section: creationTimestamp resourceVersion selfLink uid Install the manifest with its new name and namespace: kubectl apply -f etcd-secret.yaml Copy Go to Update manifest configuration (the last step under Set up MTL from ETCD client) to configure the required environment variables. See your data If the integration has been been set up correctly, the Kubernetes cluster explorer contains all the Control Plane components and their status in a dedicated section, as shown below. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes Cluster Explorer: Use the Kubernetes cluster explorer to monitor and collect metrics from your cluster's Control Plane components You can also check for Control Plane data with this NRQL query: SELECT latest(timestamp) FROM K8sApiServerSample, K8sEtcdSample, K8sSchedulerSample, K8sControllerManagerSample FACET entityName where clusterName = 'MY_CLUSTER_NAME' Copy Tip If you still can't see Control Plane data, try the solution described in Kubernetes integration troubleshooting: Not seeing data.",

Install Kubernetes events with a proxy There are three options to install the Kubernetes events integration with a proxy: Installing with chart nri-kube-events: The proxy can be configured setting the configuration option proxy in the values.yaml file. If set, the variable NRIA_PROXY will be added into the deployment.yaml template. Installing with chart nri-bundle as a dependency: The proxy can be configured setting the configuration option nri-kube-events.proxy. The configuration option is passed down to the dependency nri-kube-events modifying the values.yaml of nri-bundle: nri-kube-events.proxy: https://user:password@hostname:port Copy Installing with manifest: When installing through the manifest, to configure the proxy set the NRIA_PROXY in the environment variable section of the infra container. Check the deployment template of the chart as an example of environment variable configuration. Install the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration with a proxy There are three options to install the Prometheus OpenMetric integration with a proxy: Installing with charts nri-prometheus: The proxy can be configured setting the configuration option config.emitter_proxy in the values.yaml. The config object is used to generate a configMap that mounted into the deployment under /etc/nri-prometheus/. Installing with chart nri-bundle as a dependency: The proxy can be configured setting the configuration option nri-prometheus.config.emitter_proxy. The configuration option is passed down to the dependency nri-prometheus modifying the values.yaml of nri-bundle: nri-prometheus.config.emitter_proxy: \"http://localhost:8888 Copy Installing with the manifest: Configure the proxy uncommenting the emitter_proxy option directly in the manifest: # Proxy to be used by the emitters when submitting metrics. It should be # in the format [scheme]://[domain]:[port]. # The emitter is the component in charge of sending the scraped metrics. # This proxy won't be used when scraping metrics from the targets. # By default it's empty, meaning that no proxy will be used. # emitter_proxy: \"http://localhost:8888\" Copy Set the synthetics minion to use a proxy Check this README on how to set the proxy for the Synthetics minions. Install the Pixie integration with a proxy There are two options to install the Pixie integration with a proxy: Installing with chart newrelic-pixie: The proxy can be configured setting the configuration option proxy as described in the values.yaml of the chart. Installing with chart nri-bundle as a dependency: The proxy can be configured setting the configuration option newrelic-pixie.proxy. The configuration option is passed down to the dependency newrelic-pixie modifying the values.yaml of nri-bundle: newrelic-pixie.proxy: https://user:password@hostname:port Copy",

      "body": "The easiest way to install the Kubernetes integration is to use our automated installer to generate a manifest. It bundles not just the integration DaemonSets, but also other New Relic Kubernetes configurations, like Kubernetes events, Prometheus OpenMetrics, and New Relic log monitoring. As a Kubernetes user, you might consider Auto-telemetry with Pixie for deeper insights into your Kubernetes clusters and workloads. No language agents required. Ready to get started? If you don't already have one, sign up for a New Relic account. It's free, forever! Use automated installer We encourage you to use our automated installer for servers, VMs, and unprivileged environments. The automated installer can provide you either a Helm command with the required values filled, or a plain manifest if you don't want to use Helm. It also features great customizability and full control over which features and dependencies are enabled. If you are installing our integration on a managed cloud, please take a look at these preliminary notes before proceeding. Before you start the install, make sure you have a New Relic account. It's free! No credit card required. If your New Relic account is in the EU region, choose the EU install option. Get an account Start the installer Eu guided install Or, for fully manual instructions for deploying our integration using Helm. Installs for managed services and platforms Before starting our automated installer, check out these notes for your managed services or platforms: Amazon EKS / EKS-Anywhere The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In Amazon EKS, master nodes are managed by Amazon and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. Before starting our automated installer to deploy the Kubernetes integration in Amazon EKS, make sure you are using the version of kubectl provided by AWS. Amazon EKS Fargate Installation on EKS Fargate clusters requires dedicated steps, which are detailed in our fargate installation docs. Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In GKE, master nodes are managed by Google and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. Before starting our automated installer to deploy the Kubernetes integration on GKE, ensure you have sufficient permissions: Go to console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam and find your username. Click edit. Ensure you have permissions to create Roles and ClusterRoles: If you are not sure, add the Kubernetes Engine Cluster Admin role. If you cannot edit your user role, ask the owner of the GCP project to give you the necessary permissions. OpenShift container platform To deploy the Kubernetes integration with OpenShift: Add the <>{'<release_name>'}</>-newrelic-infrastructure service account to your privileged Security Context Constraints: oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged \\ system:serviceaccount:<namespace>:<release_name>-newrelic-infrastructure Copy The default <>{'<release_name>'}</> provided by the installer is nri-bundle. Complete the steps in our automated installer. If you're using signed certificates, make sure they are properly configured by using the following variables in the DaemonSet portion of your manifest to set the .pem file: Copy name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_DIR value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_DIR name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_FILE value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_NAME YAML key path: `spec.template.spec.containers.name.env` Copy Save your changes. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In Azure Kubernetes Service, master nodes are managed by Azure and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. To deploy in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), complete the steps in our automated installer. Pivotal Container Service (PKS / VMware Tanzu) To deploy in PKS, we recommend that you use the automated installer, or you can follow the manual instructions provided in Install the Kubernetes integration using Helm. Upgrading our Kubernetes integration Our Kubernetes integration is under active development and we regularly release updates which include bug fixes, new features, and support for newer Kubernetes versions and cloud providers. We strongly recommend all our customers to regularly update the Kubernetes integration to get the best experience. Upgrading using the automated installer and Helm In order to update an installation that was deployed using Helm command provided by the automated installer, just go through the process and run the Helm command again. This will pull the new version of the chart and its dependencies and upgrade it to the latest version. Upgrading using the automated installer and plain manifests Tip We encourage you to deploy our integration using Helm, as it provides a cleaner upgrade path compared to using manifests directly. If custom manifests have been used instead of Helm, we encourage you to first remove the old installation using kubectl delete -f previous-manifest-file.yml, and then proceed through the guided installer again. This will generate an updated set of manifests that can be deployed using kubectl apply -f manifest-file.yml. We do not recommend applying a new version of the manifest file without removing the previous one first, since it might leave some leftover components in your cluster. Monitor services running on Kubernetes Tip We encourage you to deploy our integration using Helm, as it allows easier configuration on how to monitor services by just adding snippets to your values.yml file. After having installed our Kubernetes integration, you can start instrumenting the services than run in your cluster. To learn more about how to do this, please check our Monitor services running on Kubernetes page.

      "body": "Helm is a package manager on top of Kubernetes. It facilitates installation, upgrades, or revision tracking, and it manages dependencies for the services that you install in Kubernetes. To install the integration using Helm, we recommend our Kubernetes automated installer, which will prompt for almost all configuration options and autopopulate secrets and values for you. Additionally, our automated installer also allows to install our integration as plain manifests rather than a Helm release. See Kubernetes integration: install and configure for more details about how to use our automated installer. Start the installer This page describes in more depth how to install and configure the New Relic integration without using the automated installer. Compatibility and requirements Make sure Helm is installed on your machine. We strongly recommend using Helm 3 to manage the Kubernetes integration. Our charts are also compatible with Helm 2, but support for it might be removed in the future. To install the Kubernetes integration using Helm, you will need your New Relic account license key and your Kubernetes cluster's name: Find and copy your New Relic license key. Find the name of your cluster with this command: kubectl config current-context Copy Note this values somewhere safe as you will need them later during the installation process. Install Kubernetes integration with Helm Install with Helm 3 and nri-bundle (recommended) New Relic has several charts for the different components which offer different features for the platform: newrelic-infrastructure: Contains the main Kubernetes integration and the infrastructure agent. This is the core component for the New Relic Kubernetes experience, responsible of reporting most of the data that is surfaced in dashboard and the Kubernetes Cluster Explorer. newrelic-logging: Provides a DaemonSet with New Relic's Fluent Bit output plugin to easily forward your logs to New Relic. nri-kube-events: Collects and reports cluster events (such as kubectl get events) to New Relic. nri-prometheus: New Relic's Prometheus OpenMetrics Integration, automatically scrapes Prometheus endpoints present in the cluser and reports metrics to New Relic. nri-metadata-injection: Sets up a minimal MutatingAdmissionWebhook that injects a couple of environment to containers. These contain metadata about the cluster and New Relic installation and will be later picked up by applications instrumented using APM, allowing to correlate APM and infrastructure data. nri-statsd: New Relic StatsD integration. Additionally, New Relic provides nri-bundle, a chart which pulls a selectable set of the charts mentioned above. nri-bundle can also install Kube State Metrics and Pixie for you if needed. While it is possible to install those charts separately, we strongly recommend using the nri-bundle chart for Kubernetes deployments, as it ensures that values across all the charts are consistent and provides full control over which components are installed, as well as the possibility to configure all of them as Helm dependencies. This is the same chart that is used and referenced by our automated installer. Installing and configuring nri-bundle with Helm Ensure you are using the appropriate context in the machine where you will run Helm and kubectl: You can check the available contexts with: kubectl config get-contexts Copy And switch to the desired context using: kubectl config use-context CONTEXT_NAME Copy Add the New Relic Helm charts repo: helm repo add newrelic https://helm-charts.newrelic.com Copy Make sure everything is configured properly in the chart by running the following command. Notice that we are specifying --dry-run and --debug, so nothing will be installed in this step: helm upgrade --install newrelic newrelic/nri-bundle \\ --dry-run \\ --debug \\ --namespace newrelic --create-namespace \\ --set global.licenseKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY \\ --set global.cluster=K8S_CLUSTER_NAME \\ --set ksm.enabled= true \\ --set newrelic-infrastructure.privileged= true \\ --set infrastructure.enabled=true \\ --set prometheus.enabled=true \\ --set webhook.enabled=true \\ --set kubeEvents.enabled=true \\ --set logging.enabled=true Copy Please notice and adjust the following flags: global.licenseKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY: Must be set to a valid License Key for your account. global.cluster=K8S_CLUSTER_NAME: Is used to identify the cluster in the New Relic UI, so should be a descriptive value not used by any other Kubernetes cluster configured in your New Relic account. ksm.enabled=true: Setting this to true will automatically install Kube State Metrics (KSM) for you, which is required for our integration to run. You can set this to false if KSM is already present in your cluster, even if it is on a different namespace. newrelic-infrastructure.privileged=true: Can be set to false to install a trimmed down version of our integration that does not require extra privileges, such as hostPath mounts or running containers as root. Please note that this will disable detailed process collection from the host. For performance reasons, our logging solution still requires hostPath mounts, regardless of the value of this flag. If this is not allowedin your cluster, you will need to disable the logging solution by specifying logging.enabled=false. prometheus.enabled=true: Will deploy our Prometheus OpenMetrics integration, which automatically collects data from prometheus endpoints present in the cluster. webhook.enabled=true: Will install our minimal webhook, which adds environment variables that, in turn, allows linking applications instrumented with APM with infrastructure data. Our chart has a comprehensive set of flags and tunables that can be edited to configure our solution to your particular needs. For a full list of all the flags that can be configured, please check the chart's README and the default values.yaml file. Install the Kubernetes integration by running the customized command without --debug and --dry-run: helm upgrade --install newrelic newrelic/nri-bundle \\ --namespace newrelic --create-namespace \\ --set global.licenseKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY \\ --set global.cluster=K8S_CLUSTER_NAME \\ --set ksm.enabled= true \\ --set newrelic-infrastructure.privileged= true \\ --set infrastructure.enabled=true \\ --set prometheus.enabled=true \\ --set webhook.enabled=true \\ --set kubeEvents.enabled=true \\ --set logging.enabled=true Copy Wait a few seconds, then check that the DaemonSet and pods have been created: kubectl -n newrelic get daemonsets,pods Copy Make sure you see a DaemonSet, and one pod per node for newrelic-infrastructure, as well as one Deployment and one pod for any other component that you have enabled. Install with Helm 2 and nri-bundle (legacy) Installation instructions for Helm 2 Important Helm 2 has been deprecated and New Relic does not recommend using it for deployments. Instructions in this section are provided for legacy systems only. To install using Helm 2: Ensure that Helm 2, including their cluster-side components (such as Tiller) are properly installed and configured. Please check the official documentation for more details. Set the cluster where you want to install the agent: kubectl config set-cluster DESIRED_CLUSTER Copy To see the available clusters, run kubectl config get-clusters Make sure that kube-state-metrics is installed on your machine: kubectl get deployment --all-namespaces | grep kube-state-metrics Copy If it's not installed, follow the instructions in the kube-state-metrics GitHub repo to install it. Add the New Relic Helm charts repo: helm repo add newrelic https://helm-charts.newrelic.com Copy Make sure everything is configured properly in the chart by running the following command. This step uses the --dry-run and --debug switches and therefore the agent is not installed. helm install newrelic/newrelic-infrastructure \\ --dry-run \\ --debug \\ --set licenseKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY \\ --set cluster=K8S_CLUSTER_NAME \\ --set config.custom_attributes.cluster=K8S_CLUSTER_NAME Copy Install the New Relic Kubernetes integration: helm install newrelic/newrelic-infrastructure \\ --set licenseKey=your_new_relic_license_key \\ --set cluster=K8S_CLUSTER_NAME \\ --set config.custom_attributes.cluster=K8S_CLUSTER_NAME Copy Tip Note that the --dry-run and --debug switches have been removed. Wait a few seconds, then check that the DaemonSet and pods have been created: kubectl get daemonsets,pods Copy Make sure you see a DaemonSet, and one pod per node. Helm configuration options When you install or upgrade the Kubernetes integration with Helm using the command line, you can pass your configuration variables with the --set flag. helm install newrelic/newrelic-infrastructure \\ --set licenseKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY \\ --set cluster=YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME Copy A full list of the configuration parameters can be found in the newrelic-infrastructure chart README Upgrade using Helm To update your Kubernetes integration installed via Helm: Update the local chart repository: helm repo update Copy Update the release by running again the appropriate helm upgrade --install ... command in the section above. Monitor services running on Kubernetes After having installed our Kubernetes integration, you can start instrumenting the services than run in your cluster. To learn more about how to do this, please check our Monitor services running on Kubernetes page. Use your Kubernetes data To learn more about how to use your Kubernetes data, please head to our detailed Find and use your Kubernetes data pages. Reduce data ingest Our charts support setting an option to reduce the amount of data ingest at the cost of dropping detailed information. To enable it, set global.lowDataMode=true in the nri-bundle chart. lowDataMode affects three specific components of the nri-bundle chart outlined below. Prometheus OpenMetrics Integration If lowDataMode is enabled, the following metrics are excluded by default as they are already collected and used by the New Relic Kubernetes Integration. - kube_ - container_ - machine_ - cadvisor_ Copy New Relic Logging If lowDataMode is enabled, Labels and Annotations are set to Off in the Filter section of the fluent-bit.conf file. This means that this detail will be dropped from the container log files which reduces the overall data ingest into New Relic. The following fields are retained: Allowlist_key container_name Allowlist_key namespace_name Allowlist_key pod_name Allowlist_key stream Allowlist_key log Copy Low Data Mode Log Example Complete Log Record [ { \"cluster_name\": \"api-test\", \"kubernetes\": { \"annotations\": { \"kubernetes.io/psp\": \"eks.privileged\" }, \"container_hash\": \"fryckbos/test@sha256:5b098eaf3c7d5b3585eb10cebee63665b6208bea31ef31a3f0856c5ffdda644b\", \"container_image\": \"fryckbos/test:latest\", \"container_name\": \"newrelic-logging\", \"docker_id\": \"134e1daf63761baa15e035b08b7aea04518a0f0e50af4215131a50c6a379a072\", \"host\": \"ip-192-168-17-123.ec2.internal\", \"labels\": { \"app\": \"newrelic-logging\", \"app.kubernetes.io/name\": \"newrelic-logging\", \"controller-revision-hash\": \"84db95db86\", \"pod-template-generation\": \"1\", \"release\": \"nri-bundle\" }, \"namespace_name\": \"nrlogs\", \"pod_id\": \"54556e3e-719c-46b5-af69-020b75d69bf1\", \"pod_name\": \"nri-bundle-newrelic-logging-jxnbj\" }, \"message\": \"[2021/09/14 12:30:49] [ info] [engine] started (pid=1)\\n\", \"plugin\": { \"source\": \"kubernetes\", \"type\": \"fluent-bit\", \"version\": \"1.8.1\" }, \"stream\": \"stderr\", \"time\": \"2021-09-14T12:30:49.138824971Z\", \"timestamp\": 1631622649138 } ] Copy Log Record after enabling lowDataMode.

      "body": "New Relic provides Control Plane support for your Kubernetes integration, allowing you to monitor and collect metrics from your cluster's Control Plane components. That data can then be found in New Relic and used to create queries and charts. Features We monitor and collect metrics from the following control plane components: ETCD: leader information, resident memory size, number of OS threads, consensus proposals data, etc. For a list of supported metrics, see ETCD data. API server: rate of apiserver requests, breakdown of apiserver requests by HTTP method and response code, etc. For the complete list of supported metrics, see API server data. Scheduler: requested CPU/memory vs available on the node, tolerations to taints, any set affinity or anti-affinity, etc. For the complete list of supported metrics, see Scheduler data. Controller manager: resident memory size, number of OS threads created, goroutines currently existing, etc. For the complete list of supported metrics, see Controller manager data. Compatibility and requirements Control plane monitoring requires Kubernetes integration version 1.16.0 or higher. Control plane monitoring support is not enabled for managed clusters. This is because providers (EKS, GKE, AKS, etc.) abstract away the concept of master nodes and control plane components, so that access to them is limited or non-existent. External control planes are not supported. The unprivileged version of the Kubernetes integration does not support control plane monitoring. OpenShift 4.x uses control plane component metric endpoints that are different than the default. Discovery of master nodes and control plane components The Kubernetes integration relies on the kubeadm labeling conventions to discover the master nodes and the control plane components. This means that master nodes should be labeled with node-role.kubernetes.io/master=\"\" or kubernetes.io/role=\"master\". The control plane components should have either the k8s-app or the tier and component labels. Refer to the following table for accepted label combinations and values: Component Label Endpoint API server Kubeadm / Kops / ClusterAPI k8s-app=kube-apiserver tier=control-plane component=kube-apiserver OpenShift app=openshift-kube-apiserver apiserver=true localhost:443/metrics by default (can be configured) if the request fails falls back to localhost:8080/metrics ETCD Kubeadm / Kops / ClusterAPI k8s-app=etcd-manager-main tier=control-plane component=etcd OpenShift k8s-app=etcd localhost:4001/metrics Scheduler Kubeadm / Kops / ClusterAPI k8s-app=kube-scheduler tier=control-plane component=kube-scheduler OpenShift app=openshift-kube-scheduler scheduler=true localhost:10251/metrics Controller manager Kubeadm / Kops / ClusterAPI k8s-app=kube-controller-manager tier=control-plane component=kube-controller-manager​ OpenShift app=kube-controller-manager kube-controller-manager=true localhost:10252/metrics When the integration detects that it is running inside a master node, it tries to find which components are running on the node by looking for pods that match the labels listed in the table above. For every running component, the integration makes a request to its metrics endpoint. Configuration Control plane monitoring is automatic for agents running inside master nodes. The only component that requires an extra step to run is ETCD, because it uses mutual TLS authentication (mTLS) for client requests. The API Server can also be configured to be queried using the Secure Port. Important Control plane monitoring for OpenShift 4.x requires additional configuration. For more information, see the OpenShift 4.x Configuration section. ETCD In order to set mTLS for querying ETCD, there are two configuration options that need to be set: Option Value ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAME Name of a Kubernetes secret that contains the mTLS configuration. The secret should contain the following keys: cert: the certificate that identifies the client making the request. It should be signed by an ETCD trusted CA. key: the private key used to generate the client certificate. cacert: the root CA used to identify the ETCD server certificate. If the ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAME option is not set, ETCD metrics won't be fetched. For step by step instructions on how to create a certificate and sign it with the ETCD client CA, see Set up mTLS from the ETCD client CA. ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAMESPACE The namespace where the secret specified in the ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAME was created. If not set, the default namespace is used. API server By default, the API server metrics are queried using the localhost:8080 unsecured endpoint. If this port is disabled, you can also query these metrics over the secure port. To enable this, set the following configuration option in the Kubernetes integration manifest file: Option Value API_SERVER_ENDPOINT_URL The (secure) URL to query the metrics. The API server uses localhost:443 by default Ensure that the ClusterRole has been updated to the newest version found in the manifest Added in version 1.15.0 Important Note that the port can be different according to the secure port used by the API server. For example, in Minikube the API server secure port is 8443 and therefore API_SERVER_ENDPOINT_URL should be set to https://localhost:8443 OpenShift configuration Control plane components on OpenShift 4.x use endpoint URLs that require SSL and service account based authentication. Therefore, the default endpoint URLs can not be used. To configure control plane monitoring on OpenShift, uncomment the following environment variables in the customized manifest. URL values are pre-configured to the default base URLs for the control plane monitoring metrics endpoints in OpenShift 4.x. - name: \"SCHEDULER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10259 - name: \"ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:9979\" - name: \"CONTROLLER_MANAGER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10257\" - name: \"API_SERVER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:6443\" Copy Important Even though the custom ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL is defined, ETCD requires HTTPS and mTLS authentication to be configured. For more on configuring mTLS for ETCD in OpenShift, see Set up mTLS for ETCD in OpenShift. Important When installing through Helm openshift, specify the config to automatically include these endpoints. Setting openshift.enabled=true and openshift.version=\"4.x\" will include the secure endpoints and enable the /var/run/crio.sock runtime. Set up mTLS from the ETCD client CA The instructions below are based on the Kubernetes documentation. For more information, see Managing TLS certificates in a cluster. For OpenShift, see Set up mTLS for ETCD in OpenShift. To set up mTLS from the ETCD client CA: Download and install the tool cfssl, selecting the correct binaries for your OS from the list. Once installed, execute the following command: cat <<EOF | cfssl genkey - | cfssljson -bare server { \"hosts\": [ \"localhost\" ], \"CN\": \"newrelic-infra.pod.cluster.local\", \"key\": { \"algo\": \"ecdsa\", \"size\": 256 } } EOF Copy This command generates two files; server.csr containing the PEM encoded pkcs#10 certification request and server-key.pem containing the PEM encoded key to the certificate to be created. Use the generated certificate authority (CA) of ETCD to sign your CSR. Depending on your cluster configuration, you may already have this information. For default install configuration, download the CA certificate and the private key directly from ETCD with the following commands: kubectl cp $(kubectl get pods -l k8s-app=etcd-manager-main -n kube-system -o jsonpath=\"{.items[0].metadata.name}\"):/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd-manager/etcd-clients-ca.crt ./cacert -n kube-system kubectl cp $(kubectl get pods -l k8s-app=etcd-manager-main -n kube-system -o jsonpath=\"{.items[0].metadata.name}\"):/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd-manager/etcd-clients-ca.key ./cacert.key -n kube-system Copy Tip This requires that the etcd-manager-main pod has the label k8s-app=etcd-manager-main, which is a requirement for control plane monitoring . If your etc-manager-main pod is located in a different namespace, change the -n kube-system flags accordingly. With those files downloaded, use the following command to sign your CSRF: cfssl sign -ca cacert -ca-key cacert.key server.csr | cfssljson -bare cert Copy Create the secret that is used to retrieve the TLS config for making requests to ETC. We recommend renaming the certificate and the private key: cp cert.pem cert && cp server-key.pem key Copy kubectl -n default create secret generic newrelic-infra-etcd-tls-secret --from-file=./cert --from-file=./key --from-file=./cacert Copy To ease future installations Use the following commands to simultaneously create the CSR, retrieve the CA, generate the certificate by signing the CSR, and create the secret with all the required fields: cat <<EOF | cfssl genkey - | cfssljson -bare server && \\ kubectl cp $(kubectl get pods -l k8s-app=etcd-manager-main -n kube-system -o jsonpath=\"{.items[0].metadata.name}\"):/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd-manager/etcd-clients-ca.crt ./cacert -n kube-system && \\ kubectl cp $(kubectl get pods -l k8s-app=etcd-manager-main -n kube-system -o jsonpath=\"{.items[0].metadata.name}\"):/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd-manager/etcd-clients-ca.key ./cacert.key -n kube-system && \\ cp server-key.pem key && \\ cfssl sign -ca cacert -ca-key cacert.key server.csr | cfssljson -bare cert && \\ cp cert.pem cert && \\ kubectl -n default create secret generic newrelic-infra-etcd-tls-secret --from-file=./cert --from-file=./key --from-file=./cacert { \"hosts\": [ \"localhost\" ], \"CN\": \"newrelic-infra.pod.cluster.local\", \"key\": { \"algo\": \"ecdsa\", \"size\": 256 } } EOF Copy The last step is to update the configuration in the manifest and apply it. In the configuration section, there are two options related to ETCD mTLS: ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAME with the name of the secret that we just created. ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAMESPACE with the namespace that we used to create the secret. To complete the installation, add these variables to the container spec of the integration DaemonSet and apply the changes: - name: \"ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAME” value: \"newrelic-infra-etcd-tls-secret\" - name: \"ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAMESPACE\" value: \"default\" Copy Set up mTLS for ETCD in OpenShift Follow these instructions to set up mutual TLS authentication for ETCD in OpenShift 4.x: Export the ETCD client certificates from the cluster to an opaque secret. In a default managed OpenShift cluster, the secret is named kube-etcd-client-certs and it is stored in the openshift-monitoring namespace. kubectl get secret/kube-etcd-client-certs -n openshift-monitoring -o yaml > etcd-secret.yaml Copy Open the secret file and change the keys: Rename the certificate authority to cacert. Rename the client certificate to cert. Rename the client key to key. Optional: change the secret name and namespace to something meaningful. Remove these unnecessary keys in the metadata section: creationTimestamp resourceVersion selfLink uid Install the manifest with its new name and namespace: kubectl apply -f etcd-secret.yaml Copy Go to Update manifest configuration (the last step under Set up MTL from ETCD client) to configure the required environment variables.

It bundles not just the integration DaemonSets, but also other New Relic Kubernetes configurations, like Kubernetes events, Prometheus OpenMetrics, and New Relic log monitoring. As a Kubernetes user, you might consider Auto-telemetry with Pixie for deeper insights into your Kubernetes clusters and workloads. No language agents required. Ready to get started? If you don't already have one, sign up for a New Relic account. It's free, forever! Use automated installer We encourage you to use our automated installer for servers, VMs, and unprivileged environments. The automated installer can provide you either a Helm command with the required values filled, or a plain manifest if you don't want to use Helm. It also features great customizability and full control over which features and dependencies are enabled. If you are installing our integration on a managed cloud, please take a look at these preliminary notes before proceeding. Before you start the install, make sure you have a New Relic account. It's free! No credit card required. If your New Relic account is in the EU region, choose the EU install option. Get an account Start the installer Eu guided install Or, for fully manual instructions for deploying our integration using Helm. Installs for managed services and platforms Before starting our automated installer, check out these notes for your managed services or platforms: Amazon EKS / EKS-Anywhere The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In Amazon EKS, master nodes are managed by Amazon and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. Before starting our automated installer to deploy the Kubernetes integration in Amazon EKS, make sure you are using the version of kubectl provided by AWS. Amazon EKS Fargate Installation on EKS Fargate clusters requires dedicated steps, which are detailed in our fargate installation docs. Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In GKE, master nodes are managed by Google and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. Before starting our automated installer to deploy the Kubernetes integration on GKE, ensure you have sufficient permissions: Go to console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam and find your username. Click edit. Ensure you have permissions to create Roles and ClusterRoles: If you are not sure, add the Kubernetes Engine Cluster Admin role. If you cannot edit your user role, ask the owner of the GCP project to give you the necessary permissions. OpenShift container platform To deploy the Kubernetes integration with OpenShift: Add the <>{'<release_name>'}</>-newrelic-infrastructure service account to your privileged Security Context Constraints: oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged \\ system:serviceaccount:<namespace>:<release_name>-newrelic-infrastructure Copy The default <>{'<release_name>'}</> provided by the installer is nri-bundle. Complete the steps in our automated installer. If you're using signed certificates, make sure they are properly configured by using the following variables in the DaemonSet portion of your manifest to set the .pem file: Copy name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_DIR value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_DIR name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_FILE value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_NAME YAML key path: `spec.template.spec.containers.name.env` Copy Save your changes. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In Azure Kubernetes Service, master nodes are managed by Azure and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. To deploy in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), complete the steps in our automated installer. Pivotal Container Service (PKS / VMware Tanzu) To deploy in PKS, we recommend that you use the automated installer, or you can follow the manual instructions provided in Install the Kubernetes integration using Helm. Upgrading our Kubernetes integration Our Kubernetes integration is under active development and we regularly release updates which include bug fixes, new features, and support for newer Kubernetes versions and cloud providers. We strongly recommend all our customers to regularly update the Kubernetes integration to get the best experience. Upgrading using the automated installer and Helm In order to update an installation that was deployed using Helm command provided by the automated installer, just go through the process and run the Helm command again. This will pull the new version of the chart and its dependencies and upgrade it to the latest version. Upgrading using the automated installer and plain manifests Tip We encourage you to deploy our integration using Helm, as it provides a cleaner upgrade path compared to using manifests directly. If custom manifests have been used instead of Helm, we encourage you to first remove the old installation using kubectl delete -f previous-manifest-file.yml, and then proceed through the guided installer again. This will generate an updated set of manifests that can be deployed using kubectl apply -f manifest-file.yml. We do not recommend applying a new version of the manifest file without removing the previous one first, since it might leave some leftover components in your cluster. Monitor services running on Kubernetes Tip We encourage you to deploy our integration using Helm, as it allows easier configuration on how to monitor services by just adding snippets to your values.yml file. After having installed our Kubernetes integration, you can start instrumenting the services than run in your cluster.

      "body": "Helm is a package manager on top of Kubernetes. It facilitates installation, upgrades, or revision tracking, and it manages dependencies for the services that you install in Kubernetes. To install the integration using Helm, we recommend our Kubernetes automated installer, which will prompt for almost all configuration options and autopopulate secrets and values for you. Additionally, our automated installer also allows to install our integration as plain manifests rather than a Helm release. See Kubernetes integration: install and configure for more details about how to use our automated installer. Start the installer This page describes in more depth how to install and configure the New Relic integration without using the automated installer. Compatibility and requirements Make sure Helm is installed on your machine. We strongly recommend using Helm 3 to manage the Kubernetes integration. Our charts are also compatible with Helm 2, but support for it might be removed in the future. To install the Kubernetes integration using Helm, you will need your New Relic account license key and your Kubernetes cluster's name: Find and copy your New Relic license key. Find the name of your cluster with this command: kubectl config current-context Copy Note this values somewhere safe as you will need them later during the installation process. Install Kubernetes integration with Helm Install with Helm 3 and nri-bundle (recommended) New Relic has several charts for the different components which offer different features for the platform: newrelic-infrastructure: Contains the main Kubernetes integration and the infrastructure agent. This is the core component for the New Relic Kubernetes experience, responsible of reporting most of the data that is surfaced in dashboard and the Kubernetes Cluster Explorer. newrelic-logging: Provides a DaemonSet with New Relic's Fluent Bit output plugin to easily forward your logs to New Relic. nri-kube-events: Collects and reports cluster events (such as kubectl get events) to New Relic. nri-prometheus: New Relic's Prometheus OpenMetrics Integration, automatically scrapes Prometheus endpoints present in the cluser and reports metrics to New Relic. nri-metadata-injection: Sets up a minimal MutatingAdmissionWebhook that injects a couple of environment to containers. These contain metadata about the cluster and New Relic installation and will be later picked up by applications instrumented using APM, allowing to correlate APM and infrastructure data. nri-statsd: New Relic StatsD integration. Additionally, New Relic provides nri-bundle, a chart which pulls a selectable set of the charts mentioned above. nri-bundle can also install Kube State Metrics and Pixie for you if needed. While it is possible to install those charts separately, we strongly recommend using the nri-bundle chart for Kubernetes deployments, as it ensures that values across all the charts are consistent and provides full control over which components are installed, as well as the possibility to configure all of them as Helm dependencies. This is the same chart that is used and referenced by our automated installer. Installing and configuring nri-bundle with Helm Ensure you are using the appropriate context in the machine where you will run Helm and kubectl: You can check the available contexts with: kubectl config get-contexts Copy And switch to the desired context using: kubectl config use-context CONTEXT_NAME Copy Add the New Relic Helm charts repo: helm repo add newrelic https://helm-charts.newrelic.com Copy Make sure everything is configured properly in the chart by running the following command. Notice that we are specifying --dry-run and --debug, so nothing will be installed in this step: helm upgrade --install newrelic newrelic/nri-bundle \\ --dry-run \\ --debug \\ --namespace newrelic --create-namespace \\ --set global.licenseKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY \\ --set global.cluster=K8S_CLUSTER_NAME \\ --set ksm.enabled= true \\ --set newrelic-infrastructure.privileged= true \\ --set infrastructure.enabled=true \\ --set prometheus.enabled=true \\ --set webhook.enabled=true \\ --set kubeEvents.enabled=true \\ --set logging.enabled=true Copy Please notice and adjust the following flags: global.licenseKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY: Must be set to a valid License Key for your account. global.cluster=K8S_CLUSTER_NAME: Is used to identify the cluster in the New Relic UI, so should be a descriptive value not used by any other Kubernetes cluster configured in your New Relic account. ksm.enabled=true: Setting this to true will automatically install Kube State Metrics (KSM) for you, which is required for our integration to run. You can set this to false if KSM is already present in your cluster, even if it is on a different namespace. newrelic-infrastructure.privileged=true: Can be set to false to install a trimmed down version of our integration that does not require extra privileges, such as hostPath mounts or running containers as root. Please note that this will disable detailed process collection from the host. For performance reasons, our logging solution still requires hostPath mounts, regardless of the value of this flag. If this is not allowedin your cluster, you will need to disable the logging solution by specifying logging.enabled=false. prometheus.enabled=true: Will deploy our Prometheus OpenMetrics integration, which automatically collects data from prometheus endpoints present in the cluster. webhook.enabled=true: Will install our minimal webhook, which adds environment variables that, in turn, allows linking applications instrumented with APM with infrastructure data. Our chart has a comprehensive set of flags and tunables that can be edited to configure our solution to your particular needs. For a full list of all the flags that can be configured, please check the chart's README and the default values.yaml file. Install the Kubernetes integration by running the customized command without --debug and --dry-run: helm upgrade --install newrelic newrelic/nri-bundle \\ --namespace newrelic --create-namespace \\ --set global.licenseKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY \\ --set global.cluster=K8S_CLUSTER_NAME \\ --set ksm.enabled= true \\ --set newrelic-infrastructure.privileged= true \\ --set infrastructure.enabled=true \\ --set prometheus.enabled=true \\ --set webhook.enabled=true \\ --set kubeEvents.enabled=true \\ --set logging.enabled=true Copy Wait a few seconds, then check that the DaemonSet and pods have been created: kubectl -n newrelic get daemonsets,pods Copy Make sure you see a DaemonSet, and one pod per node for newrelic-infrastructure, as well as one Deployment and one pod for any other component that you have enabled. Install with Helm 2 and nri-bundle (legacy) Installation instructions for Helm 2 Important Helm 2 has been deprecated and New Relic does not recommend using it for deployments. Instructions in this section are provided for legacy systems only. To install using Helm 2: Ensure that Helm 2, including their cluster-side components (such as Tiller) are properly installed and configured. Please check the official documentation for more details. Set the cluster where you want to install the agent: kubectl config set-cluster DESIRED_CLUSTER Copy To see the available clusters, run kubectl config get-clusters Make sure that kube-state-metrics is installed on your machine: kubectl get deployment --all-namespaces | grep kube-state-metrics Copy If it's not installed, follow the instructions in the kube-state-metrics GitHub repo to install it. Add the New Relic Helm charts repo: helm repo add newrelic https://helm-charts.newrelic.com Copy Make sure everything is configured properly in the chart by running the following command. This step uses the --dry-run and --debug switches and therefore the agent is not installed. helm install newrelic/newrelic-infrastructure \\ --dry-run \\ --debug \\ --set licenseKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY \\ --set cluster=K8S_CLUSTER_NAME \\ --set config.custom_attributes.cluster=K8S_CLUSTER_NAME Copy Install the New Relic Kubernetes integration: helm install newrelic/newrelic-infrastructure \\ --set licenseKey=your_new_relic_license_key \\ --set cluster=K8S_CLUSTER_NAME \\ --set config.custom_attributes.cluster=K8S_CLUSTER_NAME Copy Tip Note that the --dry-run and --debug switches have been removed. Wait a few seconds, then check that the DaemonSet and pods have been created: kubectl get daemonsets,pods Copy Make sure you see a DaemonSet, and one pod per node. Helm configuration options When you install or upgrade the Kubernetes integration with Helm using the command line, you can pass your configuration variables with the --set flag. helm install newrelic/newrelic-infrastructure \\ --set licenseKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY \\ --set cluster=YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME Copy A full list of the configuration parameters can be found in the newrelic-infrastructure chart README Upgrade using Helm To update your Kubernetes integration installed via Helm: Update the local chart repository: helm repo update Copy Update the release by running again the appropriate helm upgrade --install ... command in the section above. Monitor services running on Kubernetes After having installed our Kubernetes integration, you can start instrumenting the services than run in your cluster. To learn more about how to do this, please check our Monitor services running on Kubernetes page. Use your Kubernetes data To learn more about how to use your Kubernetes data, please head to our detailed Find and use your Kubernetes data pages. Reduce data ingest Our charts support setting an option to reduce the amount of data ingest at the cost of dropping detailed information. To enable it, set global.lowDataMode=true in the nri-bundle chart. lowDataMode affects three specific components of the nri-bundle chart outlined below.

      "body": "The easiest way to install the Kubernetes integration is to use our automated installer to generate a manifest. It bundles not just the integration DaemonSets, but also other New Relic Kubernetes configurations, like Kubernetes events, Prometheus OpenMetrics, and New Relic log monitoring. As a Kubernetes user, you might consider Auto-telemetry with Pixie for deeper insights into your Kubernetes clusters and workloads. No language agents required. Ready to get started? If you don't already have one, sign up for a New Relic account. It's free, forever! Use automated installer We encourage you to use our automated installer for servers, VMs, and unprivileged environments. The automated installer can provide you either a Helm command with the required values filled, or a plain manifest if you don't want to use Helm. It also features great customizability and full control over which features and dependencies are enabled. If you are installing our integration on a managed cloud, please take a look at these preliminary notes before proceeding. Before you start the install, make sure you have a New Relic account. It's free! No credit card required. If your New Relic account is in the EU region, choose the EU install option. Get an account Start the installer Eu guided install Or, for fully manual instructions for deploying our integration using Helm. Installs for managed services and platforms Before starting our automated installer, check out these notes for your managed services or platforms: Amazon EKS / EKS-Anywhere The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In Amazon EKS, master nodes are managed by Amazon and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. Before starting our automated installer to deploy the Kubernetes integration in Amazon EKS, make sure you are using the version of kubectl provided by AWS. Amazon EKS Fargate Installation on EKS Fargate clusters requires dedicated steps, which are detailed in our fargate installation docs. Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In GKE, master nodes are managed by Google and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. Before starting our automated installer to deploy the Kubernetes integration on GKE, ensure you have sufficient permissions: Go to console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam and find your username. Click edit. Ensure you have permissions to create Roles and ClusterRoles: If you are not sure, add the Kubernetes Engine Cluster Admin role. If you cannot edit your user role, ask the owner of the GCP project to give you the necessary permissions. OpenShift container platform To deploy the Kubernetes integration with OpenShift: Add the <>{'<release_name>'}</>-newrelic-infrastructure service account to your privileged Security Context Constraints: oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged \\ system:serviceaccount:<namespace>:<release_name>-newrelic-infrastructure Copy The default <>{'<release_name>'}</> provided by the installer is nri-bundle. Complete the steps in our automated installer. If you're using signed certificates, make sure they are properly configured by using the following variables in the DaemonSet portion of your manifest to set the .pem file: Copy name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_DIR value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_DIR name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_FILE value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_NAME YAML key path: `spec.template.spec.containers.name.env` Copy Save your changes. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In Azure Kubernetes Service, master nodes are managed by Azure and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. To deploy in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), complete the steps in our automated installer. Pivotal Container Service (PKS / VMware Tanzu) To deploy in PKS, we recommend that you use the automated installer, or you can follow the manual instructions provided in Install the Kubernetes integration using Helm. Upgrading our Kubernetes integration Our Kubernetes integration is under active development and we regularly release updates which include bug fixes, new features, and support for newer Kubernetes versions and cloud providers. We strongly recommend all our customers to regularly update the Kubernetes integration to get the best experience. Upgrading using the automated installer and Helm In order to update an installation that was deployed using Helm command provided by the automated installer, just go through the process and run the Helm command again. This will pull the new version of the chart and its dependencies and upgrade it to the latest version. Upgrading using the automated installer and plain manifests Tip We encourage you to deploy our integration using Helm, as it provides a cleaner upgrade path compared to using manifests directly. If custom manifests have been used instead of Helm, we encourage you to first remove the old installation using kubectl delete -f previous-manifest-file.yml, and then proceed through the guided installer again. This will generate an updated set of manifests that can be deployed using kubectl apply -f manifest-file.yml. We do not recommend applying a new version of the manifest file without removing the previous one first, since it might leave some leftover components in your cluster. Monitor services running on Kubernetes Tip We encourage you to deploy our integration using Helm, as it allows easier configuration on how to monitor services by just adding snippets to your values.yml file. After having installed our Kubernetes integration, you can start instrumenting the services than run in your cluster. To learn more about how to do this, please check our Monitor services running on Kubernetes page. Use your Kubernetes data To learn more about how to use your Kubernetes data, please head to our detailed Find and use your Kubernetes data pages.",

      "body": "New Relic provides Control Plane support for your Kubernetes integration, allowing you to monitor and collect metrics from your cluster's Control Plane components. That data can then be found in New Relic and used to create queries and charts. Features We monitor and collect metrics from the following control plane components: ETCD: leader information, resident memory size, number of OS threads, consensus proposals data, etc. For a list of supported metrics, see ETCD data. API server: rate of apiserver requests, breakdown of apiserver requests by HTTP method and response code, etc. For the complete list of supported metrics, see API server data. Scheduler: requested CPU/memory vs available on the node, tolerations to taints, any set affinity or anti-affinity, etc. For the complete list of supported metrics, see Scheduler data. Controller manager: resident memory size, number of OS threads created, goroutines currently existing, etc. For the complete list of supported metrics, see Controller manager data. Compatibility and requirements Control plane monitoring requires Kubernetes integration version 1.16.0 or higher. Control plane monitoring support is not enabled for managed clusters. This is because providers (EKS, GKE, AKS, etc.) abstract away the concept of master nodes and control plane components, so that access to them is limited or non-existent. External control planes are not supported. The unprivileged version of the Kubernetes integration does not support control plane monitoring. OpenShift 4.x uses control plane component metric endpoints that are different than the default. Discovery of master nodes and control plane components The Kubernetes integration relies on the kubeadm labeling conventions to discover the master nodes and the control plane components. This means that master nodes should be labeled with node-role.kubernetes.io/master=\"\" or kubernetes.io/role=\"master\". The control plane components should have either the k8s-app or the tier and component labels. Refer to the following table for accepted label combinations and values: Component Label Endpoint API server Kubeadm / Kops / ClusterAPI k8s-app=kube-apiserver tier=control-plane component=kube-apiserver OpenShift app=openshift-kube-apiserver apiserver=true localhost:443/metrics by default (can be configured) if the request fails falls back to localhost:8080/metrics ETCD Kubeadm / Kops / ClusterAPI k8s-app=etcd-manager-main tier=control-plane component=etcd OpenShift k8s-app=etcd localhost:4001/metrics Scheduler Kubeadm / Kops / ClusterAPI k8s-app=kube-scheduler tier=control-plane component=kube-scheduler OpenShift app=openshift-kube-scheduler scheduler=true localhost:10251/metrics Controller manager Kubeadm / Kops / ClusterAPI k8s-app=kube-controller-manager tier=control-plane component=kube-controller-manager​ OpenShift app=kube-controller-manager kube-controller-manager=true localhost:10252/metrics When the integration detects that it is running inside a master node, it tries to find which components are running on the node by looking for pods that match the labels listed in the table above. For every running component, the integration makes a request to its metrics endpoint. Configuration Control plane monitoring is automatic for agents running inside master nodes. The only component that requires an extra step to run is ETCD, because it uses mutual TLS authentication (mTLS) for client requests. The API Server can also be configured to be queried using the Secure Port. Important Control plane monitoring for OpenShift 4.x requires additional configuration. For more information, see the OpenShift 4.x Configuration section. ETCD In order to set mTLS for querying ETCD, there are two configuration options that need to be set: Option Value ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAME Name of a Kubernetes secret that contains the mTLS configuration. The secret should contain the following keys: cert: the certificate that identifies the client making the request. It should be signed by an ETCD trusted CA. key: the private key used to generate the client certificate. cacert: the root CA used to identify the ETCD server certificate. If the ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAME option is not set, ETCD metrics won't be fetched. For step by step instructions on how to create a certificate and sign it with the ETCD client CA, see Set up mTLS from the ETCD client CA. ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAMESPACE The namespace where the secret specified in the ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAME was created. If not set, the default namespace is used. API server By default, the API server metrics are queried using the localhost:8080 unsecured endpoint. If this port is disabled, you can also query these metrics over the secure port. To enable this, set the following configuration option in the Kubernetes integration manifest file: Option Value API_SERVER_ENDPOINT_URL The (secure) URL to query the metrics. The API server uses localhost:443 by default Ensure that the ClusterRole has been updated to the newest version found in the manifest Added in version 1.15.0 Important Note that the port can be different according to the secure port used by the API server. For example, in Minikube the API server secure port is 8443 and therefore API_SERVER_ENDPOINT_URL should be set to https://localhost:8443 OpenShift configuration Control plane components on OpenShift 4.x use endpoint URLs that require SSL and service account based authentication. Therefore, the default endpoint URLs can not be used. To configure control plane monitoring on OpenShift, uncomment the following environment variables in the customized manifest. URL values are pre-configured to the default base URLs for the control plane monitoring metrics endpoints in OpenShift 4.x. - name: \"SCHEDULER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10259 - name: \"ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:9979\" - name: \"CONTROLLER_MANAGER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10257\" - name: \"API_SERVER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:6443\" Copy Important Even though the custom ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL is defined, ETCD requires HTTPS and mTLS authentication to be configured. For more on configuring mTLS for ETCD in OpenShift, see Set up mTLS for ETCD in OpenShift. Important When installing through Helm openshift, specify the config to automatically include these endpoints. Setting openshift.enabled=true and openshift.version=\"4.x\" will include the secure endpoints and enable the /var/run/crio.sock runtime. Set up mTLS from the ETCD client CA The instructions below are based on the Kubernetes documentation. For more information, see Managing TLS certificates in a cluster. For OpenShift, see Set up mTLS for ETCD in OpenShift. To set up mTLS from the ETCD client CA: Download and install the tool cfssl, selecting the correct binaries for your OS from the list. Once installed, execute the following command: cat <<EOF | cfssl genkey - | cfssljson -bare server { \"hosts\": [ \"localhost\" ], \"CN\": \"newrelic-infra.pod.cluster.local\", \"key\": { \"algo\": \"ecdsa\", \"size\": 256 } } EOF Copy This command generates two files; server.csr containing the PEM encoded pkcs#10 certification request and server-key.pem containing the PEM encoded key to the certificate to be created. Use the generated certificate authority (CA) of ETCD to sign your CSR. Depending on your cluster configuration, you may already have this information. For default install configuration, download the CA certificate and the private key directly from ETCD with the following commands: kubectl cp $(kubectl get pods -l k8s-app=etcd-manager-main -n kube-system -o jsonpath=\"{.items[0].metadata.name}\"):/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd-manager/etcd-clients-ca.crt ./cacert -n kube-system kubectl cp $(kubectl get pods -l k8s-app=etcd-manager-main -n kube-system -o jsonpath=\"{.items[0].metadata.name}\"):/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd-manager/etcd-clients-ca.key ./cacert.key -n kube-system Copy Tip This requires that the etcd-manager-main pod has the label k8s-app=etcd-manager-main, which is a requirement for control plane monitoring . If your etc-manager-main pod is located in a different namespace, change the -n kube-system flags accordingly. With those files downloaded, use the following command to sign your CSRF: cfssl sign -ca cacert -ca-key cacert.key server.csr | cfssljson -bare cert Copy Create the secret that is used to retrieve the TLS config for making requests to ETC. We recommend renaming the certificate and the private key: cp cert.pem cert && cp server-key.pem key Copy kubectl -n default create secret generic newrelic-infra-etcd-tls-secret --from-file=./cert --from-file=./key --from-file=./cacert Copy To ease future installations Use the following commands to simultaneously create the CSR, retrieve the CA, generate the certificate by signing the CSR, and create the secret with all the required fields: cat <<EOF | cfssl genkey - | cfssljson -bare server && \\ kubectl cp $(kubectl get pods -l k8s-app=etcd-manager-main -n kube-system -o jsonpath=\"{.items[0].metadata.name}\"):/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd-manager/etcd-clients-ca.crt ./cacert -n kube-system && \\ kubectl cp $(kubectl get pods -l k8s-app=etcd-manager-main -n kube-system -o jsonpath=\"{.items[0].metadata.name}\"):/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd-manager/etcd-clients-ca.key ./cacert.key -n kube-system && \\ cp server-key.pem key && \\ cfssl sign -ca cacert -ca-key cacert.key server.csr | cfssljson -bare cert && \\ cp cert.pem cert && \\ kubectl -n default create secret generic newrelic-infra-etcd-tls-secret --from-file=./cert --from-file=./key --from-file=./cacert { \"hosts\": [ \"localhost\" ], \"CN\": \"newrelic-infra.pod.cluster.local\", \"key\": { \"algo\": \"ecdsa\", \"size\": 256 } } EOF Copy The last step is to update the configuration in the manifest and apply it. In the configuration section, there are two options related to ETCD mTLS: ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAME with the name of the secret that we just created. ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAMESPACE with the namespace that we used to create the secret. To complete the installation, add these variables to the container spec of the integration DaemonSet and apply the changes: - name: \"ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAME” value: \"newrelic-infra-etcd-tls-secret\" - name: \"ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAMESPACE\" value: \"default\" Copy Set up mTLS for ETCD in OpenShift Follow these instructions to set up mutual TLS authentication for ETCD in OpenShift 4.x: Export the ETCD client certificates from the cluster to an opaque secret. In a default managed OpenShift cluster, the secret is named kube-etcd-client-certs and it is stored in the openshift-monitoring namespace. kubectl get secret/kube-etcd-client-certs -n openshift-monitoring -o yaml > etcd-secret.yaml Copy Open the secret file and change the keys: Rename the certificate authority to cacert. Rename the client certificate to cert. Rename the client key to key. Optional: change the secret name and namespace to something meaningful. Remove these unnecessary keys in the metadata section: creationTimestamp resourceVersion selfLink uid Install the manifest with its new name and namespace: kubectl apply -f etcd-secret.yaml Copy Go to Update manifest configuration (the last step under Set up MTL from ETCD client) to configure the required environment variables.

      "body": "The easiest way to install the Kubernetes integration is to use our automated installer to generate a manifest. It bundles not just the integration DaemonSets, but also other New Relic Kubernetes configurations, like Kubernetes events, Prometheus OpenMetrics, and New Relic log monitoring. As a Kubernetes user, you might consider Auto-telemetry with Pixie for deeper insights into your Kubernetes clusters and workloads. No language agents required. Ready to get started? If you don't already have one, sign up for a New Relic account. It's free, forever! Use automated installer We encourage you to use our automated installer for servers, VMs, and unprivileged environments. The automated installer can provide you either a Helm command with the required values filled, or a plain manifest if you don't want to use Helm. It also features great customizability and full control over which features and dependencies are enabled. If you are installing our integration on a managed cloud, please take a look at these preliminary notes before proceeding. Before you start the install, make sure you have a New Relic account. It's free! No credit card required. If your New Relic account is in the EU region, choose the EU install option. Get an account Start the installer Eu guided install Or, for fully manual instructions for deploying our integration using Helm. Installs for managed services and platforms Before starting our automated installer, check out these notes for your managed services or platforms: Amazon EKS / EKS-Anywhere The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In Amazon EKS, master nodes are managed by Amazon and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. Before starting our automated installer to deploy the Kubernetes integration in Amazon EKS, make sure you are using the version of kubectl provided by AWS. Amazon EKS Fargate Installation on EKS Fargate clusters requires dedicated steps, which are detailed in our fargate installation docs. Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In GKE, master nodes are managed by Google and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. Before starting our automated installer to deploy the Kubernetes integration on GKE, ensure you have sufficient permissions: Go to console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam and find your username. Click edit. Ensure you have permissions to create Roles and ClusterRoles: If you are not sure, add the Kubernetes Engine Cluster Admin role. If you cannot edit your user role, ask the owner of the GCP project to give you the necessary permissions. OpenShift container platform To deploy the Kubernetes integration with OpenShift: Add the <>{'<release_name>'}</>-newrelic-infrastructure service account to your privileged Security Context Constraints: oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged \\ system:serviceaccount:<namespace>:<release_name>-newrelic-infrastructure Copy The default <>{'<release_name>'}</> provided by the installer is nri-bundle. Complete the steps in our automated installer. If you're using signed certificates, make sure they are properly configured by using the following variables in the DaemonSet portion of your manifest to set the .pem file: Copy name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_DIR value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_DIR name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_FILE value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_NAME YAML key path: `spec.template.spec.containers.name.env` Copy Save your changes. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In Azure Kubernetes Service, master nodes are managed by Azure and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. To deploy in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), complete the steps in our automated installer. Pivotal Container Service (PKS / VMware Tanzu) To deploy in PKS, we recommend that you use the automated installer, or you can follow the manual instructions provided in Install the Kubernetes integration using Helm. Upgrading our Kubernetes integration Our Kubernetes integration is under active development and we regularly release updates which include bug fixes, new features, and support for newer Kubernetes versions and cloud providers. We strongly recommend all our customers to regularly update the Kubernetes integration to get the best experience. Upgrading using the automated installer and Helm In order to update an installation that was deployed using Helm command provided by the automated installer, just go through the process and run the Helm command again. This will pull the new version of the chart and its dependencies and upgrade it to the latest version. Upgrading using the automated installer and plain manifests Tip We encourage you to deploy our integration using Helm, as it provides a cleaner upgrade path compared to using manifests directly. If custom manifests have been used instead of Helm, we encourage you to first remove the old installation using kubectl delete -f previous-manifest-file.yml, and then proceed through the guided installer again. This will generate an updated set of manifests that can be deployed using kubectl apply -f manifest-file.yml. We do not recommend applying a new version of the manifest file without removing the previous one first, since it might leave some leftover components in your cluster. Monitor services running on Kubernetes Tip We encourage you to deploy our integration using Helm, as it allows easier configuration on how to monitor services by just adding snippets to your values.yml file. After having installed our Kubernetes integration, you can start instrumenting the services than run in your cluster. To learn more about how to do this, please check our Monitor services running on Kubernetes page. Use your Kubernetes data To learn more about how to use your Kubernetes data, please head to our detailed Find and use your Kubernetes data pages.",

      "body": "New Relic provides Control Plane support for your Kubernetes integration, allowing you to monitor and collect metrics from your cluster's Control Plane components. That data can then be found in New Relic and used to create queries and charts. Features We monitor and collect metrics from the following control plane components: ETCD: leader information, resident memory size, number of OS threads, consensus proposals data, etc. For a list of supported metrics, see ETCD data. API server: rate of apiserver requests, breakdown of apiserver requests by HTTP method and response code, etc. For the complete list of supported metrics, see API server data. Scheduler: requested CPU/memory vs available on the node, tolerations to taints, any set affinity or anti-affinity, etc. For the complete list of supported metrics, see Scheduler data. Controller manager: resident memory size, number of OS threads created, goroutines currently existing, etc. For the complete list of supported metrics, see Controller manager data. Compatibility and requirements Control plane monitoring requires Kubernetes integration version 1.16.0 or higher. Control plane monitoring support is not enabled for managed clusters. This is because providers (EKS, GKE, AKS, etc.) abstract away the concept of master nodes and control plane components, so that access to them is limited or non-existent. External control planes are not supported. The unprivileged version of the Kubernetes integration does not support control plane monitoring. OpenShift 4.x uses control plane component metric endpoints that are different than the default. Discovery of master nodes and control plane components The Kubernetes integration relies on the kubeadm labeling conventions to discover the master nodes and the control plane components. This means that master nodes should be labeled with node-role.kubernetes.io/master=\"\" or kubernetes.io/role=\"master\". The control plane components should have either the k8s-app or the tier and component labels. Refer to the following table for accepted label combinations and values: Component Label Endpoint API server Kubeadm / Kops / ClusterAPI k8s-app=kube-apiserver tier=control-plane component=kube-apiserver OpenShift app=openshift-kube-apiserver apiserver=true localhost:443/metrics by default (can be configured) if the request fails falls back to localhost:8080/metrics ETCD Kubeadm / Kops / ClusterAPI k8s-app=etcd-manager-main tier=control-plane component=etcd OpenShift k8s-app=etcd localhost:4001/metrics Scheduler Kubeadm / Kops / ClusterAPI k8s-app=kube-scheduler tier=control-plane component=kube-scheduler OpenShift app=openshift-kube-scheduler scheduler=true localhost:10251/metrics Controller manager Kubeadm / Kops / ClusterAPI k8s-app=kube-controller-manager tier=control-plane component=kube-controller-manager​ OpenShift app=kube-controller-manager kube-controller-manager=true localhost:10252/metrics When the integration detects that it is running inside a master node, it tries to find which components are running on the node by looking for pods that match the labels listed in the table above. For every running component, the integration makes a request to its metrics endpoint. Configuration Control plane monitoring is automatic for agents running inside master nodes. The only component that requires an extra step to run is ETCD, because it uses mutual TLS authentication (mTLS) for client requests. The API Server can also be configured to be queried using the Secure Port. Important Control plane monitoring for OpenShift 4.x requires additional configuration. For more information, see the OpenShift 4.x Configuration section. ETCD In order to set mTLS for querying ETCD, there are two configuration options that need to be set: Option Value ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAME Name of a Kubernetes secret that contains the mTLS configuration. The secret should contain the following keys: cert: the certificate that identifies the client making the request. It should be signed by an ETCD trusted CA. key: the private key used to generate the client certificate. cacert: the root CA used to identify the ETCD server certificate. If the ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAME option is not set, ETCD metrics won't be fetched. For step by step instructions on how to create a certificate and sign it with the ETCD client CA, see Set up mTLS from the ETCD client CA. ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAMESPACE The namespace where the secret specified in the ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAME was created. If not set, the default namespace is used. API server By default, the API server metrics are queried using the localhost:8080 unsecured endpoint. If this port is disabled, you can also query these metrics over the secure port. To enable this, set the following configuration option in the Kubernetes integration manifest file: Option Value API_SERVER_ENDPOINT_URL The (secure) URL to query the metrics. The API server uses localhost:443 by default Ensure that the ClusterRole has been updated to the newest version found in the manifest Added in version 1.15.0 Important Note that the port can be different according to the secure port used by the API server. For example, in Minikube the API server secure port is 8443 and therefore API_SERVER_ENDPOINT_URL should be set to https://localhost:8443 OpenShift configuration Control plane components on OpenShift 4.x use endpoint URLs that require SSL and service account based authentication. Therefore, the default endpoint URLs can not be used. To configure control plane monitoring on OpenShift, uncomment the following environment variables in the customized manifest. URL values are pre-configured to the default base URLs for the control plane monitoring metrics endpoints in OpenShift 4.x. - name: \"SCHEDULER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10259 - name: \"ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:9979\" - name: \"CONTROLLER_MANAGER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10257\" - name: \"API_SERVER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:6443\" Copy Important Even though the custom ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL is defined, ETCD requires HTTPS and mTLS authentication to be configured. For more on configuring mTLS for ETCD in OpenShift, see Set up mTLS for ETCD in OpenShift. Important When installing through Helm openshift, specify the config to automatically include these endpoints. Setting openshift.enabled=true and openshift.version=\"4.x\" will include the secure endpoints and enable the /var/run/crio.sock runtime. Set up mTLS from the ETCD client CA The instructions below are based on the Kubernetes documentation. For more information, see Managing TLS certificates in a cluster. For OpenShift, see Set up mTLS for ETCD in OpenShift. To set up mTLS from the ETCD client CA: Download and install the tool cfssl, selecting the correct binaries for your OS from the list. Once installed, execute the following command: cat <<EOF | cfssl genkey - | cfssljson -bare server { \"hosts\": [ \"localhost\" ], \"CN\": \"newrelic-infra.pod.cluster.local\", \"key\": { \"algo\": \"ecdsa\", \"size\": 256 } } EOF Copy This command generates two files; server.csr containing the PEM encoded pkcs#10 certification request and server-key.pem containing the PEM encoded key to the certificate to be created. Use the generated certificate authority (CA) of ETCD to sign your CSR. Depending on your cluster configuration, you may already have this information. For default install configuration, download the CA certificate and the private key directly from ETCD with the following commands: kubectl cp $(kubectl get pods -l k8s-app=etcd-manager-main -n kube-system -o jsonpath=\"{.items[0].metadata.name}\"):/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd-manager/etcd-clients-ca.crt ./cacert -n kube-system kubectl cp $(kubectl get pods -l k8s-app=etcd-manager-main -n kube-system -o jsonpath=\"{.items[0].metadata.name}\"):/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd-manager/etcd-clients-ca.key ./cacert.key -n kube-system Copy Tip This requires that the etcd-manager-main pod has the label k8s-app=etcd-manager-main, which is a requirement for control plane monitoring . If your etc-manager-main pod is located in a different namespace, change the -n kube-system flags accordingly. With those files downloaded, use the following command to sign your CSRF: cfssl sign -ca cacert -ca-key cacert.key server.csr | cfssljson -bare cert Copy Create the secret that is used to retrieve the TLS config for making requests to ETC. We recommend renaming the certificate and the private key: cp cert.pem cert && cp server-key.pem key Copy kubectl -n default create secret generic newrelic-infra-etcd-tls-secret --from-file=./cert --from-file=./key --from-file=./cacert Copy To ease future installations Use the following commands to simultaneously create the CSR, retrieve the CA, generate the certificate by signing the CSR, and create the secret with all the required fields: cat <<EOF | cfssl genkey - | cfssljson -bare server && \\ kubectl cp $(kubectl get pods -l k8s-app=etcd-manager-main -n kube-system -o jsonpath=\"{.items[0].metadata.name}\"):/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd-manager/etcd-clients-ca.crt ./cacert -n kube-system && \\ kubectl cp $(kubectl get pods -l k8s-app=etcd-manager-main -n kube-system -o jsonpath=\"{.items[0].metadata.name}\"):/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd-manager/etcd-clients-ca.key ./cacert.key -n kube-system && \\ cp server-key.pem key && \\ cfssl sign -ca cacert -ca-key cacert.key server.csr | cfssljson -bare cert && \\ cp cert.pem cert && \\ kubectl -n default create secret generic newrelic-infra-etcd-tls-secret --from-file=./cert --from-file=./key --from-file=./cacert { \"hosts\": [ \"localhost\" ], \"CN\": \"newrelic-infra.pod.cluster.local\", \"key\": { \"algo\": \"ecdsa\", \"size\": 256 } } EOF Copy The last step is to update the configuration in the manifest and apply it. In the configuration section, there are two options related to ETCD mTLS: ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAME with the name of the secret that we just created. ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAMESPACE with the namespace that we used to create the secret. To complete the installation, add these variables to the container spec of the integration DaemonSet and apply the changes: - name: \"ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAME” value: \"newrelic-infra-etcd-tls-secret\" - name: \"ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAMESPACE\" value: \"default\" Copy Set up mTLS for ETCD in OpenShift Follow these instructions to set up mutual TLS authentication for ETCD in OpenShift 4.x: Export the ETCD client certificates from the cluster to an opaque secret. In a default managed OpenShift cluster, the secret is named kube-etcd-client-certs and it is stored in the openshift-monitoring namespace. kubectl get secret/kube-etcd-client-certs -n openshift-monitoring -o yaml > etcd-secret.yaml Copy Open the secret file and change the keys: Rename the certificate authority to cacert. Rename the client certificate to cert. Rename the client key to key. Optional: change the secret name and namespace to something meaningful. Remove these unnecessary keys in the metadata section: creationTimestamp resourceVersion selfLink uid Install the manifest with its new name and namespace: kubectl apply -f etcd-secret.yaml Copy Go to Update manifest configuration (the last step under Set up MTL from ETCD client) to configure the required environment variables.

      "body": "The easiest way to install the Kubernetes integration is to use our automated installer to generate a manifest. It bundles not just the integration DaemonSets, but also other New Relic Kubernetes configurations, like Kubernetes events, Prometheus OpenMetrics, and New Relic log monitoring. As a Kubernetes user, you might consider Auto-telemetry with Pixie for deeper insights into your Kubernetes clusters and workloads. No language agents required. Ready to get started? If you don't already have one, sign up for a New Relic account. It's free, forever! Use automated installer We encourage you to use our automated installer for servers, VMs, and unprivileged environments. The automated installer can provide you either a Helm command with the required values filled, or a plain manifest if you don't want to use Helm. It also features great customizability and full control over which features and dependencies are enabled. If you are installing our integration on a managed cloud, please take a look at these preliminary notes before proceeding. Before you start the install, make sure you have a New Relic account. It's free! No credit card required. If your New Relic account is in the EU region, choose the EU install option. Get an account Start the installer Eu guided install Or, for fully manual instructions for deploying our integration using Helm. Installs for managed services and platforms Before starting our automated installer, check out these notes for your managed services or platforms: Amazon EKS / EKS-Anywhere The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In Amazon EKS, master nodes are managed by Amazon and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. Before starting our automated installer to deploy the Kubernetes integration in Amazon EKS, make sure you are using the version of kubectl provided by AWS. Amazon EKS Fargate Installation on EKS Fargate clusters requires dedicated steps, which are detailed in our fargate installation docs. Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In GKE, master nodes are managed by Google and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. Before starting our automated installer to deploy the Kubernetes integration on GKE, ensure you have sufficient permissions: Go to console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam and find your username. Click edit. Ensure you have permissions to create Roles and ClusterRoles: If you are not sure, add the Kubernetes Engine Cluster Admin role. If you cannot edit your user role, ask the owner of the GCP project to give you the necessary permissions. OpenShift container platform To deploy the Kubernetes integration with OpenShift: Add the <>{'<release_name>'}</>-newrelic-infrastructure service account to your privileged Security Context Constraints: oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged \\ system:serviceaccount:<namespace>:<release_name>-newrelic-infrastructure Copy The default <>{'<release_name>'}</> provided by the installer is nri-bundle. Complete the steps in our automated installer. If you're using signed certificates, make sure they are properly configured by using the following variables in the DaemonSet portion of your manifest to set the .pem file: Copy name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_DIR value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_DIR name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_FILE value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_NAME YAML key path: `spec.template.spec.containers.name.env` Copy Save your changes. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In Azure Kubernetes Service, master nodes are managed by Azure and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. To deploy in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), complete the steps in our automated installer. Pivotal Container Service (PKS / VMware Tanzu) To deploy in PKS, we recommend that you use the automated installer, or you can follow the manual instructions provided in Install the Kubernetes integration using Helm. Upgrading our Kubernetes integration Our Kubernetes integration is under active development and we regularly release updates which include bug fixes, new features, and support for newer Kubernetes versions and cloud providers. We strongly recommend all our customers to regularly update the Kubernetes integration to get the best experience. Upgrading using the automated installer and Helm In order to update an installation that was deployed using Helm command provided by the automated installer, just go through the process and run the Helm command again. This will pull the new version of the chart and its dependencies and upgrade it to the latest version. Upgrading using the automated installer and plain manifests Tip We encourage you to deploy our integration using Helm, as it provides a cleaner upgrade path compared to using manifests directly. If custom manifests have been used instead of Helm, we encourage you to first remove the old installation using kubectl delete -f previous-manifest-file.yml, and then proceed through the guided installer again. This will generate an updated set of manifests that can be deployed using kubectl apply -f manifest-file.yml. We do not recommend applying a new version of the manifest file without removing the previous one first, since it might leave some leftover components in your cluster. Monitor services running on Kubernetes Tip We encourage you to deploy our integration using Helm, as it allows easier configuration on how to monitor services by just adding snippets to your values.yml file. After having installed our Kubernetes integration, you can start instrumenting the services than run in your cluster. To learn more about how to do this, please check our Monitor services running on Kubernetes page. Use your Kubernetes data To learn more about how to use your Kubernetes data, please head to our detailed Find and use your Kubernetes data pages.",

      "body": "New Relic provides Control Plane support for your Kubernetes integration, allowing you to monitor and collect metrics from your cluster's Control Plane components. That data can then be found in New Relic and used to create queries and charts. Features We monitor and collect metrics from the following control plane components: ETCD: leader information, resident memory size, number of OS threads, consensus proposals data, etc. For a list of supported metrics, see ETCD data. API server: rate of apiserver requests, breakdown of apiserver requests by HTTP method and response code, etc. For the complete list of supported metrics, see API server data. Scheduler: requested CPU/memory vs available on the node, tolerations to taints, any set affinity or anti-affinity, etc. For the complete list of supported metrics, see Scheduler data. Controller manager: resident memory size, number of OS threads created, goroutines currently existing, etc. For the complete list of supported metrics, see Controller manager data. Compatibility and requirements Control plane monitoring requires Kubernetes integration version 1.16.0 or higher. Control plane monitoring support is not enabled for managed clusters. This is because providers (EKS, GKE, AKS, etc.) abstract away the concept of master nodes and control plane components, so that access to them is limited or non-existent. External control planes are not supported. The unprivileged version of the Kubernetes integration does not support control plane monitoring. OpenShift 4.x uses control plane component metric endpoints that are different than the default. Discovery of master nodes and control plane components The Kubernetes integration relies on the kubeadm labeling conventions to discover the master nodes and the control plane components. This means that master nodes should be labeled with node-role.kubernetes.io/master=\"\" or kubernetes.io/role=\"master\". The control plane components should have either the k8s-app or the tier and component labels. Refer to the following table for accepted label combinations and values: Component Label Endpoint API server Kubeadm / Kops / ClusterAPI k8s-app=kube-apiserver tier=control-plane component=kube-apiserver OpenShift app=openshift-kube-apiserver apiserver=true localhost:443/metrics by default (can be configured) if the request fails falls back to localhost:8080/metrics ETCD Kubeadm / Kops / ClusterAPI k8s-app=etcd-manager-main tier=control-plane component=etcd OpenShift k8s-app=etcd localhost:4001/metrics Scheduler Kubeadm / Kops / ClusterAPI k8s-app=kube-scheduler tier=control-plane component=kube-scheduler OpenShift app=openshift-kube-scheduler scheduler=true localhost:10251/metrics Controller manager Kubeadm / Kops / ClusterAPI k8s-app=kube-controller-manager tier=control-plane component=kube-controller-manager​ OpenShift app=kube-controller-manager kube-controller-manager=true localhost:10252/metrics When the integration detects that it is running inside a master node, it tries to find which components are running on the node by looking for pods that match the labels listed in the table above. For every running component, the integration makes a request to its metrics endpoint. Configuration Control plane monitoring is automatic for agents running inside master nodes. The only component that requires an extra step to run is ETCD, because it uses mutual TLS authentication (mTLS) for client requests. The API Server can also be configured to be queried using the Secure Port. Important Control plane monitoring for OpenShift 4.x requires additional configuration. For more information, see the OpenShift 4.x Configuration section. ETCD In order to set mTLS for querying ETCD, there are two configuration options that need to be set: Option Value ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAME Name of a Kubernetes secret that contains the mTLS configuration. The secret should contain the following keys: cert: the certificate that identifies the client making the request. It should be signed by an ETCD trusted CA. key: the private key used to generate the client certificate. cacert: the root CA used to identify the ETCD server certificate. If the ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAME option is not set, ETCD metrics won't be fetched. For step by step instructions on how to create a certificate and sign it with the ETCD client CA, see Set up mTLS from the ETCD client CA. ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAMESPACE The namespace where the secret specified in the ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAME was created. If not set, the default namespace is used. API server By default, the API server metrics are queried using the localhost:8080 unsecured endpoint. If this port is disabled, you can also query these metrics over the secure port. To enable this, set the following configuration option in the Kubernetes integration manifest file: Option Value API_SERVER_ENDPOINT_URL The (secure) URL to query the metrics. The API server uses localhost:443 by default Ensure that the ClusterRole has been updated to the newest version found in the manifest Added in version 1.15.0 Important Note that the port can be different according to the secure port used by the API server. For example, in Minikube the API server secure port is 8443 and therefore API_SERVER_ENDPOINT_URL should be set to https://localhost:8443 OpenShift configuration Control plane components on OpenShift 4.x use endpoint URLs that require SSL and service account based authentication. Therefore, the default endpoint URLs can not be used. To configure control plane monitoring on OpenShift, uncomment the following environment variables in the customized manifest. URL values are pre-configured to the default base URLs for the control plane monitoring metrics endpoints in OpenShift 4.x. - name: \"SCHEDULER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10259 - name: \"ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:9979\" - name: \"CONTROLLER_MANAGER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10257\" - name: \"API_SERVER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:6443\" Copy Important Even though the custom ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL is defined, ETCD requires HTTPS and mTLS authentication to be configured. For more on configuring mTLS for ETCD in OpenShift, see Set up mTLS for ETCD in OpenShift. Important When installing through Helm openshift, specify the config to automatically include these endpoints. Setting openshift.enabled=true and openshift.version=\"4.x\" will include the secure endpoints and enable the /var/run/crio.sock runtime. Set up mTLS from the ETCD client CA The instructions below are based on the Kubernetes documentation. For more information, see Managing TLS certificates in a cluster. For OpenShift, see Set up mTLS for ETCD in OpenShift. To set up mTLS from the ETCD client CA: Download and install the tool cfssl, selecting the correct binaries for your OS from the list. Once installed, execute the following command: cat <<EOF | cfssl genkey - | cfssljson -bare server { \"hosts\": [ \"localhost\" ], \"CN\": \"newrelic-infra.pod.cluster.local\", \"key\": { \"algo\": \"ecdsa\", \"size\": 256 } } EOF Copy This command generates two files; server.csr containing the PEM encoded pkcs#10 certification request and server-key.pem containing the PEM encoded key to the certificate to be created. Use the generated certificate authority (CA) of ETCD to sign your CSR. Depending on your cluster configuration, you may already have this information. For default install configuration, download the CA certificate and the private key directly from ETCD with the following commands: kubectl cp $(kubectl get pods -l k8s-app=etcd-manager-main -n kube-system -o jsonpath=\"{.items[0].metadata.name}\"):/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd-manager/etcd-clients-ca.crt ./cacert -n kube-system kubectl cp $(kubectl get pods -l k8s-app=etcd-manager-main -n kube-system -o jsonpath=\"{.items[0].metadata.name}\"):/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd-manager/etcd-clients-ca.key ./cacert.key -n kube-system Copy Tip This requires that the etcd-manager-main pod has the label k8s-app=etcd-manager-main, which is a requirement for control plane monitoring . If your etc-manager-main pod is located in a different namespace, change the -n kube-system flags accordingly. With those files downloaded, use the following command to sign your CSRF: cfssl sign -ca cacert -ca-key cacert.key server.csr | cfssljson -bare cert Copy Create the secret that is used to retrieve the TLS config for making requests to ETC. We recommend renaming the certificate and the private key: cp cert.pem cert && cp server-key.pem key Copy kubectl -n default create secret generic newrelic-infra-etcd-tls-secret --from-file=./cert --from-file=./key --from-file=./cacert Copy To ease future installations Use the following commands to simultaneously create the CSR, retrieve the CA, generate the certificate by signing the CSR, and create the secret with all the required fields: cat <<EOF | cfssl genkey - | cfssljson -bare server && \\ kubectl cp $(kubectl get pods -l k8s-app=etcd-manager-main -n kube-system -o jsonpath=\"{.items[0].metadata.name}\"):/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd-manager/etcd-clients-ca.crt ./cacert -n kube-system && \\ kubectl cp $(kubectl get pods -l k8s-app=etcd-manager-main -n kube-system -o jsonpath=\"{.items[0].metadata.name}\"):/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd-manager/etcd-clients-ca.key ./cacert.key -n kube-system && \\ cp server-key.pem key && \\ cfssl sign -ca cacert -ca-key cacert.key server.csr | cfssljson -bare cert && \\ cp cert.pem cert && \\ kubectl -n default create secret generic newrelic-infra-etcd-tls-secret --from-file=./cert --from-file=./key --from-file=./cacert { \"hosts\": [ \"localhost\" ], \"CN\": \"newrelic-infra.pod.cluster.local\", \"key\": { \"algo\": \"ecdsa\", \"size\": 256 } } EOF Copy The last step is to update the configuration in the manifest and apply it. In the configuration section, there are two options related to ETCD mTLS: ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAME with the name of the secret that we just created. ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAMESPACE with the namespace that we used to create the secret. To complete the installation, add these variables to the container spec of the integration DaemonSet and apply the changes: - name: \"ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAME” value: \"newrelic-infra-etcd-tls-secret\" - name: \"ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAMESPACE\" value: \"default\" Copy Set up mTLS for ETCD in OpenShift Follow these instructions to set up mutual TLS authentication for ETCD in OpenShift 4.x: Export the ETCD client certificates from the cluster to an opaque secret. In a default managed OpenShift cluster, the secret is named kube-etcd-client-certs and it is stored in the openshift-monitoring namespace. kubectl get secret/kube-etcd-client-certs -n openshift-monitoring -o yaml > etcd-secret.yaml Copy Open the secret file and change the keys: Rename the certificate authority to cacert. Rename the client certificate to cert. Rename the client key to key. Optional: change the secret name and namespace to something meaningful. Remove these unnecessary keys in the metadata section: creationTimestamp resourceVersion selfLink uid Install the manifest with its new name and namespace: kubectl apply -f etcd-secret.yaml Copy Go to Update manifest configuration (the last step under Set up MTL from ETCD client) to configure the required environment variables.

The configuration option is passed down to the dependency newrelic-infrastructure modifying the values.yaml of nri-bundle: newrelic-infrastructure.config.proxy: https://user:password@hostname:port Copy Installing with manifest: When installing through the manifest, the proxy can be configured adding the NRIA_PROXY environment variable to the environment variable section of the DaemonSet configuration. The environment variable NRIA_VERBOSE in the DaemonSet YAML can be used as an example of the environment variable configuration. Set logging with a proxy If you’re using log forwarding for the Kubernetes integration, the plugin automatically detects the HTTP_PROXY and HTTPS_PROXY environment variables, and automatically uses them to set up the proxy configuration. For more information, see how to customize the proxy, or bypass it. Install Kubernetes events with a proxy There are three options to install the Kubernetes events integration with a proxy: Installing with chart nri-kube-events: The proxy can be configured setting the configuration option proxy in the values.yaml file. If set, the variable NRIA_PROXY will be added into the deployment.yaml template. Installing with chart nri-bundle as a dependency: The proxy can be configured setting the configuration option nri-kube-events.proxy. The configuration option is passed down to the dependency nri-kube-events modifying the values.yaml of nri-bundle: nri-kube-events.proxy: https://user:password@hostname:port Copy Installing with manifest: When installing through the manifest, to configure the proxy set the NRIA_PROXY in the environment variable section of the infra container. Check the deployment template of the chart as an example of environment variable configuration. Install the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration with a proxy There are three options to install the Prometheus OpenMetric integration with a proxy: Installing with charts nri-prometheus: The proxy can be configured setting the configuration option config.emitter_proxy in the values.yaml.

      "body": "Helm is a package manager on top of Kubernetes. It facilitates installation, upgrades, or revision tracking, and it manages dependencies for the services that you install in Kubernetes. To install the integration using Helm, we recommend our Kubernetes automated installer, which will prompt for almost all configuration options and autopopulate secrets and values for you. Additionally, our automated installer also allows to install our integration as plain manifests rather than a Helm release. See Kubernetes integration: install and configure for more details about how to use our automated installer. Start the installer This page describes in more depth how to install and configure the New Relic integration without using the automated installer. Compatibility and requirements Make sure Helm is installed on your machine. We strongly recommend using Helm 3 to manage the Kubernetes integration. Our charts are also compatible with Helm 2, but support for it might be removed in the future. To install the Kubernetes integration using Helm, you will need your New Relic account license key and your Kubernetes cluster's name: Find and copy your New Relic license key. Find the name of your cluster with this command: kubectl config current-context Copy Note this values somewhere safe as you will need them later during the installation process. Install Kubernetes integration with Helm Install with Helm 3 and nri-bundle (recommended) New Relic has several charts for the different components which offer different features for the platform: newrelic-infrastructure: Contains the main Kubernetes integration and the infrastructure agent. This is the core component for the New Relic Kubernetes experience, responsible of reporting most of the data that is surfaced in dashboard and the Kubernetes Cluster Explorer. newrelic-logging: Provides a DaemonSet with New Relic's Fluent Bit output plugin to easily forward your logs to New Relic. nri-kube-events: Collects and reports cluster events (such as kubectl get events) to New Relic. nri-prometheus: New Relic's Prometheus OpenMetrics Integration, automatically scrapes Prometheus endpoints present in the cluser and reports metrics to New Relic. nri-metadata-injection: Sets up a minimal MutatingAdmissionWebhook that injects a couple of environment to containers. These contain metadata about the cluster and New Relic installation and will be later picked up by applications instrumented using APM, allowing to correlate APM and infrastructure data. nri-statsd: New Relic StatsD integration. Additionally, New Relic provides nri-bundle, a chart which pulls a selectable set of the charts mentioned above. nri-bundle can also install Kube State Metrics and Pixie for you if needed. While it is possible to install those charts separately, we strongly recommend using the nri-bundle chart for Kubernetes deployments, as it ensures that values across all the charts are consistent and provides full control over which components are installed, as well as the possibility to configure all of them as Helm dependencies. This is the same chart that is used and referenced by our automated installer. Installing and configuring nri-bundle with Helm Ensure you are using the appropriate context in the machine where you will run Helm and kubectl: You can check the available contexts with: kubectl config get-contexts Copy And switch to the desired context using: kubectl config use-context CONTEXT_NAME Copy Add the New Relic Helm charts repo: helm repo add newrelic https://helm-charts.newrelic.com Copy Make sure everything is configured properly in the chart by running the following command. Notice that we are specifying --dry-run and --debug, so nothing will be installed in this step: helm upgrade --install newrelic newrelic/nri-bundle \\ --dry-run \\ --debug \\ --namespace newrelic --create-namespace \\ --set global.licenseKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY \\ --set global.cluster=K8S_CLUSTER_NAME \\ --set ksm.enabled= true \\ --set newrelic-infrastructure.privileged= true \\ --set infrastructure.enabled=true \\ --set prometheus.enabled=true \\ --set webhook.enabled=true \\ --set kubeEvents.enabled=true \\ --set logging.enabled=true Copy Please notice and adjust the following flags: global.licenseKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY: Must be set to a valid License Key for your account. global.cluster=K8S_CLUSTER_NAME: Is used to identify the cluster in the New Relic UI, so should be a descriptive value not used by any other Kubernetes cluster configured in your New Relic account. ksm.enabled=true: Setting this to true will automatically install Kube State Metrics (KSM) for you, which is required for our integration to run. You can set this to false if KSM is already present in your cluster, even if it is on a different namespace. newrelic-infrastructure.privileged=true: Can be set to false to install a trimmed down version of our integration that does not require extra privileges, such as hostPath mounts or running containers as root. Please note that this will disable detailed process collection from the host. For performance reasons, our logging solution still requires hostPath mounts, regardless of the value of this flag. If this is not allowedin your cluster, you will need to disable the logging solution by specifying logging.enabled=false. prometheus.enabled=true: Will deploy our Prometheus OpenMetrics integration, which automatically collects data from prometheus endpoints present in the cluster. webhook.enabled=true: Will install our minimal webhook, which adds environment variables that, in turn, allows linking applications instrumented with APM with infrastructure data. Our chart has a comprehensive set of flags and tunables that can be edited to configure our solution to your particular needs. For a full list of all the flags that can be configured, please check the chart's README and the default values.yaml file. Install the Kubernetes integration by running the customized command without --debug and --dry-run: helm upgrade --install newrelic newrelic/nri-bundle \\ --namespace newrelic --create-namespace \\ --set global.licenseKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY \\ --set global.cluster=K8S_CLUSTER_NAME \\ --set ksm.enabled= true \\ --set newrelic-infrastructure.privileged= true \\ --set infrastructure.enabled=true \\ --set prometheus.enabled=true \\ --set webhook.enabled=true \\ --set kubeEvents.enabled=true \\ --set logging.enabled=true Copy Wait a few seconds, then check that the DaemonSet and pods have been created: kubectl -n newrelic get daemonsets,pods Copy Make sure you see a DaemonSet, and one pod per node for newrelic-infrastructure, as well as one Deployment and one pod for any other component that you have enabled. Install with Helm 2 and nri-bundle (legacy) Installation instructions for Helm 2 Important Helm 2 has been deprecated and New Relic does not recommend using it for deployments. Instructions in this section are provided for legacy systems only. To install using Helm 2: Ensure that Helm 2, including their cluster-side components (such as Tiller) are properly installed and configured. Please check the official documentation for more details. Set the cluster where you want to install the agent: kubectl config set-cluster DESIRED_CLUSTER Copy To see the available clusters, run kubectl config get-clusters Make sure that kube-state-metrics is installed on your machine: kubectl get deployment --all-namespaces | grep kube-state-metrics Copy If it's not installed, follow the instructions in the kube-state-metrics GitHub repo to install it. Add the New Relic Helm charts repo: helm repo add newrelic https://helm-charts.newrelic.com Copy Make sure everything is configured properly in the chart by running the following command. This step uses the --dry-run and --debug switches and therefore the agent is not installed. helm install newrelic/newrelic-infrastructure \\ --dry-run \\ --debug \\ --set licenseKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY \\ --set cluster=K8S_CLUSTER_NAME \\ --set config.custom_attributes.cluster=K8S_CLUSTER_NAME Copy Install the New Relic Kubernetes integration: helm install newrelic/newrelic-infrastructure \\ --set licenseKey=your_new_relic_license_key \\ --set cluster=K8S_CLUSTER_NAME \\ --set config.custom_attributes.cluster=K8S_CLUSTER_NAME Copy Tip Note that the --dry-run and --debug switches have been removed. Wait a few seconds, then check that the DaemonSet and pods have been created: kubectl get daemonsets,pods Copy Make sure you see a DaemonSet, and one pod per node. Helm configuration options When you install or upgrade the Kubernetes integration with Helm using the command line, you can pass your configuration variables with the --set flag. helm install newrelic/newrelic-infrastructure \\ --set licenseKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY \\ --set cluster=YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME Copy A full list of the configuration parameters can be found in the newrelic-infrastructure chart README Upgrade using Helm To update your Kubernetes integration installed via Helm: Update the local chart repository: helm repo update Copy Update the release by running again the appropriate helm upgrade --install ... command in the section above. Monitor services running on Kubernetes After having installed our Kubernetes integration, you can start instrumenting the services than run in your cluster. To learn more about how to do this, please check our Monitor services running on Kubernetes page. Use your Kubernetes data To learn more about how to use your Kubernetes data, please head to our detailed Find and use your Kubernetes data pages. Reduce data ingest Our charts support setting an option to reduce the amount of data ingest at the cost of dropping detailed information. To enable it, set global.lowDataMode=true in the nri-bundle chart. lowDataMode affects three specific components of the nri-bundle chart outlined below. Prometheus OpenMetrics Integration If lowDataMode is enabled, the following metrics are excluded by default as they are already collected and used by the New Relic Kubernetes Integration. - kube_ - container_ - machine_ - cadvisor_ Copy New Relic Logging If lowDataMode is enabled, Labels and Annotations are set to Off in the Filter section of the fluent-bit.conf file. This means that this detail will be dropped from the container log files which reduces the overall data ingest into New Relic. The following fields are retained: Allowlist_key container_name Allowlist_key namespace_name Allowlist_key pod_name Allowlist_key stream Allowlist_key log Copy Low Data Mode Log Example Complete Log Record [ { \"cluster_name\": \"api-test\", \"kubernetes\": { \"annotations\": { \"kubernetes.io/psp\": \"eks.privileged\" }, \"container_hash\": \"fryckbos/test@sha256:5b098eaf3c7d5b3585eb10cebee63665b6208bea31ef31a3f0856c5ffdda644b\", \"container_image\": \"fryckbos/test:latest\", \"container_name\": \"newrelic-logging\", \"docker_id\": \"134e1daf63761baa15e035b08b7aea04518a0f0e50af4215131a50c6a379a072\", \"host\": \"ip-192-168-17-123.ec2.internal\", \"labels\": { \"app\": \"newrelic-logging\", \"app.kubernetes.io/name\": \"newrelic-logging\", \"controller-revision-hash\": \"84db95db86\", \"pod-template-generation\": \"1\", \"release\": \"nri-bundle\" }, \"namespace_name\": \"nrlogs\", \"pod_id\": \"54556e3e-719c-46b5-af69-020b75d69bf1\", \"pod_name\": \"nri-bundle-newrelic-logging-jxnbj\" }, \"message\": \"[2021/09/14 12:30:49] [ info] [engine] started (pid=1)\\n\", \"plugin\": { \"source\": \"kubernetes\", \"type\": \"fluent-bit\", \"version\": \"1.8.1\" }, \"stream\": \"stderr\", \"time\": \"2021-09-14T12:30:49.138824971Z\", \"timestamp\": 1631622649138 } ] Copy Log Record after enabling lowDataMode.

      "body": "New Relic provides Control Plane support for your Kubernetes integration, allowing you to monitor and collect metrics from your cluster's Control Plane components. That data can then be found in New Relic and used to create queries and charts. Features We monitor and collect metrics from the following control plane components: ETCD: leader information, resident memory size, number of OS threads, consensus proposals data, etc. For a list of supported metrics, see ETCD data. API server: rate of apiserver requests, breakdown of apiserver requests by HTTP method and response code, etc. For the complete list of supported metrics, see API server data. Scheduler: requested CPU/memory vs available on the node, tolerations to taints, any set affinity or anti-affinity, etc. For the complete list of supported metrics, see Scheduler data. Controller manager: resident memory size, number of OS threads created, goroutines currently existing, etc. For the complete list of supported metrics, see Controller manager data. Compatibility and requirements Control plane monitoring requires Kubernetes integration version 1.16.0 or higher. Control plane monitoring support is not enabled for managed clusters. This is because providers (EKS, GKE, AKS, etc.) abstract away the concept of master nodes and control plane components, so that access to them is limited or non-existent. External control planes are not supported. The unprivileged version of the Kubernetes integration does not support control plane monitoring. OpenShift 4.x uses control plane component metric endpoints that are different than the default. Discovery of master nodes and control plane components The Kubernetes integration relies on the kubeadm labeling conventions to discover the master nodes and the control plane components. This means that master nodes should be labeled with node-role.kubernetes.io/master=\"\" or kubernetes.io/role=\"master\". The control plane components should have either the k8s-app or the tier and component labels. Refer to the following table for accepted label combinations and values: Component Label Endpoint API server Kubeadm / Kops / ClusterAPI k8s-app=kube-apiserver tier=control-plane component=kube-apiserver OpenShift app=openshift-kube-apiserver apiserver=true localhost:443/metrics by default (can be configured) if the request fails falls back to localhost:8080/metrics ETCD Kubeadm / Kops / ClusterAPI k8s-app=etcd-manager-main tier=control-plane component=etcd OpenShift k8s-app=etcd localhost:4001/metrics Scheduler Kubeadm / Kops / ClusterAPI k8s-app=kube-scheduler tier=control-plane component=kube-scheduler OpenShift app=openshift-kube-scheduler scheduler=true localhost:10251/metrics Controller manager Kubeadm / Kops / ClusterAPI k8s-app=kube-controller-manager tier=control-plane component=kube-controller-manager​ OpenShift app=kube-controller-manager kube-controller-manager=true localhost:10252/metrics When the integration detects that it is running inside a master node, it tries to find which components are running on the node by looking for pods that match the labels listed in the table above. For every running component, the integration makes a request to its metrics endpoint. Configuration Control plane monitoring is automatic for agents running inside master nodes. The only component that requires an extra step to run is ETCD, because it uses mutual TLS authentication (mTLS) for client requests. The API Server can also be configured to be queried using the Secure Port. Important Control plane monitoring for OpenShift 4.x requires additional configuration. For more information, see the OpenShift 4.x Configuration section. ETCD In order to set mTLS for querying ETCD, there are two configuration options that need to be set: Option Value ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAME Name of a Kubernetes secret that contains the mTLS configuration. The secret should contain the following keys: cert: the certificate that identifies the client making the request. It should be signed by an ETCD trusted CA. key: the private key used to generate the client certificate. cacert: the root CA used to identify the ETCD server certificate. If the ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAME option is not set, ETCD metrics won't be fetched. For step by step instructions on how to create a certificate and sign it with the ETCD client CA, see Set up mTLS from the ETCD client CA. ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAMESPACE The namespace where the secret specified in the ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAME was created. If not set, the default namespace is used. API server By default, the API server metrics are queried using the localhost:8080 unsecured endpoint. If this port is disabled, you can also query these metrics over the secure port. To enable this, set the following configuration option in the Kubernetes integration manifest file: Option Value API_SERVER_ENDPOINT_URL The (secure) URL to query the metrics. The API server uses localhost:443 by default Ensure that the ClusterRole has been updated to the newest version found in the manifest Added in version 1.15.0 Important Note that the port can be different according to the secure port used by the API server. For example, in Minikube the API server secure port is 8443 and therefore API_SERVER_ENDPOINT_URL should be set to https://localhost:8443 OpenShift configuration Control plane components on OpenShift 4.x use endpoint URLs that require SSL and service account based authentication. Therefore, the default endpoint URLs can not be used. To configure control plane monitoring on OpenShift, uncomment the following environment variables in the customized manifest. URL values are pre-configured to the default base URLs for the control plane monitoring metrics endpoints in OpenShift 4.x. - name: \"SCHEDULER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10259 - name: \"ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:9979\" - name: \"CONTROLLER_MANAGER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10257\" - name: \"API_SERVER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:6443\" Copy Important Even though the custom ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL is defined, ETCD requires HTTPS and mTLS authentication to be configured. For more on configuring mTLS for ETCD in OpenShift, see Set up mTLS for ETCD in OpenShift. Important When installing through Helm openshift, specify the config to automatically include these endpoints. Setting openshift.enabled=true and openshift.version=\"4.x\" will include the secure endpoints and enable the /var/run/crio.sock runtime. Set up mTLS from the ETCD client CA The instructions below are based on the Kubernetes documentation. For more information, see Managing TLS certificates in a cluster. For OpenShift, see Set up mTLS for ETCD in OpenShift. To set up mTLS from the ETCD client CA: Download and install the tool cfssl, selecting the correct binaries for your OS from the list. Once installed, execute the following command: cat <<EOF | cfssl genkey - | cfssljson -bare server { \"hosts\": [ \"localhost\" ], \"CN\": \"newrelic-infra.pod.cluster.local\", \"key\": { \"algo\": \"ecdsa\", \"size\": 256 } } EOF Copy This command generates two files; server.csr containing the PEM encoded pkcs#10 certification request and server-key.pem containing the PEM encoded key to the certificate to be created. Use the generated certificate authority (CA) of ETCD to sign your CSR. Depending on your cluster configuration, you may already have this information. For default install configuration, download the CA certificate and the private key directly from ETCD with the following commands: kubectl cp $(kubectl get pods -l k8s-app=etcd-manager-main -n kube-system -o jsonpath=\"{.items[0].metadata.name}\"):/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd-manager/etcd-clients-ca.crt ./cacert -n kube-system kubectl cp $(kubectl get pods -l k8s-app=etcd-manager-main -n kube-system -o jsonpath=\"{.items[0].metadata.name}\"):/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd-manager/etcd-clients-ca.key ./cacert.key -n kube-system Copy Tip This requires that the etcd-manager-main pod has the label k8s-app=etcd-manager-main, which is a requirement for control plane monitoring . If your etc-manager-main pod is located in a different namespace, change the -n kube-system flags accordingly. With those files downloaded, use the following command to sign your CSRF: cfssl sign -ca cacert -ca-key cacert.key server.csr | cfssljson -bare cert Copy Create the secret that is used to retrieve the TLS config for making requests to ETC. We recommend renaming the certificate and the private key: cp cert.pem cert && cp server-key.pem key Copy kubectl -n default create secret generic newrelic-infra-etcd-tls-secret --from-file=./cert --from-file=./key --from-file=./cacert Copy To ease future installations Use the following commands to simultaneously create the CSR, retrieve the CA, generate the certificate by signing the CSR, and create the secret with all the required fields: cat <<EOF | cfssl genkey - | cfssljson -bare server && \\ kubectl cp $(kubectl get pods -l k8s-app=etcd-manager-main -n kube-system -o jsonpath=\"{.items[0].metadata.name}\"):/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd-manager/etcd-clients-ca.crt ./cacert -n kube-system && \\ kubectl cp $(kubectl get pods -l k8s-app=etcd-manager-main -n kube-system -o jsonpath=\"{.items[0].metadata.name}\"):/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd-manager/etcd-clients-ca.key ./cacert.key -n kube-system && \\ cp server-key.pem key && \\ cfssl sign -ca cacert -ca-key cacert.key server.csr | cfssljson -bare cert && \\ cp cert.pem cert && \\ kubectl -n default create secret generic newrelic-infra-etcd-tls-secret --from-file=./cert --from-file=./key --from-file=./cacert { \"hosts\": [ \"localhost\" ], \"CN\": \"newrelic-infra.pod.cluster.local\", \"key\": { \"algo\": \"ecdsa\", \"size\": 256 } } EOF Copy The last step is to update the configuration in the manifest and apply it. In the configuration section, there are two options related to ETCD mTLS: ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAME with the name of the secret that we just created. ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAMESPACE with the namespace that we used to create the secret. To complete the installation, add these variables to the container spec of the integration DaemonSet and apply the changes: - name: \"ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAME” value: \"newrelic-infra-etcd-tls-secret\" - name: \"ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAMESPACE\" value: \"default\" Copy Set up mTLS for ETCD in OpenShift Follow these instructions to set up mutual TLS authentication for ETCD in OpenShift 4.x: Export the ETCD client certificates from the cluster to an opaque secret. In a default managed OpenShift cluster, the secret is named kube-etcd-client-certs and it is stored in the openshift-monitoring namespace. kubectl get secret/kube-etcd-client-certs -n openshift-monitoring -o yaml > etcd-secret.yaml Copy Open the secret file and change the keys: Rename the certificate authority to cacert. Rename the client certificate to cert. Rename the client key to key. Optional: change the secret name and namespace to something meaningful. Remove these unnecessary keys in the metadata section: creationTimestamp resourceVersion selfLink uid Install the manifest with its new name and namespace: kubectl apply -f etcd-secret.yaml Copy Go to Update manifest configuration (the last step under Set up MTL from ETCD client) to configure the required environment variables.

      "body": "The easiest way to install the Kubernetes integration is to use our automated installer to generate a manifest. It bundles not just the integration DaemonSets, but also other New Relic Kubernetes configurations, like Kubernetes events, Prometheus OpenMetrics, and New Relic log monitoring. As a Kubernetes user, you might consider Auto-telemetry with Pixie for deeper insights into your Kubernetes clusters and workloads. No language agents required. Ready to get started? If you don't already have one, sign up for a New Relic account. It's free, forever! Use automated installer We encourage you to use our automated installer for servers, VMs, and unprivileged environments. The automated installer can provide you either a Helm command with the required values filled, or a plain manifest if you don't want to use Helm. It also features great customizability and full control over which features and dependencies are enabled. If you are installing our integration on a managed cloud, please take a look at these preliminary notes before proceeding. Before you start the install, make sure you have a New Relic account. It's free! No credit card required. If your New Relic account is in the EU region, choose the EU install option. Get an account Start the installer Eu guided install Or, for fully manual instructions for deploying our integration using Helm. Installs for managed services and platforms Before starting our automated installer, check out these notes for your managed services or platforms: Amazon EKS / EKS-Anywhere The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In Amazon EKS, master nodes are managed by Amazon and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. Before starting our automated installer to deploy the Kubernetes integration in Amazon EKS, make sure you are using the version of kubectl provided by AWS. Amazon EKS Fargate Installation on EKS Fargate clusters requires dedicated steps, which are detailed in our fargate installation docs. Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In GKE, master nodes are managed by Google and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. Before starting our automated installer to deploy the Kubernetes integration on GKE, ensure you have sufficient permissions: Go to console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam and find your username. Click edit. Ensure you have permissions to create Roles and ClusterRoles: If you are not sure, add the Kubernetes Engine Cluster Admin role. If you cannot edit your user role, ask the owner of the GCP project to give you the necessary permissions. OpenShift container platform To deploy the Kubernetes integration with OpenShift: Add the <>{'<release_name>'}</>-newrelic-infrastructure service account to your privileged Security Context Constraints: oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged \\ system:serviceaccount:<namespace>:<release_name>-newrelic-infrastructure Copy The default <>{'<release_name>'}</> provided by the installer is nri-bundle. Complete the steps in our automated installer. If you're using signed certificates, make sure they are properly configured by using the following variables in the DaemonSet portion of your manifest to set the .pem file: Copy name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_DIR value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_DIR name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_FILE value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_NAME YAML key path: `spec.template.spec.containers.name.env` Copy Save your changes. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In Azure Kubernetes Service, master nodes are managed by Azure and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. To deploy in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), complete the steps in our automated installer. Pivotal Container Service (PKS / VMware Tanzu) To deploy in PKS, we recommend that you use the automated installer, or you can follow the manual instructions provided in Install the Kubernetes integration using Helm. Upgrading our Kubernetes integration Our Kubernetes integration is under active development and we regularly release updates which include bug fixes, new features, and support for newer Kubernetes versions and cloud providers. We strongly recommend all our customers to regularly update the Kubernetes integration to get the best experience. Upgrading using the automated installer and Helm In order to update an installation that was deployed using Helm command provided by the automated installer, just go through the process and run the Helm command again. This will pull the new version of the chart and its dependencies and upgrade it to the latest version. Upgrading using the automated installer and plain manifests Tip We encourage you to deploy our integration using Helm, as it provides a cleaner upgrade path compared to using manifests directly. If custom manifests have been used instead of Helm, we encourage you to first remove the old installation using kubectl delete -f previous-manifest-file.yml, and then proceed through the guided installer again. This will generate an updated set of manifests that can be deployed using kubectl apply -f manifest-file.yml. We do not recommend applying a new version of the manifest file without removing the previous one first, since it might leave some leftover components in your cluster. Monitor services running on Kubernetes Tip We encourage you to deploy our integration using Helm, as it allows easier configuration on how to monitor services by just adding snippets to your values.yml file. After having installed our Kubernetes integration, you can start instrumenting the services than run in your cluster. To learn more about how to do this, please check our Monitor services running on Kubernetes page.

      "body": "New Relic provides Control Plane support for your Kubernetes integration, allowing you to monitor and collect metrics from your cluster's Control Plane components. That data can then be found in New Relic and used to create queries and charts. Features We monitor and collect metrics from the following control plane components: ETCD: leader information, resident memory size, number of OS threads, consensus proposals data, etc. For a list of supported metrics, see ETCD data. API server: rate of apiserver requests, breakdown of apiserver requests by HTTP method and response code, etc. For the complete list of supported metrics, see API server data.

Controller manager: resident memory size, number of OS threads created, goroutines currently existing, etc. For the complete list of supported metrics, see Controller manager data. Compatibility and requirements Control plane monitoring requires Kubernetes integration version 1.16.0 or higher. Control plane monitoring support is not enabled for managed clusters. This is because providers (EKS, GKE, AKS, etc.) abstract away the concept of master nodes and control plane components, so that access to them is limited or non-existent. External control planes are not supported. The unprivileged version of the Kubernetes integration does not support control plane monitoring. OpenShift 4.x uses control plane component metric endpoints that are different than the default. Discovery of master nodes and control plane components The Kubernetes integration relies on the kubeadm labeling conventions to discover the master nodes and the control plane components. This means that master nodes should be labeled with node-role.kubernetes.io/master=\"\" or kubernetes.io/role=\"master\". The control plane components should have either the k8s-app or the tier and component labels. Refer to the following table for accepted label combinations and values: Component Label Endpoint API server Kubeadm / Kops / ClusterAPI k8s-app=kube-apiserver tier=control-plane component=kube-apiserver OpenShift app=openshift-kube-apiserver apiserver=true localhost:443/metrics by default (can be configured) if the request fails falls back to localhost:8080/metrics ETCD Kubeadm / Kops / ClusterAPI k8s-app=etcd-manager-main tier=control-plane component=etcd OpenShift k8s-app=etcd localhost:4001/metrics Scheduler Kubeadm / Kops / ClusterAPI k8s-app=kube-scheduler tier=control-plane component=kube-scheduler OpenShift app=openshift-kube-scheduler scheduler=true localhost:10251/metrics Controller manager Kubeadm / Kops / ClusterAPI k8s-app=kube-controller-manager tier=control-plane component=kube-controller-manager​ OpenShift app=kube-controller-manager kube-controller-manager=true localhost:10252/metrics When the integration detects that it is running inside a master node, it tries to find which components are running on the node by looking for pods that match the labels listed in the table above. For every running component, the integration makes a request to its metrics endpoint. Configuration Control plane monitoring is automatic for agents running inside master nodes. The only component that requires an extra step to run is ETCD, because it uses mutual TLS authentication (mTLS) for client requests. The API Server can also be configured to be queried using the Secure Port. Important Control plane monitoring for OpenShift 4.x requires additional configuration. For more information, see the OpenShift 4.x Configuration section. ETCD In order to set mTLS for querying ETCD, there are two configuration options that need to be set: Option Value ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAME Name of a Kubernetes secret that contains the mTLS configuration. The secret should contain the following keys: cert: the certificate that identifies the client making the request. It should be signed by an ETCD trusted CA. key: the private key used to generate the client certificate. cacert: the root CA used to identify the ETCD server certificate. If the ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAME option is not set, ETCD metrics won't be fetched. For step by step instructions on how to create a certificate and sign it with the ETCD client CA, see Set up mTLS from the ETCD client CA. ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAMESPACE The namespace where the secret specified in the ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAME was created. If not set, the default namespace is used. API server By default, the API server metrics are queried using the localhost:8080 unsecured endpoint. If this port is disabled, you can also query these metrics over the secure port. To enable this, set the following configuration option in the Kubernetes integration manifest file: Option Value API_SERVER_ENDPOINT_URL The (secure) URL to query the metrics. The API server uses localhost:443 by default Ensure that the ClusterRole has been updated to the newest version found in the manifest Added in version 1.15.0 Important Note that the port can be different according to the secure port used by the API server. For example, in Minikube the API server secure port is 8443 and therefore API_SERVER_ENDPOINT_URL should be set to https://localhost:8443 OpenShift configuration Control plane components on OpenShift 4.x use endpoint URLs that require SSL and service account based authentication. Therefore, the default endpoint URLs can not be used. To configure control plane monitoring on OpenShift, uncomment the following environment variables in the customized manifest. URL values are pre-configured to the default base URLs for the control plane monitoring metrics endpoints in OpenShift 4.x. - name: \"SCHEDULER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10259 - name: \"ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:9979\" - name: \"CONTROLLER_MANAGER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10257\" - name: \"API_SERVER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:6443\" Copy Important Even though the custom ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL is defined, ETCD requires HTTPS and mTLS authentication to be configured. For more on configuring mTLS for ETCD in OpenShift, see Set up mTLS for ETCD in OpenShift. Important When installing through Helm openshift, specify the config to automatically include these endpoints. Setting openshift.enabled=true and openshift.version=\"4.x\" will include the secure endpoints and enable the /var/run/crio.sock runtime. Set up mTLS from the ETCD client CA The instructions below are based on the Kubernetes documentation. For more information, see Managing TLS certificates in a cluster. For OpenShift, see Set up mTLS for ETCD in OpenShift. To set up mTLS from the ETCD client CA: Download and install the tool cfssl, selecting the correct binaries for your OS from the list. Once installed, execute the following command: cat <<EOF | cfssl genkey - | cfssljson -bare server { \"hosts\": [ \"localhost\" ], \"CN\": \"newrelic-infra.pod.cluster.local\", \"key\": { \"algo\": \"ecdsa\", \"size\": 256 } } EOF Copy This command generates two files; server.csr containing the PEM encoded pkcs#10 certification request and server-key.pem containing the PEM encoded key to the certificate to be created. Use the generated certificate authority (CA) of ETCD to sign your CSR. Depending on your cluster configuration, you may already have this information. For default install configuration, download the CA certificate and the private key directly from ETCD with the following commands: kubectl cp $(kubectl get pods -l k8s-app=etcd-manager-main -n kube-system -o jsonpath=\"{.items[0].metadata.name}\"):/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd-manager/etcd-clients-ca.crt ./cacert -n kube-system kubectl cp $(kubectl get pods -l k8s-app=etcd-manager-main -n kube-system -o jsonpath=\"{.items[0].metadata.name}\"):/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd-manager/etcd-clients-ca.key ./cacert.key -n kube-system Copy Tip This requires that the etcd-manager-main pod has the label k8s-app=etcd-manager-main, which is a requirement for control plane monitoring . If your etc-manager-main pod is located in a different namespace, change the -n kube-system flags accordingly. With those files downloaded, use the following command to sign your CSRF: cfssl sign -ca cacert -ca-key cacert.key server.csr | cfssljson -bare cert Copy Create the secret that is used to retrieve the TLS config for making requests to ETC. We recommend renaming the certificate and the private key: cp cert.pem cert && cp server-key.pem key Copy kubectl -n default create secret generic newrelic-infra-etcd-tls-secret --from-file=./cert --from-file=./key --from-file=./cacert Copy To ease future installations Use the following commands to simultaneously create the CSR, retrieve the CA, generate the certificate by signing the CSR, and create the secret with all the required fields: cat <<EOF | cfssl genkey - | cfssljson -bare server && \\ kubectl cp $(kubectl get pods -l k8s-app=etcd-manager-main -n kube-system -o jsonpath=\"{.items[0].metadata.name}\"):/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd-manager/etcd-clients-ca.crt ./cacert -n kube-system && \\ kubectl cp $(kubectl get pods -l k8s-app=etcd-manager-main -n kube-system -o jsonpath=\"{.items[0].metadata.name}\"):/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd-manager/etcd-clients-ca.key ./cacert.key -n kube-system && \\ cp server-key.pem key && \\ cfssl sign -ca cacert -ca-key cacert.key server.csr | cfssljson -bare cert && \\ cp cert.pem cert && \\ kubectl -n default create secret generic newrelic-infra-etcd-tls-secret --from-file=./cert --from-file=./key --from-file=./cacert { \"hosts\": [ \"localhost\" ], \"CN\": \"newrelic-infra.pod.cluster.local\", \"key\": { \"algo\": \"ecdsa\", \"size\": 256 } } EOF Copy The last step is to update the configuration in the manifest and apply it. In the configuration section, there are two options related to ETCD mTLS: ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAME with the name of the secret that we just created. ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAMESPACE with the namespace that we used to create the secret. To complete the installation, add these variables to the container spec of the integration DaemonSet and apply the changes: - name: \"ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAME” value: \"newrelic-infra-etcd-tls-secret\" - name: \"ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAMESPACE\" value: \"default\" Copy Set up mTLS for ETCD in OpenShift Follow these instructions to set up mutual TLS authentication for ETCD in OpenShift 4.x: Export the ETCD client certificates from the cluster to an opaque secret. In a default managed OpenShift cluster, the secret is named kube-etcd-client-certs and it is stored in the openshift-monitoring namespace. kubectl get secret/kube-etcd-client-certs -n openshift-monitoring -o yaml > etcd-secret.yaml Copy Open the secret file and change the keys: Rename the certificate authority to cacert. Rename the client certificate to cert. Rename the client key to key. Optional: change the secret name and namespace to something meaningful. Remove these unnecessary keys in the metadata section: creationTimestamp resourceVersion selfLink uid Install the manifest with its new name and namespace: kubectl apply -f etcd-secret.yaml Copy Go to Update manifest configuration (the last step under Set up MTL from ETCD client) to configure the required environment variables. See your data If the integration has been been set up correctly, the Kubernetes cluster explorer contains all the Control Plane components and their status in a dedicated section, as shown below. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes Cluster Explorer: Use the Kubernetes cluster explorer to monitor and collect metrics from your cluster's Control Plane components You can also check for Control Plane data with this NRQL query: SELECT latest(timestamp) FROM K8sApiServerSample, K8sEtcdSample, K8sSchedulerSample, K8sControllerManagerSample FACET entityName where clusterName = 'MY_CLUSTER_NAME' Copy Tip If you still can't see Control Plane data, try the solution described in Kubernetes integration troubleshooting: Not seeing data.",

It bundles not just the integration DaemonSets, but also other New Relic Kubernetes configurations, like Kubernetes events, Prometheus OpenMetrics, and New Relic log monitoring. As a Kubernetes user, you might consider Auto-telemetry with Pixie for deeper insights into your Kubernetes clusters and workloads. No language agents required. Ready to get started? If you don't already have one, sign up for a New Relic account. It's free, forever! Use automated installer We encourage you to use our automated installer for servers, VMs, and unprivileged environments. The automated installer can provide you either a Helm command with the required values filled, or a plain manifest if you don't want to use Helm. It also features great customizability and full control over which features and dependencies are enabled. If you are installing our integration on a managed cloud, please take a look at these preliminary notes before proceeding. Before you start the install, make sure you have a New Relic account. It's free! No credit card required. If your New Relic account is in the EU region, choose the EU install option. Get an account Start the installer Eu guided install Or, for fully manual instructions for deploying our integration using Helm. Installs for managed services and platforms Before starting our automated installer, check out these notes for your managed services or platforms: Amazon EKS / EKS-Anywhere The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In Amazon EKS, master nodes are managed by Amazon and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. Before starting our automated installer to deploy the Kubernetes integration in Amazon EKS, make sure you are using the version of kubectl provided by AWS. Amazon EKS Fargate Installation on EKS Fargate clusters requires dedicated steps, which are detailed in our fargate installation docs. Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In GKE, master nodes are managed by Google and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. Before starting our automated installer to deploy the Kubernetes integration on GKE, ensure you have sufficient permissions: Go to console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam and find your username. Click edit. Ensure you have permissions to create Roles and ClusterRoles: If you are not sure, add the Kubernetes Engine Cluster Admin role. If you cannot edit your user role, ask the owner of the GCP project to give you the necessary permissions. OpenShift container platform To deploy the Kubernetes integration with OpenShift: Add the <>{'<release_name>'}</>-newrelic-infrastructure service account to your privileged Security Context Constraints: oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged \\ system:serviceaccount:<namespace>:<release_name>-newrelic-infrastructure Copy The default <>{'<release_name>'}</> provided by the installer is nri-bundle. Complete the steps in our automated installer. If you're using signed certificates, make sure they are properly configured by using the following variables in the DaemonSet portion of your manifest to set the .pem file: Copy name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_DIR value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_DIR name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_FILE value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_NAME YAML key path: `spec.template.spec.containers.name.env` Copy Save your changes. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In Azure Kubernetes Service, master nodes are managed by Azure and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. To deploy in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), complete the steps in our automated installer. Pivotal Container Service (PKS / VMware Tanzu) To deploy in PKS, we recommend that you use the automated installer, or you can follow the manual instructions provided in Install the Kubernetes integration using Helm. Upgrading our Kubernetes integration Our Kubernetes integration is under active development and we regularly release updates which include bug fixes, new features, and support for newer Kubernetes versions and cloud providers. We strongly recommend all our customers to regularly update the Kubernetes integration to get the best experience. Upgrading using the automated installer and Helm In order to update an installation that was deployed using Helm command provided by the automated installer, just go through the process and run the Helm command again. This will pull the new version of the chart and its dependencies and upgrade it to the latest version. Upgrading using the automated installer and plain manifests Tip We encourage you to deploy our integration using Helm, as it provides a cleaner upgrade path compared to using manifests directly. If custom manifests have been used instead of Helm, we encourage you to first remove the old installation using kubectl delete -f previous-manifest-file.yml, and then proceed through the guided installer again. This will generate an updated set of manifests that can be deployed using kubectl apply -f manifest-file.yml. We do not recommend applying a new version of the manifest file without removing the previous one first, since it might leave some leftover components in your cluster. Monitor services running on Kubernetes Tip We encourage you to deploy our integration using Helm, as it allows easier configuration on how to monitor services by just adding snippets to your values.yml file. After having installed our Kubernetes integration, you can start instrumenting the services than run in your cluster. To learn more about how to do this, please check our Monitor services running on Kubernetes page.

Therefore, the default endpoint URLs can not be used. To configure control plane monitoring on OpenShift, uncomment the following environment variables in the customized manifest. URL values are pre-configured to the default base URLs for the control plane monitoring metrics endpoints in OpenShift 4.x. - name: \"SCHEDULER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10259 - name: \"ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:9979\" - name: \"CONTROLLER_MANAGER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10257\" - name: \"API_SERVER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:6443\" Copy Important Even though the custom ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL is defined, ETCD requires HTTPS and mTLS authentication to be configured. For more on configuring mTLS for ETCD in OpenShift, see Set up mTLS for ETCD in OpenShift. Important When installing through Helm openshift, specify the config to automatically include these endpoints. Setting openshift.enabled=true and openshift.version=\"4.x\" will include the secure endpoints and enable the /var/run/crio.sock runtime. Set up mTLS from the ETCD client CA The instructions below are based on the Kubernetes documentation. For more information, see Managing TLS certificates in a cluster. For OpenShift, see Set up mTLS for ETCD in OpenShift. To set up mTLS from the ETCD client CA: Download and install the tool cfssl, selecting the correct binaries for your OS from the list. Once installed, execute the following command: cat <<EOF | cfssl genkey - | cfssljson -bare server { \"hosts\": [ \"localhost\" ], \"CN\": \"newrelic-infra.pod.cluster.local\", \"key\": { \"algo\": \"ecdsa\", \"size\": 256 } } EOF Copy This command generates two files; server.csr containing the PEM encoded pkcs#10 certification request and server-key.pem containing the PEM encoded key to the certificate to be created. Use the generated certificate authority (CA) of ETCD to sign your CSR. Depending on your cluster configuration, you may already have this information. For default install configuration, download the CA certificate and the private key directly from ETCD with the following commands: kubectl cp $(kubectl get pods -l k8s-app=etcd-manager-main -n kube-system -o jsonpath=\"{.items[0].metadata.name}\"):/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd-manager/etcd-clients-ca.crt ./cacert -n kube-system kubectl cp $(kubectl get pods -l k8s-app=etcd-manager-main -n kube-system -o jsonpath=\"{.items[0].metadata.name}\"):/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd-manager/etcd-clients-ca.key ./cacert.key -n kube-system Copy Tip This requires that the etcd-manager-main pod has the label k8s-app=etcd-manager-main, which is a requirement for control plane monitoring . If your etc-manager-main pod is located in a different namespace, change the -n kube-system flags accordingly. With those files downloaded, use the following command to sign your CSRF: cfssl sign -ca cacert -ca-key cacert.key server.csr | cfssljson -bare cert Copy Create the secret that is used to retrieve the TLS config for making requests to ETC. We recommend renaming the certificate and the private key: cp cert.pem cert && cp server-key.pem key Copy kubectl -n default create secret generic newrelic-infra-etcd-tls-secret --from-file=./cert --from-file=./key --from-file=./cacert Copy To ease future installations Use the following commands to simultaneously create the CSR, retrieve the CA, generate the certificate by signing the CSR, and create the secret with all the required fields: cat <<EOF | cfssl genkey - | cfssljson -bare server && \\ kubectl cp $(kubectl get pods -l k8s-app=etcd-manager-main -n kube-system -o jsonpath=\"{.items[0].metadata.name}\"):/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd-manager/etcd-clients-ca.crt ./cacert -n kube-system && \\ kubectl cp $(kubectl get pods -l k8s-app=etcd-manager-main -n kube-system -o jsonpath=\"{.items[0].metadata.name}\"):/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd-manager/etcd-clients-ca.key ./cacert.key -n kube-system && \\ cp server-key.pem key && \\ cfssl sign -ca cacert -ca-key cacert.key server.csr | cfssljson -bare cert && \\ cp cert.pem cert && \\ kubectl -n default create secret generic newrelic-infra-etcd-tls-secret --from-file=./cert --from-file=./key --from-file=./cacert { \"hosts\": [ \"localhost\" ], \"CN\": \"newrelic-infra.pod.cluster.local\", \"key\": { \"algo\": \"ecdsa\", \"size\": 256 } } EOF Copy The last step is to update the configuration in the manifest and apply it. In the configuration section, there are two options related to ETCD mTLS: ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAME with the name of the secret that we just created. ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAMESPACE with the namespace that we used to create the secret. To complete the installation, add these variables to the container spec of the integration DaemonSet and apply the changes: - name: \"ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAME” value: \"newrelic-infra-etcd-tls-secret\" - name: \"ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAMESPACE\" value: \"default\" Copy Set up mTLS for ETCD in OpenShift Follow these instructions to set up mutual TLS authentication for ETCD in OpenShift 4.x: Export the ETCD client certificates from the cluster to an opaque secret. In a default managed OpenShift cluster, the secret is named kube-etcd-client-certs and it is stored in the openshift-monitoring namespace. kubectl get secret/kube-etcd-client-certs -n openshift-monitoring -o yaml > etcd-secret.yaml Copy Open the secret file and change the keys: Rename the certificate authority to cacert. Rename the client certificate to cert. Rename the client key to key. Optional: change the secret name and namespace to something meaningful. Remove these unnecessary keys in the metadata section: creationTimestamp resourceVersion selfLink uid Install the manifest with its new name and namespace: kubectl apply -f etcd-secret.yaml Copy Go to Update manifest configuration (the last step under Set up MTL from ETCD client) to configure the required environment variables.

      "body": "The easiest way to install the Kubernetes integration is to use our automated installer to generate a manifest. It bundles not just the integration DaemonSets, but also other New Relic Kubernetes configurations, like Kubernetes events, Prometheus OpenMetrics, and New Relic log monitoring. As a Kubernetes user, you might consider Auto-telemetry with Pixie for deeper insights into your Kubernetes clusters and workloads. No language agents required. Ready to get started? If you don't already have one, sign up for a New Relic account. It's free, forever! Use automated installer We encourage you to use our automated installer for servers, VMs, and unprivileged environments. The automated installer can provide you either a Helm command with the required values filled, or a plain manifest if you don't want to use Helm. It also features great customizability and full control over which features and dependencies are enabled. If you are installing our integration on a managed cloud, please take a look at these preliminary notes before proceeding. Before you start the install, make sure you have a New Relic account. It's free! No credit card required. If your New Relic account is in the EU region, choose the EU install option. Get an account Start the installer Eu guided install Or, for fully manual instructions for deploying our integration using Helm. Installs for managed services and platforms Before starting our automated installer, check out these notes for your managed services or platforms: Amazon EKS / EKS-Anywhere The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In Amazon EKS, master nodes are managed by Amazon and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. Before starting our automated installer to deploy the Kubernetes integration in Amazon EKS, make sure you are using the version of kubectl provided by AWS. Amazon EKS Fargate Installation on EKS Fargate clusters requires dedicated steps, which are detailed in our fargate installation docs. Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In GKE, master nodes are managed by Google and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. Before starting our automated installer to deploy the Kubernetes integration on GKE, ensure you have sufficient permissions: Go to console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam and find your username. Click edit. Ensure you have permissions to create Roles and ClusterRoles: If you are not sure, add the Kubernetes Engine Cluster Admin role. If you cannot edit your user role, ask the owner of the GCP project to give you the necessary permissions. OpenShift container platform To deploy the Kubernetes integration with OpenShift: Add the <>{'<release_name>'}</>-newrelic-infrastructure service account to your privileged Security Context Constraints: oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged \\ system:serviceaccount:<namespace>:<release_name>-newrelic-infrastructure Copy The default <>{'<release_name>'}</> provided by the installer is nri-bundle. Complete the steps in our automated installer. If you're using signed certificates, make sure they are properly configured by using the following variables in the DaemonSet portion of your manifest to set the .pem file: Copy name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_DIR value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_DIR name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_FILE value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_NAME YAML key path: `spec.template.spec.containers.name.env` Copy Save your changes. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In Azure Kubernetes Service, master nodes are managed by Azure and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. To deploy in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), complete the steps in our automated installer. Pivotal Container Service (PKS / VMware Tanzu) To deploy in PKS, we recommend that you use the automated installer, or you can follow the manual instructions provided in Install the Kubernetes integration using Helm. Upgrading our Kubernetes integration Our Kubernetes integration is under active development and we regularly release updates which include bug fixes, new features, and support for newer Kubernetes versions and cloud providers. We strongly recommend all our customers to regularly update the Kubernetes integration to get the best experience. Upgrading using the automated installer and Helm In order to update an installation that was deployed using Helm command provided by the automated installer, just go through the process and run the Helm command again. This will pull the new version of the chart and its dependencies and upgrade it to the latest version. Upgrading using the automated installer and plain manifests Tip We encourage you to deploy our integration using Helm, as it provides a cleaner upgrade path compared to using manifests directly. If custom manifests have been used instead of Helm, we encourage you to first remove the old installation using kubectl delete -f previous-manifest-file.yml, and then proceed through the guided installer again. This will generate an updated set of manifests that can be deployed using kubectl apply -f manifest-file.yml. We do not recommend applying a new version of the manifest file without removing the previous one first, since it might leave some leftover components in your cluster. Monitor services running on Kubernetes Tip We encourage you to deploy our integration using Helm, as it allows easier configuration on how to monitor services by just adding snippets to your values.yml file. After having installed our Kubernetes integration, you can start instrumenting the services than run in your cluster. To learn more about how to do this, please check our Monitor services running on Kubernetes page.

      "body": "BETA FEATURE This feature is still in development, but we encourage you to try it out! You can use metrics from your New Relic account to autoscale applications and services in your Kubernetes cluster by deploying the New Relic Metrics Adapter. This adapter fetches the metric values from New Relic and makes them available for the Horizontal Pod Autoscalers. The newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter implements the external.metrics.k8s.io API to support the use of external metrics based New Relic NRQL queries results. Once deployed, the value for each configured metric is fetched using the NerdGraph API based on the configured NRQL query. The metrics adapter exposes the metrics over a secured endpoint with TLS. New Relic metrics adapter in a cluster. Requirements Kubernetes 1.16 or higher. The New Relic Kubernetes integration. New Relic's user API key. No other External Metrics Adapter installed in the cluster. Installation To install the New Relic Metrics Adapter, we provide the newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter Helm chart, which is also included in the nri-bundle chart used to deploy all New Relic Kubernetes components. If not already installed, install our Kubernetes integration. Upgrade the installation to include the New Relic Metrics Adapter with the following command: helm upgrade --install newrelic newrelic/nri-bundle \\ --namespace newrelic --create-namespace --reuse-values \\ --set metrics-adapter.enabled=true \\ --set newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.personalAPIKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_PERSONAL_API_KEY \\ --set newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.config.accountID=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID \\ --set newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.config.externalMetrics.external_metric_name.query=NRQL query Copy Please notice and adjust the following flags: metrics-adapter.enabled: Must be set to true so the metrics adapter chart is installed. newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.personalAPIKey: Must be set to valid New Relic Personal API key. newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.accountID: Must be set to valid New Relic account where metrics are going to be fetched from. newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.config.externalMetrics.<var>external_metric_name</var>.<var>query</var>: Adds a new external metric where: <var>external_metric_name</var>: The metric name. <var>query</var>: The base NRQL query that is used to get the value for the metric. Tip Alternatively, you can use a values.yaml file that can be passed to the helm command with the --values flag. Values files can contain all parameters needed to configure the metrics explained in the configuration section. Configuration You can configure multiple metrics in the metrics adapter and change some parameters to modify the behaviour of the metrics cache and filtering. To see the full list and descriptions of all parameters that can be modified, refer to the chart README.md and values.yaml files. How it works The following example is a Helm values file that enable the metrics adapter on the nri-bundle chart installation, and configures the nginx_average_requests metric: metrics-adapter: enabled: true newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter: personalAPIKey: <Personal API Key> config: accountID: <Account ID> externalMetrics: nginx_average_requests: query: \"FROM Metric SELECT average(nginx.server.net.requestsPerSecond) SINCE 2 MINUTES AGO\" Copy Caution The default time span for metrics is 1h. Therefore, you should define queries with the SINCE clause to adjust the time span according to your environment and needs. There is an HPA consuming the external metric as follows: kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler apiVersion: autoscaling/v2beta2 metadata: name: nginx-scaler spec: scaleTargetRef: apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment name: nginx minReplicas: 1 maxReplicas: 10 metrics: - type: External external: metric: name: nginx_average_requests selector: matchLabels: k8s.namespaceName: nginx target: type: Value value: 10000 Copy Based on the HPA definition, the controller manager fetches the metrics from the external metrics API which are served by the New Relic metrics adapter. The New Relic metrics adapter receives the query including the nginx_average_requests metric name and all the selectors, and searches for a matching metric name in the internal memory based on the configured metrics. Then, it adds the selectors to the query to form a final query that is executed using NerdGraph to fetch the value from New Relic. The above example will generate a query like the following: FROM Metric SELECT average(nginx.server.net.requestsPerSecond) WHERE clusterName=<clusterName> AND `k8s.namespaceName`='nginx' SINCE 2 MINUTES AGO Copy Notice that a clusterName filter has been automatically added to the query to exclude metrics from other clusters in the same account. You can remove it by using the removeClusterFilter configuration parameter. Also the value is cached for a period of time defined by the cacheTTLSeconds configuration parameter, whose default is 30 seconds. Troubleshooting Get verbose logs Most common errors are displayed in the standard (non-verbose) logs. If you're doing a more in-depth investigation on your own or with New Relic Support, you can enable verbose mode. To get verbose logging details for an integration using Helm: Enable verbose logging: bash Copy $ helm upgrade -n <namespace> --reuse-values newrelic-bundle --set newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.verboseLog=true newrelic/nri-bundle Leave on verbose mode for a few minutes, or until enough activity has occurred. When you have the information you need, disable verbose logging: bash Copy $ helm upgrade --reuse-values newrelic-bundle --set newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.verboseLog=false newrelic/nri-bundle Caution Verbose mode increases significantly the amount of information sent to log files. Enable this mode temporarily, only for troubleshooting purposes, and reset the log level when finished. Get raw metrics Sometimes it's useful to get the list of available metrics and also to get the current value of an specific metric. To get the list of metrics available, run: bash Copy $ kubectl get --raw \"/apis/external.metrics.k8s.io/v1beta1/\" To get the value for a specific metric with a selector, run: bash Copy $ kubectl get --raw \"/apis/external.metrics.k8s.io/v1beta1/namespaces/*/<metric_name>?labelSelector=<selector_key>=<selector_value>\" Tip You must replace <metric_name>, <selector_key> and <selector_value> with your values. Metrics not working There are some usual errors that could cause a metric fail to retrieve the value. These errors are showed in the status of the metrics when you describe the HPA or are printed when you get the raw metrics directly. executing query: NRQL Syntax Error: Error at line...: The query that is being run has syntax errors.

      "body": "You can surface Kubernetes metadata and link it to your APM agents as distributed traces to explore performance issues and troubleshoot transaction errors. For more information, see this New Relic blog post. You can quickly start monitoring Kubernetes clusters using Auto-telemetry with Pixie, which is currently a beta release. This Pixie integration into New Relic does not require a language agent. Learn more about Auto-telemetry with Pixie here. Tip Our Kubernetes metadata injection project is open source. Here's the code to link APM and infrastructure data and the code to automatically manage certificates. Compatibility and requirements Before linking Kubernetes metadata to your APM agents, make sure you meet the following requirements: Kubernetes requirements Network requirements APM agent compatibility OpenShift requirements Kubernetes requirements To link your applications and Kubernetes, your cluster must have the MutatingAdmissionWebhook controller enabled, which requires Kubernetes 1.9 or higher. To verify that your cluster is compatible, run the following command: kubectl api-versions | grep admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1 admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1 Copy If you see a different result, follow the Kubernetes documentation to enable admission control in your cluster. Network requirements For Kubernetes to speak to our MutatingAdmissionWebhook, the master node (or the API server container, depending on how the cluster is set up) should be allowed egress for HTTPS traffic on port 443 to pods in all of the other nodes in the cluster. This might require specific configuration depending on how the infrastructure is set up (on-premises, AWS, Google Cloud, etc). Tip Until Kubernetes v1.14, users were only allowed to register admission webhooks on port 443. Since v1.15 it's possible to register them on different ports. To ensure backward compatibility, the webhook is registered by default on port 443 in the YAML config file we distribute. APM agent compatibility The following New Relic agents collect Kubernetes metadata: Go 2.3.0 or higher Java 4.10.0 or higher Node.js 5.3.0 or higher Python 4.14.0 or higher Ruby 6.1.0 or higher .NET 8.17.438 or higher Openshift requirements To link Openshift and Kubernetes you must enable mutating admission webhooks, which requires Openshift 3.9 or higher. During the process, install a resource that requires admin permissions to the cluster. Run this to log in as admin: oc login -u system:admin Copy Check that webhooks are correctly configured. If they are not, update the master-config.yaml file. admissionConfig: pluginConfig: MutatingAdmissionWebhook: configuration: apiVersion: apiserver.config.k8s.io/v1alpha1 kubeConfigFile: /dev/null kind: WebhookAdmission ValidatingAdmissionWebhook: configuration: apiVersion: apiserver.config.k8s.io/v1alpha1 kubeConfigFile: /dev/null kind: WebhookAdmission location: \"\" Copy Important Add kubeConfigFile: /dev/null to address some issues in Openshift. Enable certificate signing by editing the YAML file and updating your configuration: kubernetesMasterConfig: controllerArguments: cluster-signing-cert-file: - \"/etc/origin/master/ca.crt\" cluster-signing-key-file: - \"/etc/origin/master/ca.key\" Copy Restart the Openshift services in the master node. Configure the injection of metadata By default, all the pods you create that include APM agents have the correct environment variables set and the metadata injection applies to the entire cluster. To check that the environment variables have been set, any container that is running must be stopped, and a new instance started (see Validate the injection of metadata). This default configuration also uses the Kubernetes certificates API to automatically manage the certificates required for the injection. If needed, you can limit the injection of metadata to specific namespaces in your cluster or self-manage your certificates. Default configuration We offer instructions for deploying our integration using Helm. Just be sure that, when you are configuring the chart, the webhook that inject the metadata is enabled. Notice that we are specifying --dry-run and --debug, so nothing will be installed in this step: helm upgrade --install newrelic newrelic/nri-bundle \\ --dry-run \\ --debug \\ --namespace newrelic --create-namespace \\ --set global.licenseKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY \\ --set global.cluster=K8S_CLUSTER_NAME \\ --set ksm.enabled=true \\ --set newrelic-infrastructure.privileged=true \\ --set infrastructure.enabled=true \\ --set prometheus.enabled=true \\ --set webhook.enabled= true \\ --set kubeEvents.enabled=true \\ --set logging.enabled=true Copy Custom configuration You can limit the injection of metadata only to specific namespaces by using labels. To enable this feature, edit nri-bundle Helm values.yaml file: nri-metadata-injector: injectOnlyLabeledNamespaces: true Copy Or add a --set when installing or upgrading your Helm release: helm upgrade --install newrelic newrelic/nri-bundle \\ --dry-run \\ --debug \\ --namespace newrelic --create-namespace \\ --set global.licenseKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY \\ --set global.cluster=K8S_CLUSTER_NAME \\ --set ksm.enabled=true \\ --set newrelic-infrastructure.privileged=true \\ --set infrastructure.enabled=true \\ --set prometheus.enabled=true \\ --set webhook.enabled= true \\ --set nri-metadata-injector.injectOnlyLabeledNamespaces=true \\ --set kubeEvents.enabled=true \\ --set logging.enabled=true Copy With this option, injection is only applied to those namespaces that have the newrelic-metadata-injection label set to enabled: kubectl label namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE newrelic-metadata-injection=enabled Copy Manage custom certificates To use custom certificates you need to disable the automatic installation of certificates when you are installing using Helm. To disable the installation for certificates just modify nri-bundle Helm values.yaml like this: nri-metadata-injector: customTLSCertificate: true Copy Or add a --set when installing or upgrading your Helm release: helm upgrade --install newrelic newrelic/nri-bundle \\ --dry-run \\ --debug \\ --namespace newrelic --create-namespace \\ --set global.licenseKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY \\ --set global.cluster=K8S_CLUSTER_NAME \\ --set ksm.enabled=true \\ --set newrelic-infrastructure.privileged=true \\ --set infrastructure.enabled=true \\ --set prometheus.enabled=true \\ --set webhook.enabled= true \\ --set nri-metadata-injector.customTLSCertificate=true \\ --set kubeEvents.enabled=true \\ --set logging.enabled=true Copy Now you can proceed with the custom certificate management option. You need your certificate, server key, and Certification Authority (CA) bundle encoded in PEM format. If you have them in the standard certificate format (X.509), install openssl, and run the following: openssl x509 -in CERTIFICATE_FILENAME -outform PEM -out CERTIFICATE_FILENAME.pem openssl x509 -in SERVER_KEY_FILENAME -outform PEM -out SERVER_KEY_FILENAME.pem openssl x509 -in CA_BUNDLE_FILENAME -outform PEM -out BUNDLE_FILENAME.pem Copy If your certificate/key pair are in another format, see the Digicert knowledgebase for more help. Create the TLS secret with the signed certificate/key pair, and patch the mutating webhook configuration with the CA using the following commands: kubectl create secret tls newrelic-metadata-injection-admission \\ --key=PEM_ENCODED_SERVER_KEY \\ --cert=PEM_ENCODED_CERTIFICATE \\ --dry-run -o yaml | kubectl -n newrelic apply -f - caBundle=$(cat PEM_ENCODED_CA_BUNDLE | base64 | td -d $'\\n') kubectl patch mutatingwebhookconfiguration newrelic-metadata-injection-cfg --type='json' -p \"[{'op': 'replace', 'path': '/webhooks/0/clientConfig/caBundle', 'value':'${caBundle}'}]\" Copy Important Certificates signed by Kubernetes have an expiration of one year. For more information, see the Kubernetes source code in GitHub. Validate the injection of metadata In order to validate that the webhook (responsible for injecting the metadata) was installed correctly, deploy a new pod and check for the New Relic environment variables. Create a dummy pod containing Busybox by running: kubectl create -f https://git.io/vPieo Copy Check if New Relic environment variables were injected: kubectl exec busybox0 -- env | grep NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_NAME=fsi NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_NODE_NAME=nodea NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE_NAME=default NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_POD_NAME=busybox0 NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_CONTAINER_NAME=busybox Copy Disable the injection of metadata To disable/uninstall the injection of metadata, use the following commands: Delete the Kubernetes objects using the yaml file: kubectl delete -f k8s-metadata-injection-latest.yaml Copy Delete the TLS secret containing the certificate/key pair: kubectl delete secret/newrelic-metadata-injection-secret Copy Troubleshooting Follow these troubleshooting tips as needed. No Kubernetes metadata in APM or distributed tracing transactions Problem The creation of the secret by the k8s-webhook-cert-manager job used to fail due to the kubectl version used by the image when running in Kubernetes version 1.19.x, The new version 1.3.2 fixes this issue, therefore it is enough to run again the job using an update version of the image to fix the issue. Solution Update the image k8s-webhook-cert-manager (to a version >= 1.3.2) and re-run the job. The secret will be correctly created and the k8s-metadata-injection pod will be able to start. Note that the new version of the manifest and of the nri-bundle are already updated with the correct version of the image. Problem In OpenShift version 4.x, the CA that is used in order to patch the mutatingwebhookconfiguration resource is not the one used when signing the certificates. This is a known issue currently tracked here. In the logs of the Pod nri-metadata-injection, you'll see the following error message: TLS handshake error from 10.131.0.29:37428: remote error: tls: unknown certificate authority TLS handshake error from 10.129.0.1:49314: remote error: tls: bad certificate Copy Workaround Manually update the certificate stored in the mutatingwebhookconfiguration object. The correct CA locations might change according to the cluster configuration. However, you can usually find the CA in the secret csr-signer in the namespace openshift-kube-controller-manager. Problem There is no Kubernetes metadata included in the transactions' attributes of your APM agent or in distributed tracing. Solution Verify that the environment variables are being correctly injected by following the instructions described in the Validate your installation step. If they are not present, get the name of the metadata injection pod by running: kubectl get pods | grep newrelic-metadata-injection-deployment kubectl logs -f pod/podname Copy In another terminal, create a new pod (for example, see Validate your installation), and inspect the logs of the metadata injection deployment for errors. For every created pod there should be a set of 4 new entries in the logs like: {\"level\":\"info\",\"ts\":\"2020-04-09T12:55:32.107Z\",\"caller\":\"server/main.go:139\",\"msg\":\"POST https://newrelic-metadata-injection-svc.default.svc:443/mutate?timeout=30s HTTP/2.0\\\" from 10.11.49.2:32836\"} {\"level\":\"info\",\"ts\":\"2020-04-09T12:55:32.110Z\",\"caller\":\"server/webhook.go:168\",\"msg\":\"received admission review\",\"kind\":\"/v1, Kind=Pod\",\"namespace\":\"default\",\"name\":\"\",\"pod\":\"busybox1\",\"UID\":\"6577519b-7a61-11ea-965e-0e46d1c9335c\",\"operation\":\"CREATE\",\"userinfo\":{\"username\":\"admin\",\"uid\":\"admin\",\"groups\":[\"system:masters\",\"system:authenticated\"]}} {\"level\":\"info\",\"ts\":\"2020-04-09T12:55:32.111Z\",\"caller\":\"server/webhook.go:182\",\"msg\":\"admission response created\",\"response\":\"[{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env\\\",\\\"value\\\":[{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_NAME\\\",\\\"value\\\":\\\"adn_kops\\\"}]},{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env/-\\\",\\\"value\\\":{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_NODE_NAME\\\",\\\"valueFrom\\\":{\\\"fieldRef\\\":{\\\"fieldPath\\\":\\\"spec.nodeName\\\"}}}},{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env/-\\\",\\\"value\\\":{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE_NAME\\\",\\\"valueFrom\\\":{\\\"fieldRef\\\":{\\\"fieldPath\\\":\\\"metadata.namespace\\\"}}}},{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env/-\\\",\\\"value\\\":{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_POD_NAME\\\",\\\"valueFrom\\\":{\\\"fieldRef\\\":{\\\"fieldPath\\\":\\\"metadata.name\\\"}}}},{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env/-\\\",\\\"value\\\":{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_CONTAINER_NAME\\\",\\\"value\\\":\\\"busybox\\\"}},{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env/-\\\",\\\"value\\\":{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_CONTAINER_IMAGE_NAME\\\",\\\"value\\\":\\\"busybox\\\"}}]\"} {\"level\":\"info\",\"ts\":\"2020-04-09T12:55:32.111Z\",\"caller\":\"server/webhook.go:257\",\"msg\":\"writing response\"} Copy If there are no new entries on the logs, it means that the apiserver is not being able to communicate with the webhook service, this could be due to networking rules or security groups rejecting the communication. To check if the apiserver is not being able to communicate with the webhook you should inspect the apiserver logs for errors like: failed calling webhook \"metadata-injection.newrelic.com\": ERROR_REASON Copy To get the apiserver logs: Start a proxy to the Kubernetes API server by the executing the following command in a terminal window and keep it running. kubectl proxy --port=8001 Copy Create a new pod in your cluster, this will make the apiserver try to communicate with the webhook. The following command will create a busybox. kubectl create -f https://git.io/vPieo Copy Retrieve the apiserver logs. curl localhost:8001/logs/kube-apiserver.log > apiserver.log Copy Delete the busybox container. kubectl delete -f https://git.io/vPieo Copy Inspect the logs for errors. grep -E 'failed calling webhook' apiserver.log Copy Remember that one of the requirements for the metadata injection is that the apiserver must be allowed egress to the pods running on the cluster. If you encounter errors regarding connection timeouts or failed connections, make sure to check the security groups and firewall rules of the cluster. If there are no log entries in either the apiserver logs or the metadata injection deployment, it means that the webhook was not properly registered. Ensure the metadata injection setup job ran successfully by inspecting the output of: kubectl get job newrelic-metadata-setup Copy If the job is not completed, investigate the logs of the setup job: kubectl logs job/newrelic-metadata-setup Copy Ensure the CertificateSigningRequest is approved and issued by running: kubectl get csr newrelic-metadata-injection-svc.default Copy Ensure the TLS secret is present by running: kubectl get secret newrelic-metadata-injection-secret Copy Ensure the CA bundle is present in the mutating webhook configuration: kubectl get mutatingwebhookconfiguration newrelic-metadata-injection-cfg -o json Copy Ensure the TargetPort of the Service resource matches the Port of the Deployment's container: kubectl describe service/newrelic-metadata-injection-svc kubectl describe deployment/newrelic-metadata-injection-deployment Copy",

      "body": "If you have a service running on Kubernetes, and it's a service we support, you can enable monitoring of that service by adding a configuration section for that integration to the Kubernetes integration's config. This tutorial shows how to enable monitoring for a Redis service running on the Kubernetes PHP Guestbook. For the general procedure, see Monitor a Kubernetes-running service. What you need See the general requirements for this feature, including supported services. The kubectl command-line tool must be configured to communicate with your cluster. If you don't have a cluster, you can create one using Minikube. Step 1: Set up an example Redis application This tutorial builds on the Kubernetes tutorial Deploying a PHP Guestbook application with Redis. Skip the Kubernetes tutorial and run the following command to set up the application needed for our tutorial: kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/examples/master/guestbook/all-in-one/guestbook-all-in-one.yaml Copy If you'd like to first complete the Kubernetes tutorial, follow their tutorial instructions but do not follow the instructions in the Cleaning up section. Step 2: Enable monitoring of Redis instances The PHP Guestbook application has three Redis instances: one master and two slave instances. Each instance is tagged with a label where app=redis. For this example, we're using our Redis monitoring integration. It can monitor both master and slave instances of Redis, so we don’t have to distinguish between them. In the Kubernetes integration's YAML config file (newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml), you need to update the nri-integration-cfg section. From the list of integration configs, get the Redis integration YAML and add it to the Kubernetes config. The Redis YAML is highlighted below. --- apiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap metadata: name: nri-integration-cfg namespace: default data: redis-config.yml: | --- # Run auto discovery to find pods with label \"app=redis\" # https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/host-integrations/installation/container-auto-discovery discovery: command: # Run discovery for Kubernetes.

You can use metrics from your New Relic account to autoscale applications and services in your Kubernetes cluster by deploying the New Relic Metrics Adapter. This adapter fetches the metric values from New Relic and makes them available for the Horizontal Pod Autoscalers. The newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter implements the external.metrics.k8s.io API to support the use of external metrics based New Relic NRQL queries results. Once deployed, the value for each configured metric is fetched using the NerdGraph API based on the configured NRQL query. The metrics adapter exposes the metrics over a secured endpoint with TLS. New Relic metrics adapter in a cluster. Requirements Kubernetes 1.16 or higher. The New Relic Kubernetes integration. New Relic's user API key. No other External Metrics Adapter installed in the cluster. Installation To install the New Relic Metrics Adapter, we provide the newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter Helm chart, which is also included in the nri-bundle chart used to deploy all New Relic Kubernetes components. If not already installed, install our Kubernetes integration. Upgrade the installation to include the New Relic Metrics Adapter with the following command: helm upgrade --install newrelic newrelic/nri-bundle \\ --namespace newrelic --create-namespace --reuse-values \\ --set metrics-adapter.enabled=true \\ --set newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.personalAPIKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_PERSONAL_API_KEY \\ --set newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.config.accountID=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID \\ --set newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.config.externalMetrics.external_metric_name.query=NRQL query Copy Please notice and adjust the following flags: metrics-adapter.enabled: Must be set to true so the metrics adapter chart is installed. newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.personalAPIKey: Must be set to valid New Relic Personal API key. newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.accountID: Must be set to valid New Relic account where metrics are going to be fetched from. newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.config.externalMetrics.<var>external_metric_name</var>.<var>query</var>: Adds a new external metric where: <var>external_metric_name</var>: The metric name. <var>query</var>: The base NRQL query that is used to get the value for the metric. Tip Alternatively, you can use a values.yaml file that can be passed to the helm command with the --values flag. Values files can contain all parameters needed to configure the metrics explained in the configuration section. Configuration You can configure multiple metrics in the metrics adapter and change some parameters to modify the behaviour of the metrics cache and filtering. To see the full list and descriptions of all parameters that can be modified, refer to the chart README.md and values.yaml files. How it works The following example is a Helm values file that enable the metrics adapter on the nri-bundle chart installation, and configures the nginx_average_requests metric: metrics-adapter: enabled: true newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter: personalAPIKey: <Personal API Key> config: accountID: <Account ID> externalMetrics: nginx_average_requests: query: \"FROM Metric SELECT average(nginx.server.net.requestsPerSecond) SINCE 2 MINUTES AGO\" Copy Caution The default time span for metrics is 1h. Therefore, you should define queries with the SINCE clause to adjust the time span according to your environment and needs. There is an HPA consuming the external metric as follows: kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler apiVersion: autoscaling/v2beta2 metadata: name: nginx-scaler spec: scaleTargetRef: apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment name: nginx minReplicas: 1 maxReplicas: 10 metrics: - type: External external: metric: name: nginx_average_requests selector: matchLabels: k8s.namespaceName: nginx target: type: Value value: 10000 Copy Based on the HPA definition, the controller manager fetches the metrics from the external metrics API which are served by the New Relic metrics adapter. The New Relic metrics adapter receives the query including the nginx_average_requests metric name and all the selectors, and searches for a matching metric name in the internal memory based on the configured metrics. Then, it adds the selectors to the query to form a final query that is executed using NerdGraph to fetch the value from New Relic. The above example will generate a query like the following: FROM Metric SELECT average(nginx.server.net.requestsPerSecond) WHERE clusterName=<clusterName> AND `k8s.namespaceName`='nginx' SINCE 2 MINUTES AGO Copy Notice that a clusterName filter has been automatically added to the query to exclude metrics from other clusters in the same account. You can remove it by using the removeClusterFilter configuration parameter. Also the value is cached for a period of time defined by the cacheTTLSeconds configuration parameter, whose default is 30 seconds. Troubleshooting Get verbose logs Most common errors are displayed in the standard (non-verbose) logs. If you're doing a more in-depth investigation on your own or with New Relic Support, you can enable verbose mode. To get verbose logging details for an integration using Helm: Enable verbose logging: bash Copy $ helm upgrade -n <namespace> --reuse-values newrelic-bundle --set newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.verboseLog=true newrelic/nri-bundle Leave on verbose mode for a few minutes, or until enough activity has occurred. When you have the information you need, disable verbose logging: bash Copy $ helm upgrade --reuse-values newrelic-bundle --set newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.verboseLog=false newrelic/nri-bundle Caution Verbose mode increases significantly the amount of information sent to log files. Enable this mode temporarily, only for troubleshooting purposes, and reset the log level when finished. Get raw metrics Sometimes it's useful to get the list of available metrics and also to get the current value of an specific metric. To get the list of metrics available, run: bash Copy $ kubectl get --raw \"/apis/external.metrics.k8s.io/v1beta1/\" To get the value for a specific metric with a selector, run: bash Copy $ kubectl get --raw \"/apis/external.metrics.k8s.io/v1beta1/namespaces/*/<metric_name>?labelSelector=<selector_key>=<selector_value>\" Tip You must replace <metric_name>, <selector_key> and <selector_value> with your values. Metrics not working There are some usual errors that could cause a metric fail to retrieve the value. These errors are showed in the status of the metrics when you describe the HPA or are printed when you get the raw metrics directly. executing query: NRQL Syntax Error: Error at line...: The query that is being run has syntax errors. The same error message gives you the executed query and position of the error. You can try this query inside the New Relic query builder and correct the configuration from the adapter. extracting return value: expected first value to be of type \"float64\", got %!q(<nil>): The query doesn't return any value. The same error message gives you the executed query so you can try this query inside the New Relic query builder and correct the configuration from the adapter or the match selectors in the HPA.",

      "body": "You can surface Kubernetes metadata and link it to your APM agents as distributed traces to explore performance issues and troubleshoot transaction errors. For more information, see this New Relic blog post. You can quickly start monitoring Kubernetes clusters using Auto-telemetry with Pixie, which is currently a beta release. This Pixie integration into New Relic does not require a language agent. Learn more about Auto-telemetry with Pixie here. Tip Our Kubernetes metadata injection project is open source. Here's the code to link APM and infrastructure data and the code to automatically manage certificates. Compatibility and requirements Before linking Kubernetes metadata to your APM agents, make sure you meet the following requirements: Kubernetes requirements Network requirements APM agent compatibility OpenShift requirements Kubernetes requirements To link your applications and Kubernetes, your cluster must have the MutatingAdmissionWebhook controller enabled, which requires Kubernetes 1.9 or higher. To verify that your cluster is compatible, run the following command: kubectl api-versions | grep admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1 admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1 Copy If you see a different result, follow the Kubernetes documentation to enable admission control in your cluster. Network requirements For Kubernetes to speak to our MutatingAdmissionWebhook, the master node (or the API server container, depending on how the cluster is set up) should be allowed egress for HTTPS traffic on port 443 to pods in all of the other nodes in the cluster. This might require specific configuration depending on how the infrastructure is set up (on-premises, AWS, Google Cloud, etc). Tip Until Kubernetes v1.14, users were only allowed to register admission webhooks on port 443. Since v1.15 it's possible to register them on different ports. To ensure backward compatibility, the webhook is registered by default on port 443 in the YAML config file we distribute. APM agent compatibility The following New Relic agents collect Kubernetes metadata: Go 2.3.0 or higher Java 4.10.0 or higher Node.js 5.3.0 or higher Python 4.14.0 or higher Ruby 6.1.0 or higher .NET 8.17.438 or higher Openshift requirements To link Openshift and Kubernetes you must enable mutating admission webhooks, which requires Openshift 3.9 or higher. During the process, install a resource that requires admin permissions to the cluster. Run this to log in as admin: oc login -u system:admin Copy Check that webhooks are correctly configured. If they are not, update the master-config.yaml file. admissionConfig: pluginConfig: MutatingAdmissionWebhook: configuration: apiVersion: apiserver.config.k8s.io/v1alpha1 kubeConfigFile: /dev/null kind: WebhookAdmission ValidatingAdmissionWebhook: configuration: apiVersion: apiserver.config.k8s.io/v1alpha1 kubeConfigFile: /dev/null kind: WebhookAdmission location: \"\" Copy Important Add kubeConfigFile: /dev/null to address some issues in Openshift. Enable certificate signing by editing the YAML file and updating your configuration: kubernetesMasterConfig: controllerArguments: cluster-signing-cert-file: - \"/etc/origin/master/ca.crt\" cluster-signing-key-file: - \"/etc/origin/master/ca.key\" Copy Restart the Openshift services in the master node. Configure the injection of metadata By default, all the pods you create that include APM agents have the correct environment variables set and the metadata injection applies to the entire cluster. To check that the environment variables have been set, any container that is running must be stopped, and a new instance started (see Validate the injection of metadata). This default configuration also uses the Kubernetes certificates API to automatically manage the certificates required for the injection. If needed, you can limit the injection of metadata to specific namespaces in your cluster or self-manage your certificates. Default configuration We offer instructions for deploying our integration using Helm. Just be sure that, when you are configuring the chart, the webhook that inject the metadata is enabled. Notice that we are specifying --dry-run and --debug, so nothing will be installed in this step: helm upgrade --install newrelic newrelic/nri-bundle \\ --dry-run \\ --debug \\ --namespace newrelic --create-namespace \\ --set global.licenseKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY \\ --set global.cluster=K8S_CLUSTER_NAME \\ --set ksm.enabled=true \\ --set newrelic-infrastructure.privileged=true \\ --set infrastructure.enabled=true \\ --set prometheus.enabled=true \\ --set webhook.enabled= true \\ --set kubeEvents.enabled=true \\ --set logging.enabled=true Copy Custom configuration You can limit the injection of metadata only to specific namespaces by using labels. To enable this feature, edit nri-bundle Helm values.yaml file: nri-metadata-injector: injectOnlyLabeledNamespaces: true Copy Or add a --set when installing or upgrading your Helm release: helm upgrade --install newrelic newrelic/nri-bundle \\ --dry-run \\ --debug \\ --namespace newrelic --create-namespace \\ --set global.licenseKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY \\ --set global.cluster=K8S_CLUSTER_NAME \\ --set ksm.enabled=true \\ --set newrelic-infrastructure.privileged=true \\ --set infrastructure.enabled=true \\ --set prometheus.enabled=true \\ --set webhook.enabled= true \\ --set nri-metadata-injector.injectOnlyLabeledNamespaces=true \\ --set kubeEvents.enabled=true \\ --set logging.enabled=true Copy With this option, injection is only applied to those namespaces that have the newrelic-metadata-injection label set to enabled: kubectl label namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE newrelic-metadata-injection=enabled Copy Manage custom certificates To use custom certificates you need to disable the automatic installation of certificates when you are installing using Helm. To disable the installation for certificates just modify nri-bundle Helm values.yaml like this: nri-metadata-injector: customTLSCertificate: true Copy Or add a --set when installing or upgrading your Helm release: helm upgrade --install newrelic newrelic/nri-bundle \\ --dry-run \\ --debug \\ --namespace newrelic --create-namespace \\ --set global.licenseKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY \\ --set global.cluster=K8S_CLUSTER_NAME \\ --set ksm.enabled=true \\ --set newrelic-infrastructure.privileged=true \\ --set infrastructure.enabled=true \\ --set prometheus.enabled=true \\ --set webhook.enabled= true \\ --set nri-metadata-injector.customTLSCertificate=true \\ --set kubeEvents.enabled=true \\ --set logging.enabled=true Copy Now you can proceed with the custom certificate management option. You need your certificate, server key, and Certification Authority (CA) bundle encoded in PEM format. If you have them in the standard certificate format (X.509), install openssl, and run the following: openssl x509 -in CERTIFICATE_FILENAME -outform PEM -out CERTIFICATE_FILENAME.pem openssl x509 -in SERVER_KEY_FILENAME -outform PEM -out SERVER_KEY_FILENAME.pem openssl x509 -in CA_BUNDLE_FILENAME -outform PEM -out BUNDLE_FILENAME.pem Copy If your certificate/key pair are in another format, see the Digicert knowledgebase for more help. Create the TLS secret with the signed certificate/key pair, and patch the mutating webhook configuration with the CA using the following commands: kubectl create secret tls newrelic-metadata-injection-admission \\ --key=PEM_ENCODED_SERVER_KEY \\ --cert=PEM_ENCODED_CERTIFICATE \\ --dry-run -o yaml | kubectl -n newrelic apply -f - caBundle=$(cat PEM_ENCODED_CA_BUNDLE | base64 | td -d $'\\n') kubectl patch mutatingwebhookconfiguration newrelic-metadata-injection-cfg --type='json' -p \"[{'op': 'replace', 'path': '/webhooks/0/clientConfig/caBundle', 'value':'${caBundle}'}]\" Copy Important Certificates signed by Kubernetes have an expiration of one year. For more information, see the Kubernetes source code in GitHub. Validate the injection of metadata In order to validate that the webhook (responsible for injecting the metadata) was installed correctly, deploy a new pod and check for the New Relic environment variables. Create a dummy pod containing Busybox by running: kubectl create -f https://git.io/vPieo Copy Check if New Relic environment variables were injected: kubectl exec busybox0 -- env | grep NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_NAME=fsi NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_NODE_NAME=nodea NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE_NAME=default NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_POD_NAME=busybox0 NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_CONTAINER_NAME=busybox Copy Disable the injection of metadata To disable/uninstall the injection of metadata, use the following commands: Delete the Kubernetes objects using the yaml file: kubectl delete -f k8s-metadata-injection-latest.yaml Copy Delete the TLS secret containing the certificate/key pair: kubectl delete secret/newrelic-metadata-injection-secret Copy Troubleshooting Follow these troubleshooting tips as needed. No Kubernetes metadata in APM or distributed tracing transactions Problem The creation of the secret by the k8s-webhook-cert-manager job used to fail due to the kubectl version used by the image when running in Kubernetes version 1.19.x, The new version 1.3.2 fixes this issue, therefore it is enough to run again the job using an update version of the image to fix the issue. Solution Update the image k8s-webhook-cert-manager (to a version >= 1.3.2) and re-run the job. The secret will be correctly created and the k8s-metadata-injection pod will be able to start. Note that the new version of the manifest and of the nri-bundle are already updated with the correct version of the image. Problem In OpenShift version 4.x, the CA that is used in order to patch the mutatingwebhookconfiguration resource is not the one used when signing the certificates. This is a known issue currently tracked here. In the logs of the Pod nri-metadata-injection, you'll see the following error message: TLS handshake error from 10.131.0.29:37428: remote error: tls: unknown certificate authority TLS handshake error from 10.129.0.1:49314: remote error: tls: bad certificate Copy Workaround Manually update the certificate stored in the mutatingwebhookconfiguration object. The correct CA locations might change according to the cluster configuration. However, you can usually find the CA in the secret csr-signer in the namespace openshift-kube-controller-manager. Problem There is no Kubernetes metadata included in the transactions' attributes of your APM agent or in distributed tracing. Solution Verify that the environment variables are being correctly injected by following the instructions described in the Validate your installation step. If they are not present, get the name of the metadata injection pod by running: kubectl get pods | grep newrelic-metadata-injection-deployment kubectl logs -f pod/podname Copy In another terminal, create a new pod (for example, see Validate your installation), and inspect the logs of the metadata injection deployment for errors. For every created pod there should be a set of 4 new entries in the logs like: {\"level\":\"info\",\"ts\":\"2020-04-09T12:55:32.107Z\",\"caller\":\"server/main.go:139\",\"msg\":\"POST https://newrelic-metadata-injection-svc.default.svc:443/mutate?timeout=30s HTTP/2.0\\\" from 10.11.49.2:32836\"} {\"level\":\"info\",\"ts\":\"2020-04-09T12:55:32.110Z\",\"caller\":\"server/webhook.go:168\",\"msg\":\"received admission review\",\"kind\":\"/v1, Kind=Pod\",\"namespace\":\"default\",\"name\":\"\",\"pod\":\"busybox1\",\"UID\":\"6577519b-7a61-11ea-965e-0e46d1c9335c\",\"operation\":\"CREATE\",\"userinfo\":{\"username\":\"admin\",\"uid\":\"admin\",\"groups\":[\"system:masters\",\"system:authenticated\"]}} {\"level\":\"info\",\"ts\":\"2020-04-09T12:55:32.111Z\",\"caller\":\"server/webhook.go:182\",\"msg\":\"admission response created\",\"response\":\"[{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env\\\",\\\"value\\\":[{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_NAME\\\",\\\"value\\\":\\\"adn_kops\\\"}]},{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env/-\\\",\\\"value\\\":{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_NODE_NAME\\\",\\\"valueFrom\\\":{\\\"fieldRef\\\":{\\\"fieldPath\\\":\\\"spec.nodeName\\\"}}}},{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env/-\\\",\\\"value\\\":{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE_NAME\\\",\\\"valueFrom\\\":{\\\"fieldRef\\\":{\\\"fieldPath\\\":\\\"metadata.namespace\\\"}}}},{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env/-\\\",\\\"value\\\":{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_POD_NAME\\\",\\\"valueFrom\\\":{\\\"fieldRef\\\":{\\\"fieldPath\\\":\\\"metadata.name\\\"}}}},{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env/-\\\",\\\"value\\\":{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_CONTAINER_NAME\\\",\\\"value\\\":\\\"busybox\\\"}},{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env/-\\\",\\\"value\\\":{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_CONTAINER_IMAGE_NAME\\\",\\\"value\\\":\\\"busybox\\\"}}]\"} {\"level\":\"info\",\"ts\":\"2020-04-09T12:55:32.111Z\",\"caller\":\"server/webhook.go:257\",\"msg\":\"writing response\"} Copy If there are no new entries on the logs, it means that the apiserver is not being able to communicate with the webhook service, this could be due to networking rules or security groups rejecting the communication. To check if the apiserver is not being able to communicate with the webhook you should inspect the apiserver logs for errors like: failed calling webhook \"metadata-injection.newrelic.com\": ERROR_REASON Copy To get the apiserver logs: Start a proxy to the Kubernetes API server by the executing the following command in a terminal window and keep it running. kubectl proxy --port=8001 Copy Create a new pod in your cluster, this will make the apiserver try to communicate with the webhook. The following command will create a busybox. kubectl create -f https://git.io/vPieo Copy Retrieve the apiserver logs. curl localhost:8001/logs/kube-apiserver.log > apiserver.log Copy Delete the busybox container. kubectl delete -f https://git.io/vPieo Copy Inspect the logs for errors. grep -E 'failed calling webhook' apiserver.log Copy Remember that one of the requirements for the metadata injection is that the apiserver must be allowed egress to the pods running on the cluster. If you encounter errors regarding connection timeouts or failed connections, make sure to check the security groups and firewall rules of the cluster. If there are no log entries in either the apiserver logs or the metadata injection deployment, it means that the webhook was not properly registered. Ensure the metadata injection setup job ran successfully by inspecting the output of: kubectl get job newrelic-metadata-setup Copy If the job is not completed, investigate the logs of the setup job: kubectl logs job/newrelic-metadata-setup Copy Ensure the CertificateSigningRequest is approved and issued by running: kubectl get csr newrelic-metadata-injection-svc.default Copy Ensure the TLS secret is present by running: kubectl get secret newrelic-metadata-injection-secret Copy Ensure the CA bundle is present in the mutating webhook configuration: kubectl get mutatingwebhookconfiguration newrelic-metadata-injection-cfg -o json Copy Ensure the TargetPort of the Service resource matches the Port of the Deployment's container: kubectl describe service/newrelic-metadata-injection-svc kubectl describe deployment/newrelic-metadata-injection-deployment Copy",

      "body": "With New Relic's Kubernetes integration you can monitor both Kubernetes and the services running on it, such as Cassandra, Redis, MySQL, and other supported services. Get started Our Kubernetes integration comes bundled with some of our on-host integrations (like Cassandra, MySQL, and Apache). This lets you get data for those supported services by adding a section to the Kubernetes integration's configuration, which lives as a ConfigMap inside a manifest. What you need Enable this feature for a service Details about how configuration works For an example of how to monitor Redis running on a Kubernetes PHP Guestbook, see this tutorial. What you need To monitor services running on Kubernetes, you only need a Kubernetes cluster running the Kubernetes integration, version 1.16.0 or higher (install | check version | update).

You should see data being reported. Additional notes about enabling services: Enabling multiple services may use more resources than what is set in the resource limits of the Kubernetes integration config file. If this becomes an issue, raise the limit in the resources section. The Kubernetes integration does not automatically update. For best results, regularly update. Monitor services in our Kubernetes integration installed with Helm If you installed our Kubernetes integration using Helm, to monitor services you need to update the existing installation with the new configuration, which contains the services to monitor: helm upgrade --reuse-values -f values.yaml [RELEASE] [CHART] Copy If you use nri-bundle charts, you need to update the children's chart values. Find some examples here. Learn more More resources for learning about configuration: Learn technical details about how configuration works. Learn how to configure monitoring of multiple services with the same config file. See a step-by-step tutorial showing how to monitor a Redis service on Kubernetes. Manually configure service monitoring The enable procedure should be all you need to get monitoring working, but if you run into problems, understanding some technical details about configuration can be helpful. This section goes into more detail about how configuration works. For each service you wish to monitor, you must add a configuration file for that integration to our Kubernetes integration's configuration. This document will cover these subjects: How the service-specific configuration YAML snippet works Adding the service-specific YAML in the Kubernetes integration's config file Adding multiple services to the Kubernetes integration's config file How the service-specific YAML config works Our Kubernetes integration's configuration follows the ConfigMap format. Using a ConfigMap allows us to decouple the configuration for the integrations from the Kubernetes image. The other benefit is that a ConfigMap can be updated automatically without reloading the running container. Because the infrastructure agent uses YAML to configure its associated integrations, ConfigMaps are a good choice for storing YAML. (For more information on config file format, see the Integration config file format.) The Kubernetes integration image comes with an auto-discovery feature that simplifies the configuration of multiple instances of services using a single configuration file. For example, if you have several NGINX instances running, creating an NGINX integration configuration file for every instance would be hard to implement and hard to update. With our auto-discovery option, you can discover and monitor all your NGINX instances with a single configuration file. Each integration has its own specific configuration YAML. Our NGINX integration default config file looks like this: nginx-config.yml: | --- discovery: command: # Use the following optional arguments : # --namespaces: Comma separated list of namespaces to discover pods on # --port: Port used to connect to the kubelet. Default is 10255 # --tls: Use secure (TLS) connection # Custom Example: # exec: /var/db/newrelic-infra/nri-discovery-kubernetes --namespaces namespace1,namespace2 --port 10250 --tls # Default exec: /var/db/newrelic-infra/nri-discovery-kubernetes match: label.app: nginx integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: STATUS_URL: http://${discovery.ip}/status STATUS_MODULE: discover METRICS: 1 Copy The above config enables the following: Runs nri-discovery-kubernetes to query the data for the node we are currently on. Parses the data that comes back and looks for any Kubernetes pod that has a Kubernetes container with an app= label with value nginx. For any matches, it attempts to run the NGINX integration. The status URL is built from: The pod's IP address The status page is pulled from the label on K8s pod called status_url This automatic discovery works the same as the container auto-discovery used by the infrastructure agent. For more advanced options, see Container auto-discovery. Add a service YAML to the Kubernetes integration config It's best practice to configure enabled integrations alongside the Kubernetes integration configuration. This is easier than maintaining configuration files for every single service/integration instance. Below is an example of a Kubernetes integration's ConfigMap. The highlighted section shows where an integration configuration YAML (in this case, NGINX) is placed. For more information on discovery:, see Container auto-discovery for on-host integrations. --- apiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap metadata: name: nri-integration-cfg namespace: default data: nginx-config.yml: | --- # Run auto discovery to find pods with label \"app=nginx\" # https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/host-integrations/installation/container-auto-discovery discovery: command: # Use the following optional arguments : # --namespaces: Comma separated list of namespaces to discover pods on # --tls: Use secure (TLS) connection # --port: Port used to connect to the kubelet.

Make sure the namespace used is the same one used by the Kubernetes integration manifest. If you haven't changed it in the downloaded manifest file, the value is default. Add multiple services to the same config You can monitor several services using the same Kubernetes integration config file. To do this, add another integration configuration YAML to the same Kubernetes integration config file. Below is the Kubernetes config created in the last section, with a new section for the Cassandra integration's config (highlighted). --- apiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap metadata: name: nri-integration-cfg namespace: default data: nginx-config.yml: | --- # Run auto discovery to find pods with label \"app=nginx\" # https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/host-integrations/installation/container-auto-discovery discovery: command: # Run discovery for Kubernetes.

      "body": "BETA FEATURE This feature is still in development, but we encourage you to try it out! You can use metrics from your New Relic account to autoscale applications and services in your Kubernetes cluster by deploying the New Relic Metrics Adapter. This adapter fetches the metric values from New Relic and makes them available for the Horizontal Pod Autoscalers. The newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter implements the external.metrics.k8s.io API to support the use of external metrics based New Relic NRQL queries results. Once deployed, the value for each configured metric is fetched using the NerdGraph API based on the configured NRQL query. The metrics adapter exposes the metrics over a secured endpoint with TLS. New Relic metrics adapter in a cluster. Requirements Kubernetes 1.16 or higher. The New Relic Kubernetes integration. New Relic's user API key. No other External Metrics Adapter installed in the cluster. Installation To install the New Relic Metrics Adapter, we provide the newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter Helm chart, which is also included in the nri-bundle chart used to deploy all New Relic Kubernetes components. If not already installed, install our Kubernetes integration. Upgrade the installation to include the New Relic Metrics Adapter with the following command: helm upgrade --install newrelic newrelic/nri-bundle \\ --namespace newrelic --create-namespace --reuse-values \\ --set metrics-adapter.enabled=true \\ --set newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.personalAPIKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_PERSONAL_API_KEY \\ --set newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.config.accountID=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID \\ --set newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.config.externalMetrics.external_metric_name.query=NRQL query Copy Please notice and adjust the following flags: metrics-adapter.enabled: Must be set to true so the metrics adapter chart is installed. newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.personalAPIKey: Must be set to valid New Relic Personal API key. newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.accountID: Must be set to valid New Relic account where metrics are going to be fetched from. newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.config.externalMetrics.<var>external_metric_name</var>.<var>query</var>: Adds a new external metric where: <var>external_metric_name</var>: The metric name. <var>query</var>: The base NRQL query that is used to get the value for the metric. Tip Alternatively, you can use a values.yaml file that can be passed to the helm command with the --values flag. Values files can contain all parameters needed to configure the metrics explained in the configuration section. Configuration You can configure multiple metrics in the metrics adapter and change some parameters to modify the behaviour of the metrics cache and filtering. To see the full list and descriptions of all parameters that can be modified, refer to the chart README.md and values.yaml files. How it works The following example is a Helm values file that enable the metrics adapter on the nri-bundle chart installation, and configures the nginx_average_requests metric: metrics-adapter: enabled: true newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter: personalAPIKey: <Personal API Key> config: accountID: <Account ID> externalMetrics: nginx_average_requests: query: \"FROM Metric SELECT average(nginx.server.net.requestsPerSecond) SINCE 2 MINUTES AGO\" Copy Caution The default time span for metrics is 1h. Therefore, you should define queries with the SINCE clause to adjust the time span according to your environment and needs. There is an HPA consuming the external metric as follows: kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler apiVersion: autoscaling/v2beta2 metadata: name: nginx-scaler spec: scaleTargetRef: apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment name: nginx minReplicas: 1 maxReplicas: 10 metrics: - type: External external: metric: name: nginx_average_requests selector: matchLabels: k8s.namespaceName: nginx target: type: Value value: 10000 Copy Based on the HPA definition, the controller manager fetches the metrics from the external metrics API which are served by the New Relic metrics adapter. The New Relic metrics adapter receives the query including the nginx_average_requests metric name and all the selectors, and searches for a matching metric name in the internal memory based on the configured metrics. Then, it adds the selectors to the query to form a final query that is executed using NerdGraph to fetch the value from New Relic. The above example will generate a query like the following: FROM Metric SELECT average(nginx.server.net.requestsPerSecond) WHERE clusterName=<clusterName> AND `k8s.namespaceName`='nginx' SINCE 2 MINUTES AGO Copy Notice that a clusterName filter has been automatically added to the query to exclude metrics from other clusters in the same account. You can remove it by using the removeClusterFilter configuration parameter. Also the value is cached for a period of time defined by the cacheTTLSeconds configuration parameter, whose default is 30 seconds. Troubleshooting Get verbose logs Most common errors are displayed in the standard (non-verbose) logs. If you're doing a more in-depth investigation on your own or with New Relic Support, you can enable verbose mode. To get verbose logging details for an integration using Helm: Enable verbose logging: bash Copy $ helm upgrade -n <namespace> --reuse-values newrelic-bundle --set newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.verboseLog=true newrelic/nri-bundle Leave on verbose mode for a few minutes, or until enough activity has occurred. When you have the information you need, disable verbose logging: bash Copy $ helm upgrade --reuse-values newrelic-bundle --set newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.verboseLog=false newrelic/nri-bundle Caution Verbose mode increases significantly the amount of information sent to log files. Enable this mode temporarily, only for troubleshooting purposes, and reset the log level when finished. Get raw metrics Sometimes it's useful to get the list of available metrics and also to get the current value of an specific metric. To get the list of metrics available, run: bash Copy $ kubectl get --raw \"/apis/external.metrics.k8s.io/v1beta1/\" To get the value for a specific metric with a selector, run: bash Copy $ kubectl get --raw \"/apis/external.metrics.k8s.io/v1beta1/namespaces/*/<metric_name>?labelSelector=<selector_key>=<selector_value>\" Tip You must replace <metric_name>, <selector_key> and <selector_value> with your values. Metrics not working There are some usual errors that could cause a metric fail to retrieve the value. These errors are showed in the status of the metrics when you describe the HPA or are printed when you get the raw metrics directly. executing query: NRQL Syntax Error: Error at line...: The query that is being run has syntax errors. The same error message gives you the executed query and position of the error. You can try this query inside the New Relic query builder and correct the configuration from the adapter. extracting return value: expected first value to be of type \"float64\", got %!q(<nil>): The query doesn't return any value. The same error message gives you the executed query so you can try this query inside the New Relic query builder and correct the configuration from the adapter or the match selectors in the HPA.",

Additional notes about enabling services: Enabling multiple services may use more resources than what is set in the resource limits of the Kubernetes integration config file. If this becomes an issue, raise the limit in the resources section. The Kubernetes integration does not automatically update. For best results, regularly update. Monitor services in our Kubernetes integration installed with Helm If you installed our Kubernetes integration using Helm, to monitor services you need to update the existing installation with the new configuration, which contains the services to monitor: helm upgrade --reuse-values -f values.yaml [RELEASE] [CHART] Copy If you use nri-bundle charts, you need to update the children's chart values. Find some examples here. Learn more More resources for learning about configuration: Learn technical details about how configuration works. Learn how to configure monitoring of multiple services with the same config file. See a step-by-step tutorial showing how to monitor a Redis service on Kubernetes. Manually configure service monitoring The enable procedure should be all you need to get monitoring working, but if you run into problems, understanding some technical details about configuration can be helpful. This section goes into more detail about how configuration works. For each service you wish to monitor, you must add a configuration file for that integration to our Kubernetes integration's configuration. This document will cover these subjects: How the service-specific configuration YAML snippet works Adding the service-specific YAML in the Kubernetes integration's config file Adding multiple services to the Kubernetes integration's config file How the service-specific YAML config works Our Kubernetes integration's configuration follows the ConfigMap format. Using a ConfigMap allows us to decouple the configuration for the integrations from the Kubernetes image. The other benefit is that a ConfigMap can be updated automatically without reloading the running container. Because the infrastructure agent uses YAML to configure its associated integrations, ConfigMaps are a good choice for storing YAML. (For more information on config file format, see the Integration config file format.) The Kubernetes integration image comes with an auto-discovery feature that simplifies the configuration of multiple instances of services using a single configuration file. For example, if you have several NGINX instances running, creating an NGINX integration configuration file for every instance would be hard to implement and hard to update. With our auto-discovery option, you can discover and monitor all your NGINX instances with a single configuration file. Each integration has its own specific configuration YAML. Our NGINX integration default config file looks like this: nginx-config.yml: | --- discovery: command: # Use the following optional arguments : # --namespaces: Comma separated list of namespaces to discover pods on # --port: Port used to connect to the kubelet. Default is 10255 # --tls: Use secure (TLS) connection # Custom Example: # exec: /var/db/newrelic-infra/nri-discovery-kubernetes --namespaces namespace1,namespace2 --port 10250 --tls # Default exec: /var/db/newrelic-infra/nri-discovery-kubernetes match: label.app: nginx integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: STATUS_URL: http://${discovery.ip}/status STATUS_MODULE: discover METRICS: 1 Copy The above config enables the following: Runs nri-discovery-kubernetes to query the data for the node we are currently on.

      "body": "If you have a service running on Kubernetes, and it's a service we support, you can enable monitoring of that service by adding a configuration section for that integration to the Kubernetes integration's config. This tutorial shows how to enable monitoring for a Redis service running on the Kubernetes PHP Guestbook. For the general procedure, see Monitor a Kubernetes-running service. What you need See the general requirements for this feature, including supported services. The kubectl command-line tool must be configured to communicate with your cluster. If you don't have a cluster, you can create one using Minikube. Step 1: Set up an example Redis application This tutorial builds on the Kubernetes tutorial Deploying a PHP Guestbook application with Redis. Skip the Kubernetes tutorial and run the following command to set up the application needed for our tutorial: kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/examples/master/guestbook/all-in-one/guestbook-all-in-one.yaml Copy If you'd like to first complete the Kubernetes tutorial, follow their tutorial instructions but do not follow the instructions in the Cleaning up section. Step 2: Enable monitoring of Redis instances The PHP Guestbook application has three Redis instances: one master and two slave instances. Each instance is tagged with a label where app=redis. For this example, we're using our Redis monitoring integration. It can monitor both master and slave instances of Redis, so we don’t have to distinguish between them. In the Kubernetes integration's YAML config file (newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml), you need to update the nri-integration-cfg section. From the list of integration configs, get the Redis integration YAML and add it to the Kubernetes config. The Redis YAML is highlighted below. --- apiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap metadata: name: nri-integration-cfg namespace: default data: redis-config.yml: | --- # Run auto discovery to find pods with label \"app=redis\" # https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/host-integrations/installation/container-auto-discovery discovery: command: # Run discovery for Kubernetes. Use the following optional arguments : # --namespaces: Comma separated list of namespaces to discover pods on # --tls: Use secure (TLS) connection # --port: Port used to connect to the kubelet. Default is 10255 exec: /var/db/newrelic-infra/nri-discovery-kubernetes --port PORT --tls match: label.app: redis integrations: - name: nri-redis env: # using the discovered IP as the hostname address HOSTNAME: ${discovery.ip} PORT: 6379 KEYS: '{\"0\":[\"<KEY_1>\"],\"1\":[\"<KEY_2>\"]}' REMOTE_MONITORING: true labels: env: production Copy Deploy the updated service: kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy You should be able to see the following in the logs for the pod newrelic-infra: time=\"2019-12-23T17:37:07Z\" level=info msg=\"Integration health check starting\" instance=redis-metrics integration=com.newrelic.redis prefix=integration/com.newrelic.redis working-dir=/var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations time=\"2019-12-23T17:37:07Z\" level=info msg=\"Integration health check finished with success\" instance=redis-metrics integration=com.newrelic.redis prefix=integration/com.newrelic.redis working-dir=/var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations Copy If there are no errors, you should see Redis data in the Infrastructure UI.

      "body": "You can surface Kubernetes metadata and link it to your APM agents as distributed traces to explore performance issues and troubleshoot transaction errors. For more information, see this New Relic blog post. You can quickly start monitoring Kubernetes clusters using Auto-telemetry with Pixie, which is currently a beta release. This Pixie integration into New Relic does not require a language agent. Learn more about Auto-telemetry with Pixie here. Tip Our Kubernetes metadata injection project is open source. Here's the code to link APM and infrastructure data and the code to automatically manage certificates. Compatibility and requirements Before linking Kubernetes metadata to your APM agents, make sure you meet the following requirements: Kubernetes requirements Network requirements APM agent compatibility OpenShift requirements Kubernetes requirements To link your applications and Kubernetes, your cluster must have the MutatingAdmissionWebhook controller enabled, which requires Kubernetes 1.9 or higher. To verify that your cluster is compatible, run the following command: kubectl api-versions | grep admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1 admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1 Copy If you see a different result, follow the Kubernetes documentation to enable admission control in your cluster. Network requirements For Kubernetes to speak to our MutatingAdmissionWebhook, the master node (or the API server container, depending on how the cluster is set up) should be allowed egress for HTTPS traffic on port 443 to pods in all of the other nodes in the cluster. This might require specific configuration depending on how the infrastructure is set up (on-premises, AWS, Google Cloud, etc). Tip Until Kubernetes v1.14, users were only allowed to register admission webhooks on port 443. Since v1.15 it's possible to register them on different ports. To ensure backward compatibility, the webhook is registered by default on port 443 in the YAML config file we distribute. APM agent compatibility The following New Relic agents collect Kubernetes metadata: Go 2.3.0 or higher Java 4.10.0 or higher Node.js 5.3.0 or higher Python 4.14.0 or higher Ruby 6.1.0 or higher .NET 8.17.438 or higher Openshift requirements To link Openshift and Kubernetes you must enable mutating admission webhooks, which requires Openshift 3.9 or higher. During the process, install a resource that requires admin permissions to the cluster. Run this to log in as admin: oc login -u system:admin Copy Check that webhooks are correctly configured. If they are not, update the master-config.yaml file. admissionConfig: pluginConfig: MutatingAdmissionWebhook: configuration: apiVersion: apiserver.config.k8s.io/v1alpha1 kubeConfigFile: /dev/null kind: WebhookAdmission ValidatingAdmissionWebhook: configuration: apiVersion: apiserver.config.k8s.io/v1alpha1 kubeConfigFile: /dev/null kind: WebhookAdmission location: \"\" Copy Important Add kubeConfigFile: /dev/null to address some issues in Openshift. Enable certificate signing by editing the YAML file and updating your configuration: kubernetesMasterConfig: controllerArguments: cluster-signing-cert-file: - \"/etc/origin/master/ca.crt\" cluster-signing-key-file: - \"/etc/origin/master/ca.key\" Copy Restart the Openshift services in the master node. Configure the injection of metadata By default, all the pods you create that include APM agents have the correct environment variables set and the metadata injection applies to the entire cluster. To check that the environment variables have been set, any container that is running must be stopped, and a new instance started (see Validate the injection of metadata). This default configuration also uses the Kubernetes certificates API to automatically manage the certificates required for the injection. If needed, you can limit the injection of metadata to specific namespaces in your cluster or self-manage your certificates. Default configuration We offer instructions for deploying our integration using Helm. Just be sure that, when you are configuring the chart, the webhook that inject the metadata is enabled. Notice that we are specifying --dry-run and --debug, so nothing will be installed in this step: helm upgrade --install newrelic newrelic/nri-bundle \\ --dry-run \\ --debug \\ --namespace newrelic --create-namespace \\ --set global.licenseKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY \\ --set global.cluster=K8S_CLUSTER_NAME \\ --set ksm.enabled=true \\ --set newrelic-infrastructure.privileged=true \\ --set infrastructure.enabled=true \\ --set prometheus.enabled=true \\ --set webhook.enabled= true \\ --set kubeEvents.enabled=true \\ --set logging.enabled=true Copy Custom configuration You can limit the injection of metadata only to specific namespaces by using labels. To enable this feature, edit nri-bundle Helm values.yaml file: nri-metadata-injector: injectOnlyLabeledNamespaces: true Copy Or add a --set when installing or upgrading your Helm release: helm upgrade --install newrelic newrelic/nri-bundle \\ --dry-run \\ --debug \\ --namespace newrelic --create-namespace \\ --set global.licenseKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY \\ --set global.cluster=K8S_CLUSTER_NAME \\ --set ksm.enabled=true \\ --set newrelic-infrastructure.privileged=true \\ --set infrastructure.enabled=true \\ --set prometheus.enabled=true \\ --set webhook.enabled= true \\ --set nri-metadata-injector.injectOnlyLabeledNamespaces=true \\ --set kubeEvents.enabled=true \\ --set logging.enabled=true Copy With this option, injection is only applied to those namespaces that have the newrelic-metadata-injection label set to enabled: kubectl label namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE newrelic-metadata-injection=enabled Copy Manage custom certificates To use custom certificates you need to disable the automatic installation of certificates when you are installing using Helm. To disable the installation for certificates just modify nri-bundle Helm values.yaml like this: nri-metadata-injector: customTLSCertificate: true Copy Or add a --set when installing or upgrading your Helm release: helm upgrade --install newrelic newrelic/nri-bundle \\ --dry-run \\ --debug \\ --namespace newrelic --create-namespace \\ --set global.licenseKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY \\ --set global.cluster=K8S_CLUSTER_NAME \\ --set ksm.enabled=true \\ --set newrelic-infrastructure.privileged=true \\ --set infrastructure.enabled=true \\ --set prometheus.enabled=true \\ --set webhook.enabled= true \\ --set nri-metadata-injector.customTLSCertificate=true \\ --set kubeEvents.enabled=true \\ --set logging.enabled=true Copy Now you can proceed with the custom certificate management option. You need your certificate, server key, and Certification Authority (CA) bundle encoded in PEM format. If you have them in the standard certificate format (X.509), install openssl, and run the following: openssl x509 -in CERTIFICATE_FILENAME -outform PEM -out CERTIFICATE_FILENAME.pem openssl x509 -in SERVER_KEY_FILENAME -outform PEM -out SERVER_KEY_FILENAME.pem openssl x509 -in CA_BUNDLE_FILENAME -outform PEM -out BUNDLE_FILENAME.pem Copy If your certificate/key pair are in another format, see the Digicert knowledgebase for more help. Create the TLS secret with the signed certificate/key pair, and patch the mutating webhook configuration with the CA using the following commands: kubectl create secret tls newrelic-metadata-injection-admission \\ --key=PEM_ENCODED_SERVER_KEY \\ --cert=PEM_ENCODED_CERTIFICATE \\ --dry-run -o yaml | kubectl -n newrelic apply -f - caBundle=$(cat PEM_ENCODED_CA_BUNDLE | base64 | td -d $'\\n') kubectl patch mutatingwebhookconfiguration newrelic-metadata-injection-cfg --type='json' -p \"[{'op': 'replace', 'path': '/webhooks/0/clientConfig/caBundle', 'value':'${caBundle}'}]\" Copy Important Certificates signed by Kubernetes have an expiration of one year. For more information, see the Kubernetes source code in GitHub. Validate the injection of metadata In order to validate that the webhook (responsible for injecting the metadata) was installed correctly, deploy a new pod and check for the New Relic environment variables. Create a dummy pod containing Busybox by running: kubectl create -f https://git.io/vPieo Copy Check if New Relic environment variables were injected: kubectl exec busybox0 -- env | grep NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_NAME=fsi NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_NODE_NAME=nodea NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE_NAME=default NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_POD_NAME=busybox0 NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_CONTAINER_NAME=busybox Copy Disable the injection of metadata To disable/uninstall the injection of metadata, use the following commands: Delete the Kubernetes objects using the yaml file: kubectl delete -f k8s-metadata-injection-latest.yaml Copy Delete the TLS secret containing the certificate/key pair: kubectl delete secret/newrelic-metadata-injection-secret Copy Troubleshooting Follow these troubleshooting tips as needed. No Kubernetes metadata in APM or distributed tracing transactions Problem The creation of the secret by the k8s-webhook-cert-manager job used to fail due to the kubectl version used by the image when running in Kubernetes version 1.19.x, The new version 1.3.2 fixes this issue, therefore it is enough to run again the job using an update version of the image to fix the issue. Solution Update the image k8s-webhook-cert-manager (to a version >= 1.3.2) and re-run the job. The secret will be correctly created and the k8s-metadata-injection pod will be able to start. Note that the new version of the manifest and of the nri-bundle are already updated with the correct version of the image. Problem In OpenShift version 4.x, the CA that is used in order to patch the mutatingwebhookconfiguration resource is not the one used when signing the certificates. This is a known issue currently tracked here. In the logs of the Pod nri-metadata-injection, you'll see the following error message: TLS handshake error from 10.131.0.29:37428: remote error: tls: unknown certificate authority TLS handshake error from 10.129.0.1:49314: remote error: tls: bad certificate Copy Workaround Manually update the certificate stored in the mutatingwebhookconfiguration object. The correct CA locations might change according to the cluster configuration. However, you can usually find the CA in the secret csr-signer in the namespace openshift-kube-controller-manager. Problem There is no Kubernetes metadata included in the transactions' attributes of your APM agent or in distributed tracing. Solution Verify that the environment variables are being correctly injected by following the instructions described in the Validate your installation step. If they are not present, get the name of the metadata injection pod by running: kubectl get pods | grep newrelic-metadata-injection-deployment kubectl logs -f pod/podname Copy In another terminal, create a new pod (for example, see Validate your installation), and inspect the logs of the metadata injection deployment for errors. For every created pod there should be a set of 4 new entries in the logs like: {\"level\":\"info\",\"ts\":\"2020-04-09T12:55:32.107Z\",\"caller\":\"server/main.go:139\",\"msg\":\"POST https://newrelic-metadata-injection-svc.default.svc:443/mutate?timeout=30s HTTP/2.0\\\" from 10.11.49.2:32836\"} {\"level\":\"info\",\"ts\":\"2020-04-09T12:55:32.110Z\",\"caller\":\"server/webhook.go:168\",\"msg\":\"received admission review\",\"kind\":\"/v1, Kind=Pod\",\"namespace\":\"default\",\"name\":\"\",\"pod\":\"busybox1\",\"UID\":\"6577519b-7a61-11ea-965e-0e46d1c9335c\",\"operation\":\"CREATE\",\"userinfo\":{\"username\":\"admin\",\"uid\":\"admin\",\"groups\":[\"system:masters\",\"system:authenticated\"]}} {\"level\":\"info\",\"ts\":\"2020-04-09T12:55:32.111Z\",\"caller\":\"server/webhook.go:182\",\"msg\":\"admission response created\",\"response\":\"[{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env\\\",\\\"value\\\":[{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_NAME\\\",\\\"value\\\":\\\"adn_kops\\\"}]},{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env/-\\\",\\\"value\\\":{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_NODE_NAME\\\",\\\"valueFrom\\\":{\\\"fieldRef\\\":{\\\"fieldPath\\\":\\\"spec.nodeName\\\"}}}},{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env/-\\\",\\\"value\\\":{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE_NAME\\\",\\\"valueFrom\\\":{\\\"fieldRef\\\":{\\\"fieldPath\\\":\\\"metadata.namespace\\\"}}}},{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env/-\\\",\\\"value\\\":{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_POD_NAME\\\",\\\"valueFrom\\\":{\\\"fieldRef\\\":{\\\"fieldPath\\\":\\\"metadata.name\\\"}}}},{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env/-\\\",\\\"value\\\":{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_CONTAINER_NAME\\\",\\\"value\\\":\\\"busybox\\\"}},{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env/-\\\",\\\"value\\\":{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_CONTAINER_IMAGE_NAME\\\",\\\"value\\\":\\\"busybox\\\"}}]\"} {\"level\":\"info\",\"ts\":\"2020-04-09T12:55:32.111Z\",\"caller\":\"server/webhook.go:257\",\"msg\":\"writing response\"} Copy If there are no new entries on the logs, it means that the apiserver is not being able to communicate with the webhook service, this could be due to networking rules or security groups rejecting the communication. To check if the apiserver is not being able to communicate with the webhook you should inspect the apiserver logs for errors like: failed calling webhook \"metadata-injection.newrelic.com\": ERROR_REASON Copy To get the apiserver logs: Start a proxy to the Kubernetes API server by the executing the following command in a terminal window and keep it running. kubectl proxy --port=8001 Copy Create a new pod in your cluster, this will make the apiserver try to communicate with the webhook. The following command will create a busybox. kubectl create -f https://git.io/vPieo Copy Retrieve the apiserver logs. curl localhost:8001/logs/kube-apiserver.log > apiserver.log Copy Delete the busybox container. kubectl delete -f https://git.io/vPieo Copy Inspect the logs for errors. grep -E 'failed calling webhook' apiserver.log Copy Remember that one of the requirements for the metadata injection is that the apiserver must be allowed egress to the pods running on the cluster. If you encounter errors regarding connection timeouts or failed connections, make sure to check the security groups and firewall rules of the cluster. If there are no log entries in either the apiserver logs or the metadata injection deployment, it means that the webhook was not properly registered. Ensure the metadata injection setup job ran successfully by inspecting the output of: kubectl get job newrelic-metadata-setup Copy If the job is not completed, investigate the logs of the setup job: kubectl logs job/newrelic-metadata-setup Copy Ensure the CertificateSigningRequest is approved and issued by running: kubectl get csr newrelic-metadata-injection-svc.default Copy Ensure the TLS secret is present by running: kubectl get secret newrelic-metadata-injection-secret Copy Ensure the CA bundle is present in the mutating webhook configuration: kubectl get mutatingwebhookconfiguration newrelic-metadata-injection-cfg -o json Copy Ensure the TargetPort of the Service resource matches the Port of the Deployment's container: kubectl describe service/newrelic-metadata-injection-svc kubectl describe deployment/newrelic-metadata-injection-deployment Copy",

Get started Our Kubernetes integration comes bundled with some of our on-host integrations (like Cassandra, MySQL, and Apache). This lets you get data for those supported services by adding a section to the Kubernetes integration's configuration, which lives as a ConfigMap inside a manifest. What you need Enable this feature for a service Details about how configuration works For an example of how to monitor Redis running on a Kubernetes PHP Guestbook, see this tutorial. What you need To monitor services running on Kubernetes, you only need a Kubernetes cluster running the Kubernetes integration, version 1.16.0 or higher (install | check version | update).

You should see data being reported. Additional notes about enabling services: Enabling multiple services may use more resources than what is set in the resource limits of the Kubernetes integration config file. If this becomes an issue, raise the limit in the resources section. The Kubernetes integration does not automatically update. For best results, regularly update. Monitor services in our Kubernetes integration installed with Helm If you installed our Kubernetes integration using Helm, to monitor services you need to update the existing installation with the new configuration, which contains the services to monitor: helm upgrade --reuse-values -f values.yaml [RELEASE] [CHART] Copy If you use nri-bundle charts, you need to update the children's chart values. Find some examples here. Learn more More resources for learning about configuration: Learn technical details about how configuration works. Learn how to configure monitoring of multiple services with the same config file. See a step-by-step tutorial showing how to monitor a Redis service on Kubernetes. Manually configure service monitoring The enable procedure should be all you need to get monitoring working, but if you run into problems, understanding some technical details about configuration can be helpful. This section goes into more detail about how configuration works. For each service you wish to monitor, you must add a configuration file for that integration to our Kubernetes integration's configuration. This document will cover these subjects: How the service-specific configuration YAML snippet works Adding the service-specific YAML in the Kubernetes integration's config file Adding multiple services to the Kubernetes integration's config file How the service-specific YAML config works Our Kubernetes integration's configuration follows the ConfigMap format. Using a ConfigMap allows us to decouple the configuration for the integrations from the Kubernetes image. The other benefit is that a ConfigMap can be updated automatically without reloading the running container. Because the infrastructure agent uses YAML to configure its associated integrations, ConfigMaps are a good choice for storing YAML. (For more information on config file format, see the Integration config file format.) The Kubernetes integration image comes with an auto-discovery feature that simplifies the configuration of multiple instances of services using a single configuration file. For example, if you have several NGINX instances running, creating an NGINX integration configuration file for every instance would be hard to implement and hard to update. With our auto-discovery option, you can discover and monitor all your NGINX instances with a single configuration file. Each integration has its own specific configuration YAML. Our NGINX integration default config file looks like this: nginx-config.yml: | --- discovery: command: # Use the following optional arguments : # --namespaces: Comma separated list of namespaces to discover pods on # --port: Port used to connect to the kubelet. Default is 10255 # --tls: Use secure (TLS) connection # Custom Example: # exec: /var/db/newrelic-infra/nri-discovery-kubernetes --namespaces namespace1,namespace2 --port 10250 --tls # Default exec: /var/db/newrelic-infra/nri-discovery-kubernetes match: label.app: nginx integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: STATUS_URL: http://${discovery.ip}/status STATUS_MODULE: discover METRICS: 1 Copy The above config enables the following: Runs nri-discovery-kubernetes to query the data for the node we are currently on. Parses the data that comes back and looks for any Kubernetes pod that has a Kubernetes container with an app= label with value nginx. For any matches, it attempts to run the NGINX integration. The status URL is built from: The pod's IP address The status page is pulled from the label on K8s pod called status_url This automatic discovery works the same as the container auto-discovery used by the infrastructure agent. For more advanced options, see Container auto-discovery. Add a service YAML to the Kubernetes integration config It's best practice to configure enabled integrations alongside the Kubernetes integration configuration. This is easier than maintaining configuration files for every single service/integration instance. Below is an example of a Kubernetes integration's ConfigMap. The highlighted section shows where an integration configuration YAML (in this case, NGINX) is placed. For more information on discovery:, see Container auto-discovery for on-host integrations. --- apiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap metadata: name: nri-integration-cfg namespace: default data: nginx-config.yml: | --- # Run auto discovery to find pods with label \"app=nginx\" # https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/host-integrations/installation/container-auto-discovery discovery: command: # Use the following optional arguments : # --namespaces: Comma separated list of namespaces to discover pods on # --tls: Use secure (TLS) connection # --port: Port used to connect to the kubelet. Default is 10255 exec: /var/db/newrelic-infra/nri-discovery-kubernetes --port PORT --tls match: label.app: nginx integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: # If you're using ngx_http_api_module be certain to use the full path up to and including the version number # Use the discovered IP as the host address STATUS_URL: http://${discovery.ip}/status # Comma separated list of ngx_http_api_module, NON PARAMETERIZED, Endpoints # endpoints: /nginx,/processes,/connections,/ssl,/slabs,/http,/http/requests,/http/server_zones,/http/caches,/http/upstreams,/http/keyvals,/stream,/stream/server_zones,/stream/upstreams,/stream/keyvals,/stream/zone_sync # Name of Nginx status module OHI is to query against. discover | ngx_http_stub_status_module | ngx_http_status_module | ngx_http_api_module STATUS_MODULE: discover METRICS: 1 Copy This configuration map can then be referenced in the DaemonSet, the same as the one that was generated via the command line. Make sure the namespace used is the same one used by the Kubernetes integration manifest. If you haven't changed it in the downloaded manifest file, the value is default. Add multiple services to the same config You can monitor several services using the same Kubernetes integration config file. To do this, add another integration configuration YAML to the same Kubernetes integration config file. Below is the Kubernetes config created in the last section, with a new section for the Cassandra integration's config (highlighted). --- apiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap metadata: name: nri-integration-cfg namespace: default data: nginx-config.yml: | --- # Run auto discovery to find pods with label \"app=nginx\" # https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/host-integrations/installation/container-auto-discovery discovery: command: # Run discovery for Kubernetes.

Additionally, depending on your environment, there may be some additional service-specific configuration you must do. When you've completed configuration, our infrastructure agent looks for any pod with a label cassandra and runs the integration against it.",

This tutorial shows how to enable monitoring for a Redis service running on the Kubernetes PHP Guestbook. For the general procedure, see Monitor a Kubernetes-running service. What you need See the general requirements for this feature, including supported services. The kubectl command-line tool must be configured to communicate with your cluster. If you don't have a cluster, you can create one using Minikube. Step 1: Set up an example Redis application This tutorial builds on the Kubernetes tutorial Deploying a PHP Guestbook application with Redis. Skip the Kubernetes tutorial and run the following command to set up the application needed for our tutorial: kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/examples/master/guestbook/all-in-one/guestbook-all-in-one.yaml Copy If you'd like to first complete the Kubernetes tutorial, follow their tutorial instructions but do not follow the instructions in the Cleaning up section. Step 2: Enable monitoring of Redis instances The PHP Guestbook application has three Redis instances: one master and two slave instances. Each instance is tagged with a label where app=redis. For this example, we're using our Redis monitoring integration. It can monitor both master and slave instances of Redis, so we don’t have to distinguish between them. In the Kubernetes integration's YAML config file (newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml), you need to update the nri-integration-cfg section. From the list of integration configs, get the Redis integration YAML and add it to the Kubernetes config.

      "body": "New Relic provides Control Plane support for your Kubernetes integration, allowing you to monitor and collect metrics from your cluster's Control Plane components. That data can then be found in New Relic and used to create queries and charts. Features We monitor and collect metrics from the following control plane components: ETCD: leader information, resident memory size, number of OS threads, consensus proposals data, etc. For a list of supported metrics, see ETCD data. API server: rate of apiserver requests, breakdown of apiserver requests by HTTP method and response code, etc. For the complete list of supported metrics, see API server data. Scheduler: requested CPU/memory vs available on the node, tolerations to taints, any set affinity or anti-affinity, etc. For the complete list of supported metrics, see Scheduler data. Controller manager: resident memory size, number of OS threads created, goroutines currently existing, etc. For the complete list of supported metrics, see Controller manager data. Compatibility and requirements Control plane monitoring requires Kubernetes integration version 1.16.0 or higher. Control plane monitoring support is not enabled for managed clusters. This is because providers (EKS, GKE, AKS, etc.) abstract away the concept of master nodes and control plane components, so that access to them is limited or non-existent. External control planes are not supported. The unprivileged version of the Kubernetes integration does not support control plane monitoring. OpenShift 4.x uses control plane component metric endpoints that are different than the default. Discovery of master nodes and control plane components The Kubernetes integration relies on the kubeadm labeling conventions to discover the master nodes and the control plane components. This means that master nodes should be labeled with node-role.kubernetes.io/master=\"\" or kubernetes.io/role=\"master\". The control plane components should have either the k8s-app or the tier and component labels. Refer to the following table for accepted label combinations and values: Component Label Endpoint API server Kubeadm / Kops / ClusterAPI k8s-app=kube-apiserver tier=control-plane component=kube-apiserver OpenShift app=openshift-kube-apiserver apiserver=true localhost:443/metrics by default (can be configured) if the request fails falls back to localhost:8080/metrics ETCD Kubeadm / Kops / ClusterAPI k8s-app=etcd-manager-main tier=control-plane component=etcd OpenShift k8s-app=etcd localhost:4001/metrics Scheduler Kubeadm / Kops / ClusterAPI k8s-app=kube-scheduler tier=control-plane component=kube-scheduler OpenShift app=openshift-kube-scheduler scheduler=true localhost:10251/metrics Controller manager Kubeadm / Kops / ClusterAPI k8s-app=kube-controller-manager tier=control-plane component=kube-controller-manager​ OpenShift app=kube-controller-manager kube-controller-manager=true localhost:10252/metrics When the integration detects that it is running inside a master node, it tries to find which components are running on the node by looking for pods that match the labels listed in the table above. For every running component, the integration makes a request to its metrics endpoint. Configuration Control plane monitoring is automatic for agents running inside master nodes. The only component that requires an extra step to run is ETCD, because it uses mutual TLS authentication (mTLS) for client requests. The API Server can also be configured to be queried using the Secure Port. Important Control plane monitoring for OpenShift 4.x requires additional configuration. For more information, see the OpenShift 4.x Configuration section. ETCD In order to set mTLS for querying ETCD, there are two configuration options that need to be set: Option Value ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAME Name of a Kubernetes secret that contains the mTLS configuration. The secret should contain the following keys: cert: the certificate that identifies the client making the request. It should be signed by an ETCD trusted CA. key: the private key used to generate the client certificate. cacert: the root CA used to identify the ETCD server certificate. If the ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAME option is not set, ETCD metrics won't be fetched. For step by step instructions on how to create a certificate and sign it with the ETCD client CA, see Set up mTLS from the ETCD client CA. ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAMESPACE The namespace where the secret specified in the ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAME was created. If not set, the default namespace is used. API server By default, the API server metrics are queried using the localhost:8080 unsecured endpoint. If this port is disabled, you can also query these metrics over the secure port. To enable this, set the following configuration option in the Kubernetes integration manifest file: Option Value API_SERVER_ENDPOINT_URL The (secure) URL to query the metrics. The API server uses localhost:443 by default Ensure that the ClusterRole has been updated to the newest version found in the manifest Added in version 1.15.0 Important Note that the port can be different according to the secure port used by the API server. For example, in Minikube the API server secure port is 8443 and therefore API_SERVER_ENDPOINT_URL should be set to https://localhost:8443 OpenShift configuration Control plane components on OpenShift 4.x use endpoint URLs that require SSL and service account based authentication. Therefore, the default endpoint URLs can not be used. To configure control plane monitoring on OpenShift, uncomment the following environment variables in the customized manifest. URL values are pre-configured to the default base URLs for the control plane monitoring metrics endpoints in OpenShift 4.x. - name: \"SCHEDULER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10259 - name: \"ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:9979\" - name: \"CONTROLLER_MANAGER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10257\" - name: \"API_SERVER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:6443\" Copy Important Even though the custom ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL is defined, ETCD requires HTTPS and mTLS authentication to be configured. For more on configuring mTLS for ETCD in OpenShift, see Set up mTLS for ETCD in OpenShift. Important When installing through Helm openshift, specify the config to automatically include these endpoints. Setting openshift.enabled=true and openshift.version=\"4.x\" will include the secure endpoints and enable the /var/run/crio.sock runtime. Set up mTLS from the ETCD client CA The instructions below are based on the Kubernetes documentation. For more information, see Managing TLS certificates in a cluster. For OpenShift, see Set up mTLS for ETCD in OpenShift. To set up mTLS from the ETCD client CA: Download and install the tool cfssl, selecting the correct binaries for your OS from the list. Once installed, execute the following command: cat <<EOF | cfssl genkey - | cfssljson -bare server { \"hosts\": [ \"localhost\" ], \"CN\": \"newrelic-infra.pod.cluster.local\", \"key\": { \"algo\": \"ecdsa\", \"size\": 256 } } EOF Copy This command generates two files; server.csr containing the PEM encoded pkcs#10 certification request and server-key.pem containing the PEM encoded key to the certificate to be created. Use the generated certificate authority (CA) of ETCD to sign your CSR. Depending on your cluster configuration, you may already have this information. For default install configuration, download the CA certificate and the private key directly from ETCD with the following commands: kubectl cp $(kubectl get pods -l k8s-app=etcd-manager-main -n kube-system -o jsonpath=\"{.items[0].metadata.name}\"):/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd-manager/etcd-clients-ca.crt ./cacert -n kube-system kubectl cp $(kubectl get pods -l k8s-app=etcd-manager-main -n kube-system -o jsonpath=\"{.items[0].metadata.name}\"):/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd-manager/etcd-clients-ca.key ./cacert.key -n kube-system Copy Tip This requires that the etcd-manager-main pod has the label k8s-app=etcd-manager-main, which is a requirement for control plane monitoring . If your etc-manager-main pod is located in a different namespace, change the -n kube-system flags accordingly. With those files downloaded, use the following command to sign your CSRF: cfssl sign -ca cacert -ca-key cacert.key server.csr | cfssljson -bare cert Copy Create the secret that is used to retrieve the TLS config for making requests to ETC. We recommend renaming the certificate and the private key: cp cert.pem cert && cp server-key.pem key Copy kubectl -n default create secret generic newrelic-infra-etcd-tls-secret --from-file=./cert --from-file=./key --from-file=./cacert Copy To ease future installations Use the following commands to simultaneously create the CSR, retrieve the CA, generate the certificate by signing the CSR, and create the secret with all the required fields: cat <<EOF | cfssl genkey - | cfssljson -bare server && \\ kubectl cp $(kubectl get pods -l k8s-app=etcd-manager-main -n kube-system -o jsonpath=\"{.items[0].metadata.name}\"):/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd-manager/etcd-clients-ca.crt ./cacert -n kube-system && \\ kubectl cp $(kubectl get pods -l k8s-app=etcd-manager-main -n kube-system -o jsonpath=\"{.items[0].metadata.name}\"):/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd-manager/etcd-clients-ca.key ./cacert.key -n kube-system && \\ cp server-key.pem key && \\ cfssl sign -ca cacert -ca-key cacert.key server.csr | cfssljson -bare cert && \\ cp cert.pem cert && \\ kubectl -n default create secret generic newrelic-infra-etcd-tls-secret --from-file=./cert --from-file=./key --from-file=./cacert { \"hosts\": [ \"localhost\" ], \"CN\": \"newrelic-infra.pod.cluster.local\", \"key\": { \"algo\": \"ecdsa\", \"size\": 256 } } EOF Copy The last step is to update the configuration in the manifest and apply it. In the configuration section, there are two options related to ETCD mTLS: ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAME with the name of the secret that we just created. ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAMESPACE with the namespace that we used to create the secret. To complete the installation, add these variables to the container spec of the integration DaemonSet and apply the changes: - name: \"ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAME” value: \"newrelic-infra-etcd-tls-secret\" - name: \"ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAMESPACE\" value: \"default\" Copy Set up mTLS for ETCD in OpenShift Follow these instructions to set up mutual TLS authentication for ETCD in OpenShift 4.x: Export the ETCD client certificates from the cluster to an opaque secret. In a default managed OpenShift cluster, the secret is named kube-etcd-client-certs and it is stored in the openshift-monitoring namespace. kubectl get secret/kube-etcd-client-certs -n openshift-monitoring -o yaml > etcd-secret.yaml Copy Open the secret file and change the keys: Rename the certificate authority to cacert. Rename the client certificate to cert. Rename the client key to key. Optional: change the secret name and namespace to something meaningful. Remove these unnecessary keys in the metadata section: creationTimestamp resourceVersion selfLink uid Install the manifest with its new name and namespace: kubectl apply -f etcd-secret.yaml Copy Go to Update manifest configuration (the last step under Set up MTL from ETCD client) to configure the required environment variables.

      "body": "New Relic provides Control Plane support for your Kubernetes integration, allowing you to monitor and collect metrics from your cluster's Control Plane components. That data can then be found in New Relic and used to create queries and charts. Features We monitor and collect metrics from the following control plane components: ETCD: leader information, resident memory size, number of OS threads, consensus proposals data, etc. For a list of supported metrics, see ETCD data. API server: rate of apiserver requests, breakdown of apiserver requests by HTTP method and response code, etc. For the complete list of supported metrics, see API server data. Scheduler: requested CPU/memory vs available on the node, tolerations to taints, any set affinity or anti-affinity, etc. For the complete list of supported metrics, see Scheduler data. Controller manager: resident memory size, number of OS threads created, goroutines currently existing, etc. For the complete list of supported metrics, see Controller manager data. Compatibility and requirements Control plane monitoring requires Kubernetes integration version 1.16.0 or higher. Control plane monitoring support is not enabled for managed clusters. This is because providers (EKS, GKE, AKS, etc.) abstract away the concept of master nodes and control plane components, so that access to them is limited or non-existent. External control planes are not supported. The unprivileged version of the Kubernetes integration does not support control plane monitoring. OpenShift 4.x uses control plane component metric endpoints that are different than the default. Discovery of master nodes and control plane components The Kubernetes integration relies on the kubeadm labeling conventions to discover the master nodes and the control plane components. This means that master nodes should be labeled with node-role.kubernetes.io/master=\"\" or kubernetes.io/role=\"master\". The control plane components should have either the k8s-app or the tier and component labels. Refer to the following table for accepted label combinations and values: Component Label Endpoint API server Kubeadm / Kops / ClusterAPI k8s-app=kube-apiserver tier=control-plane component=kube-apiserver OpenShift app=openshift-kube-apiserver apiserver=true localhost:443/metrics by default (can be configured) if the request fails falls back to localhost:8080/metrics ETCD Kubeadm / Kops / ClusterAPI k8s-app=etcd-manager-main tier=control-plane component=etcd OpenShift k8s-app=etcd localhost:4001/metrics Scheduler Kubeadm / Kops / ClusterAPI k8s-app=kube-scheduler tier=control-plane component=kube-scheduler OpenShift app=openshift-kube-scheduler scheduler=true localhost:10251/metrics Controller manager Kubeadm / Kops / ClusterAPI k8s-app=kube-controller-manager tier=control-plane component=kube-controller-manager​ OpenShift app=kube-controller-manager kube-controller-manager=true localhost:10252/metrics When the integration detects that it is running inside a master node, it tries to find which components are running on the node by looking for pods that match the labels listed in the table above. For every running component, the integration makes a request to its metrics endpoint. Configuration Control plane monitoring is automatic for agents running inside master nodes. The only component that requires an extra step to run is ETCD, because it uses mutual TLS authentication (mTLS) for client requests. The API Server can also be configured to be queried using the Secure Port. Important Control plane monitoring for OpenShift 4.x requires additional configuration. For more information, see the OpenShift 4.x Configuration section. ETCD In order to set mTLS for querying ETCD, there are two configuration options that need to be set: Option Value ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAME Name of a Kubernetes secret that contains the mTLS configuration. The secret should contain the following keys: cert: the certificate that identifies the client making the request. It should be signed by an ETCD trusted CA. key: the private key used to generate the client certificate. cacert: the root CA used to identify the ETCD server certificate. If the ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAME option is not set, ETCD metrics won't be fetched. For step by step instructions on how to create a certificate and sign it with the ETCD client CA, see Set up mTLS from the ETCD client CA. ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAMESPACE The namespace where the secret specified in the ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAME was created. If not set, the default namespace is used. API server By default, the API server metrics are queried using the localhost:8080 unsecured endpoint. If this port is disabled, you can also query these metrics over the secure port. To enable this, set the following configuration option in the Kubernetes integration manifest file: Option Value API_SERVER_ENDPOINT_URL The (secure) URL to query the metrics. The API server uses localhost:443 by default Ensure that the ClusterRole has been updated to the newest version found in the manifest Added in version 1.15.0 Important Note that the port can be different according to the secure port used by the API server. For example, in Minikube the API server secure port is 8443 and therefore API_SERVER_ENDPOINT_URL should be set to https://localhost:8443 OpenShift configuration Control plane components on OpenShift 4.x use endpoint URLs that require SSL and service account based authentication. Therefore, the default endpoint URLs can not be used. To configure control plane monitoring on OpenShift, uncomment the following environment variables in the customized manifest. URL values are pre-configured to the default base URLs for the control plane monitoring metrics endpoints in OpenShift 4.x. - name: \"SCHEDULER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10259 - name: \"ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:9979\" - name: \"CONTROLLER_MANAGER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10257\" - name: \"API_SERVER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:6443\" Copy Important Even though the custom ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL is defined, ETCD requires HTTPS and mTLS authentication to be configured. For more on configuring mTLS for ETCD in OpenShift, see Set up mTLS for ETCD in OpenShift. Important When installing through Helm openshift, specify the config to automatically include these endpoints. Setting openshift.enabled=true and openshift.version=\"4.x\" will include the secure endpoints and enable the /var/run/crio.sock runtime. Set up mTLS from the ETCD client CA The instructions below are based on the Kubernetes documentation. For more information, see Managing TLS certificates in a cluster. For OpenShift, see Set up mTLS for ETCD in OpenShift. To set up mTLS from the ETCD client CA: Download and install the tool cfssl, selecting the correct binaries for your OS from the list. Once installed, execute the following command: cat <<EOF | cfssl genkey - | cfssljson -bare server { \"hosts\": [ \"localhost\" ], \"CN\": \"newrelic-infra.pod.cluster.local\", \"key\": { \"algo\": \"ecdsa\", \"size\": 256 } } EOF Copy This command generates two files; server.csr containing the PEM encoded pkcs#10 certification request and server-key.pem containing the PEM encoded key to the certificate to be created. Use the generated certificate authority (CA) of ETCD to sign your CSR. Depending on your cluster configuration, you may already have this information. For default install configuration, download the CA certificate and the private key directly from ETCD with the following commands: kubectl cp $(kubectl get pods -l k8s-app=etcd-manager-main -n kube-system -o jsonpath=\"{.items[0].metadata.name}\"):/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd-manager/etcd-clients-ca.crt ./cacert -n kube-system kubectl cp $(kubectl get pods -l k8s-app=etcd-manager-main -n kube-system -o jsonpath=\"{.items[0].metadata.name}\"):/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd-manager/etcd-clients-ca.key ./cacert.key -n kube-system Copy Tip This requires that the etcd-manager-main pod has the label k8s-app=etcd-manager-main, which is a requirement for control plane monitoring . If your etc-manager-main pod is located in a different namespace, change the -n kube-system flags accordingly. With those files downloaded, use the following command to sign your CSRF: cfssl sign -ca cacert -ca-key cacert.key server.csr | cfssljson -bare cert Copy Create the secret that is used to retrieve the TLS config for making requests to ETC. We recommend renaming the certificate and the private key: cp cert.pem cert && cp server-key.pem key Copy kubectl -n default create secret generic newrelic-infra-etcd-tls-secret --from-file=./cert --from-file=./key --from-file=./cacert Copy To ease future installations Use the following commands to simultaneously create the CSR, retrieve the CA, generate the certificate by signing the CSR, and create the secret with all the required fields: cat <<EOF | cfssl genkey - | cfssljson -bare server && \\ kubectl cp $(kubectl get pods -l k8s-app=etcd-manager-main -n kube-system -o jsonpath=\"{.items[0].metadata.name}\"):/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd-manager/etcd-clients-ca.crt ./cacert -n kube-system && \\ kubectl cp $(kubectl get pods -l k8s-app=etcd-manager-main -n kube-system -o jsonpath=\"{.items[0].metadata.name}\"):/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd-manager/etcd-clients-ca.key ./cacert.key -n kube-system && \\ cp server-key.pem key && \\ cfssl sign -ca cacert -ca-key cacert.key server.csr | cfssljson -bare cert && \\ cp cert.pem cert && \\ kubectl -n default create secret generic newrelic-infra-etcd-tls-secret --from-file=./cert --from-file=./key --from-file=./cacert { \"hosts\": [ \"localhost\" ], \"CN\": \"newrelic-infra.pod.cluster.local\", \"key\": { \"algo\": \"ecdsa\", \"size\": 256 } } EOF Copy The last step is to update the configuration in the manifest and apply it. In the configuration section, there are two options related to ETCD mTLS: ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAME with the name of the secret that we just created. ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAMESPACE with the namespace that we used to create the secret. To complete the installation, add these variables to the container spec of the integration DaemonSet and apply the changes: - name: \"ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAME” value: \"newrelic-infra-etcd-tls-secret\" - name: \"ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAMESPACE\" value: \"default\" Copy Set up mTLS for ETCD in OpenShift Follow these instructions to set up mutual TLS authentication for ETCD in OpenShift 4.x: Export the ETCD client certificates from the cluster to an opaque secret. In a default managed OpenShift cluster, the secret is named kube-etcd-client-certs and it is stored in the openshift-monitoring namespace. kubectl get secret/kube-etcd-client-certs -n openshift-monitoring -o yaml > etcd-secret.yaml Copy Open the secret file and change the keys: Rename the certificate authority to cacert. Rename the client certificate to cert. Rename the client key to key. Optional: change the secret name and namespace to something meaningful. Remove these unnecessary keys in the metadata section: creationTimestamp resourceVersion selfLink uid Install the manifest with its new name and namespace: kubectl apply -f etcd-secret.yaml Copy Go to Update manifest configuration (the last step under Set up MTL from ETCD client) to configure the required environment variables.

Install Kubernetes events with a proxy There are three options to install the Kubernetes events integration with a proxy: Installing with chart nri-kube-events: The proxy can be configured setting the configuration option proxy in the values.yaml file. If set, the variable NRIA_PROXY will be added into the deployment.yaml template. Installing with chart nri-bundle as a dependency: The proxy can be configured setting the configuration option nri-kube-events.proxy. The configuration option is passed down to the dependency nri-kube-events modifying the values.yaml of nri-bundle: nri-kube-events.proxy: https://user:password@hostname:port Copy Installing with manifest: When installing through the manifest, to configure the proxy set the NRIA_PROXY in the environment variable section of the infra container. Check the deployment template of the chart as an example of environment variable configuration. Install the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration with a proxy There are three options to install the Prometheus OpenMetric integration with a proxy: Installing with charts nri-prometheus: The proxy can be configured setting the configuration option config.emitter_proxy in the values.yaml. The config object is used to generate a configMap that mounted into the deployment under /etc/nri-prometheus/. Installing with chart nri-bundle as a dependency: The proxy can be configured setting the configuration option nri-prometheus.config.emitter_proxy. The configuration option is passed down to the dependency nri-prometheus modifying the values.yaml of nri-bundle: nri-prometheus.config.emitter_proxy: \"http://localhost:8888 Copy Installing with the manifest: Configure the proxy uncommenting the emitter_proxy option directly in the manifest: # Proxy to be used by the emitters when submitting metrics.

      "body": "New Relic provides Control Plane support for your Kubernetes integration, allowing you to monitor and collect metrics from your cluster's Control Plane components. That data can then be found in New Relic and used to create queries and charts. Features We monitor and collect metrics from the following control plane components: ETCD: leader information, resident memory size, number of OS threads, consensus proposals data, etc. For a list of supported metrics, see ETCD data. API server: rate of apiserver requests, breakdown of apiserver requests by HTTP method and response code, etc. For the complete list of supported metrics, see API server data. Scheduler: requested CPU/memory vs available on the node, tolerations to taints, any set affinity or anti-affinity, etc. For the complete list of supported metrics, see Scheduler data. Controller manager: resident memory size, number of OS threads created, goroutines currently existing, etc. For the complete list of supported metrics, see Controller manager data. Compatibility and requirements Control plane monitoring requires Kubernetes integration version 1.16.0 or higher. Control plane monitoring support is not enabled for managed clusters. This is because providers (EKS, GKE, AKS, etc.) abstract away the concept of master nodes and control plane components, so that access to them is limited or non-existent. External control planes are not supported. The unprivileged version of the Kubernetes integration does not support control plane monitoring. OpenShift 4.x uses control plane component metric endpoints that are different than the default. Discovery of master nodes and control plane components The Kubernetes integration relies on the kubeadm labeling conventions to discover the master nodes and the control plane components. This means that master nodes should be labeled with node-role.kubernetes.io/master=\"\" or kubernetes.io/role=\"master\". The control plane components should have either the k8s-app or the tier and component labels. Refer to the following table for accepted label combinations and values: Component Label Endpoint API server Kubeadm / Kops / ClusterAPI k8s-app=kube-apiserver tier=control-plane component=kube-apiserver OpenShift app=openshift-kube-apiserver apiserver=true localhost:443/metrics by default (can be configured) if the request fails falls back to localhost:8080/metrics ETCD Kubeadm / Kops / ClusterAPI k8s-app=etcd-manager-main tier=control-plane component=etcd OpenShift k8s-app=etcd localhost:4001/metrics Scheduler Kubeadm / Kops / ClusterAPI k8s-app=kube-scheduler tier=control-plane component=kube-scheduler OpenShift app=openshift-kube-scheduler scheduler=true localhost:10251/metrics Controller manager Kubeadm / Kops / ClusterAPI k8s-app=kube-controller-manager tier=control-plane component=kube-controller-manager​ OpenShift app=kube-controller-manager kube-controller-manager=true localhost:10252/metrics When the integration detects that it is running inside a master node, it tries to find which components are running on the node by looking for pods that match the labels listed in the table above. For every running component, the integration makes a request to its metrics endpoint. Configuration Control plane monitoring is automatic for agents running inside master nodes. The only component that requires an extra step to run is ETCD, because it uses mutual TLS authentication (mTLS) for client requests. The API Server can also be configured to be queried using the Secure Port. Important Control plane monitoring for OpenShift 4.x requires additional configuration. For more information, see the OpenShift 4.x Configuration section. ETCD In order to set mTLS for querying ETCD, there are two configuration options that need to be set: Option Value ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAME Name of a Kubernetes secret that contains the mTLS configuration. The secret should contain the following keys: cert: the certificate that identifies the client making the request. It should be signed by an ETCD trusted CA. key: the private key used to generate the client certificate. cacert: the root CA used to identify the ETCD server certificate. If the ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAME option is not set, ETCD metrics won't be fetched. For step by step instructions on how to create a certificate and sign it with the ETCD client CA, see Set up mTLS from the ETCD client CA. ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAMESPACE The namespace where the secret specified in the ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAME was created. If not set, the default namespace is used. API server By default, the API server metrics are queried using the localhost:8080 unsecured endpoint. If this port is disabled, you can also query these metrics over the secure port. To enable this, set the following configuration option in the Kubernetes integration manifest file: Option Value API_SERVER_ENDPOINT_URL The (secure) URL to query the metrics. The API server uses localhost:443 by default Ensure that the ClusterRole has been updated to the newest version found in the manifest Added in version 1.15.0 Important Note that the port can be different according to the secure port used by the API server. For example, in Minikube the API server secure port is 8443 and therefore API_SERVER_ENDPOINT_URL should be set to https://localhost:8443 OpenShift configuration Control plane components on OpenShift 4.x use endpoint URLs that require SSL and service account based authentication. Therefore, the default endpoint URLs can not be used. To configure control plane monitoring on OpenShift, uncomment the following environment variables in the customized manifest. URL values are pre-configured to the default base URLs for the control plane monitoring metrics endpoints in OpenShift 4.x. - name: \"SCHEDULER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10259 - name: \"ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:9979\" - name: \"CONTROLLER_MANAGER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10257\" - name: \"API_SERVER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:6443\" Copy Important Even though the custom ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL is defined, ETCD requires HTTPS and mTLS authentication to be configured. For more on configuring mTLS for ETCD in OpenShift, see Set up mTLS for ETCD in OpenShift. Important When installing through Helm openshift, specify the config to automatically include these endpoints. Setting openshift.enabled=true and openshift.version=\"4.x\" will include the secure endpoints and enable the /var/run/crio.sock runtime. Set up mTLS from the ETCD client CA The instructions below are based on the Kubernetes documentation. For more information, see Managing TLS certificates in a cluster. For OpenShift, see Set up mTLS for ETCD in OpenShift. To set up mTLS from the ETCD client CA: Download and install the tool cfssl, selecting the correct binaries for your OS from the list. Once installed, execute the following command: cat <<EOF | cfssl genkey - | cfssljson -bare server { \"hosts\": [ \"localhost\" ], \"CN\": \"newrelic-infra.pod.cluster.local\", \"key\": { \"algo\": \"ecdsa\", \"size\": 256 } } EOF Copy This command generates two files; server.csr containing the PEM encoded pkcs#10 certification request and server-key.pem containing the PEM encoded key to the certificate to be created. Use the generated certificate authority (CA) of ETCD to sign your CSR. Depending on your cluster configuration, you may already have this information. For default install configuration, download the CA certificate and the private key directly from ETCD with the following commands: kubectl cp $(kubectl get pods -l k8s-app=etcd-manager-main -n kube-system -o jsonpath=\"{.items[0].metadata.name}\"):/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd-manager/etcd-clients-ca.crt ./cacert -n kube-system kubectl cp $(kubectl get pods -l k8s-app=etcd-manager-main -n kube-system -o jsonpath=\"{.items[0].metadata.name}\"):/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd-manager/etcd-clients-ca.key ./cacert.key -n kube-system Copy Tip This requires that the etcd-manager-main pod has the label k8s-app=etcd-manager-main, which is a requirement for control plane monitoring . If your etc-manager-main pod is located in a different namespace, change the -n kube-system flags accordingly. With those files downloaded, use the following command to sign your CSRF: cfssl sign -ca cacert -ca-key cacert.key server.csr | cfssljson -bare cert Copy Create the secret that is used to retrieve the TLS config for making requests to ETC. We recommend renaming the certificate and the private key: cp cert.pem cert && cp server-key.pem key Copy kubectl -n default create secret generic newrelic-infra-etcd-tls-secret --from-file=./cert --from-file=./key --from-file=./cacert Copy To ease future installations Use the following commands to simultaneously create the CSR, retrieve the CA, generate the certificate by signing the CSR, and create the secret with all the required fields: cat <<EOF | cfssl genkey - | cfssljson -bare server && \\ kubectl cp $(kubectl get pods -l k8s-app=etcd-manager-main -n kube-system -o jsonpath=\"{.items[0].metadata.name}\"):/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd-manager/etcd-clients-ca.crt ./cacert -n kube-system && \\ kubectl cp $(kubectl get pods -l k8s-app=etcd-manager-main -n kube-system -o jsonpath=\"{.items[0].metadata.name}\"):/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd-manager/etcd-clients-ca.key ./cacert.key -n kube-system && \\ cp server-key.pem key && \\ cfssl sign -ca cacert -ca-key cacert.key server.csr | cfssljson -bare cert && \\ cp cert.pem cert && \\ kubectl -n default create secret generic newrelic-infra-etcd-tls-secret --from-file=./cert --from-file=./key --from-file=./cacert { \"hosts\": [ \"localhost\" ], \"CN\": \"newrelic-infra.pod.cluster.local\", \"key\": { \"algo\": \"ecdsa\", \"size\": 256 } } EOF Copy The last step is to update the configuration in the manifest and apply it. In the configuration section, there are two options related to ETCD mTLS: ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAME with the name of the secret that we just created. ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAMESPACE with the namespace that we used to create the secret. To complete the installation, add these variables to the container spec of the integration DaemonSet and apply the changes: - name: \"ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAME” value: \"newrelic-infra-etcd-tls-secret\" - name: \"ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAMESPACE\" value: \"default\" Copy Set up mTLS for ETCD in OpenShift Follow these instructions to set up mutual TLS authentication for ETCD in OpenShift 4.x: Export the ETCD client certificates from the cluster to an opaque secret. In a default managed OpenShift cluster, the secret is named kube-etcd-client-certs and it is stored in the openshift-monitoring namespace. kubectl get secret/kube-etcd-client-certs -n openshift-monitoring -o yaml > etcd-secret.yaml Copy Open the secret file and change the keys: Rename the certificate authority to cacert. Rename the client certificate to cert. Rename the client key to key. Optional: change the secret name and namespace to something meaningful. Remove these unnecessary keys in the metadata section: creationTimestamp resourceVersion selfLink uid Install the manifest with its new name and namespace: kubectl apply -f etcd-secret.yaml Copy Go to Update manifest configuration (the last step under Set up MTL from ETCD client) to configure the required environment variables.

      "body": "New Relic provides Control Plane support for your Kubernetes integration, allowing you to monitor and collect metrics from your cluster's Control Plane components. That data can then be found in New Relic and used to create queries and charts. Features We monitor and collect metrics from the following control plane components: ETCD: leader information, resident memory size, number of OS threads, consensus proposals data, etc. For a list of supported metrics, see ETCD data. API server: rate of apiserver requests, breakdown of apiserver requests by HTTP method and response code, etc. For the complete list of supported metrics, see API server data. Scheduler: requested CPU/memory vs available on the node, tolerations to taints, any set affinity or anti-affinity, etc. For the complete list of supported metrics, see Scheduler data. Controller manager: resident memory size, number of OS threads created, goroutines currently existing, etc. For the complete list of supported metrics, see Controller manager data. Compatibility and requirements Control plane monitoring requires Kubernetes integration version 1.16.0 or higher. Control plane monitoring support is not enabled for managed clusters. This is because providers (EKS, GKE, AKS, etc.) abstract away the concept of master nodes and control plane components, so that access to them is limited or non-existent. External control planes are not supported. The unprivileged version of the Kubernetes integration does not support control plane monitoring. OpenShift 4.x uses control plane component metric endpoints that are different than the default. Discovery of master nodes and control plane components The Kubernetes integration relies on the kubeadm labeling conventions to discover the master nodes and the control plane components. This means that master nodes should be labeled with node-role.kubernetes.io/master=\"\" or kubernetes.io/role=\"master\". The control plane components should have either the k8s-app or the tier and component labels. Refer to the following table for accepted label combinations and values: Component Label Endpoint API server Kubeadm / Kops / ClusterAPI k8s-app=kube-apiserver tier=control-plane component=kube-apiserver OpenShift app=openshift-kube-apiserver apiserver=true localhost:443/metrics by default (can be configured) if the request fails falls back to localhost:8080/metrics ETCD Kubeadm / Kops / ClusterAPI k8s-app=etcd-manager-main tier=control-plane component=etcd OpenShift k8s-app=etcd localhost:4001/metrics Scheduler Kubeadm / Kops / ClusterAPI k8s-app=kube-scheduler tier=control-plane component=kube-scheduler OpenShift app=openshift-kube-scheduler scheduler=true localhost:10251/metrics Controller manager Kubeadm / Kops / ClusterAPI k8s-app=kube-controller-manager tier=control-plane component=kube-controller-manager​ OpenShift app=kube-controller-manager kube-controller-manager=true localhost:10252/metrics When the integration detects that it is running inside a master node, it tries to find which components are running on the node by looking for pods that match the labels listed in the table above. For every running component, the integration makes a request to its metrics endpoint. Configuration Control plane monitoring is automatic for agents running inside master nodes. The only component that requires an extra step to run is ETCD, because it uses mutual TLS authentication (mTLS) for client requests. The API Server can also be configured to be queried using the Secure Port. Important Control plane monitoring for OpenShift 4.x requires additional configuration. For more information, see the OpenShift 4.x Configuration section. ETCD In order to set mTLS for querying ETCD, there are two configuration options that need to be set: Option Value ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAME Name of a Kubernetes secret that contains the mTLS configuration. The secret should contain the following keys: cert: the certificate that identifies the client making the request. It should be signed by an ETCD trusted CA. key: the private key used to generate the client certificate. cacert: the root CA used to identify the ETCD server certificate. If the ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAME option is not set, ETCD metrics won't be fetched. For step by step instructions on how to create a certificate and sign it with the ETCD client CA, see Set up mTLS from the ETCD client CA. ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAMESPACE The namespace where the secret specified in the ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAME was created. If not set, the default namespace is used. API server By default, the API server metrics are queried using the localhost:8080 unsecured endpoint. If this port is disabled, you can also query these metrics over the secure port. To enable this, set the following configuration option in the Kubernetes integration manifest file: Option Value API_SERVER_ENDPOINT_URL The (secure) URL to query the metrics. The API server uses localhost:443 by default Ensure that the ClusterRole has been updated to the newest version found in the manifest Added in version 1.15.0 Important Note that the port can be different according to the secure port used by the API server. For example, in Minikube the API server secure port is 8443 and therefore API_SERVER_ENDPOINT_URL should be set to https://localhost:8443 OpenShift configuration Control plane components on OpenShift 4.x use endpoint URLs that require SSL and service account based authentication. Therefore, the default endpoint URLs can not be used. To configure control plane monitoring on OpenShift, uncomment the following environment variables in the customized manifest. URL values are pre-configured to the default base URLs for the control plane monitoring metrics endpoints in OpenShift 4.x. - name: \"SCHEDULER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10259 - name: \"ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:9979\" - name: \"CONTROLLER_MANAGER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10257\" - name: \"API_SERVER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:6443\" Copy Important Even though the custom ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL is defined, ETCD requires HTTPS and mTLS authentication to be configured. For more on configuring mTLS for ETCD in OpenShift, see Set up mTLS for ETCD in OpenShift. Important When installing through Helm openshift, specify the config to automatically include these endpoints. Setting openshift.enabled=true and openshift.version=\"4.x\" will include the secure endpoints and enable the /var/run/crio.sock runtime. Set up mTLS from the ETCD client CA The instructions below are based on the Kubernetes documentation. For more information, see Managing TLS certificates in a cluster. For OpenShift, see Set up mTLS for ETCD in OpenShift. To set up mTLS from the ETCD client CA: Download and install the tool cfssl, selecting the correct binaries for your OS from the list. Once installed, execute the following command: cat <<EOF | cfssl genkey - | cfssljson -bare server { \"hosts\": [ \"localhost\" ], \"CN\": \"newrelic-infra.pod.cluster.local\", \"key\": { \"algo\": \"ecdsa\", \"size\": 256 } } EOF Copy This command generates two files; server.csr containing the PEM encoded pkcs#10 certification request and server-key.pem containing the PEM encoded key to the certificate to be created. Use the generated certificate authority (CA) of ETCD to sign your CSR. Depending on your cluster configuration, you may already have this information. For default install configuration, download the CA certificate and the private key directly from ETCD with the following commands: kubectl cp $(kubectl get pods -l k8s-app=etcd-manager-main -n kube-system -o jsonpath=\"{.items[0].metadata.name}\"):/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd-manager/etcd-clients-ca.crt ./cacert -n kube-system kubectl cp $(kubectl get pods -l k8s-app=etcd-manager-main -n kube-system -o jsonpath=\"{.items[0].metadata.name}\"):/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd-manager/etcd-clients-ca.key ./cacert.key -n kube-system Copy Tip This requires that the etcd-manager-main pod has the label k8s-app=etcd-manager-main, which is a requirement for control plane monitoring . If your etc-manager-main pod is located in a different namespace, change the -n kube-system flags accordingly. With those files downloaded, use the following command to sign your CSRF: cfssl sign -ca cacert -ca-key cacert.key server.csr | cfssljson -bare cert Copy Create the secret that is used to retrieve the TLS config for making requests to ETC. We recommend renaming the certificate and the private key: cp cert.pem cert && cp server-key.pem key Copy kubectl -n default create secret generic newrelic-infra-etcd-tls-secret --from-file=./cert --from-file=./key --from-file=./cacert Copy To ease future installations Use the following commands to simultaneously create the CSR, retrieve the CA, generate the certificate by signing the CSR, and create the secret with all the required fields: cat <<EOF | cfssl genkey - | cfssljson -bare server && \\ kubectl cp $(kubectl get pods -l k8s-app=etcd-manager-main -n kube-system -o jsonpath=\"{.items[0].metadata.name}\"):/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd-manager/etcd-clients-ca.crt ./cacert -n kube-system && \\ kubectl cp $(kubectl get pods -l k8s-app=etcd-manager-main -n kube-system -o jsonpath=\"{.items[0].metadata.name}\"):/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd-manager/etcd-clients-ca.key ./cacert.key -n kube-system && \\ cp server-key.pem key && \\ cfssl sign -ca cacert -ca-key cacert.key server.csr | cfssljson -bare cert && \\ cp cert.pem cert && \\ kubectl -n default create secret generic newrelic-infra-etcd-tls-secret --from-file=./cert --from-file=./key --from-file=./cacert { \"hosts\": [ \"localhost\" ], \"CN\": \"newrelic-infra.pod.cluster.local\", \"key\": { \"algo\": \"ecdsa\", \"size\": 256 } } EOF Copy The last step is to update the configuration in the manifest and apply it. In the configuration section, there are two options related to ETCD mTLS: ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAME with the name of the secret that we just created. ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAMESPACE with the namespace that we used to create the secret. To complete the installation, add these variables to the container spec of the integration DaemonSet and apply the changes: - name: \"ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAME” value: \"newrelic-infra-etcd-tls-secret\" - name: \"ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAMESPACE\" value: \"default\" Copy Set up mTLS for ETCD in OpenShift Follow these instructions to set up mutual TLS authentication for ETCD in OpenShift 4.x: Export the ETCD client certificates from the cluster to an opaque secret. In a default managed OpenShift cluster, the secret is named kube-etcd-client-certs and it is stored in the openshift-monitoring namespace. kubectl get secret/kube-etcd-client-certs -n openshift-monitoring -o yaml > etcd-secret.yaml Copy Open the secret file and change the keys: Rename the certificate authority to cacert. Rename the client certificate to cert. Rename the client key to key. Optional: change the secret name and namespace to something meaningful. Remove these unnecessary keys in the metadata section: creationTimestamp resourceVersion selfLink uid Install the manifest with its new name and namespace: kubectl apply -f etcd-secret.yaml Copy Go to Update manifest configuration (the last step under Set up MTL from ETCD client) to configure the required environment variables.

Important When installing through Helm openshift, specify the config to automatically include these endpoints. Setting openshift.enabled=true and openshift.version=\"4.x\" will include the secure endpoints and enable the /var/run/crio.sock runtime. Set up mTLS from the ETCD client CA The instructions below are based on the Kubernetes documentation. For more information, see Managing TLS certificates in a cluster. For OpenShift, see Set up mTLS for ETCD in OpenShift. To set up mTLS from the ETCD client CA: Download and install the tool cfssl, selecting the correct binaries for your OS from the list. Once installed, execute the following command: cat <<EOF | cfssl genkey - | cfssljson -bare server { \"hosts\": [ \"localhost\" ], \"CN\": \"newrelic-infra.pod.cluster.local\", \"key\": { \"algo\": \"ecdsa\", \"size\": 256 } } EOF Copy This command generates two files; server.csr containing the PEM encoded pkcs#10 certification request and server-key.pem containing the PEM encoded key to the certificate to be created. Use the generated certificate authority (CA) of ETCD to sign your CSR. Depending on your cluster configuration, you may already have this information. For default install configuration, download the CA certificate and the private key directly from ETCD with the following commands: kubectl cp $(kubectl get pods -l k8s-app=etcd-manager-main -n kube-system -o jsonpath=\"{.items[0].metadata.name}\"):/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd-manager/etcd-clients-ca.crt ./cacert -n kube-system kubectl cp $(kubectl get pods -l k8s-app=etcd-manager-main -n kube-system -o jsonpath=\"{.items[0].metadata.name}\"):/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd-manager/etcd-clients-ca.key ./cacert.key -n kube-system Copy Tip This requires that the etcd-manager-main pod has the label k8s-app=etcd-manager-main, which is a requirement for control plane monitoring . If your etc-manager-main pod is located in a different namespace, change the -n kube-system flags accordingly.

      "body": "New Relic provides Control Plane support for your Kubernetes integration, allowing you to monitor and collect metrics from your cluster's Control Plane components. That data can then be found in New Relic and used to create queries and charts. Features We monitor and collect metrics from the following control plane components: ETCD: leader information, resident memory size, number of OS threads, consensus proposals data, etc. For a list of supported metrics, see ETCD data. API server: rate of apiserver requests, breakdown of apiserver requests by HTTP method and response code, etc. For the complete list of supported metrics, see API server data. Scheduler: requested CPU/memory vs available on the node, tolerations to taints, any set affinity or anti-affinity, etc. For the complete list of supported metrics, see Scheduler data. Controller manager: resident memory size, number of OS threads created, goroutines currently existing, etc. For the complete list of supported metrics, see Controller manager data. Compatibility and requirements Control plane monitoring requires Kubernetes integration version 1.16.0 or higher. Control plane monitoring support is not enabled for managed clusters. This is because providers (EKS, GKE, AKS, etc.) abstract away the concept of master nodes and control plane components, so that access to them is limited or non-existent. External control planes are not supported. The unprivileged version of the Kubernetes integration does not support control plane monitoring. OpenShift 4.x uses control plane component metric endpoints that are different than the default. Discovery of master nodes and control plane components The Kubernetes integration relies on the kubeadm labeling conventions to discover the master nodes and the control plane components. This means that master nodes should be labeled with node-role.kubernetes.io/master=\"\" or kubernetes.io/role=\"master\". The control plane components should have either the k8s-app or the tier and component labels. Refer to the following table for accepted label combinations and values: Component Label Endpoint API server Kubeadm / Kops / ClusterAPI k8s-app=kube-apiserver tier=control-plane component=kube-apiserver OpenShift app=openshift-kube-apiserver apiserver=true localhost:443/metrics by default (can be configured) if the request fails falls back to localhost:8080/metrics ETCD Kubeadm / Kops / ClusterAPI k8s-app=etcd-manager-main tier=control-plane component=etcd OpenShift k8s-app=etcd localhost:4001/metrics Scheduler Kubeadm / Kops / ClusterAPI k8s-app=kube-scheduler tier=control-plane component=kube-scheduler OpenShift app=openshift-kube-scheduler scheduler=true localhost:10251/metrics Controller manager Kubeadm / Kops / ClusterAPI k8s-app=kube-controller-manager tier=control-plane component=kube-controller-manager​ OpenShift app=kube-controller-manager kube-controller-manager=true localhost:10252/metrics When the integration detects that it is running inside a master node, it tries to find which components are running on the node by looking for pods that match the labels listed in the table above. For every running component, the integration makes a request to its metrics endpoint. Configuration Control plane monitoring is automatic for agents running inside master nodes. The only component that requires an extra step to run is ETCD, because it uses mutual TLS authentication (mTLS) for client requests. The API Server can also be configured to be queried using the Secure Port. Important Control plane monitoring for OpenShift 4.x requires additional configuration. For more information, see the OpenShift 4.x Configuration section. ETCD In order to set mTLS for querying ETCD, there are two configuration options that need to be set: Option Value ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAME Name of a Kubernetes secret that contains the mTLS configuration. The secret should contain the following keys: cert: the certificate that identifies the client making the request. It should be signed by an ETCD trusted CA. key: the private key used to generate the client certificate. cacert: the root CA used to identify the ETCD server certificate. If the ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAME option is not set, ETCD metrics won't be fetched. For step by step instructions on how to create a certificate and sign it with the ETCD client CA, see Set up mTLS from the ETCD client CA. ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAMESPACE The namespace where the secret specified in the ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAME was created. If not set, the default namespace is used. API server By default, the API server metrics are queried using the localhost:8080 unsecured endpoint. If this port is disabled, you can also query these metrics over the secure port. To enable this, set the following configuration option in the Kubernetes integration manifest file: Option Value API_SERVER_ENDPOINT_URL The (secure) URL to query the metrics. The API server uses localhost:443 by default Ensure that the ClusterRole has been updated to the newest version found in the manifest Added in version 1.15.0 Important Note that the port can be different according to the secure port used by the API server. For example, in Minikube the API server secure port is 8443 and therefore API_SERVER_ENDPOINT_URL should be set to https://localhost:8443 OpenShift configuration Control plane components on OpenShift 4.x use endpoint URLs that require SSL and service account based authentication. Therefore, the default endpoint URLs can not be used. To configure control plane monitoring on OpenShift, uncomment the following environment variables in the customized manifest. URL values are pre-configured to the default base URLs for the control plane monitoring metrics endpoints in OpenShift 4.x. - name: \"SCHEDULER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10259 - name: \"ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:9979\" - name: \"CONTROLLER_MANAGER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10257\" - name: \"API_SERVER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:6443\" Copy Important Even though the custom ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL is defined, ETCD requires HTTPS and mTLS authentication to be configured. For more on configuring mTLS for ETCD in OpenShift, see Set up mTLS for ETCD in OpenShift. Important When installing through Helm openshift, specify the config to automatically include these endpoints. Setting openshift.enabled=true and openshift.version=\"4.x\" will include the secure endpoints and enable the /var/run/crio.sock runtime.

      "body": "If you are running our Kubernetes integration with a proxy, you need to configure each component (the infrastructure agent, logging, Kubernetes events, etc.) to correctly work with your proxy. Install the infrastructure agent with a proxy There are three options to install the infrastructure agent with a proxy: Installing with chart newrelic-infrastructure: The proxy can be configured setting the configuration option config.proxy as described in the values.yaml of the chart. The whole config object is used to generate a configMap that is mounted as the file /etc/newrelic-infra.yml used to configure the agent. Installing with chart nri-bundle as a dependency: The proxy can be configured setting the configuration option newrelic-infrastructure.config.proxy. The configuration option is passed down to the dependency newrelic-infrastructure modifying the values.yaml of nri-bundle: newrelic-infrastructure.config.proxy: https://user:password@hostname:port Copy Installing with manifest: When installing through the manifest, the proxy can be configured adding the NRIA_PROXY environment variable to the environment variable section of the DaemonSet configuration. The environment variable NRIA_VERBOSE in the DaemonSet YAML can be used as an example of the environment variable configuration. Set logging with a proxy If you’re using log forwarding for the Kubernetes integration, the plugin automatically detects the HTTP_PROXY and HTTPS_PROXY environment variables, and automatically uses them to set up the proxy configuration. For more information, see how to customize the proxy, or bypass it. Install Kubernetes events with a proxy There are three options to install the Kubernetes events integration with a proxy: Installing with chart nri-kube-events: The proxy can be configured setting the configuration option proxy in the values.yaml file. If set, the variable NRIA_PROXY will be added into the deployment.yaml template. Installing with chart nri-bundle as a dependency: The proxy can be configured setting the configuration option nri-kube-events.proxy. The configuration option is passed down to the dependency nri-kube-events modifying the values.yaml of nri-bundle: nri-kube-events.proxy: https://user:password@hostname:port Copy Installing with manifest: When installing through the manifest, to configure the proxy set the NRIA_PROXY in the environment variable section of the infra container. Check the deployment template of the chart as an example of environment variable configuration. Install the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration with a proxy There are three options to install the Prometheus OpenMetric integration with a proxy: Installing with charts nri-prometheus: The proxy can be configured setting the configuration option config.emitter_proxy in the values.yaml. The config object is used to generate a configMap that mounted into the deployment under /etc/nri-prometheus/. Installing with chart nri-bundle as a dependency: The proxy can be configured setting the configuration option nri-prometheus.config.emitter_proxy. The configuration option is passed down to the dependency nri-prometheus modifying the values.yaml of nri-bundle: nri-prometheus.config.emitter_proxy: \"http://localhost:8888 Copy Installing with the manifest: Configure the proxy uncommenting the emitter_proxy option directly in the manifest: # Proxy to be used by the emitters when submitting metrics. It should be # in the format [scheme]://[domain]:[port]. # The emitter is the component in charge of sending the scraped metrics. # This proxy won't be used when scraping metrics from the targets. # By default it's empty, meaning that no proxy will be used. # emitter_proxy: \"http://localhost:8888\" Copy Set the synthetics minion to use a proxy Check this README on how to set the proxy for the Synthetics minions. Install the Pixie integration with a proxy There are two options to install the Pixie integration with a proxy: Installing with chart newrelic-pixie: The proxy can be configured setting the configuration option proxy as described in the values.yaml of the chart.

You can find out about the health of each entity, explore logs, and see how your apps are performing. With the Events integration, everything that happens in your cluster becomes visible, and logs brought in using the logs plugin are also available. Meet the cluster explorer The cluster explorer represents your most relevant cluster data on a chart with the shape of a ship's wheel — which is also Kubernetes' logo. Outer ring: Contains up to 24 nodes of your cluster, the most relevant based on the amount of alerts. Hover over each node to check resource consumption and the percentage of allocable pods used. Inner rings: Contain the pods ( ) of each node. Pods with active alerts are shown in the third innermost ring, and pods that are pending or unable to run are in the center. Hover the mouse over each node or pod to get a quick overview of its resource usage. You can click each node and pod to view its resource usage over time or to get more information about its health and active alerts. Colors are based on predefined alert conditions: Yellow pods have active warning alerts, while red pods have active critical alerts. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer: Click any pod to get more information about its status and health, and to dig deeper into application data and traces, logs, and events. Click a node to see the following data: Pod statistics CPU, memory, and storage consumption against allocatable amounts Amount of pods used by the node against the allocatable amount of pods For each pod, depending on the integrations and features you've enabled, you can see: Pod status and metadata, including namespace and deployment Container status and statistics Active alerts (both warning and critical) Kubernetes events that happened in that pod APM data and traces (if you've linked your APM data) A link to the pods' and containers' logs, collected using the Kubernetes plugin for New Relic Logs Cluster and control plane statistics are always visible on the left side. Cluster dashboard The cluster dashboard can be accessed at any time from the cluster explorer by clicking Kubernetes dashboard. It provides a curated dashboard experience for your Kubernetes cluster. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer > Kubernetes dashboard: The Kubernetes dashboard can be accessed from the Kubernetes cluster explorer. It shows useful Kubernetes metric data. Cluster explorer node table Below the cluster explorer is the node table, which shows all the nodes of the cluster, namespace, or deployment. Like all other usage indicators, the table shows consumption against allocatable resources. Search and filter your cluster data The main way to modify the data view in the cluster explorer is by using the top bar to search for specific attributes or values. All the attributes and values collected by the Kubernetes integration can be combined to narrow down the cluster view. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer: All your Kubernetes cluster's attributes and data points can be used to filter the cluster explorer view. You can also change the time frame using the time picker in the upper right corner. The Auto-refresh box turns the cluster explorer into a real-time dashboard that refreshes every 60 seconds. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer: The time picker lets you select several predefined time spans. To reload the data every minute, check the auto-refresh box. Browse your Kubernetes events If you’ve enabled the Kubernetes events integration, you can click the Events tab to browse everything that happened in your cluster, from warnings to normal events.

      "body": "Read on to learn how New Relic on-host integrations collect and report data to New Relic. Data collection and reporting process This is how an infrastructure on-host integration sends data to New Relic: On startup, the infrastructure agent scans the directory that contains the integration's definition files. The infrastructure agent registers every integration executable defined in the definition file. The agent scans a dedicated directory for integration configuration files. If those config files specify integrations that have been registered with the infrastructure agent, the agent sets up and schedules the integrations. At the scheduled interval (the default is 15 seconds), the agent harvests the data from the integration and prepares it for transmission. Every 60 seconds, it sends that data to New Relic, along with any other infrastructure data. After a successful collection pass, the integration executable exits. File structure and specifications Understanding the file structure of New Relic on-host integrations can help you customize your integration, understand and use your data, and troubleshoot problems. On-host integrations adhere to a set of open source specifications, allowing anyone to build their own infrastructure on-host integration.

      "body": "From a New Relic perspective, entity is a broad concept. An entity is anything New Relic can identify that has data you can monitor. Integrations can be configured to create their own entity, called a remote entity, by setting the remote_monitoring option to true. If set to false, an integration will be considered a local entity, and the data related to it will be attached to the host entity that the agent creates. Remote monitoring requires infrastructure agent version 1.2.25 or higher. For the Apache, Cassandra, MySQL, NGINX, and Redis integrations, remote monitoring (and multi-tenancy) is enabled by activating the configuration parameter remote_monitoring. Important If your Apache, Cassandra, MySQL, NGINX, or Redis service is located in the same host as the agent, when you activate remote monitoring the resulting entity will be considered as remote, regardless of its actual location. This may affect alerts, alter attributes, and have other effects, as explained here. Effects of activating remote_monitoring By enabling remote_monitoring, the integration becomes a different entity which is no longer attached to the infrastructure agent. As a result, the following items may be affected: Alert verification Enabling remote monitoring can affect your configured alerts in case they are using any of the values that are affected by this new feature. We strongly recommend checking your existing alerts to make sure they keep on working as expected. New entity attributes These attributes are modified in the resulting entity: Display name: New entity unique key (instead of using the display name) Entity GUID: New entity GUID Entity ID: New entity ID Entity key: New entity unique key (instead of using the display name) External key: Using integration entity name (instead of using the agent display) Changes in recorded metrics When remote monitoring is enabled, we will add the hostname and port values to all metrics. If the nricluster name or nriservice are defined in the integration configuration file, they will also be decorated. Unrecorded attributes Since the integration is now an independent entity which is not attached to the agent, the following agent attributes are not collected: agentName agentVersion coreCount criticalViolationCount fullHostname instanceType kernelVersion linuxDistribution entityType operatingSystem processorCount systemMemoryBytes warningViolationCount Your custom attributes Updated hostname For the ApacheSample, RedisSample, CassandraSample, and NginxSample integration metrics, we will use the integration configuration hostname instead of the short hostname from the agent.

      "body": "Read on to learn how New Relic on-host integrations collect and report data to New Relic. Data collection and reporting process This is how an infrastructure on-host integration sends data to New Relic: On startup, the infrastructure agent scans the directory that contains the integration's definition files. The infrastructure agent registers every integration executable defined in the definition file. The agent scans a dedicated directory for integration configuration files. If those config files specify integrations that have been registered with the infrastructure agent, the agent sets up and schedules the integrations. At the scheduled interval (the default is 15 seconds), the agent harvests the data from the integration and prepares it for transmission. Every 60 seconds, it sends that data to New Relic, along with any other infrastructure data. After a successful collection pass, the integration executable exits. File structure and specifications Understanding the file structure of New Relic on-host integrations can help you customize your integration, understand and use your data, and troubleshoot problems. On-host integrations adhere to a set of open source specifications, allowing anyone to build their own infrastructure on-host integration.

      "body": "From a New Relic perspective, entity is a broad concept. An entity is anything New Relic can identify that has data you can monitor. Integrations can be configured to create their own entity, called a remote entity, by setting the remote_monitoring option to true. If set to false, an integration will be considered a local entity, and the data related to it will be attached to the host entity that the agent creates. Remote monitoring requires infrastructure agent version 1.2.25 or higher. For the Apache, Cassandra, MySQL, NGINX, and Redis integrations, remote monitoring (and multi-tenancy) is enabled by activating the configuration parameter remote_monitoring. Important If your Apache, Cassandra, MySQL, NGINX, or Redis service is located in the same host as the agent, when you activate remote monitoring the resulting entity will be considered as remote, regardless of its actual location. This may affect alerts, alter attributes, and have other effects, as explained here. Effects of activating remote_monitoring By enabling remote_monitoring, the integration becomes a different entity which is no longer attached to the infrastructure agent. As a result, the following items may be affected: Alert verification Enabling remote monitoring can affect your configured alerts in case they are using any of the values that are affected by this new feature. We strongly recommend checking your existing alerts to make sure they keep on working as expected. New entity attributes These attributes are modified in the resulting entity: Display name: New entity unique key (instead of using the display name) Entity GUID: New entity GUID Entity ID: New entity ID Entity key: New entity unique key (instead of using the display name) External key: Using integration entity name (instead of using the agent display) Changes in recorded metrics When remote monitoring is enabled, we will add the hostname and port values to all metrics. If the nricluster name or nriservice are defined in the integration configuration file, they will also be decorated. Unrecorded attributes Since the integration is now an independent entity which is not attached to the agent, the following agent attributes are not collected: agentName agentVersion coreCount criticalViolationCount fullHostname instanceType kernelVersion linuxDistribution entityType operatingSystem processorCount systemMemoryBytes warningViolationCount Your custom attributes Updated hostname For the ApacheSample, RedisSample, CassandraSample, and NginxSample integration metrics, we will use the integration configuration hostname instead of the short hostname from the agent. When the integration hostname is a loopback address, the agent will replace it in order to guarantee uniqueness.",

Our preferred protocol for all domains is TLS 1.2. For more information, see New Relic's Explorers Hub post about TLS 1.2. In addition, TLS 1.2 is required for most domains, except: APM agent connections Browser agent connections Event API For future updates to required and supported protocol versions, follow the Security Notifications tag in New Relic's Explorers Hub. User-facing domains Update your allow list to ensure New Relic can communicate with a number of integral domains that are listed in this section. Blocking domains can cause issues with individual product features or prevent pages from loading altogether. This list doesn't cover domains that New Relic connects to that can be blocked without affecting your usage of the product. It also doesn't cover Nerdpacks or other features that communicate with external services that have additional domain requirements. If your organization uses a firewall that restricts outbound traffic, follow the specific procedures for the operating system and the firewall you use to add the following domains to the allow list. Domain Description *.newrelic.com New Relic One and supporting services *.nr-assets.net Static New Relic assets *.nr-ext.net New Relic One Nerdpacks and assets *.amazonaws.com New Relic One catalog assets behind AWS S3 *.cloudfront.net Static New Relic assets behind AWS CloudFront CDN secure.gravatar.com Support for Gravatar avatars fonts.googleapis.com Support for Google Fonts fonts.gstatic.com Support for Google Fonts www.google.com Support for reCAPTCHA www.gstatic.com Support for reCAPTCHA *.nr-data.net OpenTelemetry and Pixie APM agents To enhance network performance and data security, New Relic uses a CDN and DDoS prevention service with a large IP range. New Relic agents require your firewall to allow outgoing connections to the following networks and ports. To add the following IP connections to the allow list, follow the specific procedures for the operating system and the firewall you use. TLS is required for all domains. Use the IP connections for account data in the US or European Union region as appropriate: IP connections APM data Networks US region accounts: 162.247.240.0/22 EU region accounts: 185.221.84.0/22 Ports US region accounts: Default: TCP 443 (recommended) TCP 80 EU region accounts: Default: TCP 443 (recommended) TCP 80 Endpoints US region accounts: collector*.newrelic.com EU region accounts: collector*.eu01.nr-data.net:443 (recommended) Port 443 recommended Recommendation: Use port 443, a secured channel for encrypted HTTPS traffic. Some New Relic agents also offer port 80, an unsecured channel open to all HTTP traffic. While some agents can be configured to use both port 80 and port 443, we recommend that you choose the port 443 (default). If you have an existing configuration that uses port 80, you can update it to use port 443, the default New Relic connection. Agent downloads TLS is required for all domains. Service for download.newrelic.com is provided through Fastly and is subject to change without warning. For the most current list of public IP addresses for New Relic agent downloads, see api.fastly.com/public-ip-list. Infrastructure agents In order to report data to New Relic, our infrastructure monitoring needs outbound access to these domains, networks, and ports. TLS is required for all domains. Use the IP connections for account data in the US or European Union region as appropriate: IP connections Infrastructure data Domains infra-api.newrelic.com: Required to submit events, metrics, and inventory data. identity-api.newrelic.com: Required for entity registration (for example, a host entity). infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com: Required to determine feature flags.

Network blocks for US region accounts: 162.247.240.0/22 Network blocks for EU region accounts: 158.177.65.64/29 159.122.103.184/29 161.156.125.32/28 These network blocks also apply to third-party ticketing integrations and New Relic cloud integrations. Pixie integration The Pixie integration runs in your Kubernetes cluster and pulls a set of curated observability data from Pixie to send it to New Relic using the OpenTelemetry line protocol. The Pixie integration requires outbound network access to the following: work.withpixie.ai:443 otlp.nr-data.net:4317 (US region accounts) otlp.eu01.nr-data.net:4317 (EU region accounts) OpenTelemetry New Relic supports the native OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) for exporting telemetry data. This allows you to use the vendor neutral components developed by the OpenTelemetry community to export your data to New Relic. To export OTLP data to New Relic, configure the OTLP exporter to add a header ( api-key ) whose value is your account license key. And, based on your region, configure the endpoint where the exporter sends data to New Relic. See the OpenTelemetry quick start for more information. otlp.nr-data.net:4317 (US region accounts) otlp.eu01.nr-data.net:4317 (EU region accounts) Network blocks for US region accounts: 162.247.240.0/22 Network blocks for EU region accounts: 185.221.84.0/22",

      "body": "For some New Relic solutions, one way to report custom data to New Relic is to use custom attributes. For example, for New Relic browser monitoring, you might create a custom attribute to track the user name associated with a slow or failing request. Requirements Custom attributes are available for these New Relic solutions: APM Browser monitoring Mobile monitoring Infrastructure monitoring For other custom data solutions, see Intro to custom data. APM: Record custom attributes Important Review the list of reserved terms used by NRQL. Using reserved terms can cause issues. To enable and use custom attributes for APM, follow the procedure for your APM agent: C SDK To add custom attributes to applications monitored by the C SDK, call one of the attribute functions; for example, newrelic_add_attribute_double(). The key name for your custom attribute depends on what you specify when you call the function. Go Custom attribute collection is enabled by default in the Go agent. However, you can disable custom attribute collection. Java Custom attribute collection is enabled by default in Java. You can collect custom attributes using XML and the Java agent APIs. These two methods can be used in conjunction with each other. Method How to do it Specify attributes in XML XML allows you to specify custom attributes without changing any of your source code. You can have multiple XML files for custom attributes that are grouped by some logical facet. To set custom attributes for your Java app via XML: Review the New Relic Java agent's documentation about XML file format, methods and classes, and examples. From your Extensions directory within the New Relic Java agent, create a single XML file. Define the methods you want New Relic to monitor by editing your XML file directly. Define an XML instrumentation file using the New Relic UI. This may require additional config in the common: block of your newrelic.yml. See Report custom attributes under Instrumentation options for more detail. Call the agent's API Example 1: Adding custom attributes to transactions To collect custom attributes using the agent's API, call the relevant methods: For each method you want to record an attribute for, call NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...). Optional: Include or exclude certain attributes with attributes.include and attributes.exclude. For example, to record a variable named userId, include this code in the parent method: NewRelic.addCustomParameter(\"userId\", userId); Copy Example 2: Adding custom attributes to spans in distributed traces To collect custom attributes using the agent's API, call the relevant methods: For each span (currently executing method) that you want to record an attribute for, call NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().addCustomAttribute(...). Optional: Include or exclude certain attributes with span_events.attributes.include and span_events.attributes.exclude. For example, to record a variable named userId on the current span, include this code in the associated method: NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().addCustomAttribute(\"userId\", userId); Copy Collect user attributes The Java agent also includes a built-in mechanism to enable user attributes and collect user information from HttpServletRequest.getUserPrincipal() as custom attributes. .NET Custom attribute collection is enabled by default in .NET. To collect custom attributes, call the relevant API methods: For each method for which you want to record an attribute, call AddCustomAttribute. Optional: Include or exclude attributes with the include and exclude configuration options. For example, to record attributes for a coupon code (string) and an item ID code (number), you could include this code in the parent method: IAgent agent = NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.GetAgent(); ITransaction transaction = agent.CurrentTransaction; transaction .AddCustomAttribute(\"Discount Code\", \"Summer Super Sale\") .AddCustomAttribute(\"Item Code\", 31456); Copy Node.js Custom attribute collection is enabled by default in Node.js. To collect custom attributes, call the relevant API method: For each attribute you want to record, call newrelic.addCustomAttribute. To record multiple attributes using a single call, use newrelic.addCustomAttributes. For example, to record attributes for a coupon code and an item ID code, you could include this in the parent method: newrelic.addCustomAttributes({ \"Discount Code\": \"Summer Super Sale\", \"Item Code\": 31456 }); Copy PHP Custom attribute collection is enabled by default in PHP. To collect custom attributes, call the relevant API method for each method that you want to record an attribute; newrelic_add_custom_parameter for transaction events and spans newrelic_add_custom_span_parameter for only spans For example, to record a variable named $userId, include this code in the parent method: newrelic_add_custom_parameter ('userID', $userId) Copy Python Custom attribute collection is enabled by default in Python. To collect custom attributes, call add_custom_parameter for each method that you want to record an attribute. For example, to record a variable named user_id, include this code in the parent method: newrelic.agent.add_custom_parameter('user_id', user_id) Copy Ruby Custom attribute collection is enabled by default in Ruby. To collect custom attributes, call the relevant API methods: For Ruby agent version 3.12.0 or higher, use the add_custom_attributes method. For example, to record a variable named @user_id, include this code in the parent method: ::NewRelic::Agent.add_custom_attributes({ user_id: @user.id }) Copy For Ruby agent version 3.11.2 or lower, use the add_custom_parameters method. For example, to record a variable named @user_id, include this code in the parent method: ::NewRelic::Agent.add_custom_parameters({ user_id: @user.id }) Copy Browser monitoring: Record custom attributes The browser agent provides an API to specify extra details associated with a page view or browser interaction, either by forwarding attributes from APM to browser monitoring or by specifying custom attributes through JavaScript. Values forwarded from the APM agent are encoded and injected into browser attributes by our browser agent. Infrastructure monitoring: Record custom attributes Our Infrastructure monitoring lets you create custom attributes that are used to annotate the data from the infrastructure agent. You can use this metadata to build filter sets, group your results, and annotate your data. Mobile monitoring: Record custom attributes Mobile agents include API calls to record custom attributes: For an overview of mobile monitoring custom data, see Insert custom events and attributes Android method: setAttribute iOS method: setAttribute",

For more information about service levels, please refer to our Support Plan. Community forum The New Relic Community Forum is 100% free and open to anyone with a New Relic account. The community is a place where many customer questions have already been asked and answered. Answers come from our community of experienced users, New Relic Support Engineers, and dozens of other Relics who help answer questions and solve problems. If you want to ask a question, check the community - if your question has not already been answered, members of the community can help. Github We want everyone to monitor their systems, and we're contributing our technology back to the open-source community to make that happen. You can find all our open source projects in our Github repo. We're committed to open standards, open-sourcing all of our instrumentation, and engaging engineers where they are, in the communities they already belong to. For more information on support for Open Source projects, visit our Open Source Support Policy. Diagnostic tools New Relic offers a diagnostics utility that can automatically detect common problems with New Relic agents. If Diagnostics detects a problem, it suggests troubleshooting steps. New Relic Diagnostics can also automatically attach troubleshooting data to a New Relic Support ticket. We have also made available Troubleshooting Frameworks that step users through common troubleshooting questions. Support ticket Support is now available in the New Relic One Platform! Just click on the question mark at the top right of your New Relic One screen to surface contextual documentation and resources. Depending on the Service Level associated with your New Relic account, you may be eligible for ticketed support and can open a ticket without leaving the New Relic One Platform. As an alternative, customers eligible for ticketed support may also open a support ticket from the New Relic Support page We are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year to help you troubleshoot issues related to the New Relic One Platform and generally available New Relic Products as outlined below. Scope of support You can have confidence that the Products we make Generally Available are fully tested with the compatible environments outlined in New Relic Documentation. New Relic’s Global Technical Support provides assistance for: the New Relic One platform and its features and capabilities, New Relic's monitoring and observability solutions, and our alerting and Applied Intelligence features. For issues within Third Party tools, or when tools in your infrastructure aren't working together properly, Global Technical Support may reach a point where we must refer New Relic users to such Third Party or community for assistance. Support includes Troubleshooting problems on the New Relic One Platform Assistance with issues during installation & upgrade in compatible environments Guidance on implementation and configuration in compatible environments Troubleshooting problems with ingesting data into New Relic General usage and best practice guidelines Identifying bugs with New Relic Products Assistance in English or Japanese Only (Japanese customer Terms of Service) Support does not include Unsupported or incompatible environments & frameworks Our Products are fully tested with the compatible environments and installation frameworks, and we’re here to help you through issues that may arise with our Products within these compatible environments and frameworks. We cannot support installation or configuration of our Products in environments or frameworks that do not meet established compatibility requirements. But if you're looking for help customizing New Relic for your particular environment, New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can assist with unique configurations or environments. Software customizations We are eager to help troubleshoot issues with the Products and features we make generally available, and those categorized as New Relic’s Open Source Community Plus Projects. New Relic’s Global Technical Support does not support customizations, modifications, or extensions to our code. Customizations or extensions to New Relic’s Open Source Projects in other Project categories are supported by the developer community in GitHub. New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can assist with unique configurations or environments. Custom applications With New Relic One, users have the ability to extend beyond the curated dashboards and design custom applications tailored to your business. New Relic’s Global Technical Support team does not support custom applications. The New Relic Developer site provides guidance on building custom apps, and here are a growing number of open source apps that you can use to get started. Custom scripts & queries We are happy to help troubleshoot issues related to the New Relic One platform that may be causing issues with a script or query. We cannot provide solutions for specific script or query use cases. New Relic Documentation and New Relic University offer resources on how to construct custom scripts and queries. End of Life New Relic may EOL products in accordance with the EOL policy. We recommend upgrading to our newest versions so you can take advantage of recent capabilities and bug fixes. More details are available in our published End of Life Policy. Beta or Limited Release Our support team covers generally available New Relic Products. Products that are in Beta or Limited Release status are not considered “generally available.” If you are invited to participate in a Beta program, or are using a Limited Release component, your account team will be your point of contact for questions. Please contact your account representative directly. Troubleshooting of customer environment We want to help every customer get the most of their New Relic experience within what are increasingly complex environments. However, we can’t help with things we didn’t build. We cannot assist with administration, configuration, or troubleshooting of a customer environment. When in doubt, you can get in touch with us, and we’ll help verify whether an issue is with our Product within a supported environment so you know where to go next. Troubleshooting third-party tools & services New Relic integrates well with many Third Party tools and services; however, we cannot support tools and services not provided or licensed by New Relic. We’ll do our best to determine whether an issue is with New Relic’s Products or caused by something outside of our control and purview. Issues with installation or configuration of the Third Party tools and services themselves should be directed to the respective owner of that Third Party tool or service or to the developer community. The Community and GitHub are great resources for assistance with Third Party tools and services as well. Some account-related functions For security reasons, some account-related Product functions must be conducted by the New Relic user designated as the “account owner,” such as Enabling SSO and High-Security Mode, adding users, and upgrading user permissions. Product training We are here to help you solve problems you may encounter on the road to instrumenting everything. Global Technical Support cannot provide user training on New Relic Products. New Relic offers a well-curated library of documentation and in-depth tutorials organized by Product, skill level, learning format, and solutions to help you navigate the observability journey. Check out New Relic University! Consultancy services Global Technical Support is here to help our valued customers as outlined in these support offerings. If you need help with something that falls outside of the Scope of Support, New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can help you navigate the challenges of building modern software and adopting the latest technologies, so you can focus on what you do best: delivering an incredible experience to your customers. Important As of March 10, 2021, you're no longer able to create a New Relic support ticket by emailing support@newrelic.com.

Once you're there, follow these steps: Click the ? icon in the upper right hand corner. Click I need more help. Select Create a Support Ticket. By creating a support ticket directly within your account, it will speed up the support process and improve our team’s ability to troubleshoot your issue more effectively. Open source support We want everyone to monitor their systems, and we're contributing our technology back to the open-source community to make that happen. We're committed to open standards, open-sourcing all of our instrumentation, and engaging engineers where they are, in the communities they already belong to.

      "body": "Last updated September 17, 2021. This is supplement to our security policy and serves as a guide to New Relic’s description of its Services, functionalities, and features. Tip We may update the URLs in this document without notice. Security Program New Relic follows \"privacy by design\" principles as described here: https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/security/security-privacy/data-privacy/data-privacy-new-relic/. Security Domains New Relic’s policies and procedures cover industry-recognized security domains such as Endpoint Protection; Portable Media Security; Mobile Device Security; Wireless Security; Configuration Management; Vulnerability Management; Network Protection; Transmission Protection; Password Management; Access Control, Audit Logging & Monitoring; Education, Training, and Awareness; Third Party Assurance; Incident Management; Business Continuity and Disaster Recover; Risk Management; Data Protection & Privacy; and Service Management Systems. Security Certifications New Relic audits its Services against industry standards as described at https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/security/security-privacy/compliance/regulatory-audits-new-relic-services/. Data Control, Facilities, and Encryption New Relic's customers can send data to New Relic's APIs by (1) using New Relic's software, (2) using vendor-neutral software that is managed and maintained by a third-party such as via OpenTelemetry instrumentation provided by opentelemetry.io, or (3) from third-party systems that customer's manage and/or control. New Relic's customers can use New Relic's Services such as NerdGraph to filter out and drop data. See https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/telemetry-data-platform/manage-data/drop-data-using-nerdgraph/. New Relic's customers can adjust their data retention periods as appropriate for their needs. See https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/telemetry-data-platform/manage-data/manage-data-retention/#adjust-retention. New Relic Logs obfuscates numbers that match known patterns, such as bank card and social security numbers as described here: https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/logs/log-management/get-started/new-relics-log-management-security-privacy/. New Relic honors requests to delete personal data in accordance with applicable privacy laws. Please see https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/security/security-privacy/data-privacy/data-privacy-new-relic/. Customers may use New Relic's APIs to query data, such as NerdGraph described here, and New Relic Services to export the data to other cloud providers. Customers can configure its log forwarder [https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/logs/enable-log-management-new-relic/enable-log-monitoring-new-relic/forward-your-logs-using-infrastructure-agent/] before sending infrastructure logs to New Relic.

Tip We may update the URLs in this document without notice. Security Program New Relic follows \"privacy by design\" principles as described here: https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/security/security-privacy/data-privacy/data-privacy-new-relic/. Security Domains New Relic’s policies and procedures cover industry-recognized security domains such as Endpoint Protection; Portable Media Security; Mobile Device Security; Wireless Security; Configuration Management; Vulnerability Management; Network Protection; Transmission Protection; Password Management; Access Control, Audit Logging & Monitoring; Education, Training, and Awareness; Third Party Assurance; Incident Management; Business Continuity and Disaster Recover; Risk Management; Data Protection & Privacy; and Service Management Systems. Security Certifications New Relic audits its Services against industry standards as described at https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/security/security-privacy/compliance/regulatory-audits-new-relic-services/. Data Control, Facilities, and Encryption New Relic's customers can send data to New Relic's APIs by (1) using New Relic's software, (2) using vendor-neutral software that is managed and maintained by a third-party such as via OpenTelemetry instrumentation provided by opentelemetry.io, or (3) from third-party systems that customer's manage and/or control. New Relic's customers can use New Relic's Services such as NerdGraph to filter out and drop data. See https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/telemetry-data-platform/manage-data/drop-data-using-nerdgraph/. New Relic's customers can adjust their data retention periods as appropriate for their needs. See https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/telemetry-data-platform/manage-data/manage-data-retention/#adjust-retention. New Relic Logs obfuscates numbers that match known patterns, such as bank card and social security numbers as described here: https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/logs/log-management/get-started/new-relics-log-management-security-privacy/. New Relic honors requests to delete personal data in accordance with applicable privacy laws. Please see https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/security/security-privacy/data-privacy/data-privacy-new-relic/. Customers may use New Relic's APIs to query data, such as NerdGraph described here, and New Relic Services to export the data to other cloud providers. Customers can configure its log forwarder [https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/logs/enable-log-management-new-relic/enable-log-monitoring-new-relic/forward-your-logs-using-infrastructure-agent/] before sending infrastructure logs to New Relic.

      "body": "Last updated September 17, 2021. This is supplement to our security policy and serves as a guide to New Relic’s description of its Services, functionalities, and features. Tip We may update the URLs in this document without notice. Security Program New Relic follows \"privacy by design\" principles as described here: https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/security/security-privacy/data-privacy/data-privacy-new-relic/. Security Domains New Relic’s policies and procedures cover industry-recognized security domains such as Endpoint Protection; Portable Media Security; Mobile Device Security; Wireless Security; Configuration Management; Vulnerability Management; Network Protection; Transmission Protection; Password Management; Access Control, Audit Logging & Monitoring; Education, Training, and Awareness; Third Party Assurance; Incident Management; Business Continuity and Disaster Recover; Risk Management; Data Protection & Privacy; and Service Management Systems. Security Certifications New Relic audits its Services against industry standards as described at https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/security/security-privacy/compliance/regulatory-audits-new-relic-services/. Data Control, Facilities, and Encryption New Relic's customers can send data to New Relic's APIs by (1) using New Relic's software, (2) using vendor-neutral software that is managed and maintained by a third-party such as via OpenTelemetry instrumentation provided by opentelemetry.io, or (3) from third-party systems that customer's manage and/or control. New Relic's customers can use New Relic's Services such as NerdGraph to filter out and drop data. See https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/telemetry-data-platform/manage-data/drop-data-using-nerdgraph/.

Answers come from our community of experienced users, New Relic Support Engineers, and dozens of other Relics who help answer questions and solve problems. If you want to ask a question, check the community - if your question has not already been answered, members of the community can help. Github We want everyone to monitor their systems, and we're contributing our technology back to the open-source community to make that happen. You can find all our open source projects in our Github repo. We're committed to open standards, open-sourcing all of our instrumentation, and engaging engineers where they are, in the communities they already belong to. For more information on support for Open Source projects, visit our Open Source Support Policy. Diagnostic tools New Relic offers a diagnostics utility that can automatically detect common problems with New Relic agents. If Diagnostics detects a problem, it suggests troubleshooting steps. New Relic Diagnostics can also automatically attach troubleshooting data to a New Relic Support ticket. We have also made available Troubleshooting Frameworks that step users through common troubleshooting questions. Support ticket Support is now available in the New Relic One Platform! Just click on the question mark at the top right of your New Relic One screen to surface contextual documentation and resources. Depending on the Service Level associated with your New Relic account, you may be eligible for ticketed support and can open a ticket without leaving the New Relic One Platform. As an alternative, customers eligible for ticketed support may also open a support ticket from the New Relic Support page We are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year to help you troubleshoot issues related to the New Relic One Platform and generally available New Relic Products as outlined below. Scope of support You can have confidence that the Products we make Generally Available are fully tested with the compatible environments outlined in New Relic Documentation. New Relic’s Global Technical Support provides assistance for: the New Relic One platform and its features and capabilities, New Relic's monitoring and observability solutions, and our alerting and Applied Intelligence features. For issues within Third Party tools, or when tools in your infrastructure aren't working together properly, Global Technical Support may reach a point where we must refer New Relic users to such Third Party or community for assistance. Support includes Troubleshooting problems on the New Relic One Platform Assistance with issues during installation & upgrade in compatible environments Guidance on implementation and configuration in compatible environments Troubleshooting problems with ingesting data into New Relic General usage and best practice guidelines Identifying bugs with New Relic Products Assistance in English or Japanese Only (Japanese customer Terms of Service) Support does not include Unsupported or incompatible environments & frameworks Our Products are fully tested with the compatible environments and installation frameworks, and we’re here to help you through issues that may arise with our Products within these compatible environments and frameworks. We cannot support installation or configuration of our Products in environments or frameworks that do not meet established compatibility requirements. But if you're looking for help customizing New Relic for your particular environment, New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can assist with unique configurations or environments. Software customizations We are eager to help troubleshoot issues with the Products and features we make generally available, and those categorized as New Relic’s Open Source Community Plus Projects.

Customizations or extensions to New Relic’s Open Source Projects in other Project categories are supported by the developer community in GitHub. New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can assist with unique configurations or environments. Custom applications With New Relic One, users have the ability to extend beyond the curated dashboards and design custom applications tailored to your business. New Relic’s Global Technical Support team does not support custom applications. The New Relic Developer site provides guidance on building custom apps, and here are a growing number of open source apps that you can use to get started. Custom scripts & queries We are happy to help troubleshoot issues related to the New Relic One platform that may be causing issues with a script or query. We cannot provide solutions for specific script or query use cases. New Relic Documentation and New Relic University offer resources on how to construct custom scripts and queries. End of Life New Relic may EOL products in accordance with the EOL policy. We recommend upgrading to our newest versions so you can take advantage of recent capabilities and bug fixes. More details are available in our published End of Life Policy. Beta or Limited Release Our support team covers generally available New Relic Products. Products that are in Beta or Limited Release status are not considered “generally available.” If you are invited to participate in a Beta program, or are using a Limited Release component, your account team will be your point of contact for questions. Please contact your account representative directly. Troubleshooting of customer environment We want to help every customer get the most of their New Relic experience within what are increasingly complex environments. However, we can’t help with things we didn’t build. We cannot assist with administration, configuration, or troubleshooting of a customer environment. When in doubt, you can get in touch with us, and we’ll help verify whether an issue is with our Product within a supported environment so you know where to go next. Troubleshooting third-party tools & services New Relic integrates well with many Third Party tools and services; however, we cannot support tools and services not provided or licensed by New Relic. We’ll do our best to determine whether an issue is with New Relic’s Products or caused by something outside of our control and purview. Issues with installation or configuration of the Third Party tools and services themselves should be directed to the respective owner of that Third Party tool or service or to the developer community. The Community and GitHub are great resources for assistance with Third Party tools and services as well. Some account-related functions For security reasons, some account-related Product functions must be conducted by the New Relic user designated as the “account owner,” such as Enabling SSO and High-Security Mode, adding users, and upgrading user permissions. Product training We are here to help you solve problems you may encounter on the road to instrumenting everything. Global Technical Support cannot provide user training on New Relic Products. New Relic offers a well-curated library of documentation and in-depth tutorials organized by Product, skill level, learning format, and solutions to help you navigate the observability journey. Check out New Relic University! Consultancy services Global Technical Support is here to help our valued customers as outlined in these support offerings.

We strive to keep our resources operating efficiently, so our services are available to all subscribers. Because you have access to shared resources, we have put these rules in place to ensure everyone has a great experience. For example, you as a tenant would not want other tenants to engage in the types of activities described below. To help us do this, we have put some rules in place regarding your use of the New Relic Properties and created this Acceptable Use Policy (“AUP”). This AUP applies if you use any New Relic product, service, software, website, forum, page or system (collectively, the “New Relic Properties”) and is part of the technical guides documentation that New Relic makes available at dedicated 'Documentation' pages on New Relic websites, including, but not limited to, https://docs.newrelic.com, https://docs.pixielabs.ai/, and https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/codestream (the “Documentation”). In connection with your use of the New Relic Properties, you will not, and you will not allow third parties to:: Harm New Relic’s Properties and interests, such as: Uploading, transmitting or otherwise provide content that infringes New Relic’s or a third party’s intellectual property, privacy or other rights, violates applicable laws or regulations or contains viruses, worms, harmful code, malware or other harmful materials; Hosting, selling, reselling, renting, exploiting, sublicensing, leasing, or otherwise providing the New Relic Properties or any portion thereof or use such for time sharing purposes or on a service bureau basis without our express written permission; Modifying, disabling, or compromising the integrity or performance of the New Relic Properties or related systems, networks, or data; including by: Attempting to compromise the integrity of the New Relic Properties, including probing, scanning or testing the vulnerability of any part of the New Relic Properties without proper authorization; Overwhelming our infrastructure (such as by using “botnets”, “robots,” “spiders” and “offline readers”); Going beyond the use parameters for any given service as described in the corresponding Documentation; Using metatags or other “hidden text”; Drastically exceeding your contracted rate of use as set forth in your order or the Documentation; or Consuming an unreasonable amount of storage.

Harass others or engage in activity that is unlawful, invasive, infringing, defamatory, fraudulent or violates anyone's legal rights, such as: Posting or transmitting abusive messages, defamatory, libelous, false or misleading statements, hate speech or messages that incite or threaten violence, or stalk or harass others; Promoting, encouraging, or facilitating hate speech, violence, discrimination based on race, color, sexual orientation, marital status, gender or identity expression, parental status, religion or creed, national origin or ancestry, sex, age, physical or mental disability, veteran status, genetic information, citizenship and/or any other characteristic protected by law. You are not permitted to use New Relic Properties if you are an entity identified by nationally-recognized non-profits as engaging in such activities. Using the New Relic Properties in violation of your company's policy(ies) and procedures, or attempting to modify or gain unauthorized use of or access to, another user's account, website, application, system, equipment or data; Misrepresenting yourself, impersonating another person, falsely implying any sponsorship or association with New Relic or affiliation with any third party, engaging in fraud, hiding or attempt to hide your identity or disguising the origin of any content (including by “spoofing” or “phishing”); Collecting or harvesting any personally identifiable information, including account names, from any other user’s account or the New Relic Properties, or using the New Relic Properties to violate the privacy of others; Including, publishing or posting other people’s private and confidential information without their express permission; Using anyone’s name or trademarks without their express written permission; Using the New Relic Properties to generate or send unsolicited communications, advertising, chain letters, or spam; Soliciting our users for commercial purposes, unless expressly permitted in writing by New Relic; Disparaging anyone; or Disclosing any confidential information obtained through any method contrary to this AUP. Violate any applicable law or regulation or for high-risk purposes, such as: Using the New Relic Properties in violation of any applicable law or regulation, including data, privacy, and export control laws in applicable jurisdictions; Using the New Relic Properties in any situation for which they are not designed, manufactured or intended, such as for use in life support, emergency or mission critical circumstances, or in any activities where use or failure of the New Relic Properties could lead to death, personal injury or property or environmental damage. For example, you may not use, or permit any other person to use, the New Relic Properties in connection with aircraft or other modes of human mass transportation or nuclear or chemical facilities, life support systems, implantable medical equipment, motor vehicles, or weaponry systems; or Querying or otherwise configuring, processing or submitting any personal data that could be legally considered sensitive in any applicable jurisdiction, including, but not limited to: (i) patient, medical, or other protected health information regulated by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (as amended and supplemented) (“HIPAA”); (ii) personal data about individuals under the age of 16, which for the avoidance of doubt includes any “personal information” as such term is defined under the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act; (iii) government issued identification numbers, including Social Security numbers, driver’s license numbers and other state-issued identification numbers; (iv) financial account information, including financial account numbers or payment card data (including credit card or debit card numbers); (v) credentials granting access to an online account, including the combination of a username or email address along with a password or security question and answer that would permit access to an online account; (vi) special categories of sensitive personal data, (such as defined under Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament), including personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious beliefs, trade union membership, physical or mental health or condition, sexual life, sexual orientation, genetic data, biometric data, or the commission or alleged commission any crime or offense; (vii) precise geo-location data; or (viii) any data similar to the above protected under foreign or domestic laws, including without limitation any data subject to regulation under the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), 22 C.F.R. §§ 120-130. You represent and warrant to New Relic that you have all necessary rights, consents, and permissions to use and submit data that you send to the New Relic Properties, all without violating or infringing any applicable laws, third-party rights (including intellectual property, publicity, or privacy rights), or any terms or policies governing such data. New Relic Properties do not include Third-Party Services If you choose to use any Third Party Services, your use of Third-Party Services is wholly subject to your separate agreement with the relevant provider. New Relic bears no responsibility or liability for Third-Party Services. If you enable a Third-Party Service with the New Relic Properties, New Relic may access and exchange Customer Data with the Third-Party Service on your behalf and instruction. “Third-Party Services” means any third party platform, add-on, service, or product not provided by New Relic and that a User integrates or enables for use with the Service, including third-party applications and plug-ins. Open source software that New Relic makes separately available for download (e.g. community tools) is, as required, governed by the terms of the applicable open source license. The license for any open source software identified as included in New Relic Properties will, as required, wholly apply to your use of that open source software. Updates, Contact Information and Violations We will occasionally need to modify this AUP to help us continue to provide you with a great experience while using the New Relic Properties. In the event we modify this AUP, we will do so by posting a revised version, and any changes will be effective immediately if you’re a new user of the New Relic Properties and thirty (30) days after posting for all other users. If you continue using the New Relic Properties after we update this AUP, you agree to the latest version of this AUP. You can report a violation of this AUP to: AUP@newrelic.com. Or by mail at: Attn: Legal New Relic, Inc. 188 Spear Street, Suite 1200 San Francisco, CA 94105 This AUP, and our customers’ compliance with it, is essential for enabling us to provide you and our other customers with the New Relic Properties, which we take very seriously. You are wholly and solely responsible for appropriate configuration of systems and software that you own or can control to ensure your compliance with this AUP. So, if we determine in our sole discretion that you have violated this AUP, we may, without limiting any other remedies available to us, permanently or temporarily suspend, limit, or terminate your access to the New Relic Properties without notice or liability. This right applies even if the breach is unintentional or unauthorized if we believe that any such suspension, limitation, or termination is necessary to ensure compliance with laws, or to protect the rights, safety, privacy, security, or property of us or others. In this AUP, the term “content” means: (1) any information, data, text, software, code, scripts, music, sound, photos, graphics, videos, messages, tags, interactive features, or other materials that you post, upload, share, submit, or otherwise provide in any manner to the services and (2) any other materials, content, or data you provide to New Relic or use with the New Relic Properties. As used in this AUP, “you” may refer to an individual user or the legal entity an individual user is employed by that has contracted with New Relic, and “we” means New Relic.",

For more information about service levels, please refer to our Support Plan. Community forum The New Relic Community Forum is 100% free and open to anyone with a New Relic account. The community is a place where many customer questions have already been asked and answered. Answers come from our community of experienced users, New Relic Support Engineers, and dozens of other Relics who help answer questions and solve problems. If you want to ask a question, check the community - if your question has not already been answered, members of the community can help. Github We want everyone to monitor their systems, and we're contributing our technology back to the open-source community to make that happen. You can find all our open source projects in our Github repo. We're committed to open standards, open-sourcing all of our instrumentation, and engaging engineers where they are, in the communities they already belong to. For more information on support for Open Source projects, visit our Open Source Support Policy. Diagnostic tools New Relic offers a diagnostics utility that can automatically detect common problems with New Relic agents. If Diagnostics detects a problem, it suggests troubleshooting steps. New Relic Diagnostics can also automatically attach troubleshooting data to a New Relic Support ticket. We have also made available Troubleshooting Frameworks that step users through common troubleshooting questions. Support ticket Support is now available in the New Relic One Platform! Just click on the question mark at the top right of your New Relic One screen to surface contextual documentation and resources. Depending on the Service Level associated with your New Relic account, you may be eligible for ticketed support and can open a ticket without leaving the New Relic One Platform. As an alternative, customers eligible for ticketed support may also open a support ticket from the New Relic Support page We are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year to help you troubleshoot issues related to the New Relic One Platform and generally available New Relic Products as outlined below. Scope of support You can have confidence that the Products we make Generally Available are fully tested with the compatible environments outlined in New Relic Documentation. New Relic’s Global Technical Support provides assistance for: the New Relic One platform and its features and capabilities, New Relic's monitoring and observability solutions, and our alerting and Applied Intelligence features. For issues within Third Party tools, or when tools in your infrastructure aren't working together properly, Global Technical Support may reach a point where we must refer New Relic users to such Third Party or community for assistance. Support includes Troubleshooting problems on the New Relic One Platform Assistance with issues during installation & upgrade in compatible environments Guidance on implementation and configuration in compatible environments Troubleshooting problems with ingesting data into New Relic General usage and best practice guidelines Identifying bugs with New Relic Products Assistance in English or Japanese Only (Japanese customer Terms of Service) Support does not include Unsupported or incompatible environments & frameworks Our Products are fully tested with the compatible environments and installation frameworks, and we’re here to help you through issues that may arise with our Products within these compatible environments and frameworks. We cannot support installation or configuration of our Products in environments or frameworks that do not meet established compatibility requirements. But if you're looking for help customizing New Relic for your particular environment, New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can assist with unique configurations or environments. Software customizations We are eager to help troubleshoot issues with the Products and features we make generally available, and those categorized as New Relic’s Open Source Community Plus Projects. New Relic’s Global Technical Support does not support customizations, modifications, or extensions to our code. Customizations or extensions to New Relic’s Open Source Projects in other Project categories are supported by the developer community in GitHub. New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can assist with unique configurations or environments. Custom applications With New Relic One, users have the ability to extend beyond the curated dashboards and design custom applications tailored to your business. New Relic’s Global Technical Support team does not support custom applications. The New Relic Developer site provides guidance on building custom apps, and here are a growing number of open source apps that you can use to get started. Custom scripts & queries We are happy to help troubleshoot issues related to the New Relic One platform that may be causing issues with a script or query. We cannot provide solutions for specific script or query use cases. New Relic Documentation and New Relic University offer resources on how to construct custom scripts and queries. End of Life New Relic may EOL products in accordance with the EOL policy. We recommend upgrading to our newest versions so you can take advantage of recent capabilities and bug fixes. More details are available in our published End of Life Policy. Beta or Limited Release Our support team covers generally available New Relic Products. Products that are in Beta or Limited Release status are not considered “generally available.” If you are invited to participate in a Beta program, or are using a Limited Release component, your account team will be your point of contact for questions. Please contact your account representative directly. Troubleshooting of customer environment We want to help every customer get the most of their New Relic experience within what are increasingly complex environments. However, we can’t help with things we didn’t build. We cannot assist with administration, configuration, or troubleshooting of a customer environment. When in doubt, you can get in touch with us, and we’ll help verify whether an issue is with our Product within a supported environment so you know where to go next. Troubleshooting third-party tools & services New Relic integrates well with many Third Party tools and services; however, we cannot support tools and services not provided or licensed by New Relic. We’ll do our best to determine whether an issue is with New Relic’s Products or caused by something outside of our control and purview. Issues with installation or configuration of the Third Party tools and services themselves should be directed to the respective owner of that Third Party tool or service or to the developer community. The Community and GitHub are great resources for assistance with Third Party tools and services as well. Some account-related functions For security reasons, some account-related Product functions must be conducted by the New Relic user designated as the “account owner,” such as Enabling SSO and High-Security Mode, adding users, and upgrading user permissions. Product training We are here to help you solve problems you may encounter on the road to instrumenting everything. Global Technical Support cannot provide user training on New Relic Products. New Relic offers a well-curated library of documentation and in-depth tutorials organized by Product, skill level, learning format, and solutions to help you navigate the observability journey. Check out New Relic University! Consultancy services Global Technical Support is here to help our valued customers as outlined in these support offerings. If you need help with something that falls outside of the Scope of Support, New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can help you navigate the challenges of building modern software and adopting the latest technologies, so you can focus on what you do best: delivering an incredible experience to your customers. Important As of March 10, 2021, you're no longer able to create a New Relic support ticket by emailing support@newrelic.com.

Once you're there, follow these steps: Click the ? icon in the upper right hand corner. Click I need more help. Select Create a Support Ticket. By creating a support ticket directly within your account, it will speed up the support process and improve our team’s ability to troubleshoot your issue more effectively. Open source support We want everyone to monitor their systems, and we're contributing our technology back to the open-source community to make that happen. We're committed to open standards, open-sourcing all of our instrumentation, and engaging engineers where they are, in the communities they already belong to.

Or by mail at: Attn: Legal New Relic, Inc. 188 Spear Street, Suite 1200 San Francisco, CA 94105 This AUP, and our customers’ compliance with it, is essential for enabling us to provide you and our other customers with the New Relic Properties, which we take very seriously. You are wholly and solely responsible for appropriate configuration of systems and software that you own or can control to ensure your compliance with this AUP. So, if we determine in our sole discretion that you have violated this AUP, we may, without limiting any other remedies available to us, permanently or temporarily suspend, limit, or terminate your access to the New Relic Properties without notice or liability. This right applies even if the breach is unintentional or unauthorized if we believe that any such suspension, limitation, or termination is necessary to ensure compliance with laws, or to protect the rights, safety, privacy, security, or property of us or others. In this AUP, the term “content” means: (1) any information, data, text, software, code, scripts, music, sound, photos, graphics, videos, messages, tags, interactive features, or other materials that you post, upload, share, submit, or otherwise provide in any manner to the services and (2) any other materials, content, or data you provide to New Relic or use with the New Relic Properties. As used in this AUP, “you” may refer to an individual user or the legal entity an individual user is employed by that has contracted with New Relic, and “we” means New Relic.",

For more information about service levels, please refer to our Support Plan. Community forum The New Relic Community Forum is 100% free and open to anyone with a New Relic account. The community is a place where many customer questions have already been asked and answered. Answers come from our community of experienced users, New Relic Support Engineers, and dozens of other Relics who help answer questions and solve problems. If you want to ask a question, check the community - if your question has not already been answered, members of the community can help. Github We want everyone to monitor their systems, and we're contributing our technology back to the open-source community to make that happen. You can find all our open source projects in our Github repo. We're committed to open standards, open-sourcing all of our instrumentation, and engaging engineers where they are, in the communities they already belong to. For more information on support for Open Source projects, visit our Open Source Support Policy. Diagnostic tools New Relic offers a diagnostics utility that can automatically detect common problems with New Relic agents. If Diagnostics detects a problem, it suggests troubleshooting steps. New Relic Diagnostics can also automatically attach troubleshooting data to a New Relic Support ticket. We have also made available Troubleshooting Frameworks that step users through common troubleshooting questions. Support ticket Support is now available in the New Relic One Platform! Just click on the question mark at the top right of your New Relic One screen to surface contextual documentation and resources. Depending on the Service Level associated with your New Relic account, you may be eligible for ticketed support and can open a ticket without leaving the New Relic One Platform. As an alternative, customers eligible for ticketed support may also open a support ticket from the New Relic Support page We are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year to help you troubleshoot issues related to the New Relic One Platform and generally available New Relic Products as outlined below. Scope of support You can have confidence that the Products we make Generally Available are fully tested with the compatible environments outlined in New Relic Documentation. New Relic’s Global Technical Support provides assistance for: the New Relic One platform and its features and capabilities, New Relic's monitoring and observability solutions, and our alerting and Applied Intelligence features. For issues within Third Party tools, or when tools in your infrastructure aren't working together properly, Global Technical Support may reach a point where we must refer New Relic users to such Third Party or community for assistance. Support includes Troubleshooting problems on the New Relic One Platform Assistance with issues during installation & upgrade in compatible environments Guidance on implementation and configuration in compatible environments Troubleshooting problems with ingesting data into New Relic General usage and best practice guidelines Identifying bugs with New Relic Products Assistance in English or Japanese Only (Japanese customer Terms of Service) Support does not include Unsupported or incompatible environments & frameworks Our Products are fully tested with the compatible environments and installation frameworks, and we’re here to help you through issues that may arise with our Products within these compatible environments and frameworks. We cannot support installation or configuration of our Products in environments or frameworks that do not meet established compatibility requirements. But if you're looking for help customizing New Relic for your particular environment, New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can assist with unique configurations or environments. Software customizations We are eager to help troubleshoot issues with the Products and features we make generally available, and those categorized as New Relic’s Open Source Community Plus Projects. New Relic’s Global Technical Support does not support customizations, modifications, or extensions to our code. Customizations or extensions to New Relic’s Open Source Projects in other Project categories are supported by the developer community in GitHub. New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can assist with unique configurations or environments. Custom applications With New Relic One, users have the ability to extend beyond the curated dashboards and design custom applications tailored to your business. New Relic’s Global Technical Support team does not support custom applications. The New Relic Developer site provides guidance on building custom apps, and here are a growing number of open source apps that you can use to get started. Custom scripts & queries We are happy to help troubleshoot issues related to the New Relic One platform that may be causing issues with a script or query. We cannot provide solutions for specific script or query use cases. New Relic Documentation and New Relic University offer resources on how to construct custom scripts and queries. End of Life New Relic may EOL products in accordance with the EOL policy. We recommend upgrading to our newest versions so you can take advantage of recent capabilities and bug fixes. More details are available in our published End of Life Policy. Beta or Limited Release Our support team covers generally available New Relic Products. Products that are in Beta or Limited Release status are not considered “generally available.” If you are invited to participate in a Beta program, or are using a Limited Release component, your account team will be your point of contact for questions. Please contact your account representative directly. Troubleshooting of customer environment We want to help every customer get the most of their New Relic experience within what are increasingly complex environments. However, we can’t help with things we didn’t build. We cannot assist with administration, configuration, or troubleshooting of a customer environment. When in doubt, you can get in touch with us, and we’ll help verify whether an issue is with our Product within a supported environment so you know where to go next. Troubleshooting third-party tools & services New Relic integrates well with many Third Party tools and services; however, we cannot support tools and services not provided or licensed by New Relic. We’ll do our best to determine whether an issue is with New Relic’s Products or caused by something outside of our control and purview. Issues with installation or configuration of the Third Party tools and services themselves should be directed to the respective owner of that Third Party tool or service or to the developer community. The Community and GitHub are great resources for assistance with Third Party tools and services as well. Some account-related functions For security reasons, some account-related Product functions must be conducted by the New Relic user designated as the “account owner,” such as Enabling SSO and High-Security Mode, adding users, and upgrading user permissions. Product training We are here to help you solve problems you may encounter on the road to instrumenting everything. Global Technical Support cannot provide user training on New Relic Products. New Relic offers a well-curated library of documentation and in-depth tutorials organized by Product, skill level, learning format, and solutions to help you navigate the observability journey. Check out New Relic University! Consultancy services Global Technical Support is here to help our valued customers as outlined in these support offerings. If you need help with something that falls outside of the Scope of Support, New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can help you navigate the challenges of building modern software and adopting the latest technologies, so you can focus on what you do best: delivering an incredible experience to your customers. Important As of March 10, 2021, you're no longer able to create a New Relic support ticket by emailing support@newrelic.com.

Once you're there, follow these steps: Click the ? icon in the upper right hand corner. Click I need more help. Select Create a Support Ticket. By creating a support ticket directly within your account, it will speed up the support process and improve our team’s ability to troubleshoot your issue more effectively. Open source support We want everyone to monitor their systems, and we're contributing our technology back to the open-source community to make that happen. We're committed to open standards, open-sourcing all of our instrumentation, and engaging engineers where they are, in the communities they already belong to.

New Relic Properties do not include Third-Party Services If you choose to use any Third Party Services, your use of Third-Party Services is wholly subject to your separate agreement with the relevant provider. New Relic bears no responsibility or liability for Third-Party Services. If you enable a Third-Party Service with the New Relic Properties, New Relic may access and exchange Customer Data with the Third-Party Service on your behalf and instruction. “Third-Party Services” means any third party platform, add-on, service, or product not provided by New Relic and that a User integrates or enables for use with the Service, including third-party applications and plug-ins.

Or by mail at: Attn: Legal New Relic, Inc. 188 Spear Street, Suite 1200 San Francisco, CA 94105 This AUP, and our customers’ compliance with it, is essential for enabling us to provide you and our other customers with the New Relic Properties, which we take very seriously. You are wholly and solely responsible for appropriate configuration of systems and software that you own or can control to ensure your compliance with this AUP. So, if we determine in our sole discretion that you have violated this AUP, we may, without limiting any other remedies available to us, permanently or temporarily suspend, limit, or terminate your access to the New Relic Properties without notice or liability. This right applies even if the breach is unintentional or unauthorized if we believe that any such suspension, limitation, or termination is necessary to ensure compliance with laws, or to protect the rights, safety, privacy, security, or property of us or others. In this AUP, the term “content” means: (1) any information, data, text, software, code, scripts, music, sound, photos, graphics, videos, messages, tags, interactive features, or other materials that you post, upload, share, submit, or otherwise provide in any manner to the services and (2) any other materials, content, or data you provide to New Relic or use with the New Relic Properties. As used in this AUP, “you” may refer to an individual user or the legal entity an individual user is employed by that has contracted with New Relic, and “we” means New Relic.",

For more information about service levels, please refer to our Support Plan. Community forum The New Relic Community Forum is 100% free and open to anyone with a New Relic account. The community is a place where many customer questions have already been asked and answered. Answers come from our community of experienced users, New Relic Support Engineers, and dozens of other Relics who help answer questions and solve problems. If you want to ask a question, check the community - if your question has not already been answered, members of the community can help. Github We want everyone to monitor their systems, and we're contributing our technology back to the open-source community to make that happen. You can find all our open source projects in our Github repo. We're committed to open standards, open-sourcing all of our instrumentation, and engaging engineers where they are, in the communities they already belong to. For more information on support for Open Source projects, visit our Open Source Support Policy. Diagnostic tools New Relic offers a diagnostics utility that can automatically detect common problems with New Relic agents. If Diagnostics detects a problem, it suggests troubleshooting steps. New Relic Diagnostics can also automatically attach troubleshooting data to a New Relic Support ticket. We have also made available Troubleshooting Frameworks that step users through common troubleshooting questions. Support ticket Support is now available in the New Relic One Platform! Just click on the question mark at the top right of your New Relic One screen to surface contextual documentation and resources. Depending on the Service Level associated with your New Relic account, you may be eligible for ticketed support and can open a ticket without leaving the New Relic One Platform. As an alternative, customers eligible for ticketed support may also open a support ticket from the New Relic Support page We are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year to help you troubleshoot issues related to the New Relic One Platform and generally available New Relic Products as outlined below. Scope of support You can have confidence that the Products we make Generally Available are fully tested with the compatible environments outlined in New Relic Documentation. New Relic’s Global Technical Support provides assistance for: the New Relic One platform and its features and capabilities, New Relic's monitoring and observability solutions, and our alerting and Applied Intelligence features. For issues within Third Party tools, or when tools in your infrastructure aren't working together properly, Global Technical Support may reach a point where we must refer New Relic users to such Third Party or community for assistance. Support includes Troubleshooting problems on the New Relic One Platform Assistance with issues during installation & upgrade in compatible environments Guidance on implementation and configuration in compatible environments Troubleshooting problems with ingesting data into New Relic General usage and best practice guidelines Identifying bugs with New Relic Products Assistance in English or Japanese Only (Japanese customer Terms of Service) Support does not include Unsupported or incompatible environments & frameworks Our Products are fully tested with the compatible environments and installation frameworks, and we’re here to help you through issues that may arise with our Products within these compatible environments and frameworks. We cannot support installation or configuration of our Products in environments or frameworks that do not meet established compatibility requirements. But if you're looking for help customizing New Relic for your particular environment, New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can assist with unique configurations or environments. Software customizations We are eager to help troubleshoot issues with the Products and features we make generally available, and those categorized as New Relic’s Open Source Community Plus Projects. New Relic’s Global Technical Support does not support customizations, modifications, or extensions to our code. Customizations or extensions to New Relic’s Open Source Projects in other Project categories are supported by the developer community in GitHub. New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can assist with unique configurations or environments. Custom applications With New Relic One, users have the ability to extend beyond the curated dashboards and design custom applications tailored to your business. New Relic’s Global Technical Support team does not support custom applications. The New Relic Developer site provides guidance on building custom apps, and here are a growing number of open source apps that you can use to get started. Custom scripts & queries We are happy to help troubleshoot issues related to the New Relic One platform that may be causing issues with a script or query. We cannot provide solutions for specific script or query use cases. New Relic Documentation and New Relic University offer resources on how to construct custom scripts and queries. End of Life New Relic may EOL products in accordance with the EOL policy. We recommend upgrading to our newest versions so you can take advantage of recent capabilities and bug fixes. More details are available in our published End of Life Policy. Beta or Limited Release Our support team covers generally available New Relic Products. Products that are in Beta or Limited Release status are not considered “generally available.” If you are invited to participate in a Beta program, or are using a Limited Release component, your account team will be your point of contact for questions. Please contact your account representative directly. Troubleshooting of customer environment We want to help every customer get the most of their New Relic experience within what are increasingly complex environments. However, we can’t help with things we didn’t build. We cannot assist with administration, configuration, or troubleshooting of a customer environment. When in doubt, you can get in touch with us, and we’ll help verify whether an issue is with our Product within a supported environment so you know where to go next. Troubleshooting third-party tools & services New Relic integrates well with many Third Party tools and services; however, we cannot support tools and services not provided or licensed by New Relic. We’ll do our best to determine whether an issue is with New Relic’s Products or caused by something outside of our control and purview. Issues with installation or configuration of the Third Party tools and services themselves should be directed to the respective owner of that Third Party tool or service or to the developer community. The Community and GitHub are great resources for assistance with Third Party tools and services as well. Some account-related functions For security reasons, some account-related Product functions must be conducted by the New Relic user designated as the “account owner,” such as Enabling SSO and High-Security Mode, adding users, and upgrading user permissions. Product training We are here to help you solve problems you may encounter on the road to instrumenting everything. Global Technical Support cannot provide user training on New Relic Products. New Relic offers a well-curated library of documentation and in-depth tutorials organized by Product, skill level, learning format, and solutions to help you navigate the observability journey. Check out New Relic University! Consultancy services Global Technical Support is here to help our valued customers as outlined in these support offerings. If you need help with something that falls outside of the Scope of Support, New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can help you navigate the challenges of building modern software and adopting the latest technologies, so you can focus on what you do best: delivering an incredible experience to your customers.

By creating a support ticket directly within your account, it will speed up the support process and improve our team’s ability to troubleshoot your issue more effectively. Open source support We want everyone to monitor their systems, and we're contributing our technology back to the open-source community to make that happen. We're committed to open standards, open-sourcing all of our instrumentation, and engaging engineers where they are, in the communities they already belong to.

Or by mail at: Attn: Legal New Relic, Inc. 188 Spear Street, Suite 1200 San Francisco, CA 94105 This AUP, and our customers’ compliance with it, is essential for enabling us to provide you and our other customers with the New Relic Properties, which we take very seriously. You are wholly and solely responsible for appropriate configuration of systems and software that you own or can control to ensure your compliance with this AUP. So, if we determine in our sole discretion that you have violated this AUP, we may, without limiting any other remedies available to us, permanently or temporarily suspend, limit, or terminate your access to the New Relic Properties without notice or liability. This right applies even if the breach is unintentional or unauthorized if we believe that any such suspension, limitation, or termination is necessary to ensure compliance with laws, or to protect the rights, safety, privacy, security, or property of us or others. In this AUP, the term “content” means: (1) any information, data, text, software, code, scripts, music, sound, photos, graphics, videos, messages, tags, interactive features, or other materials that you post, upload, share, submit, or otherwise provide in any manner to the services and (2) any other materials, content, or data you provide to New Relic or use with the New Relic Properties. As used in this AUP, “you” may refer to an individual user or the legal entity an individual user is employed by that has contracted with New Relic, and “we” means New Relic.",

For more information about service levels, please refer to our Support Plan. Community forum The New Relic Community Forum is 100% free and open to anyone with a New Relic account. The community is a place where many customer questions have already been asked and answered. Answers come from our community of experienced users, New Relic Support Engineers, and dozens of other Relics who help answer questions and solve problems. If you want to ask a question, check the community - if your question has not already been answered, members of the community can help. Github We want everyone to monitor their systems, and we're contributing our technology back to the open-source community to make that happen. You can find all our open source projects in our Github repo. We're committed to open standards, open-sourcing all of our instrumentation, and engaging engineers where they are, in the communities they already belong to. For more information on support for Open Source projects, visit our Open Source Support Policy. Diagnostic tools New Relic offers a diagnostics utility that can automatically detect common problems with New Relic agents. If Diagnostics detects a problem, it suggests troubleshooting steps. New Relic Diagnostics can also automatically attach troubleshooting data to a New Relic Support ticket. We have also made available Troubleshooting Frameworks that step users through common troubleshooting questions. Support ticket Support is now available in the New Relic One Platform! Just click on the question mark at the top right of your New Relic One screen to surface contextual documentation and resources. Depending on the Service Level associated with your New Relic account, you may be eligible for ticketed support and can open a ticket without leaving the New Relic One Platform. As an alternative, customers eligible for ticketed support may also open a support ticket from the New Relic Support page We are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year to help you troubleshoot issues related to the New Relic One Platform and generally available New Relic Products as outlined below. Scope of support You can have confidence that the Products we make Generally Available are fully tested with the compatible environments outlined in New Relic Documentation. New Relic’s Global Technical Support provides assistance for: the New Relic One platform and its features and capabilities, New Relic's monitoring and observability solutions, and our alerting and Applied Intelligence features. For issues within Third Party tools, or when tools in your infrastructure aren't working together properly, Global Technical Support may reach a point where we must refer New Relic users to such Third Party or community for assistance. Support includes Troubleshooting problems on the New Relic One Platform Assistance with issues during installation & upgrade in compatible environments Guidance on implementation and configuration in compatible environments Troubleshooting problems with ingesting data into New Relic General usage and best practice guidelines Identifying bugs with New Relic Products Assistance in English or Japanese Only (Japanese customer Terms of Service) Support does not include Unsupported or incompatible environments & frameworks Our Products are fully tested with the compatible environments and installation frameworks, and we’re here to help you through issues that may arise with our Products within these compatible environments and frameworks. We cannot support installation or configuration of our Products in environments or frameworks that do not meet established compatibility requirements. But if you're looking for help customizing New Relic for your particular environment, New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can assist with unique configurations or environments. Software customizations We are eager to help troubleshoot issues with the Products and features we make generally available, and those categorized as New Relic’s Open Source Community Plus Projects. New Relic’s Global Technical Support does not support customizations, modifications, or extensions to our code. Customizations or extensions to New Relic’s Open Source Projects in other Project categories are supported by the developer community in GitHub. New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can assist with unique configurations or environments. Custom applications With New Relic One, users have the ability to extend beyond the curated dashboards and design custom applications tailored to your business. New Relic’s Global Technical Support team does not support custom applications. The New Relic Developer site provides guidance on building custom apps, and here are a growing number of open source apps that you can use to get started. Custom scripts & queries We are happy to help troubleshoot issues related to the New Relic One platform that may be causing issues with a script or query. We cannot provide solutions for specific script or query use cases. New Relic Documentation and New Relic University offer resources on how to construct custom scripts and queries. End of Life New Relic may EOL products in accordance with the EOL policy. We recommend upgrading to our newest versions so you can take advantage of recent capabilities and bug fixes. More details are available in our published End of Life Policy. Beta or Limited Release Our support team covers generally available New Relic Products. Products that are in Beta or Limited Release status are not considered “generally available.” If you are invited to participate in a Beta program, or are using a Limited Release component, your account team will be your point of contact for questions. Please contact your account representative directly. Troubleshooting of customer environment We want to help every customer get the most of their New Relic experience within what are increasingly complex environments. However, we can’t help with things we didn’t build. We cannot assist with administration, configuration, or troubleshooting of a customer environment. When in doubt, you can get in touch with us, and we’ll help verify whether an issue is with our Product within a supported environment so you know where to go next. Troubleshooting third-party tools & services New Relic integrates well with many Third Party tools and services; however, we cannot support tools and services not provided or licensed by New Relic. We’ll do our best to determine whether an issue is with New Relic’s Products or caused by something outside of our control and purview. Issues with installation or configuration of the Third Party tools and services themselves should be directed to the respective owner of that Third Party tool or service or to the developer community. The Community and GitHub are great resources for assistance with Third Party tools and services as well. Some account-related functions For security reasons, some account-related Product functions must be conducted by the New Relic user designated as the “account owner,” such as Enabling SSO and High-Security Mode, adding users, and upgrading user permissions. Product training We are here to help you solve problems you may encounter on the road to instrumenting everything. Global Technical Support cannot provide user training on New Relic Products. New Relic offers a well-curated library of documentation and in-depth tutorials organized by Product, skill level, learning format, and solutions to help you navigate the observability journey. Check out New Relic University! Consultancy services Global Technical Support is here to help our valued customers as outlined in these support offerings. If you need help with something that falls outside of the Scope of Support, New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can help you navigate the challenges of building modern software and adopting the latest technologies, so you can focus on what you do best: delivering an incredible experience to your customers. Important As of March 10, 2021, you're no longer able to create a New Relic support ticket by emailing support@newrelic.com.

Once you're there, follow these steps: Click the ? icon in the upper right hand corner. Click I need more help. Select Create a Support Ticket. By creating a support ticket directly within your account, it will speed up the support process and improve our team’s ability to troubleshoot your issue more effectively. Open source support We want everyone to monitor their systems, and we're contributing our technology back to the open-source community to make that happen. We're committed to open standards, open-sourcing all of our instrumentation, and engaging engineers where they are, in the communities they already belong to.

Or by mail at: Attn: Legal New Relic, Inc. 188 Spear Street, Suite 1200 San Francisco, CA 94105 This AUP, and our customers’ compliance with it, is essential for enabling us to provide you and our other customers with the New Relic Properties, which we take very seriously. You are wholly and solely responsible for appropriate configuration of systems and software that you own or can control to ensure your compliance with this AUP. So, if we determine in our sole discretion that you have violated this AUP, we may, without limiting any other remedies available to us, permanently or temporarily suspend, limit, or terminate your access to the New Relic Properties without notice or liability. This right applies even if the breach is unintentional or unauthorized if we believe that any such suspension, limitation, or termination is necessary to ensure compliance with laws, or to protect the rights, safety, privacy, security, or property of us or others. In this AUP, the term “content” means: (1) any information, data, text, software, code, scripts, music, sound, photos, graphics, videos, messages, tags, interactive features, or other materials that you post, upload, share, submit, or otherwise provide in any manner to the services and (2) any other materials, content, or data you provide to New Relic or use with the New Relic Properties. As used in this AUP, “you” may refer to an individual user or the legal entity an individual user is employed by that has contracted with New Relic, and “we” means New Relic.",

By downloading, installing, authorizing installation, or using the Add-on (defined below) with your Underlying Software (defined below), you (“Customer”) agree to the terms and conditions herein (“Agreement”) with New Relic, Inc., a Delaware corporation with offices located at 188 Spear Street, Suite 1200 San Francisco, CA 94105 (“New Relic\"), (collectively the “Parties”). Capitalized terms not defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in the New Relic Terms of Service (the “Terms of Service”) available here: newrelic.com/termsandconditions/terms. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS AGREEMENT, YOUR SOLE REMEDY IS TO NOT USE THE ADD-ON. 1. DEFINITIONS “Add-on” means the New Relic applications and/or software, including but not limited to connectors, extensions, UI extension, and plugins, provided by New Relic to Customer to enable the Services to operate with certain third party or Customer software or systems (“Underlying Software”). For the purposes of the Terms of Service, the Add-on shall be treated like an Agent, subject to the separate terms herein. 2. USE OF THE PROGRAMMABILITY ADD-ON 2.1 Software Evaluation License. Subject to the terms herein, New Relic grants to Customer a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferrable, non-sublicensable right to install, use, and configure the Add-on solely as needed to enable the Services for internal evaluation purposes. New Relic reserves all rights and licenses not expressly granted herein. 2.2 Ownership. As between the Parties, New Relic owns all right, title, and interest to the Add-on and Feedback, including but not limited to any intellectual property and proprietary rights therein. Customer retains all right, title, and interest in any Customer Data processed by the Add-on in connection with the Services. 2.3 Feedback. Customer agrees to provide feedback, suggestions, ideas, requests or recommendations (“Feedback”) regarding the Add-on, and hereby irrevocably assigns all intellectual property and proprietary rights it holds in the Feedback to New Relic. 2.4 Notice. Customer acknowledges and agrees that the Add-on is made to work with the Underlying Software as configured at the time of creation and there is no guarantee that Add-on will continue to work in the event Customer changes, replaces, upgrades versions of, updates, or otherwise changes the Underlying Software (an “Upgrade Event”). Customer shall hold New Relic harmless from any claims or damages arising from Customer’s Upgrade Event. 2.5 Restrictions. Customer will not: (i) use the Add-on except as permitted hereunder; (ii) distribute, sell, sublicense, or otherwise transfer the Add-on; (iii) decompile, disassemble or reverse engineer any software underlying the Add-on; (iv) use the Add-on to damage, disable, overburden or impair any New Relic server or network(s) connected to any New Relic server or interfere with any other party’s use and enjoyment of the Services; (v) use the Add-on to defraud, defame, abuse, harass, stalk, threaten or infringe the rights of privacy or other intellectual property rights of others or otherwise violate any applicable law; (vi) circumvent or modify any security technologies included as part of the Add-on; or (vii) attempt or permit any third party to do any of the foregoing.

CONFIDENTIALITY 3.1 Definition. “Confidential Information” means: (a) the Programmability Add-on, and any features, results or output produced by, and other information relating to the Add-on (including, without limitation, all Feedback); and (b) any business or technical information of New Relic including but not limited to any technical information, research, development, know-how that a reasonable person would understand to be confidential. 3.2 Restrictions. Customer will not use or disclose any Confidential Information, except as necessary for the performance of this Agreement. Customer will use all reasonable efforts to protect Confidential Information from unauthorized use or disclosure, but in no event less than the efforts that it ordinarily uses with respect to its own proprietary information. Customer may disclose Confidential Information to those of its employees who have a bona fide need to know such Confidential Information for the performance of this Agreement; provided that each such employee first executes a written agreement that contains use and nondisclosure restrictions at least as protective as those set forth herein. Confidential Information shall not include any information that: (a) is or becomes generally known to the public through no fault or breach of this Agreement by Customer; (b) is rightfully known by Customer at the time of disclosure without an obligation of confidentiality; (c) is independently developed by Customer without access or use of any Confidential Information; or (d) is rightfully obtained from a third party without restriction on use or disclosure. 4.

App An app means the application software designed to run on smartphones, tablet computers, and other mobile devices. Each app includes a predefined number of users. App transaction An app transaction is an APM application's attempt to process a web or non-web request. In New Relic APM these manifest as throughput TIMESERIES or individually as events in the Transaction event type. AWS Lambda event An AWS Lambda event means the row of data collected from the customer's AWS Lambda function by the New Relic agent or sent from an external service into the New Relic platform. It consists of the AwsLambdaInvocation, AwsLambdaInvocationError, or custom event types. Check A check means the single instance of a Synthetics monitor running in New Relic's monitoring network and reporting back response time, and whether the check was a success or failure. Compute unit A compute unit means the measure of resources associated with a unit of computation on a physical or virtual host. Datapoints per minute Datapoints per minute (DPM) refers to the per-minute rate at which individual metric values are sent to the New Relic Metric Ingest API. For billing purposes, datapoints per minute are calculated as a monthly average value by summing the datapoints ingested during a 30 day period and dividing by the number of minutes in that period (43,200). Event An event means the row of data collected from the customer's application by the New Relic agent or sent from an external service into our database. Host A host means the physical computer or virtual machine instance running a single copy of an operating system. Host usage is tracked monthly by summing the hours that every host in the account is connected to New Relic and dividing by 750. A host is counted if it is connected any time during an hour. Incident event An incident event is an alerting event (open, closed, etc.) created by an alerting engine that is sent into the New Relic Applied Intelligence platform (non-unique) for de-duplication, flapping detection, smart suppression, enrichment, and correlation. Page view A page view means the full page load (triggering an onLoad event) or a recorded URL change (state change). Per GB daily Per GB daily represents a daily average of Log data sent to New Relic over a 30 day period. Span A span represents an operation summary collected from the customer's application via the New Relic APM agent or New Relic Serverless for AWS Lambda agent, or sent from other tracing tools to the New Relic Trace API. User A user means the individual that connects to your app from a single device. Each unique device is considered as a unique user.",

Capitalized terms not defined below shall take on the meaning set forth in your Terms. New Relic Service Level Availability The Service will be considered available so long as Customer is able to log in to its interface and view Customer Data (\"Service Availability\"). The applicable Service Availability will be calculated as a percentage of: (1) the total number of minutes in a month after (2) subtracting any periods of unavailability during such month from the total number of minutes in a month. New Relic will use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain Service Availability of at least 99.8% during any calendar month. In the event the Service Availability drops below: (i) 98.5% for two consecutive calendar months during the Subscription Term, or (ii) 96.5% in any single calendar month, Customer may request to terminate the relevant Service with no penalty. Such termination will be effective as of the end of the then-current billing period and no additional fees will be charged. The service level within New Relic's control is the Service Availability, not, for example, the transmission of data over the public Internet. Service Availability calculations will exclude unavailability arising from any: (a) planned maintenance periods; (b) emergency maintenance that is necessary to prevent imminent harm to the Service; (c) force majeure events; (d) Third-Party Services, Customer application, equipment, software or other technology, or Customer or its User's use of the Service, in violation of the Agreement or not in accordance with the Documentation; or (e) suspension, limitation, and/or termination of Customer’s access or use of the Service in accordance with this Agreement. This describes Customer’s sole and exclusive remedy for failures of Service Availability. Customer may request the Service Availability attainment for the previous month by filing a support ticket on the New Relic support site.",

      "body": "Updated 23 September 2021. The below Security Policy applies only to customers with an existing New Relic agreement in place that explicitly references this Security Policy applying to the Service purchased in an Order. Capitalized terms not defined below shall take on the meaning set forth in such New Relic agreement. New Relic Security Policy 1. Purpose This Policy describes New Relic's security program and the technical and organizational security controls to protect New Relic’s systems as shown in New Relic’s third-party audits and certifications. New Relic may update this Policy from time to time, and such updates will not materially reduce the overall protections set forth in this Policy. The then-current terms of this Policy are available at https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/licenses/license-information/referenced-policies/security-policy/. 2. Security Overview 2.1. New Relic maintains a comprehensive Information Protection Program to manage information security within New Relic that includes administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of Customer Data and that is appropriate to the nature, size, and complexity of New Relic's business operations. New Relic’s Information Protection Program includes: 2.1.1. executive review, support and accountability for all security related policies and practices; 2.1.2. formal written policies and procedures that are designed to protect against the loss, theft, or other unauthorized access or alteration of Customer Data, meet or exceed applicable industry standards, outlines a definition of information security and its overall objectives, include defined information security roles and responsibilities, a framework for setting control objectives and controls, a formal and effective risk mitigation program and a service provider security management program; 2.1.3. periodic risk assessments, including internal audits and/or independent 3rd party audits, to measure the effectiveness and appropriateness of controls for all systems processing Customer Data; 2.1.4. in-depth review of security incidents, including effective determination of root cause and corrective action; formal, industry-recognized controls frameworks based on an external audit standard; 2.1.5. employee screening and access management; and 2.1.6. comprehensive security testing, vulnerability identification, and mitigation methodology that consists of a variety of independent approaches that, when combined, are designed to maximize coverage for a diverse set of attack vectors. 2.2. New Relic's Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) leads New Relic's Information Security Program and develops, reviews, and approves, with appropriate stakeholders, New Relic's security policies and procedures. New Relic has appointed data protection officer(s) as described in New Relic’s Privacy Notices who are consulted as necessary under applicable laws. 2.3. Information security objectives, approach, scope, importance, goals, and principles for the organization’s security program are formally identified, communicated throughout the organization to users in a form that is relevant, accessible, and understandable to the intended reader; and supported by a controls framework that considers legislative, regulatory, contractual requirements, and other policy-related requirements. 2.4. New Relic will maintain written policies and procedures to review, test, and approve (as appropriate) changes affecting New Relic infrastructure and systems that process Customer Data including, but not limited to, peer reviews prior to introducing new code into production. New Relic will establish acceptance criteria for new information systems, upgrades, and new versions and will carry out suitable tests of the system(s) during development and prior to acceptance. Any changes or updates will not materially decrease the security of the systems. 3.Security Certifications 3.1. New Relic regularly tests, assesses, and evaluates its security measures for protecting Customer Data using industry-recognized standards and uses independent third-party auditors to verify such controls. 3.2. New Relic agrees to provide Customer, upon request, with applicable certifications or reports about New Relic systems. All information exchanged in connection with the audit activities described in this section is deemed to be the Confidential Information of New Relic. 3.3. Additional information about New Relic’s security certifications are available on New Relic’s Security Guide. 4. Data Control and Encryption 4.1. The Service and related features are designed to provide Customer with control over Customer’s data sources and Customer’s environments that are monitored and sending data to New Relic. 4.2. New Relic will have established methods to: (i) enable Customer to use encryption on Customer Data in transit, and (ii) securely hash passwords in storage following industry standard practices (e.g. scrypt) as described in the Documentation. Server certificate-based authentication is used as part of the TLS encryption with a trusted certificate authority. 4.3. New Relic receives and processes data in accordance with the Agreement and the Services as described in the Documentation. New Relic permits customers to delete personal data in accordance with applicable privacy laws as further described in the Documentation. In the event of error in personal data sent in Customer Data Customers may request personal data deletion and re-send data that is accurate. 4.4. Additional information for Customer data control and encryption, including encryption of data at rest, is available on New Relic’s Security Guide. 5. Facilities 5.1. All physical locations that process Customer Data are co-locations and third party data centers. All physical locations have security measures in place that are designed to prevent unauthorized physical access to data processing facilities and unlawful access, modification, or destruction of Customer Data. 5.2. New Relic will seek assurances (e.g., in the form of an independent 3rd party audit report such as the SOC 2 Type 2, ISO 27001, and vendor security evaluations) from its data processing facilities vendors that store or process Customer Data: 5.2.1. secure its data process facilities in an access-controlled location and have protections in place to prevent unauthorized access, damage, and interference; 5.2.2 employ physical security appropriate to the classification of the assets and information being managed which may include card key access, security cameras, and solid wall construction for all exterior walls; 5.2.3 limit and screen all entrants, which may include measures such as on-site security guard, badge reader, electronic lock, or a monitored closed caption television (CCTV); and 5.2.4 maintain relevant access logs. 5.3. Additional information about New Relic’s third party data centers are available on New Relic’s Security Guide. 6. Employee Access, Screening and Controls. New Relic will have and maintain policies and practices that include, at a minimum, the following controls and safeguards applied to New Relic employees and contractors who may access Customer Data: 6.1. For U.S. New Relic employees and subject to applicable law, a criminal background screening of each of its new employees to whom it gives access to Customer Data at the federal, state, and county levels. For non-U.S. New Relic employees, New Relic will use commercially reasonable efforts to meet the same criteria as established for U.S.-based New Relic employees, subject to general business practices in the respective country and in compliance with applicable local law requirements; 6.2. All New Relic employees with access to Customer Data will undergo adequate training, such as annual security awareness training, in the care, protection and handling of Customer Data, and will align with the privacy and security measures set out in this Addendum by following the guidance provided in their welcome package, which includes New Relic’s security policies and a security acknowledgement; 6.3. A disciplinary policy and process, to be used when New Relic employees violate New Relic security or privacy policies or access Customer Data without prior authorization; 6.4. Administrative or remote access to New Relic systems that process Customer Data will align with industry standard practices, including multi-factor authentication; 6.5. Restricted access to New Relic proprietary source code to prevent unauthorized access; 6.6. Controls designed to ensure that only those New Relic employees with an actual need-to-know will have access to New Relic systems including, but not limited to, the use of a formal access management process for the request, review, approval, and provisioning; 6.7. Controls designed to ensure that New Relic employees are granted access to New Relic systems based on least-privilege principles; and 6.8. Revoke access to New Relic employees no longer requiring access. 7. Security Incident and Data Breach Response 7.1. New Relic will take appropriate physical, technical, and administrative security measures that are commercially reasonable and consistent with industry standards to prevent a Data Breach, and as required by any applicable law or regulation. “Data Breach” means the theft, loss, or unauthorized access of Customer Data. Without limiting the foregoing, New Relic will implement security measures at least as stringent as those set out in this Addendum. New Relic will designate a senior representative to provide incident briefings, as needed in case of a Data Breach, and to respond to reasonable requests by Customer pertaining to privacy and data security issues within a commercially reasonable time frame. 7.2. New Relic will: 7.2.1. Notify Customer without undue delay if New Relic becomes aware of a Data Breach; 7.2.2. Maintain a security incident response plan, including procedures and means to respond in a manner consistent with industry standards; 7.2.3. Reasonably cooperate with Customer to investigate and remediate a Data Breach and mitigate any further risk to the Customer Data, or risk to data subjects and/or Customer’s reputation or brand; 7.2.4. Provide reasonable assistance to Customer at New Relic’s sole cost and expense; and 7.2.5. Make commercially reasonable efforts to preserve evidence and reasonably cooperate with Customer and legal authorities (as applicable and legally permissible) during an investigation of a Data Breach. 8. Network and Systems Security 8.1. All extranet connectivity by New Relic personnel to systems processing Customer Data will be through secure remote connections. 8.2. Network segments connected to the Internet will be protected by secure access control mechanisms, such as a firewall configured to secure all devices behind it and properly addresses security concerns according to industry standard practices. 8.3. New Relic will have industry standard measures in place to actively monitor its systems and help detect a potential hostile attack, such as Network Intrusion Detection (NID) or Host Intrusion Detection (HID)/Prevention. 8.4. Applications, ports, services, and similar access points installed on a computer or network facility, which are not specifically required for business functionality, will be disabled or removed. 8.5. New Relic maintains configuration standards for authorized operating systems and software for systems that support processing of Customer Data. New Relic will establish and follow server configuration guidelines and processes for preventing unauthorized access to Customer Data. New Relic maintains secure images or templates for systems based on the organization’s approved configuration standards. 8.6. Development, test, and operational environments will be logically separated to reduce the risks of unauthorized access or changes to the operational system. 8.7. New Relic network architecture will be designed to limit site access and restrict the availability of information systems that are considered to be vulnerable to attack. 8.8. New Relic provides appropriate TLS certificates when users access and view Customer Data in the Service.

      "body": "This document is about the New Relic One pricing model. For an explanation of how that plan works, see New Relic One pricing. The document below goes into license-level details. The Usage Plan applies to (i) your Pay As You Go subscription, or (ii) your Commitment Term for the Annual Pool of Funds subscription (see a description of these two plans). New Relic may modify the Usage Plan from time to time. Any changes to the Usage Plan will become effective immediately for changes that provide a benefit or right to the Customer, all other changes will become effective if Customer assents or upon any new or renewal Commitment Term. Usage Plan - Effective as October 21, 2021: The Order and Usage Plan may contain defined terms that are denoted by capitalization. In the event that a capitalized term is not defined in either the Order or the Usage Plan, such terms shall have the meaning set forth in the New Relic One pricing definitions page. Pay As You Go By electing and subscribing to the Pay As You Go subscription model (“Pay As You Go” or “PAYG”), Customer commits to paying for the New Relic Products on a month-to-month consumption basis. Monthly Product Usage will be invoiced regardless if a PO is required or not. Any Customer dispute to Monthly Product Usage from the prior month must be in good-faith and received by New Relic in writing within three (3) business days of the start of the next month or such dispute notice will be considered invalid. The dispute notice will set forth in reasonable detail the information concerning the disputed charges. The parties will use good-faith efforts to promptly resolve any disputed charges. Customer’s usage of the Products in excess of the Free Tier each month shall be billed in arrears on the first business day of the following month based on the Customer’s Per Unit usage of each Product each month multiplied by the corresponding rates set forth in an Order and summed (“Monthly Product Usage”). Annual Pool of Funds By electing and subscribing to the Annual Pool of Funds subscription model (“Annual Pool of Funds” or “APoF”) for the Commitment Term, Customer commits in an Order to: (i) paying the Commitment Fee amounts described in the Subscription table and any additional commitment fees set forth; and (ii) the Monthly Discounted Fee Rates applying to Customer’s Monthly Product Usage. New Relic will invoice the Commitment Fee as per the ‘Billing Terms’ described in an Order. On a monthly cadence during the Commitment Term, Customer’s Per Unit usage of the Products will be multiplied by the corresponding Monthly Discounted Rate and summed (“Monthly Product Usage”). Monthly Product Usage will be deducted from the Commitment Fee amounts that are paid in advance. If Monthly Product Usage exceeds any such remaining unconsumed amounts, Customer will be invoiced for the difference (“Additional Usage”), including for any Monthly Product Usage during the last month of the Commitment Term. Payment of such invoices will be governed as set forth in the Terms. Any Customer dispute to Monthly Product Usage from the prior month must be in good-faith and received by New Relic in writing within three (3) business days of the start of the next month (including for any Monthly Product Usage for the last month of the Commitment Term) or such dispute notice will be considered invalid. The dispute notice will set forth in reasonable detail the information concerning the disputed charges. The parties will use good-faith efforts to promptly resolve any disputed charges. Any unconsumed balances from the Customer payment of each annual Commitment Fee and any additional payments, if applicable, as set out in an Order will expire and lapse at the end of each year of the Commitment Term. Applicable Invoicing and Order Terms All amounts stated in an Order are non-cancelable payment obligations of the Customer for the Commitment Term regardless of usage. Any fees paid are non-refundable and do not represent a deposit for, or a credit towards, the purchase of other products not specified in an Order or for any purchase after the Commitment Term. Customer acknowledges that a final payment for the full outstanding amount of any remaining unpaid Commitment Fee and/or Monthly Product Usage Fee may be invoiced upon each anniversary date of the term start date. Tax will be added where applicable. New Relic may review Customer's use of the Products at any time. If New Relic identifies any Customer usage of the Product(s) that is not in accordance with the Terms or Documentation, New Relic may suspend such unauthorized usage. All existing purchases and related pricing in effect prior to the execution of an Order shall remain in force. Unless otherwise stated in an Order, an Order does not modify or amend any existing purchases. Additional future products or quantities are not subject to promotional pricing unless otherwise stated in an Order. In the event that a Customer indicates in an Order that it requires a purchase order (“PO”) for its subscription, Customer agrees to provide the required PO prior to the provisioning of the Products. If a Customer does not indicate a PO is required, Customer agrees that New Relic may issue invoice(s) and is entitled to such payment without a PO reference. All Additional Usage fees will be invoiced regardless of a PO requirement. The Product(s) are deemed accepted upon its provisioning. User Accounts Use of the Products require Customer users to create Login Credentials. Customer user Login Credential information must be accurate, current, and complete. New Relic’s use and collection of Login Credentials (in accordance with its General Data Privacy Notice) is for account and product management and support of its customers. Customer and Customer users must abide by the New Relic Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) and Login Credentials may not be shared. Each Customer user must have their own user account. Entry into an Order indicates your agreement that the amount of provisioned users (at the rate specified in the Order) applies in lieu of and supersedes any other amount of users of the Products that may be specified in the agreement between Customer and New Relic. New Relic One Pro and Enterprise Service Level Availability Commitment With a subscription to \"New Relic One - Pro Users\" or \"New Relic One - Enterprise Users,\" you agree that during the Commitment Term the applicable service level availability commitment set forth on the ‘Service level availability commitment’ page in the Documentation shall apply to the Products. For clarity, if your agreement with New Relic contains a different service level availability commitment or remedies, the above does not apply to your subscription to the \"New Relic One - Pro Users\" or \"New Relic One - Enterprise Users\". If you subscribe to any other New Relic Products with New Relic One pricing, any service level availability commitment or related remedies contained within your agreement with New Relic are vacated and nullified, and New Relic will use commercially reasonable efforts to make \"New Relic One - Standard Users\" available in line with industry standards. New Relic One Pro and Enterprise Support Plans With a subscription to New Relic One Users, New Relic provides an updated support plan commitment. By subscribing to New Relic One Users, you agree that during the Commitment Term the applicable Support Plan set forth on the ‘Support plan’ page in the Documentation shall apply in lieu of, and supersedes and replaces, any other support related commitments that may be contained within your agreement with New Relic. For New Relic K.K. customers (Japan), the above does not currently apply to the support offerings provided by New Relic to you. Free tier, ‘lite’, no-charge, preview access, New Relic One - Data, New Relic One - Standard User subscriptions If you are using New Relic’s Products in the free tier only, or on a no-charge, or a ‘lite’ or ‘preview access’ basis you agree that the Unpaid Terms of Service will apply to such Product usage and replace and supersede any other terms. In addition, if your subscription contains the \"New Relic One - Standard Users Product,\" you agree that the Paid Terms of Service will apply to your subscription to the Products set forth in an Order and replace and supersede any other terms. Separate Platforms Customer access to any separate platforms for purposes of applicability of governing terms, such as Community Cloud for Pixie or CodeStream, is subject to their respective terms of service. If you enable a separate platform with New Relic One, New Relic may access and exchange Customer Data with the separate platform on your behalf. For clarity, such other platforms do not form part of the New Relic One offering and, unless otherwise expressly provided in the terms and then only to the extent provided, New Relic One warranties, indemnities, etc., do not apply to use of any other platforms for purposes of applicability of governing terms. Separate platforms are not intended to meet any legal obligations for Prohibited Data uses. Further, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by New Relic, (a) for users of separate platforms, New Relic is neither a Business Associate or a subcontractor (as defined under HIPAA), nor a payment card processor, and (b) separate platforms are neither HIPAA nor PCI DSS compliant.",

For more information about service levels, please refer to our Support Plan. Community forum The New Relic Community Forum is 100% free and open to anyone with a New Relic account. The community is a place where many customer questions have already been asked and answered. Answers come from our community of experienced users, New Relic Support Engineers, and dozens of other Relics who help answer questions and solve problems. If you want to ask a question, check the community - if your question has not already been answered, members of the community can help. Github We want everyone to monitor their systems, and we're contributing our technology back to the open-source community to make that happen. You can find all our open source projects in our Github repo. We're committed to open standards, open-sourcing all of our instrumentation, and engaging engineers where they are, in the communities they already belong to. For more information on support for Open Source projects, visit our Open Source Support Policy. Diagnostic tools New Relic offers a diagnostics utility that can automatically detect common problems with New Relic agents. If Diagnostics detects a problem, it suggests troubleshooting steps. New Relic Diagnostics can also automatically attach troubleshooting data to a New Relic Support ticket. We have also made available Troubleshooting Frameworks that step users through common troubleshooting questions. Support ticket Support is now available in the New Relic One Platform! Just click on the question mark at the top right of your New Relic One screen to surface contextual documentation and resources. Depending on the Service Level associated with your New Relic account, you may be eligible for ticketed support and can open a ticket without leaving the New Relic One Platform. As an alternative, customers eligible for ticketed support may also open a support ticket from the New Relic Support page We are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year to help you troubleshoot issues related to the New Relic One Platform and generally available New Relic Products as outlined below. Scope of support You can have confidence that the Products we make Generally Available are fully tested with the compatible environments outlined in New Relic Documentation. New Relic’s Global Technical Support provides assistance for: the New Relic One platform and its features and capabilities, New Relic's monitoring and observability solutions, and our alerting and Applied Intelligence features. For issues within Third Party tools, or when tools in your infrastructure aren't working together properly, Global Technical Support may reach a point where we must refer New Relic users to such Third Party or community for assistance. Support includes Troubleshooting problems on the New Relic One Platform Assistance with issues during installation & upgrade in compatible environments Guidance on implementation and configuration in compatible environments Troubleshooting problems with ingesting data into New Relic General usage and best practice guidelines Identifying bugs with New Relic Products Assistance in English or Japanese Only (Japanese customer Terms of Service) Support does not include Unsupported or incompatible environments & frameworks Our Products are fully tested with the compatible environments and installation frameworks, and we’re here to help you through issues that may arise with our Products within these compatible environments and frameworks. We cannot support installation or configuration of our Products in environments or frameworks that do not meet established compatibility requirements. But if you're looking for help customizing New Relic for your particular environment, New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can assist with unique configurations or environments. Software customizations We are eager to help troubleshoot issues with the Products and features we make generally available, and those categorized as New Relic’s Open Source Community Plus Projects. New Relic’s Global Technical Support does not support customizations, modifications, or extensions to our code. Customizations or extensions to New Relic’s Open Source Projects in other Project categories are supported by the developer community in GitHub. New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can assist with unique configurations or environments. Custom applications With New Relic One, users have the ability to extend beyond the curated dashboards and design custom applications tailored to your business. New Relic’s Global Technical Support team does not support custom applications. The New Relic Developer site provides guidance on building custom apps, and here are a growing number of open source apps that you can use to get started. Custom scripts & queries We are happy to help troubleshoot issues related to the New Relic One platform that may be causing issues with a script or query. We cannot provide solutions for specific script or query use cases. New Relic Documentation and New Relic University offer resources on how to construct custom scripts and queries. End of Life New Relic may EOL products in accordance with the EOL policy. We recommend upgrading to our newest versions so you can take advantage of recent capabilities and bug fixes. More details are available in our published End of Life Policy. Beta or Limited Release Our support team covers generally available New Relic Products. Products that are in Beta or Limited Release status are not considered “generally available.” If you are invited to participate in a Beta program, or are using a Limited Release component, your account team will be your point of contact for questions. Please contact your account representative directly. Troubleshooting of customer environment We want to help every customer get the most of their New Relic experience within what are increasingly complex environments. However, we can’t help with things we didn’t build. We cannot assist with administration, configuration, or troubleshooting of a customer environment. When in doubt, you can get in touch with us, and we’ll help verify whether an issue is with our Product within a supported environment so you know where to go next. Troubleshooting third-party tools & services New Relic integrates well with many Third Party tools and services; however, we cannot support tools and services not provided or licensed by New Relic. We’ll do our best to determine whether an issue is with New Relic’s Products or caused by something outside of our control and purview. Issues with installation or configuration of the Third Party tools and services themselves should be directed to the respective owner of that Third Party tool or service or to the developer community. The Community and GitHub are great resources for assistance with Third Party tools and services as well. Some account-related functions For security reasons, some account-related Product functions must be conducted by the New Relic user designated as the “account owner,” such as Enabling SSO and High-Security Mode, adding users, and upgrading user permissions. Product training We are here to help you solve problems you may encounter on the road to instrumenting everything. Global Technical Support cannot provide user training on New Relic Products. New Relic offers a well-curated library of documentation and in-depth tutorials organized by Product, skill level, learning format, and solutions to help you navigate the observability journey. Check out New Relic University! Consultancy services Global Technical Support is here to help our valued customers as outlined in these support offerings. If you need help with something that falls outside of the Scope of Support, New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can help you navigate the challenges of building modern software and adopting the latest technologies, so you can focus on what you do best: delivering an incredible experience to your customers. Important As of March 10, 2021, you're no longer able to create a New Relic support ticket by emailing support@newrelic.com. If you have ticketed support as part of your subscription, when logged into your New Relic account, go to one.newrelic.com to create a support ticket. Once you're there, follow these steps: Click the ? icon in the upper right hand corner. Click I need more help. Select Create a Support Ticket. By creating a support ticket directly within your account, it will speed up the support process and improve our team’s ability to troubleshoot your issue more effectively. Open source support We want everyone to monitor their systems, and we're contributing our technology back to the open-source community to make that happen. We're committed to open standards, open-sourcing all of our instrumentation, and engaging engineers where they are, in the communities they already belong to.

      "body": "You can send your Amazon CloudWatch logs to New Relic using our AWS Lambda function, newrelic-log-ingestion. This can be easily deployed from the AWS Serverless application repository. Forwarding your CloudWatch logs to New Relic will give you enhanced log management capabilities to collect, process, explore, query, and alert on your log data. Install and configure the Cloudwatch logs Lambda function The following setup shows one approach for configuring environment variables. You can also configure them from the Functions page. Complete the following: Make sure you have a New Relic license key. Open the AWS Serverless Application Repository in your browser. Search for newrelic and check Show apps that create custom IAM roles or resource policies to find newrelic-log-ingestion. Open the newrelic-log-ingestion details and click Deploy. In the function's Configure menu, go to Environment Variables and configure log forwarding using the following environment variables: Key Description DEBUG_LOGGING_ENABLED A boolean to determine if you want to output debug messages in the CloudWatch console. Optional. To turn on debug logs, set this to true. Default is false. LICENSE_KEY New Relic license key is used for sending data to New Relic. Required. LOGGING_ENABLED Determines if logs are forwarded to New Relic. Required. To turn on logging, set this to true. NR_LOGGING_ENDPOINT New Relic ingestion endpoint for logs. Required. Two endpoints are available: US: https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 EU: https://log-api.eu.newrelic.com/log/v1 NR_TAGS Specify tags to be added to all log events. Optional. Each tag is composed of a colon-delimited key and value. Multiple key-value pairs are semicolon-delimited; for example, env:prod;team:myTeam. Acknowledge that the app creates custom IAM roles, and then click Deploy. Once the process completes, create a Lambda trigger to link your Lambda function to CloudWatch logs. Create a Lambda trigger To get your logs streaming to New Relic, attach a trigger to the Lambda: From the left side menu, select Functions. Find and select the previously created newrelic-log-ingestion function. Under Designer, click Add Triggers, and select Cloudwatch Logs from the dropdown. Select the the appropriate Log group for your application. Enter a name for your filter. Optional: Enter a filter pattern. Check the Enable trigger checkbox, then click Add to create the trigger. Configure retries (optional) You can configure the number of retries you want to perform in case the function fails to send the data in case of communication issues. Recommended number is 3 retries, but you can change the retry behavior by changing the below parameters: Tip The more the number of retries there are can make the function run for longer times. This increases the probability of having higher costs for Lambda. However, decreasing the number of retries could increase the probability of data loss. MAX_RETRIES = 3 # Defines the number of retries after lambda failure to deliver data INITIAL_BACKOFF = 1 # Defines the initial wait seconds until next retry is executed BACKOFF_MULTIPLIER = 2 # Time multiplier between the retries As an example, in default above configuration, first retry will happen after 1 second, second retry after 2 seconds and third retry will happen after 4 seconds. Copy Resources created by the SAM template When you create the application from the repository, the following resources are also created: The Lambda function itself A role used to give execution permissions to the Lambda function based in CloudWatch Logs. All other Lambda configurations not listed can be left as the defaults.

      "body": "You can forward your logs to New Relic using our infrastructure monitoring agent. This makes all of your logging data available in one location and provides deeper visibility into both your application and your platform performance data. Forwarding your logs to New Relic will give you enhanced log management capabilities to collect, process, explore, query, and alert on your log data. Basic process To forward your logs through our infrastructure monitoring agent: If you haven't already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Verify the system requirements needed for configuring logs. Ensure you have installed the infrastructure agent, version 1.11.4 or higher. Create a logging.yml configuration file in the infrastructure agent's logging.d directory. Configure your log sources and other parameters. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your account for data. Explore your log data in the Logs UI and benefit from the log attributes automatically inserted by the infrastructure agent. Here is an example of where you can see logs in context of your infrastructure monitoring details in New Relic One. System requirements To use the log forwarder of the infrastructure agent, make sure you meet the following requirements: Infrastructure agent version 1.11.4 or higher OpenSSL library 1.1.0 or higher is required by Infrastructure agent starting from 1.16.4. Built-in support for ARM64 architecture on Linux systems (in example, AWS Graviton architecture) added in Infrastructure agent 1.26.0. Important The log forwarding feature is not supported with the Docker container for infrastructure monitoring agents. The log forwarding feature is compatible with the following operating systems: Operating system Supported version Amazon Linux Amazon Linux 2 CentOS Version 7 or higher Debian Version 9 (\"Stretch\") or higher Exception: Version 11 is not supported. Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) Version 7 or higher SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) Version 12 Ubuntu Versions 16.04.x, 18.04.x and 20.04.x (LTS versions) Windows Windows Server 2012, 2016, and 2019, and their service packs. Windows 10 Install the infrastructure agent Starting with version 1.11.4, the infrastructure agent can forward logs to New Relic. To install and run the agent, use a package manager (Linux) or the MSI installer (Windows). Important The log forwarding feature is not included when the infrastructure agent is implemented using Linux tarball or Windows ZIP installations. To use the following links, make sure you are logged to your New Relic account. Amazon Linux CentOS Debian RHEL SLES Ubuntu Windows If you don't have a New Relic account yet, or if you prefer to follow the procedure manually, see our tutorial to install the package manager. Configure the infrastructure agent Configuration files describe which log sources are forwarded. Our infrastructure agent uses .yml files to configure logging. You can add as many config files as you want. To add a new configuration file for the log forwarding feature: Navigate to the log forwarder configuration folder: Linux: /etc/newrelic-infra/logging.d/ Windows: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\logging.d\\ Create a logging.yml configuration file, and add the parameters you need. The logging.d directory has various .yml.example files you can use as a reference or starting point. The agent automatically processes new configuration files without having to restart the infrastructure monitoring service. The only exception to this is when configuring a custom Fluent Bit configuration. Log forwarding parameters The infrastructure log forwarding .yml config supports the following parameters: Name (required) To start, define a name of the log or logs you want to forward to New Relic. Log source (required) What you use for the log source will depend on where you want to forward your logs from. Available options include: file Path to the log file or files. The agent tracks changes on the log files in a way similar to tail -f shell. Example: logs: - name: example-log file: /var/log/example.log # Path to a single log file - name: example-log-two file: /var/log/example-two.log # Path to another single log file Copy The file parameter can point to a specific log file or multiple files by using wildcards applied to names and extensions; for example, /logs/*.log. You can use wildcards in place of directories in a file path, which can be used to tail files located in different directories. Example: logs: - name: docker-logs file: /var/lib/docker/containers/*/*.log # Path to multiple folders and files Copy Important Use of wildcards may significantly increase the number of file descriptors and inotify watches the Fluent Bit process keeps open, which can interfere with log collection if the host's file descriptor limit is reached. Tailing a large number of files may require you to increase the maximum number of file descriptors and inotify watchers allowed by the operating system. Please refer to Errors when tailing a large amount of log files for more details on how to increase them. systemd Use the systemd parameter to forward log messages that are collected by the journald daemon in Linux environments. This input type requires the agent to run in root mode. Example: logs: - name: systemd-example systemd: cupsd Copy syslog Syslog data source. Parameters: uri: Syslog socket. Format varies depending on the protocol: TCP/UDP network sockets: [tcp/udp]://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT Unix domain sockets: unix_[tcp/udp]:// + /socket/path parser: Syslog parser. Default is rfc3164. Use rfc5424 if your messages include fractional seconds. Note: rfc3164 currently does not work on SuSE. unix_permissions: default is 0644 for domain sockets; this limits entries to processes running as root. You can use 0666 to listen for non-root processes, at your own risk. When running the agent in privileged mode, ports and sockets must be available or owned by nri-agent, with 0666 file permissions, so that other processes can write logs to the sockets. logs: # TCP network socket - name: syslog-tcp-test syslog: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:5140 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format parser: rfc5424 # Default syslog parser is rfc3164 # UDP network socket - name: syslog-udp-test syslog: uri: udp://0.0.0.0:6140 # Use the udp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format max_line_kb: 35 # Unix TCP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-tcp-test syslog: uri: unix_tcp:///var/unix-tcp-socket-test unix_permissions: 0666 # Default is 0644. Change at your own risk # Unix UDP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-udp-test syslog: uri: unix_udp:///var/unix-udp-socket-test parser: rfc5424 Copy tcp Logs retrieved over TCP connections. Parameters: uri: TCP/IP socket to listen for incoming data. The URI format is tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format: format of the data. It can be json or none. separator: If format: none is used, you can define a separator string for splitting records (default: \\n). logs: - name: tcp-simple-test tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:1234 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format format: none # Raw text - this is default for 'tcp' separator: \\t # String for separating raw text entries max_line_kb: 32 - name: tcp-json-test tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:2345 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format format: json Copy winlog Collect events from Windows log channels. Parameters: channel: name of the channel logs will be collected from. collect-eventids: a list of Windows Event IDs to be collected and forwarded to New Relic. Event ID ranges are supported. exclude-eventids: a list of Windows Event IDs to be excluded from collection. Event ID ranges are supported. All events are collected from the specified channel by default. Configure the collect-eventids and exclude-eventids sections to avoid sending unwanted logs to your New Relic account. Add event IDs or ranges to collect-eventids or exclude-eventids to forward or drop specific events. exclude-eventids takes precedence over collect-eventids if the same event ID is present in both sections. Example: logs: # Winlog log ingestion with eventId filters. - name: windows-security winlog: channel: Security collect-eventids: - 4624 - 4265 - 4700-4800 exclude-eventids: - 4735 # entries for the application, system, powershell, and SCOM channels - name: windows-application winlog: channel: Application - name: windows-system winlog: channel: System - name: windows-pshell winlog: channel: Windows Powershell - name: scom winlog: channel: Operations Manager # Entry for Windows Defender Logs - name: windows-defender winlog: channel: Microsoft-Windows-Windows Defender/Operational # Entry for Windows Clustering Logs - name: windows-clustering winlog: channel: Microsoft-Windows-FailoverClustering/Operational # Entry for IIS logs with logtype attribute for automatic parsing - name: iis-log file: C:\\inetpub\\logs\\LogFiles\\w3svc.log attributes: logtype: iis_w3c Copy Optional configuration The following configuration parameters are not required but are still recommended. attributes List of custom attributes specified as key-value pairs that can be used to send additional data with the logs which you can then query. The attributes configuration parameter can be used with any log source. One common use of the attributes configuration parameter is to specify the logtype attribute. This attribute allows leveraging one of the built-in parsing rules supported by New Relic Logs. Example: logs: - name: example-file-attributes file: /var/log/example.log attributes: logtype: nginx region: example-us-02 team: A-team - name: example-tcp-attributes tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:2345 format: json attributes: logtype: nginx region: example-us-02 team: B-team Copy attributes automatically inserted by the infrastructure agent The infrastructure agent automatically inserts log attributes for your convenience. Some of them are inserted for any log record, while others depend on the configuration parameters you used while setting up the log forwarder. Attribute name Description entity.guids Always inserted. The infrastructure agent inserts the Entity GUID assigned by New Relic to identify the host where it's running. It is available in the entity.guids field. Note: If the captured logs belong to an application instrumented using APM, the entity.guids field contains both the entity GUID of infrastructure, as well as the GUID of APM, separated by a pipe ( | ) delimiter. fb.input Always inserted. The underlying Fluent Bit input plugin type used to capture the logs. Currently its values are tail, systemd, winlog, syslog, and tcp. filePath Inserted when sing the file input type. Absolute file path of the file being monitored. hostname Always inserted. The hostname of the machine/VM/container executing the infrastructure agent. plugin.type Always inserted. Indicates the utility used to capture the logs. In this case, it is the infrastructure agent itself, so this attribute always has the value nri-agent. pattern Regular expression for filtering records. Only supported for the tail, systemd, syslog, and tcp (only with format none) sources. This field works in a way similar to grep -E in Unix systems. For example, for a given file being captured, you can filter for records containing either WARN or ERROR using: - name: only-records-with-warn-and-error file: /var/log/logFile.log pattern: WARN|ERROR Copy No filtering is applied by default. max_line_kb Maximum size of log entries/lines in KB. If log entries exceed the limit, they are skipped. Default is 128. fluentbit External Fluent Bit configuration and parser files. If defined, they are merged with the existing configuration and parser files generated by the infrastructure agent. The infrastructure agent processes the configuration files located in the logging.d directory and will generate a run-time Fluent Bit configuration file that contains the appropriate [INPUT], [FILTER] and [OUTPUT] sections. Optionally, it will also declare an @INCLUDE in case you provided an external Fluent Bit configuration file via the fluentbit option. The runtime file does not define a [SERVICE] section, leaving all default Fluent Bit configuration values. You can still override Fluent Bit's default settings by defining your own [SERVICE] section in your external Fluent Bit configuration file and include it via the fluentbit option. Parameters: config_file: path to an existing Fluent Bit configuration file. Note that any overlapping source results in duplicate messages in New Relic Logs. parsers_file: path to an existing Fluent Bit parsers file. The following parser names are reserved: rfc3164, rfc3164-local and rfc5424. Sample configuration file Here is an example of a logging.d/ configuration file in YAML format. For more configuration examples, see the infrastructure agent repository. logging.d/sample.yaml # Remember to only use spaces for indentation logs: # Example of 'file' source - name: file-with-attributes file: /var/log/test.log # Path to a single file or pattern attributes: # You can use custom attributes to enrich your data logtype: nginx team: The A Team pattern: Error # Regular expression to filter log entries # Example of 'systemd' source (Linux only) - name: systemd-example systemd: cupsd # Examples of 'syslog' source, one per protocol # TCP network socket - name: syslog-tcp-test syslog: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:5140 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format parser: rfc5424 # Default syslog parser is rfc3164 # UDP network socket - name: syslog-udp-test syslog: uri: udp://0.0.0.0:6140 # Use the udp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format max_line_kb: 35 # Paths for Unix sockets are defined by combining protocol and path: # unix_udp:// + /path/socket - for example, unix_udp:///tmp/socket # Unix TCP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-tcp-test syslog: uri: unix_tcp:///var/unix-tcp-socket-test unix_permissions: 0666 # Default is 0644.

For example, you can execute a query like this: SELECT * FROM Log Copy Troubleshooting If you encounter problems with configuring your log forwarder, try these troubleshooting tips. No log data If no data appears after you enable our log management capabilities, follow our standard log troubleshooting procedures. No data appears when tailing a file The log forwarding feature requires the agent to have permission to read the data sources. When running the infrastructure agent in privileged or non-privileged modes, make sure that the log files you want to forward (and any intermediary directory in its path) are readable by the user running nri-agent. Example: Check file access under Linux Let's check whether the file /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log can be monitored by the nri-agent user. In Linux, you can do a quick check with the namei command: sudo -u nri-agent namei -ml /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log f: /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log drwxr-xr-x root root / drwxr-xr-x root root var drwxrwxr-x root syslog log drwxr--r-- root root restrictedLogs logFile.log - No such file or directory Copy This command failed because the file is not visible to the nri-agent user. By inspecting the previous output, we can detect that the restrictedLogs directory is missing the execution flag for others. To fix this, execute: sudo chmod 755 /var/log/restrictedLogs Copy And then check for file access again: # sudo -u nri-agent namei -ml /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log f: /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log drwxr-xr-x root root / drwxr-xr-x root root var drwxrwxr-x root syslog log drwxr-xr-x root root restrictedLogs -rw-r----- vagrant vagrant logFile.log Copy The file is now visible to the nri-agent user. You must ensure that the file is also readable by the nri-agent user. To check this, use: # sudo -u nri-agent head /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log head: cannot open '/var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log' for reading: Permission denied Copy In this example, the file is missing the read rights for the others group (users other than vagrant and the vagrant user group). You could fix this by granting read permissions to others, but the application could change these permissions upon restart. To avoid this, a better approach is to add the nri-agent user to the vagrant user group. No data appears when capturing via a Syslog socket The log forwarding feature requires that the agent has permission to read the data sources. When running the infrastructure agent in privileged or non-privileged modes: If you're using Unix domain socket files, make sure that the nri-agent user can access these files (please refer to the previous section) and that they have read and write permissions (666) so that other users than nri-agent can write to them. If you're using IP sockets, ensure that the port that you are using is not a system reserved one (like port 80, for example). If no data appears after you enable log management, follow standard log management troubleshooting procedures. No data appears using infrastructure agent proxy As explained in the infrastructure agent configuration guidelines, the proxy parameter must use either HTTP or HTTPS and be in the form https://user:password@hostname:port. The agent can parse the parameter without the HTTP or HTTPS, but the log forwarder cannot. You will see an error like the following in the agent verbose logs: [ERROR] building HTTP transport: parse \\\"hostname:port\\\": first path segment in URL cannot contain colon Copy To solve this problem, check your newrelic-infra.yml file, and ensure the proxy parameter adheres to this form. If you're using caBundleFile or caBundleDir in order to specify any certificate, we recommend to follow the below rules for each OS: Linux For HTTP proxies you don't need to setup any certificates. The plugin loads the system certificates and New Relic sends logs into the logging endpoint. However, you can specify the proxy self-signed certificate (PEM file) using either the caBundleFile or caBundleDir parameters. Windows For HTTP proxies you don't need to setup any certificates. The plugin loads the system certificates. For HTTPS, you can configure it in one of the following ways: Import the proxy certificate to the system pool (Recommended) Import the proxy self-signed certificate (PEM file) by using the MMC tool. Refer to this link, and in Step 2 ensure to import it in your Trusted Root Certification Authorities, instead of in the Intermediate Certification Authorities. Using the caBundleFile and caBundleDir parameters On Windows, we cannot load both the certificates from the system certificate pool and the ones specified with the caBundleFile caBundleDir parameters. So, if you are using caBundleFile or caBundleDir, ensure that the following certificates are placed in the same PEM file (when using caBundleFile) or in the same directory (when using caBundleDir): The Proxy certificate (because it's an HTTPS proxy). The Logging Endpoint certificate (eg. https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1). The Infrastructure Agent certificate (eg. https://infra-api.newrelic.com). You can check the certificates by running: # openssl s_client -connect log-api.newrelic.com:443 -servername log-api.newrelic.com Copy Sending the infrastructure agent's logs to New Relic You can configure the infrastructure agent to send its own logs to New Relic. This is useful for troubleshooting issues with log forwarding, the agent, or when contacting support. To forward the infrastructure agent logs to New Relic: Edit your newrelic-infra.yml file. Enable agent logging in troubleshooting mode by adding verbose: 3. On Windows and systems that don't use systemd or where journald is inaccessible, verbose:3 causes the agent to write the logs on the disk. Revert to verbose:0 to prevent this. (Recommended): Enable agent logging in JSON format to log_format: json. Restart the agent to load the new settings. This configuration sets up the agent in troubleshooting mode, but the log forwarder (based on Fluent Bit) will continue in a non-verbose mode. Sometimes you can have issues with the log forwarder itself. For example, there may be problems accessing a specific channel when shipping Windows log events or when accessing a particular log file. In these situations, you can also enable the verbose mode for the log forwarder: Set verbose to a value other than 0. Add the configuration option: trace: [\"log.fw\"]. Caution Check whether you are using the [fluentbit] option. When setting verbose: 3 and trace: [\"log.fw\"], ensure that you don't define any [OUTPUT] section pointing to stdout in an external Fluent Bit configuration file, Fluent Bit does not start with the infra agent Important Fluent Bit's tail plugin does not support network drives. For Linux versions prior to 2016, you may need to update the OpenSSL library to 1.1.0 (or higher). To check if you have this problem: See if infra-agent has started Fluent Bit by running: ps -aux | grep fluent-bi Copy If it isn't running go to /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/logging and run: ./fluent-bit -i systemd -o stdout Copy If you get the following error, update OpenSSL to 1.1.0 or higher: error while loading shared libraries: libssl.so.1.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory Copy Runtime error on Windows One of the following error messages may appear when enabling log forwarding on Windows: The code execution cannot proceed because VCRUNTIME140.dll was not found. Copy OR error=\"exit status 3221225781\" process=log-forwarder Copy This is caused by a missing DLL. To solve the issue, install the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable as applicable: x64 x86 Errors when tailing a large amount of log files (Linux) It's common to face either one of the following error messages when attempting to tail a large amount of files: Too many open files The user limit on the total number of inotify watches was reached or the kernel failed to allocate a needed resource The operating system defines a maximum amount of allocatable file descriptors (typically 1024 by default), and a maximum amount of allocatable inotify watches (typically 8192 by default). Any process attempting to go above these limits will fail, returning one of the errors above. The underlying technology we use to forward logs, Fluent Bit, opens one file descriptor and sets an inotify watch for each file you configure to be forwarded. Moreover, at the time of writing this section, Fluent Bit uses an extra set of 32 file descriptors for its normal operation, with another extra file descriptor when it shuts down. Therefore, to capture a large amount of files you need to ensure that both the file descriptor and inotify watch limits are slightly greater than the amount of log files you wish to tail. The following instructions summarize how to increase these limits if you want to tail 10,000 log files. Also, it assumes the infrastructure agent is installed in root running mode, and therefore must be run using the root user. Check which is the current hard limit for the amount of file descriptors per process. Typically, this limit should be quite high and should not need to be modified. ulimit -Hn Copy Add the following line to /etc/security/limits.conf. We specified a limit of 10100 here instead of just 10000 to allow Fluent Bit to allocate the extra file descriptors it may need to work. root soft nofile 10100 # replace root by nri-agent for non-root (privileged and unprivileged) installations Copy Add the following line to /etc/pam.d/common-session so that the previous limit is applied upon restart: session required pam_limits.so Copy Add the following line to /etc/sysctl.conf to increase the amount of allowed inotify watchers per user. We specified a limit of 18192 here instead of just 10000 so that the root user will still have 8192 available inotify watches (the default value). fs.inotify.max_user_watches=18192 Copy Restart your system. Ensure that the new limits have been enforced by running: ulimit -Sn # Should return 10100 cat /proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_watches # Should return 18192 Copy Learn more on how to increase open file limits, or on how to increase the inotify watches. Uninstall log forwarding To uninstall log forwarding capabilities, go to your logging.d directory, and remove files with the .yml extension that were originally added during the configuration process.

      "body": "You can forward your logs to New Relic using our infrastructure monitoring agent. This makes all of your logging data available in one location and provides deeper visibility into both your application and your platform performance data. Forwarding your logs to New Relic will give you enhanced log management capabilities to collect, process, explore, query, and alert on your log data. Basic process To forward your logs through our infrastructure monitoring agent: If you haven't already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Verify the system requirements needed for configuring logs. Ensure you have installed the infrastructure agent, version 1.11.4 or higher. Create a logging.yml configuration file in the infrastructure agent's logging.d directory. Configure your log sources and other parameters. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your account for data. Explore your log data in the Logs UI and benefit from the log attributes automatically inserted by the infrastructure agent. Here is an example of where you can see logs in context of your infrastructure monitoring details in New Relic One. System requirements To use the log forwarder of the infrastructure agent, make sure you meet the following requirements: Infrastructure agent version 1.11.4 or higher OpenSSL library 1.1.0 or higher is required by Infrastructure agent starting from 1.16.4. Built-in support for ARM64 architecture on Linux systems (in example, AWS Graviton architecture) added in Infrastructure agent 1.26.0. Important The log forwarding feature is not supported with the Docker container for infrastructure monitoring agents. The log forwarding feature is compatible with the following operating systems: Operating system Supported version Amazon Linux Amazon Linux 2 CentOS Version 7 or higher Debian Version 9 (\"Stretch\") or higher Exception: Version 11 is not supported. Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) Version 7 or higher SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) Version 12 Ubuntu Versions 16.04.x, 18.04.x and 20.04.x (LTS versions) Windows Windows Server 2012, 2016, and 2019, and their service packs. Windows 10 Install the infrastructure agent Starting with version 1.11.4, the infrastructure agent can forward logs to New Relic. To install and run the agent, use a package manager (Linux) or the MSI installer (Windows). Important The log forwarding feature is not included when the infrastructure agent is implemented using Linux tarball or Windows ZIP installations. To use the following links, make sure you are logged to your New Relic account. Amazon Linux CentOS Debian RHEL SLES Ubuntu Windows If you don't have a New Relic account yet, or if you prefer to follow the procedure manually, see our tutorial to install the package manager. Configure the infrastructure agent Configuration files describe which log sources are forwarded. Our infrastructure agent uses .yml files to configure logging. You can add as many config files as you want. To add a new configuration file for the log forwarding feature: Navigate to the log forwarder configuration folder: Linux: /etc/newrelic-infra/logging.d/ Windows: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\logging.d\\ Create a logging.yml configuration file, and add the parameters you need. The logging.d directory has various .yml.example files you can use as a reference or starting point. The agent automatically processes new configuration files without having to restart the infrastructure monitoring service. The only exception to this is when configuring a custom Fluent Bit configuration. Log forwarding parameters The infrastructure log forwarding .yml config supports the following parameters: Name (required) To start, define a name of the log or logs you want to forward to New Relic. Log source (required) What you use for the log source will depend on where you want to forward your logs from. Available options include: file Path to the log file or files. The agent tracks changes on the log files in a way similar to tail -f shell. Example: logs: - name: example-log file: /var/log/example.log # Path to a single log file - name: example-log-two file: /var/log/example-two.log # Path to another single log file Copy The file parameter can point to a specific log file or multiple files by using wildcards applied to names and extensions; for example, /logs/*.log. You can use wildcards in place of directories in a file path, which can be used to tail files located in different directories. Example: logs: - name: docker-logs file: /var/lib/docker/containers/*/*.log # Path to multiple folders and files Copy Important Use of wildcards may significantly increase the number of file descriptors and inotify watches the Fluent Bit process keeps open, which can interfere with log collection if the host's file descriptor limit is reached. Tailing a large number of files may require you to increase the maximum number of file descriptors and inotify watchers allowed by the operating system. Please refer to Errors when tailing a large amount of log files for more details on how to increase them. systemd Use the systemd parameter to forward log messages that are collected by the journald daemon in Linux environments. This input type requires the agent to run in root mode. Example: logs: - name: systemd-example systemd: cupsd Copy syslog Syslog data source. Parameters: uri: Syslog socket. Format varies depending on the protocol: TCP/UDP network sockets: [tcp/udp]://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT Unix domain sockets: unix_[tcp/udp]:// + /socket/path parser: Syslog parser. Default is rfc3164. Use rfc5424 if your messages include fractional seconds. Note: rfc3164 currently does not work on SuSE. unix_permissions: default is 0644 for domain sockets; this limits entries to processes running as root. You can use 0666 to listen for non-root processes, at your own risk. When running the agent in privileged mode, ports and sockets must be available or owned by nri-agent, with 0666 file permissions, so that other processes can write logs to the sockets. logs: # TCP network socket - name: syslog-tcp-test syslog: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:5140 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format parser: rfc5424 # Default syslog parser is rfc3164 # UDP network socket - name: syslog-udp-test syslog: uri: udp://0.0.0.0:6140 # Use the udp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format max_line_kb: 35 # Unix TCP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-tcp-test syslog: uri: unix_tcp:///var/unix-tcp-socket-test unix_permissions: 0666 # Default is 0644. Change at your own risk # Unix UDP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-udp-test syslog: uri: unix_udp:///var/unix-udp-socket-test parser: rfc5424 Copy tcp Logs retrieved over TCP connections. Parameters: uri: TCP/IP socket to listen for incoming data. The URI format is tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format: format of the data. It can be json or none. separator: If format: none is used, you can define a separator string for splitting records (default: \\n). logs: - name: tcp-simple-test tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:1234 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format format: none # Raw text - this is default for 'tcp' separator: \\t # String for separating raw text entries max_line_kb: 32 - name: tcp-json-test tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:2345 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format format: json Copy winlog Collect events from Windows log channels. Parameters: channel: name of the channel logs will be collected from. collect-eventids: a list of Windows Event IDs to be collected and forwarded to New Relic. Event ID ranges are supported. exclude-eventids: a list of Windows Event IDs to be excluded from collection. Event ID ranges are supported. All events are collected from the specified channel by default. Configure the collect-eventids and exclude-eventids sections to avoid sending unwanted logs to your New Relic account. Add event IDs or ranges to collect-eventids or exclude-eventids to forward or drop specific events. exclude-eventids takes precedence over collect-eventids if the same event ID is present in both sections. Example: logs: # Winlog log ingestion with eventId filters. - name: windows-security winlog: channel: Security collect-eventids: - 4624 - 4265 - 4700-4800 exclude-eventids: - 4735 # entries for the application, system, powershell, and SCOM channels - name: windows-application winlog: channel: Application - name: windows-system winlog: channel: System - name: windows-pshell winlog: channel: Windows Powershell - name: scom winlog: channel: Operations Manager # Entry for Windows Defender Logs - name: windows-defender winlog: channel: Microsoft-Windows-Windows Defender/Operational # Entry for Windows Clustering Logs - name: windows-clustering winlog: channel: Microsoft-Windows-FailoverClustering/Operational # Entry for IIS logs with logtype attribute for automatic parsing - name: iis-log file: C:\\inetpub\\logs\\LogFiles\\w3svc.log attributes: logtype: iis_w3c Copy Optional configuration The following configuration parameters are not required but are still recommended. attributes List of custom attributes specified as key-value pairs that can be used to send additional data with the logs which you can then query. The attributes configuration parameter can be used with any log source. One common use of the attributes configuration parameter is to specify the logtype attribute. This attribute allows leveraging one of the built-in parsing rules supported by New Relic Logs. Example: logs: - name: example-file-attributes file: /var/log/example.log attributes: logtype: nginx region: example-us-02 team: A-team - name: example-tcp-attributes tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:2345 format: json attributes: logtype: nginx region: example-us-02 team: B-team Copy attributes automatically inserted by the infrastructure agent The infrastructure agent automatically inserts log attributes for your convenience. Some of them are inserted for any log record, while others depend on the configuration parameters you used while setting up the log forwarder. Attribute name Description entity.guids Always inserted. The infrastructure agent inserts the Entity GUID assigned by New Relic to identify the host where it's running. It is available in the entity.guids field. Note: If the captured logs belong to an application instrumented using APM, the entity.guids field contains both the entity GUID of infrastructure, as well as the GUID of APM, separated by a pipe ( | ) delimiter. fb.input Always inserted. The underlying Fluent Bit input plugin type used to capture the logs. Currently its values are tail, systemd, winlog, syslog, and tcp. filePath Inserted when sing the file input type. Absolute file path of the file being monitored. hostname Always inserted. The hostname of the machine/VM/container executing the infrastructure agent. plugin.type Always inserted. Indicates the utility used to capture the logs. In this case, it is the infrastructure agent itself, so this attribute always has the value nri-agent. pattern Regular expression for filtering records. Only supported for the tail, systemd, syslog, and tcp (only with format none) sources. This field works in a way similar to grep -E in Unix systems. For example, for a given file being captured, you can filter for records containing either WARN or ERROR using: - name: only-records-with-warn-and-error file: /var/log/logFile.log pattern: WARN|ERROR Copy No filtering is applied by default. max_line_kb Maximum size of log entries/lines in KB. If log entries exceed the limit, they are skipped. Default is 128. fluentbit External Fluent Bit configuration and parser files. If defined, they are merged with the existing configuration and parser files generated by the infrastructure agent. The infrastructure agent processes the configuration files located in the logging.d directory and will generate a run-time Fluent Bit configuration file that contains the appropriate [INPUT], [FILTER] and [OUTPUT] sections. Optionally, it will also declare an @INCLUDE in case you provided an external Fluent Bit configuration file via the fluentbit option. The runtime file does not define a [SERVICE] section, leaving all default Fluent Bit configuration values. You can still override Fluent Bit's default settings by defining your own [SERVICE] section in your external Fluent Bit configuration file and include it via the fluentbit option. Parameters: config_file: path to an existing Fluent Bit configuration file. Note that any overlapping source results in duplicate messages in New Relic Logs. parsers_file: path to an existing Fluent Bit parsers file.

For example, you can execute a query like this: SELECT * FROM Log Copy Troubleshooting If you encounter problems with configuring your log forwarder, try these troubleshooting tips. No log data If no data appears after you enable our log management capabilities, follow our standard log troubleshooting procedures. No data appears when tailing a file The log forwarding feature requires the agent to have permission to read the data sources. When running the infrastructure agent in privileged or non-privileged modes, make sure that the log files you want to forward (and any intermediary directory in its path) are readable by the user running nri-agent. Example: Check file access under Linux Let's check whether the file /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log can be monitored by the nri-agent user. In Linux, you can do a quick check with the namei command: sudo -u nri-agent namei -ml /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log f: /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log drwxr-xr-x root root / drwxr-xr-x root root var drwxrwxr-x root syslog log drwxr--r-- root root restrictedLogs logFile.log - No such file or directory Copy This command failed because the file is not visible to the nri-agent user. By inspecting the previous output, we can detect that the restrictedLogs directory is missing the execution flag for others. To fix this, execute: sudo chmod 755 /var/log/restrictedLogs Copy And then check for file access again: # sudo -u nri-agent namei -ml /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log f: /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log drwxr-xr-x root root / drwxr-xr-x root root var drwxrwxr-x root syslog log drwxr-xr-x root root restrictedLogs -rw-r----- vagrant vagrant logFile.log Copy The file is now visible to the nri-agent user. You must ensure that the file is also readable by the nri-agent user. To check this, use: # sudo -u nri-agent head /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log head: cannot open '/var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log' for reading: Permission denied Copy In this example, the file is missing the read rights for the others group (users other than vagrant and the vagrant user group). You could fix this by granting read permissions to others, but the application could change these permissions upon restart. To avoid this, a better approach is to add the nri-agent user to the vagrant user group. No data appears when capturing via a Syslog socket The log forwarding feature requires that the agent has permission to read the data sources. When running the infrastructure agent in privileged or non-privileged modes: If you're using Unix domain socket files, make sure that the nri-agent user can access these files (please refer to the previous section) and that they have read and write permissions (666) so that other users than nri-agent can write to them. If you're using IP sockets, ensure that the port that you are using is not a system reserved one (like port 80, for example). If no data appears after you enable log management, follow standard log management troubleshooting procedures. No data appears using infrastructure agent proxy As explained in the infrastructure agent configuration guidelines, the proxy parameter must use either HTTP or HTTPS and be in the form https://user:password@hostname:port. The agent can parse the parameter without the HTTP or HTTPS, but the log forwarder cannot. You will see an error like the following in the agent verbose logs: [ERROR] building HTTP transport: parse \\\"hostname:port\\\": first path segment in URL cannot contain colon Copy To solve this problem, check your newrelic-infra.yml file, and ensure the proxy parameter adheres to this form. If you're using caBundleFile or caBundleDir in order to specify any certificate, we recommend to follow the below rules for each OS: Linux For HTTP proxies you don't need to setup any certificates. The plugin loads the system certificates and New Relic sends logs into the logging endpoint. However, you can specify the proxy self-signed certificate (PEM file) using either the caBundleFile or caBundleDir parameters. Windows For HTTP proxies you don't need to setup any certificates. The plugin loads the system certificates. For HTTPS, you can configure it in one of the following ways: Import the proxy certificate to the system pool (Recommended) Import the proxy self-signed certificate (PEM file) by using the MMC tool. Refer to this link, and in Step 2 ensure to import it in your Trusted Root Certification Authorities, instead of in the Intermediate Certification Authorities. Using the caBundleFile and caBundleDir parameters On Windows, we cannot load both the certificates from the system certificate pool and the ones specified with the caBundleFile caBundleDir parameters. So, if you are using caBundleFile or caBundleDir, ensure that the following certificates are placed in the same PEM file (when using caBundleFile) or in the same directory (when using caBundleDir): The Proxy certificate (because it's an HTTPS proxy). The Logging Endpoint certificate (eg. https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1). The Infrastructure Agent certificate (eg. https://infra-api.newrelic.com). You can check the certificates by running: # openssl s_client -connect log-api.newrelic.com:443 -servername log-api.newrelic.com Copy Sending the infrastructure agent's logs to New Relic You can configure the infrastructure agent to send its own logs to New Relic. This is useful for troubleshooting issues with log forwarding, the agent, or when contacting support. To forward the infrastructure agent logs to New Relic: Edit your newrelic-infra.yml file. Enable agent logging in troubleshooting mode by adding verbose: 3. On Windows and systems that don't use systemd or where journald is inaccessible, verbose:3 causes the agent to write the logs on the disk. Revert to verbose:0 to prevent this. (Recommended): Enable agent logging in JSON format to log_format: json. Restart the agent to load the new settings. This configuration sets up the agent in troubleshooting mode, but the log forwarder (based on Fluent Bit) will continue in a non-verbose mode. Sometimes you can have issues with the log forwarder itself. For example, there may be problems accessing a specific channel when shipping Windows log events or when accessing a particular log file. In these situations, you can also enable the verbose mode for the log forwarder: Set verbose to a value other than 0. Add the configuration option: trace: [\"log.fw\"]. Caution Check whether you are using the [fluentbit] option. When setting verbose: 3 and trace: [\"log.fw\"], ensure that you don't define any [OUTPUT] section pointing to stdout in an external Fluent Bit configuration file, Fluent Bit does not start with the infra agent Important Fluent Bit's tail plugin does not support network drives. For Linux versions prior to 2016, you may need to update the OpenSSL library to 1.1.0 (or higher). To check if you have this problem: See if infra-agent has started Fluent Bit by running: ps -aux | grep fluent-bi Copy If it isn't running go to /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/logging and run: ./fluent-bit -i systemd -o stdout Copy If you get the following error, update OpenSSL to 1.1.0 or higher: error while loading shared libraries: libssl.so.1.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory Copy Runtime error on Windows One of the following error messages may appear when enabling log forwarding on Windows: The code execution cannot proceed because VCRUNTIME140.dll was not found. Copy OR error=\"exit status 3221225781\" process=log-forwarder Copy This is caused by a missing DLL. To solve the issue, install the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable as applicable: x64 x86 Errors when tailing a large amount of log files (Linux) It's common to face either one of the following error messages when attempting to tail a large amount of files: Too many open files The user limit on the total number of inotify watches was reached or the kernel failed to allocate a needed resource The operating system defines a maximum amount of allocatable file descriptors (typically 1024 by default), and a maximum amount of allocatable inotify watches (typically 8192 by default). Any process attempting to go above these limits will fail, returning one of the errors above. The underlying technology we use to forward logs, Fluent Bit, opens one file descriptor and sets an inotify watch for each file you configure to be forwarded. Moreover, at the time of writing this section, Fluent Bit uses an extra set of 32 file descriptors for its normal operation, with another extra file descriptor when it shuts down. Therefore, to capture a large amount of files you need to ensure that both the file descriptor and inotify watch limits are slightly greater than the amount of log files you wish to tail. The following instructions summarize how to increase these limits if you want to tail 10,000 log files. Also, it assumes the infrastructure agent is installed in root running mode, and therefore must be run using the root user. Check which is the current hard limit for the amount of file descriptors per process. Typically, this limit should be quite high and should not need to be modified. ulimit -Hn Copy Add the following line to /etc/security/limits.conf. We specified a limit of 10100 here instead of just 10000 to allow Fluent Bit to allocate the extra file descriptors it may need to work. root soft nofile 10100 # replace root by nri-agent for non-root (privileged and unprivileged) installations Copy Add the following line to /etc/pam.d/common-session so that the previous limit is applied upon restart: session required pam_limits.so Copy Add the following line to /etc/sysctl.conf to increase the amount of allowed inotify watchers per user. We specified a limit of 18192 here instead of just 10000 so that the root user will still have 8192 available inotify watches (the default value). fs.inotify.max_user_watches=18192 Copy Restart your system. Ensure that the new limits have been enforced by running: ulimit -Sn # Should return 10100 cat /proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_watches # Should return 18192 Copy Learn more on how to increase open file limits, or on how to increase the inotify watches. Uninstall log forwarding To uninstall log forwarding capabilities, go to your logging.d directory, and remove files with the .yml extension that were originally added during the configuration process.

      "body": "We support two different methods to forward your logs from a Google Cloud Platform Pub/Sub topic to New Relic. Select an option The following may help you decide which option is best for your business needs. GCP log forwarding options Considerations Headerless API Best suited for low log volumes, since it performs one API call for each log record it sends. Does not incur any extra cost to your GCP subscription. If your log volume increases, this solution might hit the quota limits of your New Relic account. Dataflow job Best suited for larger log volumes, since it groups log records in batches before sending them to New Relic. Reduces the number of API calls and allows you to reduce your quota usage. May incur extra costs at your GCP subscription, due to the execution of a Dataflow job in your premises. Use headerless API To send your GCP logs to New Relic using our headerless API: 1. Generate a GCP Pub/Sub ingest URL. Start by creating an ingest URL for your GCP Pub/Sub topic. Navigate to Logs in New Relic One, and click Add more data sources. Click Google Cloud Platform, then select your New Relic account where you want to forward logs, and click Continue. Optional: Configure metadata (attribute-value pairs) to be included in every log event sent to the ingest URL you will generate in the next step. Click Generate URL. Copy your newly generated ingest URL and keep it in a safe place. You will use your new ingest URL to configure a Pub/Sub topic that sends logs to New Relic. 2. Create a GCP Pub/Sub Topic. Next you will create the GCP Pub/Sub topic that your ingest URL will use. Navigate to the GCP Pub/Sub Console. Click Create Topic. Enter a meaningful Topic ID, then configure other options as needed. Click Create Topic. 3. Prepare GCP Pub/Sub Topic to forward logs to New Relic. Once you have created your Pub/Sub topic, create a subscription for it. Return to the GCP Pub/Sub Console. Click the Pub/Sub topic you previously created. Scroll down and select the Subscriptions tab, then click Create Subscription and select Create a simple subscription. Enter a Subscription ID. Then, under Delivery Type, select Push. In the Endpoint URL field, paste the ingest URL you previously generated. Configure remaining settings as needed, and click Create. 4. Create routing sink to forward logs to New Relic. To finish setup, create a routing sink for your GCP Pub/Sub topic that will forward your logs to New Relic. Navigate to the GCP Logs Router Console. Click Create Sink. Enter a Sink name and Sink description, then click Next. Under Select sink service, select Cloud Pub/Sub topic, and select the Pub/Sub topic you previously created. Configure remaining filters as needed, then click Create sink to complete setup. Use Dataflow job To send your GCP logs to New Relic using a Dataflow job, you will use our Dataflow template. Before you begin, make sure you have the following tools on your local computer: A Unix terminal for Linux or macOS Git Java JDK 8 or higher Apache Maven 3.2 or higher. We've seen earlier versions fail during the compilation process. The Google Cloud SDK, which includes gcloud and gsutil command line tools 1. Log into your Google Cloud Platform account. Run the following command and follow the prompts to log into GCP and select your cloud project: gcloud init Copy Using the wizard, you will select a cloud project to use, and you will be able to optionally select a default compute region and zone for the resources you create using gcloud or gsutil. We will not presume a default project, location or region for the following commands. 2. Clone the DataflowTemplates GitHub repository. Clone the DataflowTemplates GitHub repository using the following command: git clone https://github.com/newrelic-forks/DataflowTemplates.git Copy Enter the directory you just created: cd DataflowTemplates Copy Then continue with the next section to execute additional commands. 3. Compile and run the Dataflow forwarder. To set the required configuration to compile and run the Dataflow forwarder, run the following commands in your DataflowTemplates directory. The only required values are: PROJECT_ID BUCKET_NAME NR_LICENSE_KEY INPUT_SUBSCRIPTION_NAME You can leave the other default values as is. bash Copy $ # The Google Cloud Platform project id where your logs are and where the Dataflow log forwarder will run $ PROJECT_ID=<your_project_id> $ # Temporary bucket that will store intermediary files as a result of compiling the Dataflow template. Its name must be unique. $ BUCKET_NAME=<a_nonexisting_gcs_bucket_name> $ # New Relic license key $ NR_LICENSE_KEY=<your_newrelic_license_key> $ Input PubSub subscription to read logs from $ INPUT_SUBSCRIPTION_NAME=<your_pubsub_input_subscription_name> $ $ # Region where the created resources will be placed $ REGION=us-west1 $ # Service account used to execute the Dataflow template $ SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME=nr-dataflow-forwarder-sa $ # File name where the service account credentials will be stored $ SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_FILENAME=service-account-key.json $ # The name your Dataflow log forwarder job will have $ JOB_NAME=nr-log-forwarder 4. Create a GCP bucket for the Dataflow template. Create a bucket in GCP to hold the generated Dataflow template by running the following command: bash Copy $ gsutil mb -p ${PROJECT_ID} -l ${REGION} gs://${BUCKET_NAME} 5. Create a service account. Execute the following commands: Create the service account: bash Copy $ gcloud iam service-accounts create ${SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME} Grant permissions to the service account: bash Copy $ gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding ${PROJECT_ID} --member=\"serviceAccount:${SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME}@${PROJECT_ID}.iam.gserviceaccount.com\" --role=\"roles/owner\" Generate the service account key file: bash Copy $ gcloud iam service-accounts keys create ${SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_FILENAME} --iam-account=${SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME}@${PROJECT_ID}.iam.gserviceaccount.com Reference your service account key file using the GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS environment variable, as it will be used by subsequent commands: bash Copy $ export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=${SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_FILENAME} 6. Compile and publish the PubsubToNewRelic template. Execute the following command: bash Copy $ mvn compile exec:java \\ > -Dexec.mainClass=com.google.cloud.teleport.templates.PubsubToNewRelic \\ > -Dexec.cleanupDaemonThreads=false \\ > -Dexec.args=\" \\ > --project=${PROJECT_ID} \\ > --region=${REGION} \\ > --enableStreamingEngine \\ > --stagingLocation=gs://${BUCKET_NAME}/staging/ \\ > --gcpTempLocation=gs://${BUCKET_NAME}/temp/ \\ > --templateLocation=gs://${BUCKET_NAME}/template/PubsubToNewRelic \\ > --runner=DataflowRunner \\ > \" 7. Run the template as a Dataflow job. Execute the following command to start shipping logs using a Dataflow job that reads from your Pub/Sub topic: bash Copy $ gcloud dataflow jobs run ${JOB_NAME} \\ > --gcs-location=gs://${BUCKET_NAME}/template/PubsubToNewRelic \\ > --region=${REGION} \\ > --parameters \"inputSubscription=projects/${PROJECT_ID}/subscriptions/${INPUT_SUBSCRIPTION_NAME},licenseKey=${NR_LICENSE_KEY}\" This command only requires these two values: The input PubSub subscription used to read log messages The New Relic license key used to send your logs For other values, the command uses default configuration settings that you can further customize as needed. 8. Optional: Tune up your Dataflow log forwarder job. Here is a reference of available options you can use to further tune up the execution of your Dataflow log forwarder job. Configuration parameter Description licenseKey Required. New Relic license key. inputSubscription Required. The Cloud Pub/Sub subscription used to consume logs. Use this format: projects/<project-id>/subscriptions/<subscription-name> Copy logsApiUrl New Relic's URL for the Log API. This routes from the VPC where the Dataflow pipeline runs. Default: https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 Copy batchCount Maximum number of log records to aggregate into a batch before sending them to New Relic in a single HTTP POST request. Default: 100 flushDelay Number of seconds to wait for additional logs (up to batchCount) since the reception of the last log record in non-full batch, before flushing them to New Relic. Default: 2 parallelism Maximum number of parallel requests. Default: 1 disableCertificateValidation Disable SSL certificate validation. Default: false useCompression Compress (in GZIP) the payloads sent to the New Relic Logs API. Default: true tokenKMSEncryptionKey KMS Encryption Key for the token. Use this format: projects/{gcp_project}/locations/{key_region}/keyRings/{key_ring}/cryptoKeys/{kms_key_name} Copy Default: null What's next?

      "body": "You can send your Amazon CloudWatch logs to New Relic using our AWS Lambda function, newrelic-log-ingestion. This can be easily deployed from the AWS Serverless application repository. Forwarding your CloudWatch logs to New Relic will give you enhanced log management capabilities to collect, process, explore, query, and alert on your log data. Install and configure the Cloudwatch logs Lambda function The following setup shows one approach for configuring environment variables. You can also configure them from the Functions page. Complete the following: Make sure you have a New Relic license key. Open the AWS Serverless Application Repository in your browser. Search for newrelic and check Show apps that create custom IAM roles or resource policies to find newrelic-log-ingestion. Open the newrelic-log-ingestion details and click Deploy. In the function's Configure menu, go to Environment Variables and configure log forwarding using the following environment variables: Key Description DEBUG_LOGGING_ENABLED A boolean to determine if you want to output debug messages in the CloudWatch console. Optional. To turn on debug logs, set this to true. Default is false. LICENSE_KEY New Relic license key is used for sending data to New Relic. Required. LOGGING_ENABLED Determines if logs are forwarded to New Relic. Required. To turn on logging, set this to true. NR_LOGGING_ENDPOINT New Relic ingestion endpoint for logs. Required. Two endpoints are available: US: https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 EU: https://log-api.eu.newrelic.com/log/v1 NR_TAGS Specify tags to be added to all log events. Optional. Each tag is composed of a colon-delimited key and value. Multiple key-value pairs are semicolon-delimited; for example, env:prod;team:myTeam. Acknowledge that the app creates custom IAM roles, and then click Deploy. Once the process completes, create a Lambda trigger to link your Lambda function to CloudWatch logs. Create a Lambda trigger To get your logs streaming to New Relic, attach a trigger to the Lambda: From the left side menu, select Functions. Find and select the previously created newrelic-log-ingestion function. Under Designer, click Add Triggers, and select Cloudwatch Logs from the dropdown. Select the the appropriate Log group for your application. Enter a name for your filter. Optional: Enter a filter pattern. Check the Enable trigger checkbox, then click Add to create the trigger. Configure retries (optional) You can configure the number of retries you want to perform in case the function fails to send the data in case of communication issues. Recommended number is 3 retries, but you can change the retry behavior by changing the below parameters: Tip The more the number of retries there are can make the function run for longer times. This increases the probability of having higher costs for Lambda. However, decreasing the number of retries could increase the probability of data loss. MAX_RETRIES = 3 # Defines the number of retries after lambda failure to deliver data INITIAL_BACKOFF = 1 # Defines the initial wait seconds until next retry is executed BACKOFF_MULTIPLIER = 2 # Time multiplier between the retries As an example, in default above configuration, first retry will happen after 1 second, second retry after 2 seconds and third retry will happen after 4 seconds. Copy Resources created by the SAM template When you create the application from the repository, the following resources are also created: The Lambda function itself A role used to give execution permissions to the Lambda function based in CloudWatch Logs. All other Lambda configurations not listed can be left as the defaults.

      "body": "You can forward your logs to New Relic using our infrastructure monitoring agent. This makes all of your logging data available in one location and provides deeper visibility into both your application and your platform performance data. Forwarding your logs to New Relic will give you enhanced log management capabilities to collect, process, explore, query, and alert on your log data. Basic process To forward your logs through our infrastructure monitoring agent: If you haven't already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Verify the system requirements needed for configuring logs. Ensure you have installed the infrastructure agent, version 1.11.4 or higher. Create a logging.yml configuration file in the infrastructure agent's logging.d directory. Configure your log sources and other parameters. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your account for data. Explore your log data in the Logs UI and benefit from the log attributes automatically inserted by the infrastructure agent. Here is an example of where you can see logs in context of your infrastructure monitoring details in New Relic One. System requirements To use the log forwarder of the infrastructure agent, make sure you meet the following requirements: Infrastructure agent version 1.11.4 or higher OpenSSL library 1.1.0 or higher is required by Infrastructure agent starting from 1.16.4. Built-in support for ARM64 architecture on Linux systems (in example, AWS Graviton architecture) added in Infrastructure agent 1.26.0. Important The log forwarding feature is not supported with the Docker container for infrastructure monitoring agents. The log forwarding feature is compatible with the following operating systems: Operating system Supported version Amazon Linux Amazon Linux 2 CentOS Version 7 or higher Debian Version 9 (\"Stretch\") or higher Exception: Version 11 is not supported. Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) Version 7 or higher SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) Version 12 Ubuntu Versions 16.04.x, 18.04.x and 20.04.x (LTS versions) Windows Windows Server 2012, 2016, and 2019, and their service packs. Windows 10 Install the infrastructure agent Starting with version 1.11.4, the infrastructure agent can forward logs to New Relic. To install and run the agent, use a package manager (Linux) or the MSI installer (Windows). Important The log forwarding feature is not included when the infrastructure agent is implemented using Linux tarball or Windows ZIP installations. To use the following links, make sure you are logged to your New Relic account. Amazon Linux CentOS Debian RHEL SLES Ubuntu Windows If you don't have a New Relic account yet, or if you prefer to follow the procedure manually, see our tutorial to install the package manager. Configure the infrastructure agent Configuration files describe which log sources are forwarded. Our infrastructure agent uses .yml files to configure logging. You can add as many config files as you want. To add a new configuration file for the log forwarding feature: Navigate to the log forwarder configuration folder: Linux: /etc/newrelic-infra/logging.d/ Windows: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\logging.d\\ Create a logging.yml configuration file, and add the parameters you need. The logging.d directory has various .yml.example files you can use as a reference or starting point. The agent automatically processes new configuration files without having to restart the infrastructure monitoring service. The only exception to this is when configuring a custom Fluent Bit configuration. Log forwarding parameters The infrastructure log forwarding .yml config supports the following parameters: Name (required) To start, define a name of the log or logs you want to forward to New Relic. Log source (required) What you use for the log source will depend on where you want to forward your logs from. Available options include: file Path to the log file or files. The agent tracks changes on the log files in a way similar to tail -f shell. Example: logs: - name: example-log file: /var/log/example.log # Path to a single log file - name: example-log-two file: /var/log/example-two.log # Path to another single log file Copy The file parameter can point to a specific log file or multiple files by using wildcards applied to names and extensions; for example, /logs/*.log. You can use wildcards in place of directories in a file path, which can be used to tail files located in different directories. Example: logs: - name: docker-logs file: /var/lib/docker/containers/*/*.log # Path to multiple folders and files Copy Important Use of wildcards may significantly increase the number of file descriptors and inotify watches the Fluent Bit process keeps open, which can interfere with log collection if the host's file descriptor limit is reached. Tailing a large number of files may require you to increase the maximum number of file descriptors and inotify watchers allowed by the operating system. Please refer to Errors when tailing a large amount of log files for more details on how to increase them. systemd Use the systemd parameter to forward log messages that are collected by the journald daemon in Linux environments. This input type requires the agent to run in root mode. Example: logs: - name: systemd-example systemd: cupsd Copy syslog Syslog data source. Parameters: uri: Syslog socket. Format varies depending on the protocol: TCP/UDP network sockets: [tcp/udp]://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT Unix domain sockets: unix_[tcp/udp]:// + /socket/path parser: Syslog parser. Default is rfc3164. Use rfc5424 if your messages include fractional seconds. Note: rfc3164 currently does not work on SuSE. unix_permissions: default is 0644 for domain sockets; this limits entries to processes running as root. You can use 0666 to listen for non-root processes, at your own risk. When running the agent in privileged mode, ports and sockets must be available or owned by nri-agent, with 0666 file permissions, so that other processes can write logs to the sockets. logs: # TCP network socket - name: syslog-tcp-test syslog: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:5140 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format parser: rfc5424 # Default syslog parser is rfc3164 # UDP network socket - name: syslog-udp-test syslog: uri: udp://0.0.0.0:6140 # Use the udp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format max_line_kb: 35 # Unix TCP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-tcp-test syslog: uri: unix_tcp:///var/unix-tcp-socket-test unix_permissions: 0666 # Default is 0644. Change at your own risk # Unix UDP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-udp-test syslog: uri: unix_udp:///var/unix-udp-socket-test parser: rfc5424 Copy tcp Logs retrieved over TCP connections. Parameters: uri: TCP/IP socket to listen for incoming data. The URI format is tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format: format of the data. It can be json or none. separator: If format: none is used, you can define a separator string for splitting records (default: \\n). logs: - name: tcp-simple-test tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:1234 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format format: none # Raw text - this is default for 'tcp' separator: \\t # String for separating raw text entries max_line_kb: 32 - name: tcp-json-test tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:2345 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format format: json Copy winlog Collect events from Windows log channels. Parameters: channel: name of the channel logs will be collected from. collect-eventids: a list of Windows Event IDs to be collected and forwarded to New Relic. Event ID ranges are supported. exclude-eventids: a list of Windows Event IDs to be excluded from collection. Event ID ranges are supported. All events are collected from the specified channel by default. Configure the collect-eventids and exclude-eventids sections to avoid sending unwanted logs to your New Relic account. Add event IDs or ranges to collect-eventids or exclude-eventids to forward or drop specific events. exclude-eventids takes precedence over collect-eventids if the same event ID is present in both sections. Example: logs: # Winlog log ingestion with eventId filters. - name: windows-security winlog: channel: Security collect-eventids: - 4624 - 4265 - 4700-4800 exclude-eventids: - 4735 # entries for the application, system, powershell, and SCOM channels - name: windows-application winlog: channel: Application - name: windows-system winlog: channel: System - name: windows-pshell winlog: channel: Windows Powershell - name: scom winlog: channel: Operations Manager # Entry for Windows Defender Logs - name: windows-defender winlog: channel: Microsoft-Windows-Windows Defender/Operational # Entry for Windows Clustering Logs - name: windows-clustering winlog: channel: Microsoft-Windows-FailoverClustering/Operational # Entry for IIS logs with logtype attribute for automatic parsing - name: iis-log file: C:\\inetpub\\logs\\LogFiles\\w3svc.log attributes: logtype: iis_w3c Copy Optional configuration The following configuration parameters are not required but are still recommended. attributes List of custom attributes specified as key-value pairs that can be used to send additional data with the logs which you can then query. The attributes configuration parameter can be used with any log source. One common use of the attributes configuration parameter is to specify the logtype attribute. This attribute allows leveraging one of the built-in parsing rules supported by New Relic Logs. Example: logs: - name: example-file-attributes file: /var/log/example.log attributes: logtype: nginx region: example-us-02 team: A-team - name: example-tcp-attributes tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:2345 format: json attributes: logtype: nginx region: example-us-02 team: B-team Copy attributes automatically inserted by the infrastructure agent The infrastructure agent automatically inserts log attributes for your convenience. Some of them are inserted for any log record, while others depend on the configuration parameters you used while setting up the log forwarder. Attribute name Description entity.guids Always inserted. The infrastructure agent inserts the Entity GUID assigned by New Relic to identify the host where it's running. It is available in the entity.guids field. Note: If the captured logs belong to an application instrumented using APM, the entity.guids field contains both the entity GUID of infrastructure, as well as the GUID of APM, separated by a pipe ( | ) delimiter. fb.input Always inserted. The underlying Fluent Bit input plugin type used to capture the logs. Currently its values are tail, systemd, winlog, syslog, and tcp. filePath Inserted when sing the file input type. Absolute file path of the file being monitored. hostname Always inserted. The hostname of the machine/VM/container executing the infrastructure agent. plugin.type Always inserted. Indicates the utility used to capture the logs. In this case, it is the infrastructure agent itself, so this attribute always has the value nri-agent. pattern Regular expression for filtering records. Only supported for the tail, systemd, syslog, and tcp (only with format none) sources. This field works in a way similar to grep -E in Unix systems. For example, for a given file being captured, you can filter for records containing either WARN or ERROR using: - name: only-records-with-warn-and-error file: /var/log/logFile.log pattern: WARN|ERROR Copy No filtering is applied by default. max_line_kb Maximum size of log entries/lines in KB. If log entries exceed the limit, they are skipped. Default is 128. fluentbit External Fluent Bit configuration and parser files. If defined, they are merged with the existing configuration and parser files generated by the infrastructure agent. The infrastructure agent processes the configuration files located in the logging.d directory and will generate a run-time Fluent Bit configuration file that contains the appropriate [INPUT], [FILTER] and [OUTPUT] sections. Optionally, it will also declare an @INCLUDE in case you provided an external Fluent Bit configuration file via the fluentbit option. The runtime file does not define a [SERVICE] section, leaving all default Fluent Bit configuration values. You can still override Fluent Bit's default settings by defining your own [SERVICE] section in your external Fluent Bit configuration file and include it via the fluentbit option. Parameters: config_file: path to an existing Fluent Bit configuration file. Note that any overlapping source results in duplicate messages in New Relic Logs. parsers_file: path to an existing Fluent Bit parsers file. The following parser names are reserved: rfc3164, rfc3164-local and rfc5424. Sample configuration file Here is an example of a logging.d/ configuration file in YAML format. For more configuration examples, see the infrastructure agent repository. logging.d/sample.yaml # Remember to only use spaces for indentation logs: # Example of 'file' source - name: file-with-attributes file: /var/log/test.log # Path to a single file or pattern attributes: # You can use custom attributes to enrich your data logtype: nginx team: The A Team pattern: Error # Regular expression to filter log entries # Example of 'systemd' source (Linux only) - name: systemd-example systemd: cupsd # Examples of 'syslog' source, one per protocol # TCP network socket - name: syslog-tcp-test syslog: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:5140 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format parser: rfc5424 # Default syslog parser is rfc3164 # UDP network socket - name: syslog-udp-test syslog: uri: udp://0.0.0.0:6140 # Use the udp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format max_line_kb: 35 # Paths for Unix sockets are defined by combining protocol and path: # unix_udp:// + /path/socket - for example, unix_udp:///tmp/socket # Unix TCP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-tcp-test syslog: uri: unix_tcp:///var/unix-tcp-socket-test unix_permissions: 0666 # Default is 0644.

For example, you can execute a query like this: SELECT * FROM Log Copy Troubleshooting If you encounter problems with configuring your log forwarder, try these troubleshooting tips. No log data If no data appears after you enable our log management capabilities, follow our standard log troubleshooting procedures. No data appears when tailing a file The log forwarding feature requires the agent to have permission to read the data sources. When running the infrastructure agent in privileged or non-privileged modes, make sure that the log files you want to forward (and any intermediary directory in its path) are readable by the user running nri-agent. Example: Check file access under Linux Let's check whether the file /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log can be monitored by the nri-agent user. In Linux, you can do a quick check with the namei command: sudo -u nri-agent namei -ml /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log f: /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log drwxr-xr-x root root / drwxr-xr-x root root var drwxrwxr-x root syslog log drwxr--r-- root root restrictedLogs logFile.log - No such file or directory Copy This command failed because the file is not visible to the nri-agent user. By inspecting the previous output, we can detect that the restrictedLogs directory is missing the execution flag for others. To fix this, execute: sudo chmod 755 /var/log/restrictedLogs Copy And then check for file access again: # sudo -u nri-agent namei -ml /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log f: /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log drwxr-xr-x root root / drwxr-xr-x root root var drwxrwxr-x root syslog log drwxr-xr-x root root restrictedLogs -rw-r----- vagrant vagrant logFile.log Copy The file is now visible to the nri-agent user. You must ensure that the file is also readable by the nri-agent user. To check this, use: # sudo -u nri-agent head /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log head: cannot open '/var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log' for reading: Permission denied Copy In this example, the file is missing the read rights for the others group (users other than vagrant and the vagrant user group). You could fix this by granting read permissions to others, but the application could change these permissions upon restart. To avoid this, a better approach is to add the nri-agent user to the vagrant user group. No data appears when capturing via a Syslog socket The log forwarding feature requires that the agent has permission to read the data sources. When running the infrastructure agent in privileged or non-privileged modes: If you're using Unix domain socket files, make sure that the nri-agent user can access these files (please refer to the previous section) and that they have read and write permissions (666) so that other users than nri-agent can write to them. If you're using IP sockets, ensure that the port that you are using is not a system reserved one (like port 80, for example). If no data appears after you enable log management, follow standard log management troubleshooting procedures. No data appears using infrastructure agent proxy As explained in the infrastructure agent configuration guidelines, the proxy parameter must use either HTTP or HTTPS and be in the form https://user:password@hostname:port. The agent can parse the parameter without the HTTP or HTTPS, but the log forwarder cannot. You will see an error like the following in the agent verbose logs: [ERROR] building HTTP transport: parse \\\"hostname:port\\\": first path segment in URL cannot contain colon Copy To solve this problem, check your newrelic-infra.yml file, and ensure the proxy parameter adheres to this form. If you're using caBundleFile or caBundleDir in order to specify any certificate, we recommend to follow the below rules for each OS: Linux For HTTP proxies you don't need to setup any certificates. The plugin loads the system certificates and New Relic sends logs into the logging endpoint. However, you can specify the proxy self-signed certificate (PEM file) using either the caBundleFile or caBundleDir parameters. Windows For HTTP proxies you don't need to setup any certificates. The plugin loads the system certificates. For HTTPS, you can configure it in one of the following ways: Import the proxy certificate to the system pool (Recommended) Import the proxy self-signed certificate (PEM file) by using the MMC tool. Refer to this link, and in Step 2 ensure to import it in your Trusted Root Certification Authorities, instead of in the Intermediate Certification Authorities. Using the caBundleFile and caBundleDir parameters On Windows, we cannot load both the certificates from the system certificate pool and the ones specified with the caBundleFile caBundleDir parameters. So, if you are using caBundleFile or caBundleDir, ensure that the following certificates are placed in the same PEM file (when using caBundleFile) or in the same directory (when using caBundleDir): The Proxy certificate (because it's an HTTPS proxy). The Logging Endpoint certificate (eg. https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1). The Infrastructure Agent certificate (eg. https://infra-api.newrelic.com). You can check the certificates by running: # openssl s_client -connect log-api.newrelic.com:443 -servername log-api.newrelic.com Copy Sending the infrastructure agent's logs to New Relic You can configure the infrastructure agent to send its own logs to New Relic. This is useful for troubleshooting issues with log forwarding, the agent, or when contacting support. To forward the infrastructure agent logs to New Relic: Edit your newrelic-infra.yml file. Enable agent logging in troubleshooting mode by adding verbose: 3. On Windows and systems that don't use systemd or where journald is inaccessible, verbose:3 causes the agent to write the logs on the disk. Revert to verbose:0 to prevent this. (Recommended): Enable agent logging in JSON format to log_format: json. Restart the agent to load the new settings. This configuration sets up the agent in troubleshooting mode, but the log forwarder (based on Fluent Bit) will continue in a non-verbose mode. Sometimes you can have issues with the log forwarder itself. For example, there may be problems accessing a specific channel when shipping Windows log events or when accessing a particular log file. In these situations, you can also enable the verbose mode for the log forwarder: Set verbose to a value other than 0. Add the configuration option: trace: [\"log.fw\"]. Caution Check whether you are using the [fluentbit] option. When setting verbose: 3 and trace: [\"log.fw\"], ensure that you don't define any [OUTPUT] section pointing to stdout in an external Fluent Bit configuration file, Fluent Bit does not start with the infra agent Important Fluent Bit's tail plugin does not support network drives. For Linux versions prior to 2016, you may need to update the OpenSSL library to 1.1.0 (or higher). To check if you have this problem: See if infra-agent has started Fluent Bit by running: ps -aux | grep fluent-bi Copy If it isn't running go to /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/logging and run: ./fluent-bit -i systemd -o stdout Copy If you get the following error, update OpenSSL to 1.1.0 or higher: error while loading shared libraries: libssl.so.1.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory Copy Runtime error on Windows One of the following error messages may appear when enabling log forwarding on Windows: The code execution cannot proceed because VCRUNTIME140.dll was not found. Copy OR error=\"exit status 3221225781\" process=log-forwarder Copy This is caused by a missing DLL. To solve the issue, install the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable as applicable: x64 x86 Errors when tailing a large amount of log files (Linux) It's common to face either one of the following error messages when attempting to tail a large amount of files: Too many open files The user limit on the total number of inotify watches was reached or the kernel failed to allocate a needed resource The operating system defines a maximum amount of allocatable file descriptors (typically 1024 by default), and a maximum amount of allocatable inotify watches (typically 8192 by default). Any process attempting to go above these limits will fail, returning one of the errors above. The underlying technology we use to forward logs, Fluent Bit, opens one file descriptor and sets an inotify watch for each file you configure to be forwarded. Moreover, at the time of writing this section, Fluent Bit uses an extra set of 32 file descriptors for its normal operation, with another extra file descriptor when it shuts down. Therefore, to capture a large amount of files you need to ensure that both the file descriptor and inotify watch limits are slightly greater than the amount of log files you wish to tail. The following instructions summarize how to increase these limits if you want to tail 10,000 log files. Also, it assumes the infrastructure agent is installed in root running mode, and therefore must be run using the root user. Check which is the current hard limit for the amount of file descriptors per process. Typically, this limit should be quite high and should not need to be modified. ulimit -Hn Copy Add the following line to /etc/security/limits.conf. We specified a limit of 10100 here instead of just 10000 to allow Fluent Bit to allocate the extra file descriptors it may need to work. root soft nofile 10100 # replace root by nri-agent for non-root (privileged and unprivileged) installations Copy Add the following line to /etc/pam.d/common-session so that the previous limit is applied upon restart: session required pam_limits.so Copy Add the following line to /etc/sysctl.conf to increase the amount of allowed inotify watchers per user. We specified a limit of 18192 here instead of just 10000 so that the root user will still have 8192 available inotify watches (the default value). fs.inotify.max_user_watches=18192 Copy Restart your system. Ensure that the new limits have been enforced by running: ulimit -Sn # Should return 10100 cat /proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_watches # Should return 18192 Copy Learn more on how to increase open file limits, or on how to increase the inotify watches. Uninstall log forwarding To uninstall log forwarding capabilities, go to your logging.d directory, and remove files with the .yml extension that were originally added during the configuration process.

      "body": "You can forward your logs to New Relic using our infrastructure monitoring agent. This makes all of your logging data available in one location and provides deeper visibility into both your application and your platform performance data. Forwarding your logs to New Relic will give you enhanced log management capabilities to collect, process, explore, query, and alert on your log data. Basic process To forward your logs through our infrastructure monitoring agent: If you haven't already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Verify the system requirements needed for configuring logs. Ensure you have installed the infrastructure agent, version 1.11.4 or higher. Create a logging.yml configuration file in the infrastructure agent's logging.d directory. Configure your log sources and other parameters. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your account for data. Explore your log data in the Logs UI and benefit from the log attributes automatically inserted by the infrastructure agent. Here is an example of where you can see logs in context of your infrastructure monitoring details in New Relic One. System requirements To use the log forwarder of the infrastructure agent, make sure you meet the following requirements: Infrastructure agent version 1.11.4 or higher OpenSSL library 1.1.0 or higher is required by Infrastructure agent starting from 1.16.4. Built-in support for ARM64 architecture on Linux systems (in example, AWS Graviton architecture) added in Infrastructure agent 1.26.0. Important The log forwarding feature is not supported with the Docker container for infrastructure monitoring agents. The log forwarding feature is compatible with the following operating systems: Operating system Supported version Amazon Linux Amazon Linux 2 CentOS Version 7 or higher Debian Version 9 (\"Stretch\") or higher Exception: Version 11 is not supported. Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) Version 7 or higher SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) Version 12 Ubuntu Versions 16.04.x, 18.04.x and 20.04.x (LTS versions) Windows Windows Server 2012, 2016, and 2019, and their service packs. Windows 10 Install the infrastructure agent Starting with version 1.11.4, the infrastructure agent can forward logs to New Relic. To install and run the agent, use a package manager (Linux) or the MSI installer (Windows). Important The log forwarding feature is not included when the infrastructure agent is implemented using Linux tarball or Windows ZIP installations. To use the following links, make sure you are logged to your New Relic account. Amazon Linux CentOS Debian RHEL SLES Ubuntu Windows If you don't have a New Relic account yet, or if you prefer to follow the procedure manually, see our tutorial to install the package manager. Configure the infrastructure agent Configuration files describe which log sources are forwarded. Our infrastructure agent uses .yml files to configure logging. You can add as many config files as you want. To add a new configuration file for the log forwarding feature: Navigate to the log forwarder configuration folder: Linux: /etc/newrelic-infra/logging.d/ Windows: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\logging.d\\ Create a logging.yml configuration file, and add the parameters you need. The logging.d directory has various .yml.example files you can use as a reference or starting point. The agent automatically processes new configuration files without having to restart the infrastructure monitoring service. The only exception to this is when configuring a custom Fluent Bit configuration. Log forwarding parameters The infrastructure log forwarding .yml config supports the following parameters: Name (required) To start, define a name of the log or logs you want to forward to New Relic. Log source (required) What you use for the log source will depend on where you want to forward your logs from. Available options include: file Path to the log file or files. The agent tracks changes on the log files in a way similar to tail -f shell. Example: logs: - name: example-log file: /var/log/example.log # Path to a single log file - name: example-log-two file: /var/log/example-two.log # Path to another single log file Copy The file parameter can point to a specific log file or multiple files by using wildcards applied to names and extensions; for example, /logs/*.log. You can use wildcards in place of directories in a file path, which can be used to tail files located in different directories. Example: logs: - name: docker-logs file: /var/lib/docker/containers/*/*.log # Path to multiple folders and files Copy Important Use of wildcards may significantly increase the number of file descriptors and inotify watches the Fluent Bit process keeps open, which can interfere with log collection if the host's file descriptor limit is reached. Tailing a large number of files may require you to increase the maximum number of file descriptors and inotify watchers allowed by the operating system. Please refer to Errors when tailing a large amount of log files for more details on how to increase them. systemd Use the systemd parameter to forward log messages that are collected by the journald daemon in Linux environments. This input type requires the agent to run in root mode. Example: logs: - name: systemd-example systemd: cupsd Copy syslog Syslog data source. Parameters: uri: Syslog socket. Format varies depending on the protocol: TCP/UDP network sockets: [tcp/udp]://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT Unix domain sockets: unix_[tcp/udp]:// + /socket/path parser: Syslog parser. Default is rfc3164. Use rfc5424 if your messages include fractional seconds. Note: rfc3164 currently does not work on SuSE. unix_permissions: default is 0644 for domain sockets; this limits entries to processes running as root. You can use 0666 to listen for non-root processes, at your own risk. When running the agent in privileged mode, ports and sockets must be available or owned by nri-agent, with 0666 file permissions, so that other processes can write logs to the sockets. logs: # TCP network socket - name: syslog-tcp-test syslog: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:5140 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format parser: rfc5424 # Default syslog parser is rfc3164 # UDP network socket - name: syslog-udp-test syslog: uri: udp://0.0.0.0:6140 # Use the udp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format max_line_kb: 35 # Unix TCP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-tcp-test syslog: uri: unix_tcp:///var/unix-tcp-socket-test unix_permissions: 0666 # Default is 0644. Change at your own risk # Unix UDP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-udp-test syslog: uri: unix_udp:///var/unix-udp-socket-test parser: rfc5424 Copy tcp Logs retrieved over TCP connections. Parameters: uri: TCP/IP socket to listen for incoming data. The URI format is tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format: format of the data. It can be json or none. separator: If format: none is used, you can define a separator string for splitting records (default: \\n). logs: - name: tcp-simple-test tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:1234 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format format: none # Raw text - this is default for 'tcp' separator: \\t # String for separating raw text entries max_line_kb: 32 - name: tcp-json-test tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:2345 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format format: json Copy winlog Collect events from Windows log channels. Parameters: channel: name of the channel logs will be collected from. collect-eventids: a list of Windows Event IDs to be collected and forwarded to New Relic. Event ID ranges are supported. exclude-eventids: a list of Windows Event IDs to be excluded from collection. Event ID ranges are supported. All events are collected from the specified channel by default. Configure the collect-eventids and exclude-eventids sections to avoid sending unwanted logs to your New Relic account. Add event IDs or ranges to collect-eventids or exclude-eventids to forward or drop specific events. exclude-eventids takes precedence over collect-eventids if the same event ID is present in both sections. Example: logs: # Winlog log ingestion with eventId filters. - name: windows-security winlog: channel: Security collect-eventids: - 4624 - 4265 - 4700-4800 exclude-eventids: - 4735 # entries for the application, system, powershell, and SCOM channels - name: windows-application winlog: channel: Application - name: windows-system winlog: channel: System - name: windows-pshell winlog: channel: Windows Powershell - name: scom winlog: channel: Operations Manager # Entry for Windows Defender Logs - name: windows-defender winlog: channel: Microsoft-Windows-Windows Defender/Operational # Entry for Windows Clustering Logs - name: windows-clustering winlog: channel: Microsoft-Windows-FailoverClustering/Operational # Entry for IIS logs with logtype attribute for automatic parsing - name: iis-log file: C:\\inetpub\\logs\\LogFiles\\w3svc.log attributes: logtype: iis_w3c Copy Optional configuration The following configuration parameters are not required but are still recommended. attributes List of custom attributes specified as key-value pairs that can be used to send additional data with the logs which you can then query. The attributes configuration parameter can be used with any log source. One common use of the attributes configuration parameter is to specify the logtype attribute. This attribute allows leveraging one of the built-in parsing rules supported by New Relic Logs. Example: logs: - name: example-file-attributes file: /var/log/example.log attributes: logtype: nginx region: example-us-02 team: A-team - name: example-tcp-attributes tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:2345 format: json attributes: logtype: nginx region: example-us-02 team: B-team Copy attributes automatically inserted by the infrastructure agent The infrastructure agent automatically inserts log attributes for your convenience. Some of them are inserted for any log record, while others depend on the configuration parameters you used while setting up the log forwarder. Attribute name Description entity.guids Always inserted. The infrastructure agent inserts the Entity GUID assigned by New Relic to identify the host where it's running. It is available in the entity.guids field. Note: If the captured logs belong to an application instrumented using APM, the entity.guids field contains both the entity GUID of infrastructure, as well as the GUID of APM, separated by a pipe ( | ) delimiter. fb.input Always inserted. The underlying Fluent Bit input plugin type used to capture the logs. Currently its values are tail, systemd, winlog, syslog, and tcp. filePath Inserted when sing the file input type. Absolute file path of the file being monitored. hostname Always inserted. The hostname of the machine/VM/container executing the infrastructure agent. plugin.type Always inserted. Indicates the utility used to capture the logs. In this case, it is the infrastructure agent itself, so this attribute always has the value nri-agent. pattern Regular expression for filtering records. Only supported for the tail, systemd, syslog, and tcp (only with format none) sources. This field works in a way similar to grep -E in Unix systems. For example, for a given file being captured, you can filter for records containing either WARN or ERROR using: - name: only-records-with-warn-and-error file: /var/log/logFile.log pattern: WARN|ERROR Copy No filtering is applied by default. max_line_kb Maximum size of log entries/lines in KB. If log entries exceed the limit, they are skipped. Default is 128. fluentbit External Fluent Bit configuration and parser files. If defined, they are merged with the existing configuration and parser files generated by the infrastructure agent. The infrastructure agent processes the configuration files located in the logging.d directory and will generate a run-time Fluent Bit configuration file that contains the appropriate [INPUT], [FILTER] and [OUTPUT] sections. Optionally, it will also declare an @INCLUDE in case you provided an external Fluent Bit configuration file via the fluentbit option. The runtime file does not define a [SERVICE] section, leaving all default Fluent Bit configuration values. You can still override Fluent Bit's default settings by defining your own [SERVICE] section in your external Fluent Bit configuration file and include it via the fluentbit option. Parameters: config_file: path to an existing Fluent Bit configuration file. Note that any overlapping source results in duplicate messages in New Relic Logs. parsers_file: path to an existing Fluent Bit parsers file. The following parser names are reserved: rfc3164, rfc3164-local and rfc5424. Sample configuration file Here is an example of a logging.d/ configuration file in YAML format. For more configuration examples, see the infrastructure agent repository. logging.d/sample.yaml # Remember to only use spaces for indentation logs: # Example of 'file' source - name: file-with-attributes file: /var/log/test.log # Path to a single file or pattern attributes: # You can use custom attributes to enrich your data logtype: nginx team: The A Team pattern: Error # Regular expression to filter log entries # Example of 'systemd' source (Linux only) - name: systemd-example systemd: cupsd # Examples of 'syslog' source, one per protocol # TCP network socket - name: syslog-tcp-test syslog: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:5140 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format parser: rfc5424 # Default syslog parser is rfc3164 # UDP network socket - name: syslog-udp-test syslog: uri: udp://0.0.0.0:6140 # Use the udp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format max_line_kb: 35 # Paths for Unix sockets are defined by combining protocol and path: # unix_udp:// + /path/socket - for example, unix_udp:///tmp/socket # Unix TCP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-tcp-test syslog: uri: unix_tcp:///var/unix-tcp-socket-test unix_permissions: 0666 # Default is 0644.

For example, you can execute a query like this: SELECT * FROM Log Copy Troubleshooting If you encounter problems with configuring your log forwarder, try these troubleshooting tips. No log data If no data appears after you enable our log management capabilities, follow our standard log troubleshooting procedures. No data appears when tailing a file The log forwarding feature requires the agent to have permission to read the data sources. When running the infrastructure agent in privileged or non-privileged modes, make sure that the log files you want to forward (and any intermediary directory in its path) are readable by the user running nri-agent. Example: Check file access under Linux Let's check whether the file /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log can be monitored by the nri-agent user. In Linux, you can do a quick check with the namei command: sudo -u nri-agent namei -ml /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log f: /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log drwxr-xr-x root root / drwxr-xr-x root root var drwxrwxr-x root syslog log drwxr--r-- root root restrictedLogs logFile.log - No such file or directory Copy This command failed because the file is not visible to the nri-agent user. By inspecting the previous output, we can detect that the restrictedLogs directory is missing the execution flag for others. To fix this, execute: sudo chmod 755 /var/log/restrictedLogs Copy And then check for file access again: # sudo -u nri-agent namei -ml /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log f: /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log drwxr-xr-x root root / drwxr-xr-x root root var drwxrwxr-x root syslog log drwxr-xr-x root root restrictedLogs -rw-r----- vagrant vagrant logFile.log Copy The file is now visible to the nri-agent user. You must ensure that the file is also readable by the nri-agent user. To check this, use: # sudo -u nri-agent head /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log head: cannot open '/var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log' for reading: Permission denied Copy In this example, the file is missing the read rights for the others group (users other than vagrant and the vagrant user group). You could fix this by granting read permissions to others, but the application could change these permissions upon restart. To avoid this, a better approach is to add the nri-agent user to the vagrant user group. No data appears when capturing via a Syslog socket The log forwarding feature requires that the agent has permission to read the data sources. When running the infrastructure agent in privileged or non-privileged modes: If you're using Unix domain socket files, make sure that the nri-agent user can access these files (please refer to the previous section) and that they have read and write permissions (666) so that other users than nri-agent can write to them. If you're using IP sockets, ensure that the port that you are using is not a system reserved one (like port 80, for example). If no data appears after you enable log management, follow standard log management troubleshooting procedures. No data appears using infrastructure agent proxy As explained in the infrastructure agent configuration guidelines, the proxy parameter must use either HTTP or HTTPS and be in the form https://user:password@hostname:port. The agent can parse the parameter without the HTTP or HTTPS, but the log forwarder cannot. You will see an error like the following in the agent verbose logs: [ERROR] building HTTP transport: parse \\\"hostname:port\\\": first path segment in URL cannot contain colon Copy To solve this problem, check your newrelic-infra.yml file, and ensure the proxy parameter adheres to this form. If you're using caBundleFile or caBundleDir in order to specify any certificate, we recommend to follow the below rules for each OS: Linux For HTTP proxies you don't need to setup any certificates. The plugin loads the system certificates and New Relic sends logs into the logging endpoint. However, you can specify the proxy self-signed certificate (PEM file) using either the caBundleFile or caBundleDir parameters. Windows For HTTP proxies you don't need to setup any certificates. The plugin loads the system certificates. For HTTPS, you can configure it in one of the following ways: Import the proxy certificate to the system pool (Recommended) Import the proxy self-signed certificate (PEM file) by using the MMC tool. Refer to this link, and in Step 2 ensure to import it in your Trusted Root Certification Authorities, instead of in the Intermediate Certification Authorities. Using the caBundleFile and caBundleDir parameters On Windows, we cannot load both the certificates from the system certificate pool and the ones specified with the caBundleFile caBundleDir parameters. So, if you are using caBundleFile or caBundleDir, ensure that the following certificates are placed in the same PEM file (when using caBundleFile) or in the same directory (when using caBundleDir): The Proxy certificate (because it's an HTTPS proxy). The Logging Endpoint certificate (eg. https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1). The Infrastructure Agent certificate (eg. https://infra-api.newrelic.com). You can check the certificates by running: # openssl s_client -connect log-api.newrelic.com:443 -servername log-api.newrelic.com Copy Sending the infrastructure agent's logs to New Relic You can configure the infrastructure agent to send its own logs to New Relic. This is useful for troubleshooting issues with log forwarding, the agent, or when contacting support. To forward the infrastructure agent logs to New Relic: Edit your newrelic-infra.yml file. Enable agent logging in troubleshooting mode by adding verbose: 3. On Windows and systems that don't use systemd or where journald is inaccessible, verbose:3 causes the agent to write the logs on the disk. Revert to verbose:0 to prevent this. (Recommended): Enable agent logging in JSON format to log_format: json. Restart the agent to load the new settings. This configuration sets up the agent in troubleshooting mode, but the log forwarder (based on Fluent Bit) will continue in a non-verbose mode. Sometimes you can have issues with the log forwarder itself. For example, there may be problems accessing a specific channel when shipping Windows log events or when accessing a particular log file. In these situations, you can also enable the verbose mode for the log forwarder: Set verbose to a value other than 0. Add the configuration option: trace: [\"log.fw\"]. Caution Check whether you are using the [fluentbit] option. When setting verbose: 3 and trace: [\"log.fw\"], ensure that you don't define any [OUTPUT] section pointing to stdout in an external Fluent Bit configuration file, Fluent Bit does not start with the infra agent Important Fluent Bit's tail plugin does not support network drives. For Linux versions prior to 2016, you may need to update the OpenSSL library to 1.1.0 (or higher). To check if you have this problem: See if infra-agent has started Fluent Bit by running: ps -aux | grep fluent-bi Copy If it isn't running go to /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/logging and run: ./fluent-bit -i systemd -o stdout Copy If you get the following error, update OpenSSL to 1.1.0 or higher: error while loading shared libraries: libssl.so.1.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory Copy Runtime error on Windows One of the following error messages may appear when enabling log forwarding on Windows: The code execution cannot proceed because VCRUNTIME140.dll was not found. Copy OR error=\"exit status 3221225781\" process=log-forwarder Copy This is caused by a missing DLL. To solve the issue, install the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable as applicable: x64 x86 Errors when tailing a large amount of log files (Linux) It's common to face either one of the following error messages when attempting to tail a large amount of files: Too many open files The user limit on the total number of inotify watches was reached or the kernel failed to allocate a needed resource The operating system defines a maximum amount of allocatable file descriptors (typically 1024 by default), and a maximum amount of allocatable inotify watches (typically 8192 by default). Any process attempting to go above these limits will fail, returning one of the errors above. The underlying technology we use to forward logs, Fluent Bit, opens one file descriptor and sets an inotify watch for each file you configure to be forwarded. Moreover, at the time of writing this section, Fluent Bit uses an extra set of 32 file descriptors for its normal operation, with another extra file descriptor when it shuts down. Therefore, to capture a large amount of files you need to ensure that both the file descriptor and inotify watch limits are slightly greater than the amount of log files you wish to tail. The following instructions summarize how to increase these limits if you want to tail 10,000 log files. Also, it assumes the infrastructure agent is installed in root running mode, and therefore must be run using the root user. Check which is the current hard limit for the amount of file descriptors per process. Typically, this limit should be quite high and should not need to be modified. ulimit -Hn Copy Add the following line to /etc/security/limits.conf. We specified a limit of 10100 here instead of just 10000 to allow Fluent Bit to allocate the extra file descriptors it may need to work. root soft nofile 10100 # replace root by nri-agent for non-root (privileged and unprivileged) installations Copy Add the following line to /etc/pam.d/common-session so that the previous limit is applied upon restart: session required pam_limits.so Copy Add the following line to /etc/sysctl.conf to increase the amount of allowed inotify watchers per user. We specified a limit of 18192 here instead of just 10000 so that the root user will still have 8192 available inotify watches (the default value). fs.inotify.max_user_watches=18192 Copy Restart your system. Ensure that the new limits have been enforced by running: ulimit -Sn # Should return 10100 cat /proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_watches # Should return 18192 Copy Learn more on how to increase open file limits, or on how to increase the inotify watches. Uninstall log forwarding To uninstall log forwarding capabilities, go to your logging.d directory, and remove files with the .yml extension that were originally added during the configuration process.

      "body": "You can forward your logs to New Relic using our infrastructure monitoring agent. This makes all of your logging data available in one location and provides deeper visibility into both your application and your platform performance data. Forwarding your logs to New Relic will give you enhanced log management capabilities to collect, process, explore, query, and alert on your log data. Basic process To forward your logs through our infrastructure monitoring agent: If you haven't already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Verify the system requirements needed for configuring logs. Ensure you have installed the infrastructure agent, version 1.11.4 or higher. Create a logging.yml configuration file in the infrastructure agent's logging.d directory. Configure your log sources and other parameters. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your account for data. Explore your log data in the Logs UI and benefit from the log attributes automatically inserted by the infrastructure agent. Here is an example of where you can see logs in context of your infrastructure monitoring details in New Relic One. System requirements To use the log forwarder of the infrastructure agent, make sure you meet the following requirements: Infrastructure agent version 1.11.4 or higher OpenSSL library 1.1.0 or higher is required by Infrastructure agent starting from 1.16.4. Built-in support for ARM64 architecture on Linux systems (in example, AWS Graviton architecture) added in Infrastructure agent 1.26.0. Important The log forwarding feature is not supported with the Docker container for infrastructure monitoring agents. The log forwarding feature is compatible with the following operating systems: Operating system Supported version Amazon Linux Amazon Linux 2 CentOS Version 7 or higher Debian Version 9 (\"Stretch\") or higher Exception: Version 11 is not supported. Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) Version 7 or higher SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) Version 12 Ubuntu Versions 16.04.x, 18.04.x and 20.04.x (LTS versions) Windows Windows Server 2012, 2016, and 2019, and their service packs. Windows 10 Install the infrastructure agent Starting with version 1.11.4, the infrastructure agent can forward logs to New Relic. To install and run the agent, use a package manager (Linux) or the MSI installer (Windows). Important The log forwarding feature is not included when the infrastructure agent is implemented using Linux tarball or Windows ZIP installations. To use the following links, make sure you are logged to your New Relic account. Amazon Linux CentOS Debian RHEL SLES Ubuntu Windows If you don't have a New Relic account yet, or if you prefer to follow the procedure manually, see our tutorial to install the package manager. Configure the infrastructure agent Configuration files describe which log sources are forwarded. Our infrastructure agent uses .yml files to configure logging. You can add as many config files as you want. To add a new configuration file for the log forwarding feature: Navigate to the log forwarder configuration folder: Linux: /etc/newrelic-infra/logging.d/ Windows: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\logging.d\\ Create a logging.yml configuration file, and add the parameters you need. The logging.d directory has various .yml.example files you can use as a reference or starting point. The agent automatically processes new configuration files without having to restart the infrastructure monitoring service. The only exception to this is when configuring a custom Fluent Bit configuration. Log forwarding parameters The infrastructure log forwarding .yml config supports the following parameters: Name (required) To start, define a name of the log or logs you want to forward to New Relic. Log source (required) What you use for the log source will depend on where you want to forward your logs from. Available options include: file Path to the log file or files. The agent tracks changes on the log files in a way similar to tail -f shell. Example: logs: - name: example-log file: /var/log/example.log # Path to a single log file - name: example-log-two file: /var/log/example-two.log # Path to another single log file Copy The file parameter can point to a specific log file or multiple files by using wildcards applied to names and extensions; for example, /logs/*.log. You can use wildcards in place of directories in a file path, which can be used to tail files located in different directories. Example: logs: - name: docker-logs file: /var/lib/docker/containers/*/*.log # Path to multiple folders and files Copy Important Use of wildcards may significantly increase the number of file descriptors and inotify watches the Fluent Bit process keeps open, which can interfere with log collection if the host's file descriptor limit is reached. Tailing a large number of files may require you to increase the maximum number of file descriptors and inotify watchers allowed by the operating system. Please refer to Errors when tailing a large amount of log files for more details on how to increase them. systemd Use the systemd parameter to forward log messages that are collected by the journald daemon in Linux environments. This input type requires the agent to run in root mode. Example: logs: - name: systemd-example systemd: cupsd Copy syslog Syslog data source. Parameters: uri: Syslog socket. Format varies depending on the protocol: TCP/UDP network sockets: [tcp/udp]://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT Unix domain sockets: unix_[tcp/udp]:// + /socket/path parser: Syslog parser. Default is rfc3164. Use rfc5424 if your messages include fractional seconds. Note: rfc3164 currently does not work on SuSE. unix_permissions: default is 0644 for domain sockets; this limits entries to processes running as root. You can use 0666 to listen for non-root processes, at your own risk. When running the agent in privileged mode, ports and sockets must be available or owned by nri-agent, with 0666 file permissions, so that other processes can write logs to the sockets. logs: # TCP network socket - name: syslog-tcp-test syslog: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:5140 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format parser: rfc5424 # Default syslog parser is rfc3164 # UDP network socket - name: syslog-udp-test syslog: uri: udp://0.0.0.0:6140 # Use the udp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format max_line_kb: 35 # Unix TCP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-tcp-test syslog: uri: unix_tcp:///var/unix-tcp-socket-test unix_permissions: 0666 # Default is 0644. Change at your own risk # Unix UDP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-udp-test syslog: uri: unix_udp:///var/unix-udp-socket-test parser: rfc5424 Copy tcp Logs retrieved over TCP connections. Parameters: uri: TCP/IP socket to listen for incoming data. The URI format is tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format: format of the data. It can be json or none. separator: If format: none is used, you can define a separator string for splitting records (default: \\n). logs: - name: tcp-simple-test tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:1234 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format format: none # Raw text - this is default for 'tcp' separator: \\t # String for separating raw text entries max_line_kb: 32 - name: tcp-json-test tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:2345 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format format: json Copy winlog Collect events from Windows log channels. Parameters: channel: name of the channel logs will be collected from. collect-eventids: a list of Windows Event IDs to be collected and forwarded to New Relic. Event ID ranges are supported. exclude-eventids: a list of Windows Event IDs to be excluded from collection. Event ID ranges are supported. All events are collected from the specified channel by default. Configure the collect-eventids and exclude-eventids sections to avoid sending unwanted logs to your New Relic account. Add event IDs or ranges to collect-eventids or exclude-eventids to forward or drop specific events. exclude-eventids takes precedence over collect-eventids if the same event ID is present in both sections. Example: logs: # Winlog log ingestion with eventId filters. - name: windows-security winlog: channel: Security collect-eventids: - 4624 - 4265 - 4700-4800 exclude-eventids: - 4735 # entries for the application, system, powershell, and SCOM channels - name: windows-application winlog: channel: Application - name: windows-system winlog: channel: System - name: windows-pshell winlog: channel: Windows Powershell - name: scom winlog: channel: Operations Manager # Entry for Windows Defender Logs - name: windows-defender winlog: channel: Microsoft-Windows-Windows Defender/Operational # Entry for Windows Clustering Logs - name: windows-clustering winlog: channel: Microsoft-Windows-FailoverClustering/Operational # Entry for IIS logs with logtype attribute for automatic parsing - name: iis-log file: C:\\inetpub\\logs\\LogFiles\\w3svc.log attributes: logtype: iis_w3c Copy Optional configuration The following configuration parameters are not required but are still recommended. attributes List of custom attributes specified as key-value pairs that can be used to send additional data with the logs which you can then query. The attributes configuration parameter can be used with any log source. One common use of the attributes configuration parameter is to specify the logtype attribute. This attribute allows leveraging one of the built-in parsing rules supported by New Relic Logs. Example: logs: - name: example-file-attributes file: /var/log/example.log attributes: logtype: nginx region: example-us-02 team: A-team - name: example-tcp-attributes tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:2345 format: json attributes: logtype: nginx region: example-us-02 team: B-team Copy attributes automatically inserted by the infrastructure agent The infrastructure agent automatically inserts log attributes for your convenience. Some of them are inserted for any log record, while others depend on the configuration parameters you used while setting up the log forwarder. Attribute name Description entity.guids Always inserted. The infrastructure agent inserts the Entity GUID assigned by New Relic to identify the host where it's running. It is available in the entity.guids field. Note: If the captured logs belong to an application instrumented using APM, the entity.guids field contains both the entity GUID of infrastructure, as well as the GUID of APM, separated by a pipe ( | ) delimiter. fb.input Always inserted. The underlying Fluent Bit input plugin type used to capture the logs. Currently its values are tail, systemd, winlog, syslog, and tcp. filePath Inserted when sing the file input type. Absolute file path of the file being monitored. hostname Always inserted. The hostname of the machine/VM/container executing the infrastructure agent. plugin.type Always inserted. Indicates the utility used to capture the logs. In this case, it is the infrastructure agent itself, so this attribute always has the value nri-agent. pattern Regular expression for filtering records. Only supported for the tail, systemd, syslog, and tcp (only with format none) sources. This field works in a way similar to grep -E in Unix systems. For example, for a given file being captured, you can filter for records containing either WARN or ERROR using: - name: only-records-with-warn-and-error file: /var/log/logFile.log pattern: WARN|ERROR Copy No filtering is applied by default. max_line_kb Maximum size of log entries/lines in KB. If log entries exceed the limit, they are skipped. Default is 128. fluentbit External Fluent Bit configuration and parser files. If defined, they are merged with the existing configuration and parser files generated by the infrastructure agent. The infrastructure agent processes the configuration files located in the logging.d directory and will generate a run-time Fluent Bit configuration file that contains the appropriate [INPUT], [FILTER] and [OUTPUT] sections. Optionally, it will also declare an @INCLUDE in case you provided an external Fluent Bit configuration file via the fluentbit option. The runtime file does not define a [SERVICE] section, leaving all default Fluent Bit configuration values. You can still override Fluent Bit's default settings by defining your own [SERVICE] section in your external Fluent Bit configuration file and include it via the fluentbit option. Parameters: config_file: path to an existing Fluent Bit configuration file. Note that any overlapping source results in duplicate messages in New Relic Logs. parsers_file: path to an existing Fluent Bit parsers file. The following parser names are reserved: rfc3164, rfc3164-local and rfc5424. Sample configuration file Here is an example of a logging.d/ configuration file in YAML format. For more configuration examples, see the infrastructure agent repository. logging.d/sample.yaml # Remember to only use spaces for indentation logs: # Example of 'file' source - name: file-with-attributes file: /var/log/test.log # Path to a single file or pattern attributes: # You can use custom attributes to enrich your data logtype: nginx team: The A Team pattern: Error # Regular expression to filter log entries # Example of 'systemd' source (Linux only) - name: systemd-example systemd: cupsd # Examples of 'syslog' source, one per protocol # TCP network socket - name: syslog-tcp-test syslog: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:5140 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format parser: rfc5424 # Default syslog parser is rfc3164 # UDP network socket - name: syslog-udp-test syslog: uri: udp://0.0.0.0:6140 # Use the udp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format max_line_kb: 35 # Paths for Unix sockets are defined by combining protocol and path: # unix_udp:// + /path/socket - for example, unix_udp:///tmp/socket # Unix TCP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-tcp-test syslog: uri: unix_tcp:///var/unix-tcp-socket-test unix_permissions: 0666 # Default is 0644.

For example, you can execute a query like this: SELECT * FROM Log Copy Troubleshooting If you encounter problems with configuring your log forwarder, try these troubleshooting tips. No log data If no data appears after you enable our log management capabilities, follow our standard log troubleshooting procedures. No data appears when tailing a file The log forwarding feature requires the agent to have permission to read the data sources. When running the infrastructure agent in privileged or non-privileged modes, make sure that the log files you want to forward (and any intermediary directory in its path) are readable by the user running nri-agent. Example: Check file access under Linux Let's check whether the file /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log can be monitored by the nri-agent user. In Linux, you can do a quick check with the namei command: sudo -u nri-agent namei -ml /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log f: /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log drwxr-xr-x root root / drwxr-xr-x root root var drwxrwxr-x root syslog log drwxr--r-- root root restrictedLogs logFile.log - No such file or directory Copy This command failed because the file is not visible to the nri-agent user. By inspecting the previous output, we can detect that the restrictedLogs directory is missing the execution flag for others. To fix this, execute: sudo chmod 755 /var/log/restrictedLogs Copy And then check for file access again: # sudo -u nri-agent namei -ml /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log f: /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log drwxr-xr-x root root / drwxr-xr-x root root var drwxrwxr-x root syslog log drwxr-xr-x root root restrictedLogs -rw-r----- vagrant vagrant logFile.log Copy The file is now visible to the nri-agent user. You must ensure that the file is also readable by the nri-agent user. To check this, use: # sudo -u nri-agent head /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log head: cannot open '/var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log' for reading: Permission denied Copy In this example, the file is missing the read rights for the others group (users other than vagrant and the vagrant user group). You could fix this by granting read permissions to others, but the application could change these permissions upon restart. To avoid this, a better approach is to add the nri-agent user to the vagrant user group. No data appears when capturing via a Syslog socket The log forwarding feature requires that the agent has permission to read the data sources. When running the infrastructure agent in privileged or non-privileged modes: If you're using Unix domain socket files, make sure that the nri-agent user can access these files (please refer to the previous section) and that they have read and write permissions (666) so that other users than nri-agent can write to them. If you're using IP sockets, ensure that the port that you are using is not a system reserved one (like port 80, for example). If no data appears after you enable log management, follow standard log management troubleshooting procedures. No data appears using infrastructure agent proxy As explained in the infrastructure agent configuration guidelines, the proxy parameter must use either HTTP or HTTPS and be in the form https://user:password@hostname:port. The agent can parse the parameter without the HTTP or HTTPS, but the log forwarder cannot. You will see an error like the following in the agent verbose logs: [ERROR] building HTTP transport: parse \\\"hostname:port\\\": first path segment in URL cannot contain colon Copy To solve this problem, check your newrelic-infra.yml file, and ensure the proxy parameter adheres to this form. If you're using caBundleFile or caBundleDir in order to specify any certificate, we recommend to follow the below rules for each OS: Linux For HTTP proxies you don't need to setup any certificates. The plugin loads the system certificates and New Relic sends logs into the logging endpoint. However, you can specify the proxy self-signed certificate (PEM file) using either the caBundleFile or caBundleDir parameters. Windows For HTTP proxies you don't need to setup any certificates. The plugin loads the system certificates. For HTTPS, you can configure it in one of the following ways: Import the proxy certificate to the system pool (Recommended) Import the proxy self-signed certificate (PEM file) by using the MMC tool. Refer to this link, and in Step 2 ensure to import it in your Trusted Root Certification Authorities, instead of in the Intermediate Certification Authorities. Using the caBundleFile and caBundleDir parameters On Windows, we cannot load both the certificates from the system certificate pool and the ones specified with the caBundleFile caBundleDir parameters. So, if you are using caBundleFile or caBundleDir, ensure that the following certificates are placed in the same PEM file (when using caBundleFile) or in the same directory (when using caBundleDir): The Proxy certificate (because it's an HTTPS proxy). The Logging Endpoint certificate (eg. https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1). The Infrastructure Agent certificate (eg. https://infra-api.newrelic.com). You can check the certificates by running: # openssl s_client -connect log-api.newrelic.com:443 -servername log-api.newrelic.com Copy Sending the infrastructure agent's logs to New Relic You can configure the infrastructure agent to send its own logs to New Relic. This is useful for troubleshooting issues with log forwarding, the agent, or when contacting support. To forward the infrastructure agent logs to New Relic: Edit your newrelic-infra.yml file. Enable agent logging in troubleshooting mode by adding verbose: 3. On Windows and systems that don't use systemd or where journald is inaccessible, verbose:3 causes the agent to write the logs on the disk. Revert to verbose:0 to prevent this. (Recommended): Enable agent logging in JSON format to log_format: json. Restart the agent to load the new settings. This configuration sets up the agent in troubleshooting mode, but the log forwarder (based on Fluent Bit) will continue in a non-verbose mode. Sometimes you can have issues with the log forwarder itself. For example, there may be problems accessing a specific channel when shipping Windows log events or when accessing a particular log file. In these situations, you can also enable the verbose mode for the log forwarder: Set verbose to a value other than 0. Add the configuration option: trace: [\"log.fw\"]. Caution Check whether you are using the [fluentbit] option. When setting verbose: 3 and trace: [\"log.fw\"], ensure that you don't define any [OUTPUT] section pointing to stdout in an external Fluent Bit configuration file, Fluent Bit does not start with the infra agent Important Fluent Bit's tail plugin does not support network drives. For Linux versions prior to 2016, you may need to update the OpenSSL library to 1.1.0 (or higher). To check if you have this problem: See if infra-agent has started Fluent Bit by running: ps -aux | grep fluent-bi Copy If it isn't running go to /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/logging and run: ./fluent-bit -i systemd -o stdout Copy If you get the following error, update OpenSSL to 1.1.0 or higher: error while loading shared libraries: libssl.so.1.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory Copy Runtime error on Windows One of the following error messages may appear when enabling log forwarding on Windows: The code execution cannot proceed because VCRUNTIME140.dll was not found. Copy OR error=\"exit status 3221225781\" process=log-forwarder Copy This is caused by a missing DLL. To solve the issue, install the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable as applicable: x64 x86 Errors when tailing a large amount of log files (Linux) It's common to face either one of the following error messages when attempting to tail a large amount of files: Too many open files The user limit on the total number of inotify watches was reached or the kernel failed to allocate a needed resource The operating system defines a maximum amount of allocatable file descriptors (typically 1024 by default), and a maximum amount of allocatable inotify watches (typically 8192 by default). Any process attempting to go above these limits will fail, returning one of the errors above. The underlying technology we use to forward logs, Fluent Bit, opens one file descriptor and sets an inotify watch for each file you configure to be forwarded. Moreover, at the time of writing this section, Fluent Bit uses an extra set of 32 file descriptors for its normal operation, with another extra file descriptor when it shuts down. Therefore, to capture a large amount of files you need to ensure that both the file descriptor and inotify watch limits are slightly greater than the amount of log files you wish to tail. The following instructions summarize how to increase these limits if you want to tail 10,000 log files. Also, it assumes the infrastructure agent is installed in root running mode, and therefore must be run using the root user. Check which is the current hard limit for the amount of file descriptors per process. Typically, this limit should be quite high and should not need to be modified. ulimit -Hn Copy Add the following line to /etc/security/limits.conf. We specified a limit of 10100 here instead of just 10000 to allow Fluent Bit to allocate the extra file descriptors it may need to work. root soft nofile 10100 # replace root by nri-agent for non-root (privileged and unprivileged) installations Copy Add the following line to /etc/pam.d/common-session so that the previous limit is applied upon restart: session required pam_limits.so Copy Add the following line to /etc/sysctl.conf to increase the amount of allowed inotify watchers per user. We specified a limit of 18192 here instead of just 10000 so that the root user will still have 8192 available inotify watches (the default value). fs.inotify.max_user_watches=18192 Copy Restart your system. Ensure that the new limits have been enforced by running: ulimit -Sn # Should return 10100 cat /proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_watches # Should return 18192 Copy Learn more on how to increase open file limits, or on how to increase the inotify watches. Uninstall log forwarding To uninstall log forwarding capabilities, go to your logging.d directory, and remove files with the .yml extension that were originally added during the configuration process.

      "body": "You can send your Amazon CloudWatch logs to New Relic using our AWS Lambda function, newrelic-log-ingestion. This can be easily deployed from the AWS Serverless application repository. Forwarding your CloudWatch logs to New Relic will give you enhanced log management capabilities to collect, process, explore, query, and alert on your log data. Install and configure the Cloudwatch logs Lambda function The following setup shows one approach for configuring environment variables. You can also configure them from the Functions page. Complete the following: Make sure you have a New Relic license key. Open the AWS Serverless Application Repository in your browser. Search for newrelic and check Show apps that create custom IAM roles or resource policies to find newrelic-log-ingestion. Open the newrelic-log-ingestion details and click Deploy. In the function's Configure menu, go to Environment Variables and configure log forwarding using the following environment variables: Key Description DEBUG_LOGGING_ENABLED A boolean to determine if you want to output debug messages in the CloudWatch console. Optional. To turn on debug logs, set this to true. Default is false. LICENSE_KEY New Relic license key is used for sending data to New Relic. Required. LOGGING_ENABLED Determines if logs are forwarded to New Relic. Required. To turn on logging, set this to true. NR_LOGGING_ENDPOINT New Relic ingestion endpoint for logs. Required. Two endpoints are available: US: https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 EU: https://log-api.eu.newrelic.com/log/v1 NR_TAGS Specify tags to be added to all log events. Optional. Each tag is composed of a colon-delimited key and value. Multiple key-value pairs are semicolon-delimited; for example, env:prod;team:myTeam. Acknowledge that the app creates custom IAM roles, and then click Deploy. Once the process completes, create a Lambda trigger to link your Lambda function to CloudWatch logs. Create a Lambda trigger To get your logs streaming to New Relic, attach a trigger to the Lambda: From the left side menu, select Functions. Find and select the previously created newrelic-log-ingestion function. Under Designer, click Add Triggers, and select Cloudwatch Logs from the dropdown. Select the the appropriate Log group for your application. Enter a name for your filter. Optional: Enter a filter pattern. Check the Enable trigger checkbox, then click Add to create the trigger. Configure retries (optional) You can configure the number of retries you want to perform in case the function fails to send the data in case of communication issues. Recommended number is 3 retries, but you can change the retry behavior by changing the below parameters: Tip The more the number of retries there are can make the function run for longer times. This increases the probability of having higher costs for Lambda. However, decreasing the number of retries could increase the probability of data loss. MAX_RETRIES = 3 # Defines the number of retries after lambda failure to deliver data INITIAL_BACKOFF = 1 # Defines the initial wait seconds until next retry is executed BACKOFF_MULTIPLIER = 2 # Time multiplier between the retries As an example, in default above configuration, first retry will happen after 1 second, second retry after 2 seconds and third retry will happen after 4 seconds. Copy Resources created by the SAM template When you create the application from the repository, the following resources are also created: The Lambda function itself A role used to give execution permissions to the Lambda function based in CloudWatch Logs. All other Lambda configurations not listed can be left as the defaults.

      "body": "You can forward your logs to New Relic using our infrastructure monitoring agent. This makes all of your logging data available in one location and provides deeper visibility into both your application and your platform performance data. Forwarding your logs to New Relic will give you enhanced log management capabilities to collect, process, explore, query, and alert on your log data. Basic process To forward your logs through our infrastructure monitoring agent: If you haven't already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Verify the system requirements needed for configuring logs. Ensure you have installed the infrastructure agent, version 1.11.4 or higher. Create a logging.yml configuration file in the infrastructure agent's logging.d directory. Configure your log sources and other parameters. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your account for data. Explore your log data in the Logs UI and benefit from the log attributes automatically inserted by the infrastructure agent. Here is an example of where you can see logs in context of your infrastructure monitoring details in New Relic One. System requirements To use the log forwarder of the infrastructure agent, make sure you meet the following requirements: Infrastructure agent version 1.11.4 or higher OpenSSL library 1.1.0 or higher is required by Infrastructure agent starting from 1.16.4. Built-in support for ARM64 architecture on Linux systems (in example, AWS Graviton architecture) added in Infrastructure agent 1.26.0. Important The log forwarding feature is not supported with the Docker container for infrastructure monitoring agents. The log forwarding feature is compatible with the following operating systems: Operating system Supported version Amazon Linux Amazon Linux 2 CentOS Version 7 or higher Debian Version 9 (\"Stretch\") or higher Exception: Version 11 is not supported. Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) Version 7 or higher SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) Version 12 Ubuntu Versions 16.04.x, 18.04.x and 20.04.x (LTS versions) Windows Windows Server 2012, 2016, and 2019, and their service packs. Windows 10 Install the infrastructure agent Starting with version 1.11.4, the infrastructure agent can forward logs to New Relic. To install and run the agent, use a package manager (Linux) or the MSI installer (Windows). Important The log forwarding feature is not included when the infrastructure agent is implemented using Linux tarball or Windows ZIP installations. To use the following links, make sure you are logged to your New Relic account. Amazon Linux CentOS Debian RHEL SLES Ubuntu Windows If you don't have a New Relic account yet, or if you prefer to follow the procedure manually, see our tutorial to install the package manager. Configure the infrastructure agent Configuration files describe which log sources are forwarded. Our infrastructure agent uses .yml files to configure logging. You can add as many config files as you want. To add a new configuration file for the log forwarding feature: Navigate to the log forwarder configuration folder: Linux: /etc/newrelic-infra/logging.d/ Windows: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\logging.d\\ Create a logging.yml configuration file, and add the parameters you need. The logging.d directory has various .yml.example files you can use as a reference or starting point. The agent automatically processes new configuration files without having to restart the infrastructure monitoring service. The only exception to this is when configuring a custom Fluent Bit configuration. Log forwarding parameters The infrastructure log forwarding .yml config supports the following parameters: Name (required) To start, define a name of the log or logs you want to forward to New Relic. Log source (required) What you use for the log source will depend on where you want to forward your logs from. Available options include: file Path to the log file or files. The agent tracks changes on the log files in a way similar to tail -f shell. Example: logs: - name: example-log file: /var/log/example.log # Path to a single log file - name: example-log-two file: /var/log/example-two.log # Path to another single log file Copy The file parameter can point to a specific log file or multiple files by using wildcards applied to names and extensions; for example, /logs/*.log. You can use wildcards in place of directories in a file path, which can be used to tail files located in different directories. Example: logs: - name: docker-logs file: /var/lib/docker/containers/*/*.log # Path to multiple folders and files Copy Important Use of wildcards may significantly increase the number of file descriptors and inotify watches the Fluent Bit process keeps open, which can interfere with log collection if the host's file descriptor limit is reached. Tailing a large number of files may require you to increase the maximum number of file descriptors and inotify watchers allowed by the operating system. Please refer to Errors when tailing a large amount of log files for more details on how to increase them. systemd Use the systemd parameter to forward log messages that are collected by the journald daemon in Linux environments. This input type requires the agent to run in root mode. Example: logs: - name: systemd-example systemd: cupsd Copy syslog Syslog data source. Parameters: uri: Syslog socket. Format varies depending on the protocol: TCP/UDP network sockets: [tcp/udp]://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT Unix domain sockets: unix_[tcp/udp]:// + /socket/path parser: Syslog parser. Default is rfc3164. Use rfc5424 if your messages include fractional seconds. Note: rfc3164 currently does not work on SuSE. unix_permissions: default is 0644 for domain sockets; this limits entries to processes running as root. You can use 0666 to listen for non-root processes, at your own risk. When running the agent in privileged mode, ports and sockets must be available or owned by nri-agent, with 0666 file permissions, so that other processes can write logs to the sockets. logs: # TCP network socket - name: syslog-tcp-test syslog: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:5140 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format parser: rfc5424 # Default syslog parser is rfc3164 # UDP network socket - name: syslog-udp-test syslog: uri: udp://0.0.0.0:6140 # Use the udp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format max_line_kb: 35 # Unix TCP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-tcp-test syslog: uri: unix_tcp:///var/unix-tcp-socket-test unix_permissions: 0666 # Default is 0644. Change at your own risk # Unix UDP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-udp-test syslog: uri: unix_udp:///var/unix-udp-socket-test parser: rfc5424 Copy tcp Logs retrieved over TCP connections. Parameters: uri: TCP/IP socket to listen for incoming data. The URI format is tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format: format of the data. It can be json or none. separator: If format: none is used, you can define a separator string for splitting records (default: \\n). logs: - name: tcp-simple-test tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:1234 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format format: none # Raw text - this is default for 'tcp' separator: \\t # String for separating raw text entries max_line_kb: 32 - name: tcp-json-test tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:2345 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format format: json Copy winlog Collect events from Windows log channels. Parameters: channel: name of the channel logs will be collected from. collect-eventids: a list of Windows Event IDs to be collected and forwarded to New Relic. Event ID ranges are supported. exclude-eventids: a list of Windows Event IDs to be excluded from collection. Event ID ranges are supported. All events are collected from the specified channel by default. Configure the collect-eventids and exclude-eventids sections to avoid sending unwanted logs to your New Relic account. Add event IDs or ranges to collect-eventids or exclude-eventids to forward or drop specific events. exclude-eventids takes precedence over collect-eventids if the same event ID is present in both sections. Example: logs: # Winlog log ingestion with eventId filters. - name: windows-security winlog: channel: Security collect-eventids: - 4624 - 4265 - 4700-4800 exclude-eventids: - 4735 # entries for the application, system, powershell, and SCOM channels - name: windows-application winlog: channel: Application - name: windows-system winlog: channel: System - name: windows-pshell winlog: channel: Windows Powershell - name: scom winlog: channel: Operations Manager # Entry for Windows Defender Logs - name: windows-defender winlog: channel: Microsoft-Windows-Windows Defender/Operational # Entry for Windows Clustering Logs - name: windows-clustering winlog: channel: Microsoft-Windows-FailoverClustering/Operational # Entry for IIS logs with logtype attribute for automatic parsing - name: iis-log file: C:\\inetpub\\logs\\LogFiles\\w3svc.log attributes: logtype: iis_w3c Copy Optional configuration The following configuration parameters are not required but are still recommended. attributes List of custom attributes specified as key-value pairs that can be used to send additional data with the logs which you can then query. The attributes configuration parameter can be used with any log source. One common use of the attributes configuration parameter is to specify the logtype attribute. This attribute allows leveraging one of the built-in parsing rules supported by New Relic Logs. Example: logs: - name: example-file-attributes file: /var/log/example.log attributes: logtype: nginx region: example-us-02 team: A-team - name: example-tcp-attributes tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:2345 format: json attributes: logtype: nginx region: example-us-02 team: B-team Copy attributes automatically inserted by the infrastructure agent The infrastructure agent automatically inserts log attributes for your convenience. Some of them are inserted for any log record, while others depend on the configuration parameters you used while setting up the log forwarder. Attribute name Description entity.guids Always inserted. The infrastructure agent inserts the Entity GUID assigned by New Relic to identify the host where it's running. It is available in the entity.guids field. Note: If the captured logs belong to an application instrumented using APM, the entity.guids field contains both the entity GUID of infrastructure, as well as the GUID of APM, separated by a pipe ( | ) delimiter. fb.input Always inserted. The underlying Fluent Bit input plugin type used to capture the logs. Currently its values are tail, systemd, winlog, syslog, and tcp. filePath Inserted when sing the file input type. Absolute file path of the file being monitored. hostname Always inserted. The hostname of the machine/VM/container executing the infrastructure agent. plugin.type Always inserted. Indicates the utility used to capture the logs. In this case, it is the infrastructure agent itself, so this attribute always has the value nri-agent. pattern Regular expression for filtering records. Only supported for the tail, systemd, syslog, and tcp (only with format none) sources. This field works in a way similar to grep -E in Unix systems. For example, for a given file being captured, you can filter for records containing either WARN or ERROR using: - name: only-records-with-warn-and-error file: /var/log/logFile.log pattern: WARN|ERROR Copy No filtering is applied by default. max_line_kb Maximum size of log entries/lines in KB. If log entries exceed the limit, they are skipped. Default is 128. fluentbit External Fluent Bit configuration and parser files. If defined, they are merged with the existing configuration and parser files generated by the infrastructure agent. The infrastructure agent processes the configuration files located in the logging.d directory and will generate a run-time Fluent Bit configuration file that contains the appropriate [INPUT], [FILTER] and [OUTPUT] sections. Optionally, it will also declare an @INCLUDE in case you provided an external Fluent Bit configuration file via the fluentbit option. The runtime file does not define a [SERVICE] section, leaving all default Fluent Bit configuration values. You can still override Fluent Bit's default settings by defining your own [SERVICE] section in your external Fluent Bit configuration file and include it via the fluentbit option. Parameters: config_file: path to an existing Fluent Bit configuration file. Note that any overlapping source results in duplicate messages in New Relic Logs. parsers_file: path to an existing Fluent Bit parsers file. The following parser names are reserved: rfc3164, rfc3164-local and rfc5424. Sample configuration file Here is an example of a logging.d/ configuration file in YAML format. For more configuration examples, see the infrastructure agent repository. logging.d/sample.yaml # Remember to only use spaces for indentation logs: # Example of 'file' source - name: file-with-attributes file: /var/log/test.log # Path to a single file or pattern attributes: # You can use custom attributes to enrich your data logtype: nginx team: The A Team pattern: Error # Regular expression to filter log entries # Example of 'systemd' source (Linux only) - name: systemd-example systemd: cupsd # Examples of 'syslog' source, one per protocol # TCP network socket - name: syslog-tcp-test syslog: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:5140 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format parser: rfc5424 # Default syslog parser is rfc3164 # UDP network socket - name: syslog-udp-test syslog: uri: udp://0.0.0.0:6140 # Use the udp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format max_line_kb: 35 # Paths for Unix sockets are defined by combining protocol and path: # unix_udp:// + /path/socket - for example, unix_udp:///tmp/socket # Unix TCP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-tcp-test syslog: uri: unix_tcp:///var/unix-tcp-socket-test unix_permissions: 0666 # Default is 0644.

For example, you can execute a query like this: SELECT * FROM Log Copy Troubleshooting If you encounter problems with configuring your log forwarder, try these troubleshooting tips. No log data If no data appears after you enable our log management capabilities, follow our standard log troubleshooting procedures. No data appears when tailing a file The log forwarding feature requires the agent to have permission to read the data sources. When running the infrastructure agent in privileged or non-privileged modes, make sure that the log files you want to forward (and any intermediary directory in its path) are readable by the user running nri-agent. Example: Check file access under Linux Let's check whether the file /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log can be monitored by the nri-agent user. In Linux, you can do a quick check with the namei command: sudo -u nri-agent namei -ml /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log f: /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log drwxr-xr-x root root / drwxr-xr-x root root var drwxrwxr-x root syslog log drwxr--r-- root root restrictedLogs logFile.log - No such file or directory Copy This command failed because the file is not visible to the nri-agent user. By inspecting the previous output, we can detect that the restrictedLogs directory is missing the execution flag for others. To fix this, execute: sudo chmod 755 /var/log/restrictedLogs Copy And then check for file access again: # sudo -u nri-agent namei -ml /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log f: /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log drwxr-xr-x root root / drwxr-xr-x root root var drwxrwxr-x root syslog log drwxr-xr-x root root restrictedLogs -rw-r----- vagrant vagrant logFile.log Copy The file is now visible to the nri-agent user. You must ensure that the file is also readable by the nri-agent user. To check this, use: # sudo -u nri-agent head /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log head: cannot open '/var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log' for reading: Permission denied Copy In this example, the file is missing the read rights for the others group (users other than vagrant and the vagrant user group). You could fix this by granting read permissions to others, but the application could change these permissions upon restart. To avoid this, a better approach is to add the nri-agent user to the vagrant user group. No data appears when capturing via a Syslog socket The log forwarding feature requires that the agent has permission to read the data sources. When running the infrastructure agent in privileged or non-privileged modes: If you're using Unix domain socket files, make sure that the nri-agent user can access these files (please refer to the previous section) and that they have read and write permissions (666) so that other users than nri-agent can write to them. If you're using IP sockets, ensure that the port that you are using is not a system reserved one (like port 80, for example). If no data appears after you enable log management, follow standard log management troubleshooting procedures. No data appears using infrastructure agent proxy As explained in the infrastructure agent configuration guidelines, the proxy parameter must use either HTTP or HTTPS and be in the form https://user:password@hostname:port. The agent can parse the parameter without the HTTP or HTTPS, but the log forwarder cannot. You will see an error like the following in the agent verbose logs: [ERROR] building HTTP transport: parse \\\"hostname:port\\\": first path segment in URL cannot contain colon Copy To solve this problem, check your newrelic-infra.yml file, and ensure the proxy parameter adheres to this form. If you're using caBundleFile or caBundleDir in order to specify any certificate, we recommend to follow the below rules for each OS: Linux For HTTP proxies you don't need to setup any certificates. The plugin loads the system certificates and New Relic sends logs into the logging endpoint. However, you can specify the proxy self-signed certificate (PEM file) using either the caBundleFile or caBundleDir parameters. Windows For HTTP proxies you don't need to setup any certificates. The plugin loads the system certificates. For HTTPS, you can configure it in one of the following ways: Import the proxy certificate to the system pool (Recommended) Import the proxy self-signed certificate (PEM file) by using the MMC tool. Refer to this link, and in Step 2 ensure to import it in your Trusted Root Certification Authorities, instead of in the Intermediate Certification Authorities. Using the caBundleFile and caBundleDir parameters On Windows, we cannot load both the certificates from the system certificate pool and the ones specified with the caBundleFile caBundleDir parameters. So, if you are using caBundleFile or caBundleDir, ensure that the following certificates are placed in the same PEM file (when using caBundleFile) or in the same directory (when using caBundleDir): The Proxy certificate (because it's an HTTPS proxy). The Logging Endpoint certificate (eg. https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1). The Infrastructure Agent certificate (eg. https://infra-api.newrelic.com). You can check the certificates by running: # openssl s_client -connect log-api.newrelic.com:443 -servername log-api.newrelic.com Copy Sending the infrastructure agent's logs to New Relic You can configure the infrastructure agent to send its own logs to New Relic. This is useful for troubleshooting issues with log forwarding, the agent, or when contacting support. To forward the infrastructure agent logs to New Relic: Edit your newrelic-infra.yml file. Enable agent logging in troubleshooting mode by adding verbose: 3. On Windows and systems that don't use systemd or where journald is inaccessible, verbose:3 causes the agent to write the logs on the disk. Revert to verbose:0 to prevent this. (Recommended): Enable agent logging in JSON format to log_format: json. Restart the agent to load the new settings. This configuration sets up the agent in troubleshooting mode, but the log forwarder (based on Fluent Bit) will continue in a non-verbose mode. Sometimes you can have issues with the log forwarder itself. For example, there may be problems accessing a specific channel when shipping Windows log events or when accessing a particular log file. In these situations, you can also enable the verbose mode for the log forwarder: Set verbose to a value other than 0. Add the configuration option: trace: [\"log.fw\"]. Caution Check whether you are using the [fluentbit] option. When setting verbose: 3 and trace: [\"log.fw\"], ensure that you don't define any [OUTPUT] section pointing to stdout in an external Fluent Bit configuration file, Fluent Bit does not start with the infra agent Important Fluent Bit's tail plugin does not support network drives. For Linux versions prior to 2016, you may need to update the OpenSSL library to 1.1.0 (or higher). To check if you have this problem: See if infra-agent has started Fluent Bit by running: ps -aux | grep fluent-bi Copy If it isn't running go to /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/logging and run: ./fluent-bit -i systemd -o stdout Copy If you get the following error, update OpenSSL to 1.1.0 or higher: error while loading shared libraries: libssl.so.1.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory Copy Runtime error on Windows One of the following error messages may appear when enabling log forwarding on Windows: The code execution cannot proceed because VCRUNTIME140.dll was not found. Copy OR error=\"exit status 3221225781\" process=log-forwarder Copy This is caused by a missing DLL. To solve the issue, install the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable as applicable: x64 x86 Errors when tailing a large amount of log files (Linux) It's common to face either one of the following error messages when attempting to tail a large amount of files: Too many open files The user limit on the total number of inotify watches was reached or the kernel failed to allocate a needed resource The operating system defines a maximum amount of allocatable file descriptors (typically 1024 by default), and a maximum amount of allocatable inotify watches (typically 8192 by default). Any process attempting to go above these limits will fail, returning one of the errors above. The underlying technology we use to forward logs, Fluent Bit, opens one file descriptor and sets an inotify watch for each file you configure to be forwarded. Moreover, at the time of writing this section, Fluent Bit uses an extra set of 32 file descriptors for its normal operation, with another extra file descriptor when it shuts down. Therefore, to capture a large amount of files you need to ensure that both the file descriptor and inotify watch limits are slightly greater than the amount of log files you wish to tail. The following instructions summarize how to increase these limits if you want to tail 10,000 log files. Also, it assumes the infrastructure agent is installed in root running mode, and therefore must be run using the root user. Check which is the current hard limit for the amount of file descriptors per process. Typically, this limit should be quite high and should not need to be modified. ulimit -Hn Copy Add the following line to /etc/security/limits.conf. We specified a limit of 10100 here instead of just 10000 to allow Fluent Bit to allocate the extra file descriptors it may need to work. root soft nofile 10100 # replace root by nri-agent for non-root (privileged and unprivileged) installations Copy Add the following line to /etc/pam.d/common-session so that the previous limit is applied upon restart: session required pam_limits.so Copy Add the following line to /etc/sysctl.conf to increase the amount of allowed inotify watchers per user. We specified a limit of 18192 here instead of just 10000 so that the root user will still have 8192 available inotify watches (the default value). fs.inotify.max_user_watches=18192 Copy Restart your system. Ensure that the new limits have been enforced by running: ulimit -Sn # Should return 10100 cat /proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_watches # Should return 18192 Copy Learn more on how to increase open file limits, or on how to increase the inotify watches. Uninstall log forwarding To uninstall log forwarding capabilities, go to your logging.d directory, and remove files with the .yml extension that were originally added during the configuration process.

Forwarding your CloudWatch logs to New Relic will give you enhanced log management capabilities to collect, process, explore, query, and alert on your log data. Install and configure the Cloudwatch logs Lambda function The following setup shows one approach for configuring environment variables. You can also configure them from the Functions page. Complete the following: Make sure you have a New Relic license key. Open the AWS Serverless Application Repository in your browser. Search for newrelic and check Show apps that create custom IAM roles or resource policies to find newrelic-log-ingestion. Open the newrelic-log-ingestion details and click Deploy. In the function's Configure menu, go to Environment Variables and configure log forwarding using the following environment variables: Key Description DEBUG_LOGGING_ENABLED A boolean to determine if you want to output debug messages in the CloudWatch console. Optional. To turn on debug logs, set this to true. Default is false. LICENSE_KEY New Relic license key is used for sending data to New Relic. Required. LOGGING_ENABLED Determines if logs are forwarded to New Relic. Required. To turn on logging, set this to true. NR_LOGGING_ENDPOINT New Relic ingestion endpoint for logs. Required.

      "body": "You can forward your logs to New Relic using our infrastructure monitoring agent. This makes all of your logging data available in one location and provides deeper visibility into both your application and your platform performance data. Forwarding your logs to New Relic will give you enhanced log management capabilities to collect, process, explore, query, and alert on your log data. Basic process To forward your logs through our infrastructure monitoring agent: If you haven't already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Verify the system requirements needed for configuring logs. Ensure you have installed the infrastructure agent, version 1.11.4 or higher. Create a logging.yml configuration file in the infrastructure agent's logging.d directory. Configure your log sources and other parameters. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your account for data. Explore your log data in the Logs UI and benefit from the log attributes automatically inserted by the infrastructure agent. Here is an example of where you can see logs in context of your infrastructure monitoring details in New Relic One. System requirements To use the log forwarder of the infrastructure agent, make sure you meet the following requirements: Infrastructure agent version 1.11.4 or higher OpenSSL library 1.1.0 or higher is required by Infrastructure agent starting from 1.16.4. Built-in support for ARM64 architecture on Linux systems (in example, AWS Graviton architecture) added in Infrastructure agent 1.26.0. Important The log forwarding feature is not supported with the Docker container for infrastructure monitoring agents. The log forwarding feature is compatible with the following operating systems: Operating system Supported version Amazon Linux Amazon Linux 2 CentOS Version 7 or higher Debian Version 9 (\"Stretch\") or higher Exception: Version 11 is not supported. Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) Version 7 or higher SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) Version 12 Ubuntu Versions 16.04.x, 18.04.x and 20.04.x (LTS versions) Windows Windows Server 2012, 2016, and 2019, and their service packs. Windows 10 Install the infrastructure agent Starting with version 1.11.4, the infrastructure agent can forward logs to New Relic. To install and run the agent, use a package manager (Linux) or the MSI installer (Windows). Important The log forwarding feature is not included when the infrastructure agent is implemented using Linux tarball or Windows ZIP installations. To use the following links, make sure you are logged to your New Relic account. Amazon Linux CentOS Debian RHEL SLES Ubuntu Windows If you don't have a New Relic account yet, or if you prefer to follow the procedure manually, see our tutorial to install the package manager. Configure the infrastructure agent Configuration files describe which log sources are forwarded. Our infrastructure agent uses .yml files to configure logging. You can add as many config files as you want. To add a new configuration file for the log forwarding feature: Navigate to the log forwarder configuration folder: Linux: /etc/newrelic-infra/logging.d/ Windows: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\logging.d\\ Create a logging.yml configuration file, and add the parameters you need. The logging.d directory has various .yml.example files you can use as a reference or starting point. The agent automatically processes new configuration files without having to restart the infrastructure monitoring service. The only exception to this is when configuring a custom Fluent Bit configuration. Log forwarding parameters The infrastructure log forwarding .yml config supports the following parameters: Name (required) To start, define a name of the log or logs you want to forward to New Relic. Log source (required) What you use for the log source will depend on where you want to forward your logs from. Available options include: file Path to the log file or files. The agent tracks changes on the log files in a way similar to tail -f shell. Example: logs: - name: example-log file: /var/log/example.log # Path to a single log file - name: example-log-two file: /var/log/example-two.log # Path to another single log file Copy The file parameter can point to a specific log file or multiple files by using wildcards applied to names and extensions; for example, /logs/*.log. You can use wildcards in place of directories in a file path, which can be used to tail files located in different directories. Example: logs: - name: docker-logs file: /var/lib/docker/containers/*/*.log # Path to multiple folders and files Copy Important Use of wildcards may significantly increase the number of file descriptors and inotify watches the Fluent Bit process keeps open, which can interfere with log collection if the host's file descriptor limit is reached. Tailing a large number of files may require you to increase the maximum number of file descriptors and inotify watchers allowed by the operating system. Please refer to Errors when tailing a large amount of log files for more details on how to increase them. systemd Use the systemd parameter to forward log messages that are collected by the journald daemon in Linux environments. This input type requires the agent to run in root mode. Example: logs: - name: systemd-example systemd: cupsd Copy syslog Syslog data source. Parameters: uri: Syslog socket. Format varies depending on the protocol: TCP/UDP network sockets: [tcp/udp]://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT Unix domain sockets: unix_[tcp/udp]:// + /socket/path parser: Syslog parser. Default is rfc3164. Use rfc5424 if your messages include fractional seconds. Note: rfc3164 currently does not work on SuSE. unix_permissions: default is 0644 for domain sockets; this limits entries to processes running as root. You can use 0666 to listen for non-root processes, at your own risk. When running the agent in privileged mode, ports and sockets must be available or owned by nri-agent, with 0666 file permissions, so that other processes can write logs to the sockets. logs: # TCP network socket - name: syslog-tcp-test syslog: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:5140 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format parser: rfc5424 # Default syslog parser is rfc3164 # UDP network socket - name: syslog-udp-test syslog: uri: udp://0.0.0.0:6140 # Use the udp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format max_line_kb: 35 # Unix TCP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-tcp-test syslog: uri: unix_tcp:///var/unix-tcp-socket-test unix_permissions: 0666 # Default is 0644. Change at your own risk # Unix UDP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-udp-test syslog: uri: unix_udp:///var/unix-udp-socket-test parser: rfc5424 Copy tcp Logs retrieved over TCP connections. Parameters: uri: TCP/IP socket to listen for incoming data. The URI format is tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format: format of the data. It can be json or none. separator: If format: none is used, you can define a separator string for splitting records (default: \\n). logs: - name: tcp-simple-test tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:1234 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format format: none # Raw text - this is default for 'tcp' separator: \\t # String for separating raw text entries max_line_kb: 32 - name: tcp-json-test tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:2345 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format format: json Copy winlog Collect events from Windows log channels. Parameters: channel: name of the channel logs will be collected from. collect-eventids: a list of Windows Event IDs to be collected and forwarded to New Relic. Event ID ranges are supported. exclude-eventids: a list of Windows Event IDs to be excluded from collection. Event ID ranges are supported. All events are collected from the specified channel by default. Configure the collect-eventids and exclude-eventids sections to avoid sending unwanted logs to your New Relic account. Add event IDs or ranges to collect-eventids or exclude-eventids to forward or drop specific events. exclude-eventids takes precedence over collect-eventids if the same event ID is present in both sections. Example: logs: # Winlog log ingestion with eventId filters. - name: windows-security winlog: channel: Security collect-eventids: - 4624 - 4265 - 4700-4800 exclude-eventids: - 4735 # entries for the application, system, powershell, and SCOM channels - name: windows-application winlog: channel: Application - name: windows-system winlog: channel: System - name: windows-pshell winlog: channel: Windows Powershell - name: scom winlog: channel: Operations Manager # Entry for Windows Defender Logs - name: windows-defender winlog: channel: Microsoft-Windows-Windows Defender/Operational # Entry for Windows Clustering Logs - name: windows-clustering winlog: channel: Microsoft-Windows-FailoverClustering/Operational # Entry for IIS logs with logtype attribute for automatic parsing - name: iis-log file: C:\\inetpub\\logs\\LogFiles\\w3svc.log attributes: logtype: iis_w3c Copy Optional configuration The following configuration parameters are not required but are still recommended. attributes List of custom attributes specified as key-value pairs that can be used to send additional data with the logs which you can then query. The attributes configuration parameter can be used with any log source. One common use of the attributes configuration parameter is to specify the logtype attribute. This attribute allows leveraging one of the built-in parsing rules supported by New Relic Logs. Example: logs: - name: example-file-attributes file: /var/log/example.log attributes: logtype: nginx region: example-us-02 team: A-team - name: example-tcp-attributes tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:2345 format: json attributes: logtype: nginx region: example-us-02 team: B-team Copy attributes automatically inserted by the infrastructure agent The infrastructure agent automatically inserts log attributes for your convenience. Some of them are inserted for any log record, while others depend on the configuration parameters you used while setting up the log forwarder. Attribute name Description entity.guids Always inserted. The infrastructure agent inserts the Entity GUID assigned by New Relic to identify the host where it's running. It is available in the entity.guids field. Note: If the captured logs belong to an application instrumented using APM, the entity.guids field contains both the entity GUID of infrastructure, as well as the GUID of APM, separated by a pipe ( | ) delimiter. fb.input Always inserted. The underlying Fluent Bit input plugin type used to capture the logs. Currently its values are tail, systemd, winlog, syslog, and tcp. filePath Inserted when sing the file input type. Absolute file path of the file being monitored. hostname Always inserted. The hostname of the machine/VM/container executing the infrastructure agent. plugin.type Always inserted. Indicates the utility used to capture the logs. In this case, it is the infrastructure agent itself, so this attribute always has the value nri-agent. pattern Regular expression for filtering records. Only supported for the tail, systemd, syslog, and tcp (only with format none) sources. This field works in a way similar to grep -E in Unix systems. For example, for a given file being captured, you can filter for records containing either WARN or ERROR using: - name: only-records-with-warn-and-error file: /var/log/logFile.log pattern: WARN|ERROR Copy No filtering is applied by default. max_line_kb Maximum size of log entries/lines in KB. If log entries exceed the limit, they are skipped. Default is 128. fluentbit External Fluent Bit configuration and parser files. If defined, they are merged with the existing configuration and parser files generated by the infrastructure agent. The infrastructure agent processes the configuration files located in the logging.d directory and will generate a run-time Fluent Bit configuration file that contains the appropriate [INPUT], [FILTER] and [OUTPUT] sections. Optionally, it will also declare an @INCLUDE in case you provided an external Fluent Bit configuration file via the fluentbit option. The runtime file does not define a [SERVICE] section, leaving all default Fluent Bit configuration values. You can still override Fluent Bit's default settings by defining your own [SERVICE] section in your external Fluent Bit configuration file and include it via the fluentbit option. Parameters: config_file: path to an existing Fluent Bit configuration file. Note that any overlapping source results in duplicate messages in New Relic Logs. parsers_file: path to an existing Fluent Bit parsers file. The following parser names are reserved: rfc3164, rfc3164-local and rfc5424. Sample configuration file Here is an example of a logging.d/ configuration file in YAML format. For more configuration examples, see the infrastructure agent repository. logging.d/sample.yaml # Remember to only use spaces for indentation logs: # Example of 'file' source - name: file-with-attributes file: /var/log/test.log # Path to a single file or pattern attributes: # You can use custom attributes to enrich your data logtype: nginx team: The A Team pattern: Error # Regular expression to filter log entries # Example of 'systemd' source (Linux only) - name: systemd-example systemd: cupsd # Examples of 'syslog' source, one per protocol # TCP network socket - name: syslog-tcp-test syslog: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:5140 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format parser: rfc5424 # Default syslog parser is rfc3164 # UDP network socket - name: syslog-udp-test syslog: uri: udp://0.0.0.0:6140 # Use the udp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format max_line_kb: 35 # Paths for Unix sockets are defined by combining protocol and path: # unix_udp:// + /path/socket - for example, unix_udp:///tmp/socket # Unix TCP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-tcp-test syslog: uri: unix_tcp:///var/unix-tcp-socket-test unix_permissions: 0666 # Default is 0644.

For example, you can execute a query like this: SELECT * FROM Log Copy Troubleshooting If you encounter problems with configuring your log forwarder, try these troubleshooting tips. No log data If no data appears after you enable our log management capabilities, follow our standard log troubleshooting procedures. No data appears when tailing a file The log forwarding feature requires the agent to have permission to read the data sources. When running the infrastructure agent in privileged or non-privileged modes, make sure that the log files you want to forward (and any intermediary directory in its path) are readable by the user running nri-agent. Example: Check file access under Linux Let's check whether the file /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log can be monitored by the nri-agent user. In Linux, you can do a quick check with the namei command: sudo -u nri-agent namei -ml /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log f: /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log drwxr-xr-x root root / drwxr-xr-x root root var drwxrwxr-x root syslog log drwxr--r-- root root restrictedLogs logFile.log - No such file or directory Copy This command failed because the file is not visible to the nri-agent user. By inspecting the previous output, we can detect that the restrictedLogs directory is missing the execution flag for others. To fix this, execute: sudo chmod 755 /var/log/restrictedLogs Copy And then check for file access again: # sudo -u nri-agent namei -ml /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log f: /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log drwxr-xr-x root root / drwxr-xr-x root root var drwxrwxr-x root syslog log drwxr-xr-x root root restrictedLogs -rw-r----- vagrant vagrant logFile.log Copy The file is now visible to the nri-agent user. You must ensure that the file is also readable by the nri-agent user. To check this, use: # sudo -u nri-agent head /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log head: cannot open '/var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log' for reading: Permission denied Copy In this example, the file is missing the read rights for the others group (users other than vagrant and the vagrant user group). You could fix this by granting read permissions to others, but the application could change these permissions upon restart. To avoid this, a better approach is to add the nri-agent user to the vagrant user group. No data appears when capturing via a Syslog socket The log forwarding feature requires that the agent has permission to read the data sources. When running the infrastructure agent in privileged or non-privileged modes: If you're using Unix domain socket files, make sure that the nri-agent user can access these files (please refer to the previous section) and that they have read and write permissions (666) so that other users than nri-agent can write to them. If you're using IP sockets, ensure that the port that you are using is not a system reserved one (like port 80, for example). If no data appears after you enable log management, follow standard log management troubleshooting procedures. No data appears using infrastructure agent proxy As explained in the infrastructure agent configuration guidelines, the proxy parameter must use either HTTP or HTTPS and be in the form https://user:password@hostname:port. The agent can parse the parameter without the HTTP or HTTPS, but the log forwarder cannot. You will see an error like the following in the agent verbose logs: [ERROR] building HTTP transport: parse \\\"hostname:port\\\": first path segment in URL cannot contain colon Copy To solve this problem, check your newrelic-infra.yml file, and ensure the proxy parameter adheres to this form. If you're using caBundleFile or caBundleDir in order to specify any certificate, we recommend to follow the below rules for each OS: Linux For HTTP proxies you don't need to setup any certificates. The plugin loads the system certificates and New Relic sends logs into the logging endpoint. However, you can specify the proxy self-signed certificate (PEM file) using either the caBundleFile or caBundleDir parameters. Windows For HTTP proxies you don't need to setup any certificates. The plugin loads the system certificates. For HTTPS, you can configure it in one of the following ways: Import the proxy certificate to the system pool (Recommended) Import the proxy self-signed certificate (PEM file) by using the MMC tool. Refer to this link, and in Step 2 ensure to import it in your Trusted Root Certification Authorities, instead of in the Intermediate Certification Authorities. Using the caBundleFile and caBundleDir parameters On Windows, we cannot load both the certificates from the system certificate pool and the ones specified with the caBundleFile caBundleDir parameters. So, if you are using caBundleFile or caBundleDir, ensure that the following certificates are placed in the same PEM file (when using caBundleFile) or in the same directory (when using caBundleDir): The Proxy certificate (because it's an HTTPS proxy). The Logging Endpoint certificate (eg. https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1). The Infrastructure Agent certificate (eg. https://infra-api.newrelic.com). You can check the certificates by running: # openssl s_client -connect log-api.newrelic.com:443 -servername log-api.newrelic.com Copy Sending the infrastructure agent's logs to New Relic You can configure the infrastructure agent to send its own logs to New Relic. This is useful for troubleshooting issues with log forwarding, the agent, or when contacting support. To forward the infrastructure agent logs to New Relic: Edit your newrelic-infra.yml file. Enable agent logging in troubleshooting mode by adding verbose: 3. On Windows and systems that don't use systemd or where journald is inaccessible, verbose:3 causes the agent to write the logs on the disk. Revert to verbose:0 to prevent this. (Recommended): Enable agent logging in JSON format to log_format: json. Restart the agent to load the new settings. This configuration sets up the agent in troubleshooting mode, but the log forwarder (based on Fluent Bit) will continue in a non-verbose mode. Sometimes you can have issues with the log forwarder itself. For example, there may be problems accessing a specific channel when shipping Windows log events or when accessing a particular log file. In these situations, you can also enable the verbose mode for the log forwarder: Set verbose to a value other than 0. Add the configuration option: trace: [\"log.fw\"]. Caution Check whether you are using the [fluentbit] option. When setting verbose: 3 and trace: [\"log.fw\"], ensure that you don't define any [OUTPUT] section pointing to stdout in an external Fluent Bit configuration file, Fluent Bit does not start with the infra agent Important Fluent Bit's tail plugin does not support network drives. For Linux versions prior to 2016, you may need to update the OpenSSL library to 1.1.0 (or higher). To check if you have this problem: See if infra-agent has started Fluent Bit by running: ps -aux | grep fluent-bi Copy If it isn't running go to /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/logging and run: ./fluent-bit -i systemd -o stdout Copy If you get the following error, update OpenSSL to 1.1.0 or higher: error while loading shared libraries: libssl.so.1.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory Copy Runtime error on Windows One of the following error messages may appear when enabling log forwarding on Windows: The code execution cannot proceed because VCRUNTIME140.dll was not found. Copy OR error=\"exit status 3221225781\" process=log-forwarder Copy This is caused by a missing DLL. To solve the issue, install the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable as applicable: x64 x86 Errors when tailing a large amount of log files (Linux) It's common to face either one of the following error messages when attempting to tail a large amount of files: Too many open files The user limit on the total number of inotify watches was reached or the kernel failed to allocate a needed resource The operating system defines a maximum amount of allocatable file descriptors (typically 1024 by default), and a maximum amount of allocatable inotify watches (typically 8192 by default). Any process attempting to go above these limits will fail, returning one of the errors above. The underlying technology we use to forward logs, Fluent Bit, opens one file descriptor and sets an inotify watch for each file you configure to be forwarded. Moreover, at the time of writing this section, Fluent Bit uses an extra set of 32 file descriptors for its normal operation, with another extra file descriptor when it shuts down. Therefore, to capture a large amount of files you need to ensure that both the file descriptor and inotify watch limits are slightly greater than the amount of log files you wish to tail. The following instructions summarize how to increase these limits if you want to tail 10,000 log files. Also, it assumes the infrastructure agent is installed in root running mode, and therefore must be run using the root user. Check which is the current hard limit for the amount of file descriptors per process. Typically, this limit should be quite high and should not need to be modified. ulimit -Hn Copy Add the following line to /etc/security/limits.conf. We specified a limit of 10100 here instead of just 10000 to allow Fluent Bit to allocate the extra file descriptors it may need to work. root soft nofile 10100 # replace root by nri-agent for non-root (privileged and unprivileged) installations Copy Add the following line to /etc/pam.d/common-session so that the previous limit is applied upon restart: session required pam_limits.so Copy Add the following line to /etc/sysctl.conf to increase the amount of allowed inotify watchers per user. We specified a limit of 18192 here instead of just 10000 so that the root user will still have 8192 available inotify watches (the default value). fs.inotify.max_user_watches=18192 Copy Restart your system. Ensure that the new limits have been enforced by running: ulimit -Sn # Should return 10100 cat /proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_watches # Should return 18192 Copy Learn more on how to increase open file limits, or on how to increase the inotify watches. Uninstall log forwarding To uninstall log forwarding capabilities, go to your logging.d directory, and remove files with the .yml extension that were originally added during the configuration process.
