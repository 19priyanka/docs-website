Configure the Winston extension To configure logs in context with the Winston extension, complete the following steps: To install the New Relic Winston log enricher, enter the following command into your terminal or command line interface: npm install @newrelic/winston-enricher Copy In your application code, update your logging configuration to add the newrelicFormatter as shown below: // index.js require('newrelic') const newrelicFormatter = require('@newrelic/winston-enricher') Copy The New Relic formatter can be used individually or combined with other formatters as the final format. format: winston.format.combine( winston.format.label({label: 'test'}), newrelicFormatter() ) Copy Check for logging data To verify that you have configured the extension correctly, run your application and verify that the logging you have configured contains the following: Includes trace.id and span.id fields Is properly-formatted JSON lines If everything is configured correctly and your data is being reported, you should see data logs in the New Relic Logs UI using the query operator has: span.id/trace.id. Troubleshooting Problem Not all log data in a message or for a specific attribute is being displayed. Cause The stack trace will be written to the error.stack property. To accommodate the 4000 character log line limit for New Relic Logs, the stack and trace properties will be removed and the message, error.message and error.stack values will be truncated to 1024 characters.

Install or update the Go agent Install or update to the most recent Go agent version, and enable Distributed tracing. Configure logs in context using the Logrus extension To configure the Logrus plugin: This step assumes that you have imported the following packages in files where Logrus is configured: import ( log \"github.com/sirupsen/logrus\" \"github.com/newrelic/go-agent/v3/integrations/logcontext/nrlogrusplugin\" \"github.com/newrelic/go-agent/v3/newrelic\" ) Copy Set the Logrus formatter to nrlogrusplugin.ContextFormatter: logger := log.New() logger.SetFormatter(nrlogrusplugin.ContextFormatter{}) Copy Or, if you are using the Logrus standard logger: log.SetFormatter(nrlogrusplugin.ContextFormatter{}) Copy The logger will now look for a newrelic.Transaction inside its context and decorate logs accordingly. Update your standard logging call to include contextual logging and pass this to the logger. For example, instead of logger.Info(\"Hello New Relic!\"), use ctx := newrelic.NewContext(context.Background(), txn) logger.WithContext(ctx).Info(\"Hello New Relic!\") Copy where txn is the current running transaction. Check for logging data To verify that you have configured the extension correctly, run your application and verify that the logging you have configured contains the following: Includes trace.id and span.id fields Is properly-formatted JSON lines If everything is configured correctly and your data is being reported, you should see data logs in the New Relic Logs UI using the query operator has:span.id OR has:trace.id What's next?

This makes all of your logging data available in one location and provides deeper visibility into both your application and your platform performance data. Tip To use log management and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Enable log forwarding using the infrastructure agent To enable log forwarding through the infrastructure agent: Start by verifying the system requirements needed for configuring Logs. Ensure you have installed the infrastructure agent, version 1.11.4 or higher. Create a logging.yml file in the infrastructure agent's logging.d directory. Configure your log sources and other parameters. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your account for data. Explore your log data in the Logs UI and benefit from the log attributes automatically inserted by the infrastructure agent. System Requirements To use the log forwarder of the infrastructure agent, make sure you meet the following requirements: Infrastructure agent version 1.11.4 or higher OpenSSL library 1.1.0 or higher is required by infra-agent starting from v1.16.4. The log forwarding feature is compatible with the following operating systems: Operating system Supported version Amazon Linux Amazon Linux 2 CentOS Version 7 or higher Debian Version 9 (\"Stretch\") or higher Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) Version 7 or higher SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) Version 12 Ubuntu Versions 16.04.x, 18.04.x and 20.04.x (LTS versions) Windows Windows Server 2012, 2016, and 2019, and their service packs. Windows 10 Caution The log forwarding feature is not supported on containerized infrastructure agents. Install the infrastructure agent Starting with version 1.11.4, the infrastructure agent can forward logs to New Relic. To install and run the agent, use a package manager (Linux) or the MSI installer (Windows). To use the following links, make sure you are logged to your New Relic account. Amazon Linux CentOS Debian RHEL SLES Ubuntu Windows If you don't have a New Relic account yet, or prefer to follow the procedure manually, see our tutorial to install the package manager. Configure the infrastructure agent Configuration files describe which log sources are forwarded. The Infrastructure agent uses .yml files for configuring logging. You can add as many config files as you want. To add a new configuration file for the log forwarding feature: Navigate to the logging forwarder configuration folder: Linux: /etc/newrelic-infra/logging.d/ Windows: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\logging.d\\ Create a logging.yml configuration file and add the parameters you need. The logging.d directory has various .yml.example files that can be used as a reference or starting point. The agent automatically processes new configuration files without having to restart the Infrastructure service. The only exception to this is when configuring a custom Fluent Bit configuration. Log forwarding parameters The infrastructure log forwarding .yml config supports the following parameters: Name (required) To start, make sure to define a name for the logs you want to forward: name Name of the log or logs being forwarding to New Relic. Log source (required) What you use for the log source will depend on where you want to forward your logs from. The available options are listed below: file Path to the log file or files. The agent tracks changes on the log files in a way similar to tail -f shell. Example: logs: - name: example-log file: /var/log/example.log # Path to a single log file - name: example-log-two file: /var/log/example-two.log # Path to another single log file Copy The file parameter can point to a specific log file or multiple files by using wildcards applied to names and extensions; for example, /logs/*.log. You can use wildcards in place of directories in a file path, which can be used to tail files located in different directories. Example: logs: - name: docker-logs file: /var/lib/docker/containers/*/*.log # Path to multiple folders and files Copy Important Use of wildcards may significantly increase the number of file descriptors the Fluent Bit process keeps open, which can interfere with log collection if the host's file descriptor limit is reached. We recommend increasing the file descriptor limit on Linux hosts running Fluent Bit by adding the following to the host's /etc/security/limits.conf file: root soft nofile 65536 root hard nofile 65536 *soft nofile 65536 *hard nofile 65536 Copy If you add these changes, reboot the host to ensure your changes are applied. systemd Use the systemd paramater to forward log messages that are collected by the journald daemon in Linux environments. This input type requires the agent to run in root mode. Example: logs: - name: systemd-example systemd: cupsd Copy syslog Syslog data source. Parameters: uri: Syslog socket. Format varies depending on the protocol: TCP/UDP network sockets: [tcp/udp]://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT Unix domain sockets: unix_[tcp/udp]:// + /socket/path parser: Syslog parser. Default is rfc3164. Use rfc5424 if your messages include fractional seconds. Note: rfc3164 currently does not work on SuSE. unix_permissions: default is 0644 for domain sockets; this limits entries to processes running as root. You can use 0666 to listen for non-root processes, at your own risk. When running the agent in privileged mode, ports and sockets must be available or owned by nri-agent, with 0666 file permissions, so that other processes can write logs to the sockets. logs: # TCP network socket - name: syslog-tcp-test syslog: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:5140 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format parser: rfc5424 # Default syslog parser is rfc3164 # UDP network socket - name: syslog-udp-test syslog: uri: udp://0.0.0.0:6140 # Use the udp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format max_line_kb: 35 # Unix TCP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-tcp-test syslog: uri: unix_tcp:///var/unix-tcp-socket-test unix_permissions: 0666 # Default is 0644. Change at your own risk # Unix UDP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-udp-test syslog: uri: unix_udp:///var/unix-udp-socket-test parser: rfc5424 Copy tcp Logs retrieved over TCP connections. Parameters: uri: TCP/IP socket to listen for incoming data. The URI format is tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format: format of the data. It can be json or none. separator: If format: none is used, you can define a separator string for splitting records (default: \\n). logs: - name: tcp-simple-test tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:1234 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format format: none # Raw text - this is default for 'tcp' separator: \\t # String for separating raw text entries max_line_kb: 32 - name: tcp-json-test tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:2345 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format format: json Copy winlog Collect events from Windows log channels. Parameters: channel: name of the channel logs will be collected from. collect-eventids: a list of Windows Event IDs to be collected and forwarded to New Relic. Event ID ranges are supported. exclude-eventids: a list of Windows Event IDs to be excluded from collection. Event ID ranges are supported. All events are collected from the specified channel by default. Configure the collect-eventids and exclude-eventids sections to avoid sending unwanted logs to your New Relic account. Add event IDs or ranges to collect-eventids or exclude-eventids to forward or drop specific events. exclude-eventids takes precedence over collect-eventids if the same event ID is present in both sections. Example: logs: # Winlog log ingestion with eventId filters. - name: windows-security winlog: channel: Security collect-eventids: - 4624 - 4265 - 4700-4800 exclude-eventids: - 4735 # entries for the application, system, powershell, and SCOM channels - name: windows-application winlog: channel: Application - name: windows-system winlog: channel: System - name: windows-pshell winlog: channel: Windows Powershell - name: scom winlog: channel: Operations Manager # Entry for Windows Defender Logs - name: windows-defender winlog: channel: Microsoft-Windows-Windows Defender/Operational # Entry for Windows Clustering Logs - name: windows-clustering winlog: channel: Microsoft-Windows-FailoverClustering/Operational # Entry for IIS logs with logtype attribute for automatic parsing - name: iis-log file: C:\\inetpub\\logs\\LogFiles\\w3svc.log attributes: logtype: iis_w3c Copy Optional Configuration The following are configuration paramaters that are not required but are still recommended. attributes List of custom attributes as key-value pairs that can be used to send additional data with the logs which you can then query. Add attributes to any log source. Example: logs: - name: example-file-attributes file: /var/log/example.log attributes: logtype: nginx region: example-us-02 team: A-team - name: example-tcp-attributes tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:2345 format: json attributes: logtype: nginx region: example-us-02 team: B-team Copy Log attributes automatically inserted by the infrastructure agent(#automatically-inserted-attributes) The infrastructure agent automatically inserts log attributes for your convenience. Some of them are inserted for any log record, while others depend on the configuration parameters you used while setting up the log forwarder. Find a summary of these attributes in the following table: Attribute name Inserting conditions Description entity.guids Always inserted The infrastructure agent inserts the Entity GUID assigned by New Relic to identify the host where it's running. It is available in the entity.guids field. Note: If the captured logs belong to an application instrumented using APM, the entity.guids field contains both the entity GUID of infrastructure, as well as the GUID of APM, separated by a pipe ( | ) delimiter. fb.input Always inserted The underlying Fluent Bit input plugin type used to capture the logs. Currently, its values are tail, systemd, winlog, syslog, and tcp. filePath When using the file input type Absolute file path of the file being monitored. hostname Always inserted The hostname of the machine/VM/container executing the infrastructure agent. plugin.type Always inserted Indicates the utility used to capture the logs. In this case, it is the infrastructure agent itself, so this attribute always has the value nri-agent. pattern Regular expression for filtering records. Only supported for the tail, systemd, syslog, and tcp (only with format none) sources. This field works in a way similar to grep -E in Unix systems. For example, for a given file being captured, you can filter for records containing either WARN or ERROR using: - name: only-records-with-warn-and-error file: /var/log/logFile.log pattern: WARN|ERROR Copy No filtering is applied by default. max_line_kb Maximum size of log entries/lines in KB. If log entries exceed the limit, they are skipped. Default is 128. fluentbit External Fluent Bit configuration and parser files. If defined, they are merged with the existing configuration and parser files generated by the infrastructure agent. The infrastructure agent processes the configuration files located in the logging.d directory and will generate a run-time Fluent Bit configuration file that contains the appropriate [INPUT], [FILTER] and [OUTPUT] sections. Optionally, it will also declare an @INCLUDE in case you provided an external Fluent Bit configuration file via the fluentbit option. The runtime file does not define a [SERVICE] section, leaving all default Fluent Bit configuration values. You can still override Fluent Bit's default settings by defining your own [SERVICE] section in your external Fluent Bit configuration file and include it via the fluentbit option. Parameters: config_file: path to an existing Fluent Bit configuration file. Note that any overlapping source results in duplicate messages in New Relic Logs. parsers_file: path to an existing Fluent Bit parsers file. The following parser names are reserved: rfc3164, rfc3164-local and rfc5424. Sample configuration file Here is an example of a logging.d/ configuration file in YAML format. For more configuration examples, see the infrastructure agent repository. logging.d/sample.yaml # Remember to only use spaces for indentation logs: # Example of 'file' source - name: file-with-attributes file: /var/log/test.log # Path to a single file or pattern attributes: # You can use custom attributes to enrich your data logtype: nginx team: The A Team pattern: Error # Regular expression to filter log entries # Example of 'systemd' source (Linux only) - name: systemd-example systemd: cupsd # Examples of 'syslog' source, one per protocol # TCP network socket - name: syslog-tcp-test syslog: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:5140 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format parser: rfc5424 # Default syslog parser is rfc3164 # UDP network socket - name: syslog-udp-test syslog: uri: udp://0.0.0.0:6140 # Use the udp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format max_line_kb: 35 # Paths for Unix sockets are defined by combining protocol and path: # unix_udp:// + /path/socket - for example, unix_udp:///tmp/socket # Unix TCP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-tcp-test syslog: uri: unix_tcp:///var/unix-tcp-socket-test unix_permissions: 0666 # Default is 0644.

No data appears when tailing a file The log forwarding feature requires the agent to have permission to read the data sources. When running the infrastructure agent in privileged or non-privileged modes, make sure that the log files you want to forward (and any intermediary directory in its path) are readable by the user running nri-agent. Example: checking file access under Linux Let's check whether the file /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log can be monitored by the nri-agent user. In Linux, you can do a quick check with the namei command: sudo -u nri-agent namei -ml /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log f: /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log drwxr-xr-x root root / drwxr-xr-x root root var drwxrwxr-x root syslog log drwxr--r-- root root restrictedLogs logFile.log - No such file or directory Copy This command failed because the file is not visible to the nri-agent user. By inspecting the previous output, we can detect that the restrictedLogs directory is missing the execution flag for others\". We can fix this by executing: sudo chmod 755 /var/log/restrictedLogs Copy And then check for file access again: # sudo -u nri-agent namei -ml /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log f: /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log drwxr-xr-x root root / drwxr-xr-x root root var drwxrwxr-x root syslog log drwxr-xr-x root root restrictedLogs -rw-r----- vagrant vagrant logFile.log Copy The file is now visible to the nri-agent user. You must ensure that the file is also readable by the nri-agent user. To check this, use: # sudo -u nri-agent head /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log head: cannot open '/var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log' for reading: Permission denied Copy In this example, the file is missing the read rights for the others group (users other than vagrant and the vagrant user group). You could fix this by granting read permissions to others, but the application could change these permissions upon restart. To avoid this, a better approach is to add the nri-agent user to the vagrant user group. No data appears when capturing via a Syslog socket The log forwarding feature requires that the agent has permission to read the data sources. When running the infrastructure agent in privileged or non-privileged modes: If you're using Unix domain socket files, make sure that the nri-agent user can access these files (please refer to the previous section) and that they have read and write permissions (666) so that other users than nri-agent can write to them. If you're using IP sockets, ensure that the port that you are using is not a system reserved one (like port 80, for example). If no data appears after you enable log management, follow standard log management troubleshooting procedures. No data appears using infrastructure agent proxy As explained in the infrastructure agent configuration guidelines, the proxy parameter must use either HTTP or HTTPS and be in the form https://user:password@hostname:port. The agent can parse the parameter without the HTTP or HTTPS, but the log-forwarder cannot. You will see an error like the following in the agent verbose logs: [ERROR] building HTTP transport: parse \\\"hostname:port\\\": first path segment in URL cannot contain colon Copy To solve this problem, check your newrelic-infra.yml file, and ensure the proxy parameter adheres to this form. Send the agent's logs to New Relic You can configure the infrastructure agent to send its own logs to New Relic. This is useful for troubleshooting issues with log forwarding, the agent, or when contacting support. To forward the infrastructure agent logs to New Relic: Edit your newrelic-infra.yml file. Enable agent logging in troubleshooting mode by adding verbose: 3 Important On Windows and systems that don't use systemd or where journald is inaccessible, verbose:3 causes the agent to write the logs on the disk. Revert to verbose:0 to prevent this. (Recommended): Enable agent logging in JSON format to log_format: json. Restart the agent to load the new settings. This configuration sets up the agent in troubleshooting mode, but the log forwarder (based on Fluent Bit) will continue in a non-verbose mode. Sometimes you can have issues with the log forwarder itself. For example, there may be problems accessing a specific channel when shipping Windows log events or when accessing a particular log file. In these situations, you can also enable the verbose mode for the log forwarder: Set verbose to a value other than 0. Add the following configuration option: trace: [\"log.fw\"]. Caution Check whether you are using the fluentbit option. When setting verbose: 3 and trace: [\"log.fw\"], ensure that you don't define any [OUTPUT] section pointing to stdout in an external Fluent Bit configuration file, Fluent Bit does not start with the infra-agent For Linux versions previous to 2016 you may need to update the OpenSSL library to 1.1.0 (or higher). To check if you have this problem: See if infra-agenthas started Fluent Bit by doing ps -aux | grep fluent-bit Copy If it isn't running go to /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/logging and run ./fluent-bit -i systemd -o stdout Copy If you get the following error, update OpenSSL to 1.1.0 or higher: error while loading shared libraries: libssl.so.1.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory Runtime error on Windows One of the following error messages may appear when enabling log forwarding on Windows: The code execution cannot proceed because VCRUNTIME140.dll was not found. Copy OR error=\"exit status 3221225781\" process=log-forwarder Copy This is caused by a missing DLL. To solve the issue, install the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable: x64 or x86. What's next? Now that you've enabled Logs, here are some potential next steps: Explore your data using the Logs UI. Configure your agent to see contextual log data, such as distributed tracing, stack traces, application logs, and more. Query your data and create custom dashboards or alerts.",

      "body": "You can forward your logs to New Relic using our infrastructure monitoring agent. This makes all of your logging data available in one location and provides deeper visibility into both your application and your platform performance data. Tip To use log management and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Enable log forwarding using the infrastructure agent To enable log forwarding through the infrastructure agent: Start by verifying the system requirements needed for configuring Logs. Ensure you have installed the infrastructure agent, version 1.11.4 or higher. Create a logging.yml file in the infrastructure agent's logging.d directory. Configure your log sources and other parameters. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your account for data. Explore your log data in the Logs UI and benefit from the log attributes automatically inserted by the infrastructure agent. System Requirements To use the log forwarder of the infrastructure agent, make sure you meet the following requirements: Infrastructure agent version 1.11.4 or higher OpenSSL library 1.1.0 or higher is required by infra-agent starting from v1.16.4. The log forwarding feature is compatible with the following operating systems: Operating system Supported version Amazon Linux Amazon Linux 2 CentOS Version 7 or higher Debian Version 9 (\"Stretch\") or higher Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) Version 7 or higher SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) Version 12 Ubuntu Versions 16.04.x, 18.04.x and 20.04.x (LTS versions) Windows Windows Server 2012, 2016, and 2019, and their service packs. Windows 10 Caution The log forwarding feature is not supported on containerized infrastructure agents. Install the infrastructure agent Starting with version 1.11.4, the infrastructure agent can forward logs to New Relic. To install and run the agent, use a package manager (Linux) or the MSI installer (Windows). To use the following links, make sure you are logged to your New Relic account. Amazon Linux CentOS Debian RHEL SLES Ubuntu Windows If you don't have a New Relic account yet, or prefer to follow the procedure manually, see our tutorial to install the package manager. Configure the infrastructure agent Configuration files describe which log sources are forwarded. The Infrastructure agent uses .yml files for configuring logging. You can add as many config files as you want. To add a new configuration file for the log forwarding feature: Navigate to the logging forwarder configuration folder: Linux: /etc/newrelic-infra/logging.d/ Windows: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\logging.d\\ Create a logging.yml configuration file and add the parameters you need. The logging.d directory has various .yml.example files that can be used as a reference or starting point. The agent automatically processes new configuration files without having to restart the Infrastructure service. The only exception to this is when configuring a custom Fluent Bit configuration. Log forwarding parameters The infrastructure log forwarding .yml config supports the following parameters: Name (required) To start, make sure to define a name for the logs you want to forward: name Name of the log or logs being forwarding to New Relic. Log source (required) What you use for the log source will depend on where you want to forward your logs from. The available options are listed below: file Path to the log file or files. The agent tracks changes on the log files in a way similar to tail -f shell. Example: logs: - name: example-log file: /var/log/example.log # Path to a single log file - name: example-log-two file: /var/log/example-two.log # Path to another single log file Copy The file parameter can point to a specific log file or multiple files by using wildcards applied to names and extensions; for example, /logs/*.log. You can use wildcards in place of directories in a file path, which can be used to tail files located in different directories. Example: logs: - name: docker-logs file: /var/lib/docker/containers/*/*.log # Path to multiple folders and files Copy Important Use of wildcards may significantly increase the number of file descriptors the Fluent Bit process keeps open, which can interfere with log collection if the host's file descriptor limit is reached. We recommend increasing the file descriptor limit on Linux hosts running Fluent Bit by adding the following to the host's /etc/security/limits.conf file: root soft nofile 65536 root hard nofile 65536 *soft nofile 65536 *hard nofile 65536 Copy If you add these changes, reboot the host to ensure your changes are applied. systemd Use the systemd paramater to forward log messages that are collected by the journald daemon in Linux environments. This input type requires the agent to run in root mode. Example: logs: - name: systemd-example systemd: cupsd Copy syslog Syslog data source. Parameters: uri: Syslog socket. Format varies depending on the protocol: TCP/UDP network sockets: [tcp/udp]://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT Unix domain sockets: unix_[tcp/udp]:// + /socket/path parser: Syslog parser. Default is rfc3164. Use rfc5424 if your messages include fractional seconds. Note: rfc3164 currently does not work on SuSE. unix_permissions: default is 0644 for domain sockets; this limits entries to processes running as root. You can use 0666 to listen for non-root processes, at your own risk. When running the agent in privileged mode, ports and sockets must be available or owned by nri-agent, with 0666 file permissions, so that other processes can write logs to the sockets. logs: # TCP network socket - name: syslog-tcp-test syslog: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:5140 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format parser: rfc5424 # Default syslog parser is rfc3164 # UDP network socket - name: syslog-udp-test syslog: uri: udp://0.0.0.0:6140 # Use the udp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format max_line_kb: 35 # Unix TCP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-tcp-test syslog: uri: unix_tcp:///var/unix-tcp-socket-test unix_permissions: 0666 # Default is 0644. Change at your own risk # Unix UDP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-udp-test syslog: uri: unix_udp:///var/unix-udp-socket-test parser: rfc5424 Copy tcp Logs retrieved over TCP connections. Parameters: uri: TCP/IP socket to listen for incoming data. The URI format is tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format: format of the data. It can be json or none. separator: If format: none is used, you can define a separator string for splitting records (default: \\n). logs: - name: tcp-simple-test tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:1234 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format format: none # Raw text - this is default for 'tcp' separator: \\t # String for separating raw text entries max_line_kb: 32 - name: tcp-json-test tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:2345 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format format: json Copy winlog Collect events from Windows log channels. Parameters: channel: name of the channel logs will be collected from. collect-eventids: a list of Windows Event IDs to be collected and forwarded to New Relic. Event ID ranges are supported. exclude-eventids: a list of Windows Event IDs to be excluded from collection. Event ID ranges are supported. All events are collected from the specified channel by default. Configure the collect-eventids and exclude-eventids sections to avoid sending unwanted logs to your New Relic account. Add event IDs or ranges to collect-eventids or exclude-eventids to forward or drop specific events. exclude-eventids takes precedence over collect-eventids if the same event ID is present in both sections. Example: logs: # Winlog log ingestion with eventId filters. - name: windows-security winlog: channel: Security collect-eventids: - 4624 - 4265 - 4700-4800 exclude-eventids: - 4735 # entries for the application, system, powershell, and SCOM channels - name: windows-application winlog: channel: Application - name: windows-system winlog: channel: System - name: windows-pshell winlog: channel: Windows Powershell - name: scom winlog: channel: Operations Manager # Entry for Windows Defender Logs - name: windows-defender winlog: channel: Microsoft-Windows-Windows Defender/Operational # Entry for Windows Clustering Logs - name: windows-clustering winlog: channel: Microsoft-Windows-FailoverClustering/Operational # Entry for IIS logs with logtype attribute for automatic parsing - name: iis-log file: C:\\inetpub\\logs\\LogFiles\\w3svc.log attributes: logtype: iis_w3c Copy Optional Configuration The following are configuration paramaters that are not required but are still recommended. attributes List of custom attributes as key-value pairs that can be used to send additional data with the logs which you can then query. Add attributes to any log source. Example: logs: - name: example-file-attributes file: /var/log/example.log attributes: logtype: nginx region: example-us-02 team: A-team - name: example-tcp-attributes tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:2345 format: json attributes: logtype: nginx region: example-us-02 team: B-team Copy Log attributes automatically inserted by the infrastructure agent(#automatically-inserted-attributes) The infrastructure agent automatically inserts log attributes for your convenience. Some of them are inserted for any log record, while others depend on the configuration parameters you used while setting up the log forwarder. Find a summary of these attributes in the following table: Attribute name Inserting conditions Description entity.guids Always inserted The infrastructure agent inserts the Entity GUID assigned by New Relic to identify the host where it's running. It is available in the entity.guids field. Note: If the captured logs belong to an application instrumented using APM, the entity.guids field contains both the entity GUID of infrastructure, as well as the GUID of APM, separated by a pipe ( | ) delimiter. fb.input Always inserted The underlying Fluent Bit input plugin type used to capture the logs. Currently, its values are tail, systemd, winlog, syslog, and tcp. filePath When using the file input type Absolute file path of the file being monitored. hostname Always inserted The hostname of the machine/VM/container executing the infrastructure agent. plugin.type Always inserted Indicates the utility used to capture the logs. In this case, it is the infrastructure agent itself, so this attribute always has the value nri-agent. pattern Regular expression for filtering records. Only supported for the tail, systemd, syslog, and tcp (only with format none) sources. This field works in a way similar to grep -E in Unix systems. For example, for a given file being captured, you can filter for records containing either WARN or ERROR using: - name: only-records-with-warn-and-error file: /var/log/logFile.log pattern: WARN|ERROR Copy No filtering is applied by default. max_line_kb Maximum size of log entries/lines in KB. If log entries exceed the limit, they are skipped. Default is 128. fluentbit External Fluent Bit configuration and parser files. If defined, they are merged with the existing configuration and parser files generated by the infrastructure agent. The infrastructure agent processes the configuration files located in the logging.d directory and will generate a run-time Fluent Bit configuration file that contains the appropriate [INPUT], [FILTER] and [OUTPUT] sections. Optionally, it will also declare an @INCLUDE in case you provided an external Fluent Bit configuration file via the fluentbit option. The runtime file does not define a [SERVICE] section, leaving all default Fluent Bit configuration values. You can still override Fluent Bit's default settings by defining your own [SERVICE] section in your external Fluent Bit configuration file and include it via the fluentbit option. Parameters: config_file: path to an existing Fluent Bit configuration file. Note that any overlapping source results in duplicate messages in New Relic Logs. parsers_file: path to an existing Fluent Bit parsers file. The following parser names are reserved: rfc3164, rfc3164-local and rfc5424. Sample configuration file Here is an example of a logging.d/ configuration file in YAML format. For more configuration examples, see the infrastructure agent repository. logging.d/sample.yaml # Remember to only use spaces for indentation logs: # Example of 'file' source - name: file-with-attributes file: /var/log/test.log # Path to a single file or pattern attributes: # You can use custom attributes to enrich your data logtype: nginx team: The A Team pattern: Error # Regular expression to filter log entries # Example of 'systemd' source (Linux only) - name: systemd-example systemd: cupsd # Examples of 'syslog' source, one per protocol # TCP network socket - name: syslog-tcp-test syslog: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:5140 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format parser: rfc5424 # Default syslog parser is rfc3164 # UDP network socket - name: syslog-udp-test syslog: uri: udp://0.0.0.0:6140 # Use the udp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format max_line_kb: 35 # Paths for Unix sockets are defined by combining protocol and path: # unix_udp:// + /path/socket - for example, unix_udp:///tmp/socket # Unix TCP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-tcp-test syslog: uri: unix_tcp:///var/unix-tcp-socket-test unix_permissions: 0666 # Default is 0644.

No data appears when tailing a file The log forwarding feature requires the agent to have permission to read the data sources. When running the infrastructure agent in privileged or non-privileged modes, make sure that the log files you want to forward (and any intermediary directory in its path) are readable by the user running nri-agent. Example: checking file access under Linux Let's check whether the file /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log can be monitored by the nri-agent user. In Linux, you can do a quick check with the namei command: sudo -u nri-agent namei -ml /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log f: /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log drwxr-xr-x root root / drwxr-xr-x root root var drwxrwxr-x root syslog log drwxr--r-- root root restrictedLogs logFile.log - No such file or directory Copy This command failed because the file is not visible to the nri-agent user. By inspecting the previous output, we can detect that the restrictedLogs directory is missing the execution flag for others\". We can fix this by executing: sudo chmod 755 /var/log/restrictedLogs Copy And then check for file access again: # sudo -u nri-agent namei -ml /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log f: /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log drwxr-xr-x root root / drwxr-xr-x root root var drwxrwxr-x root syslog log drwxr-xr-x root root restrictedLogs -rw-r----- vagrant vagrant logFile.log Copy The file is now visible to the nri-agent user. You must ensure that the file is also readable by the nri-agent user. To check this, use: # sudo -u nri-agent head /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log head: cannot open '/var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log' for reading: Permission denied Copy In this example, the file is missing the read rights for the others group (users other than vagrant and the vagrant user group). You could fix this by granting read permissions to others, but the application could change these permissions upon restart. To avoid this, a better approach is to add the nri-agent user to the vagrant user group. No data appears when capturing via a Syslog socket The log forwarding feature requires that the agent has permission to read the data sources. When running the infrastructure agent in privileged or non-privileged modes: If you're using Unix domain socket files, make sure that the nri-agent user can access these files (please refer to the previous section) and that they have read and write permissions (666) so that other users than nri-agent can write to them. If you're using IP sockets, ensure that the port that you are using is not a system reserved one (like port 80, for example). If no data appears after you enable log management, follow standard log management troubleshooting procedures. No data appears using infrastructure agent proxy As explained in the infrastructure agent configuration guidelines, the proxy parameter must use either HTTP or HTTPS and be in the form https://user:password@hostname:port. The agent can parse the parameter without the HTTP or HTTPS, but the log-forwarder cannot. You will see an error like the following in the agent verbose logs: [ERROR] building HTTP transport: parse \\\"hostname:port\\\": first path segment in URL cannot contain colon Copy To solve this problem, check your newrelic-infra.yml file, and ensure the proxy parameter adheres to this form. Send the agent's logs to New Relic You can configure the infrastructure agent to send its own logs to New Relic. This is useful for troubleshooting issues with log forwarding, the agent, or when contacting support. To forward the infrastructure agent logs to New Relic: Edit your newrelic-infra.yml file. Enable agent logging in troubleshooting mode by adding verbose: 3 Important On Windows and systems that don't use systemd or where journald is inaccessible, verbose:3 causes the agent to write the logs on the disk. Revert to verbose:0 to prevent this. (Recommended): Enable agent logging in JSON format to log_format: json. Restart the agent to load the new settings. This configuration sets up the agent in troubleshooting mode, but the log forwarder (based on Fluent Bit) will continue in a non-verbose mode. Sometimes you can have issues with the log forwarder itself. For example, there may be problems accessing a specific channel when shipping Windows log events or when accessing a particular log file. In these situations, you can also enable the verbose mode for the log forwarder: Set verbose to a value other than 0. Add the following configuration option: trace: [\"log.fw\"]. Caution Check whether you are using the fluentbit option. When setting verbose: 3 and trace: [\"log.fw\"], ensure that you don't define any [OUTPUT] section pointing to stdout in an external Fluent Bit configuration file, Fluent Bit does not start with the infra-agent For Linux versions previous to 2016 you may need to update the OpenSSL library to 1.1.0 (or higher). To check if you have this problem: See if infra-agenthas started Fluent Bit by doing ps -aux | grep fluent-bit Copy If it isn't running go to /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/logging and run ./fluent-bit -i systemd -o stdout Copy If you get the following error, update OpenSSL to 1.1.0 or higher: error while loading shared libraries: libssl.so.1.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory Runtime error on Windows One of the following error messages may appear when enabling log forwarding on Windows: The code execution cannot proceed because VCRUNTIME140.dll was not found. Copy OR error=\"exit status 3221225781\" process=log-forwarder Copy This is caused by a missing DLL. To solve the issue, install the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable: x64 or x86. What's next? Now that you've enabled Logs, here are some potential next steps: Explore your data using the Logs UI. Configure your agent to see contextual log data, such as distributed tracing, stack traces, application logs, and more. Query your data and create custom dashboards or alerts.",

Tip To use log management and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Enable log forwarding using the infrastructure agent To enable log forwarding through the infrastructure agent: Start by verifying the system requirements needed for configuring Logs. Ensure you have installed the infrastructure agent, version 1.11.4 or higher. Create a logging.yml file in the infrastructure agent's logging.d directory. Configure your log sources and other parameters. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your account for data. Explore your log data in the Logs UI and benefit from the log attributes automatically inserted by the infrastructure agent. System Requirements To use the log forwarder of the infrastructure agent, make sure you meet the following requirements: Infrastructure agent version 1.11.4 or higher OpenSSL library 1.1.0 or higher is required by infra-agent starting from v1.16.4. The log forwarding feature is compatible with the following operating systems: Operating system Supported version Amazon Linux Amazon Linux 2 CentOS Version 7 or higher Debian Version 9 (\"Stretch\") or higher Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) Version 7 or higher SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) Version 12 Ubuntu Versions 16.04.x, 18.04.x and 20.04.x (LTS versions) Windows Windows Server 2012, 2016, and 2019, and their service packs. Windows 10 Caution The log forwarding feature is not supported on containerized infrastructure agents. Install the infrastructure agent Starting with version 1.11.4, the infrastructure agent can forward logs to New Relic. To install and run the agent, use a package manager (Linux) or the MSI installer (Windows). To use the following links, make sure you are logged to your New Relic account. Amazon Linux CentOS Debian RHEL SLES Ubuntu Windows If you don't have a New Relic account yet, or prefer to follow the procedure manually, see our tutorial to install the package manager. Configure the infrastructure agent Configuration files describe which log sources are forwarded. The Infrastructure agent uses .yml files for configuring logging. You can add as many config files as you want. To add a new configuration file for the log forwarding feature: Navigate to the logging forwarder configuration folder: Linux: /etc/newrelic-infra/logging.d/ Windows: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\logging.d\\ Create a logging.yml configuration file and add the parameters you need. The logging.d directory has various .yml.example files that can be used as a reference or starting point. The agent automatically processes new configuration files without having to restart the Infrastructure service. The only exception to this is when configuring a custom Fluent Bit configuration. Log forwarding parameters The infrastructure log forwarding .yml config supports the following parameters: Name (required) To start, make sure to define a name for the logs you want to forward: name Name of the log or logs being forwarding to New Relic. Log source (required) What you use for the log source will depend on where you want to forward your logs from. The available options are listed below: file Path to the log file or files. The agent tracks changes on the log files in a way similar to tail -f shell. Example: logs: - name: example-log file: /var/log/example.log # Path to a single log file - name: example-log-two file: /var/log/example-two.log # Path to another single log file Copy The file parameter can point to a specific log file or multiple files by using wildcards applied to names and extensions; for example, /logs/*.log. You can use wildcards in place of directories in a file path, which can be used to tail files located in different directories. Example: logs: - name: docker-logs file: /var/lib/docker/containers/*/*.log # Path to multiple folders and files Copy Important Use of wildcards may significantly increase the number of file descriptors the Fluent Bit process keeps open, which can interfere with log collection if the host's file descriptor limit is reached. We recommend increasing the file descriptor limit on Linux hosts running Fluent Bit by adding the following to the host's /etc/security/limits.conf file: root soft nofile 65536 root hard nofile 65536 *soft nofile 65536 *hard nofile 65536 Copy If you add these changes, reboot the host to ensure your changes are applied. systemd Use the systemd paramater to forward log messages that are collected by the journald daemon in Linux environments. This input type requires the agent to run in root mode. Example: logs: - name: systemd-example systemd: cupsd Copy syslog Syslog data source. Parameters: uri: Syslog socket. Format varies depending on the protocol: TCP/UDP network sockets: [tcp/udp]://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT Unix domain sockets: unix_[tcp/udp]:// + /socket/path parser: Syslog parser. Default is rfc3164. Use rfc5424 if your messages include fractional seconds. Note: rfc3164 currently does not work on SuSE. unix_permissions: default is 0644 for domain sockets; this limits entries to processes running as root. You can use 0666 to listen for non-root processes, at your own risk. When running the agent in privileged mode, ports and sockets must be available or owned by nri-agent, with 0666 file permissions, so that other processes can write logs to the sockets. logs: # TCP network socket - name: syslog-tcp-test syslog: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:5140 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format parser: rfc5424 # Default syslog parser is rfc3164 # UDP network socket - name: syslog-udp-test syslog: uri: udp://0.0.0.0:6140 # Use the udp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format max_line_kb: 35 # Unix TCP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-tcp-test syslog: uri: unix_tcp:///var/unix-tcp-socket-test unix_permissions: 0666 # Default is 0644. Change at your own risk # Unix UDP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-udp-test syslog: uri: unix_udp:///var/unix-udp-socket-test parser: rfc5424 Copy tcp Logs retrieved over TCP connections. Parameters: uri: TCP/IP socket to listen for incoming data. The URI format is tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format: format of the data. It can be json or none. separator: If format: none is used, you can define a separator string for splitting records (default: \\n). logs: - name: tcp-simple-test tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:1234 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format format: none # Raw text - this is default for 'tcp' separator: \\t # String for separating raw text entries max_line_kb: 32 - name: tcp-json-test tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:2345 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format format: json Copy winlog Collect events from Windows log channels. Parameters: channel: name of the channel logs will be collected from. collect-eventids: a list of Windows Event IDs to be collected and forwarded to New Relic. Event ID ranges are supported. exclude-eventids: a list of Windows Event IDs to be excluded from collection. Event ID ranges are supported. All events are collected from the specified channel by default. Configure the collect-eventids and exclude-eventids sections to avoid sending unwanted logs to your New Relic account. Add event IDs or ranges to collect-eventids or exclude-eventids to forward or drop specific events. exclude-eventids takes precedence over collect-eventids if the same event ID is present in both sections. Example: logs: # Winlog log ingestion with eventId filters. - name: windows-security winlog: channel: Security collect-eventids: - 4624 - 4265 - 4700-4800 exclude-eventids: - 4735 # entries for the application, system, powershell, and SCOM channels - name: windows-application winlog: channel: Application - name: windows-system winlog: channel: System - name: windows-pshell winlog: channel: Windows Powershell - name: scom winlog: channel: Operations Manager # Entry for Windows Defender Logs - name: windows-defender winlog: channel: Microsoft-Windows-Windows Defender/Operational # Entry for Windows Clustering Logs - name: windows-clustering winlog: channel: Microsoft-Windows-FailoverClustering/Operational # Entry for IIS logs with logtype attribute for automatic parsing - name: iis-log file: C:\\inetpub\\logs\\LogFiles\\w3svc.log attributes: logtype: iis_w3c Copy Optional Configuration The following are configuration paramaters that are not required but are still recommended. attributes List of custom attributes as key-value pairs that can be used to send additional data with the logs which you can then query. Add attributes to any log source. Example: logs: - name: example-file-attributes file: /var/log/example.log attributes: logtype: nginx region: example-us-02 team: A-team - name: example-tcp-attributes tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:2345 format: json attributes: logtype: nginx region: example-us-02 team: B-team Copy Log attributes automatically inserted by the infrastructure agent(#automatically-inserted-attributes) The infrastructure agent automatically inserts log attributes for your convenience. Some of them are inserted for any log record, while others depend on the configuration parameters you used while setting up the log forwarder. Find a summary of these attributes in the following table: Attribute name Inserting conditions Description entity.guids Always inserted The infrastructure agent inserts the Entity GUID assigned by New Relic to identify the host where it's running. It is available in the entity.guids field. Note: If the captured logs belong to an application instrumented using APM, the entity.guids field contains both the entity GUID of infrastructure, as well as the GUID of APM, separated by a pipe ( | ) delimiter. fb.input Always inserted The underlying Fluent Bit input plugin type used to capture the logs. Currently, its values are tail, systemd, winlog, syslog, and tcp. filePath When using the file input type Absolute file path of the file being monitored. hostname Always inserted The hostname of the machine/VM/container executing the infrastructure agent. plugin.type Always inserted Indicates the utility used to capture the logs. In this case, it is the infrastructure agent itself, so this attribute always has the value nri-agent. pattern Regular expression for filtering records. Only supported for the tail, systemd, syslog, and tcp (only with format none) sources. This field works in a way similar to grep -E in Unix systems. For example, for a given file being captured, you can filter for records containing either WARN or ERROR using: - name: only-records-with-warn-and-error file: /var/log/logFile.log pattern: WARN|ERROR Copy No filtering is applied by default. max_line_kb Maximum size of log entries/lines in KB. If log entries exceed the limit, they are skipped. Default is 128. fluentbit External Fluent Bit configuration and parser files. If defined, they are merged with the existing configuration and parser files generated by the infrastructure agent. The infrastructure agent processes the configuration files located in the logging.d directory and will generate a run-time Fluent Bit configuration file that contains the appropriate [INPUT], [FILTER] and [OUTPUT] sections. Optionally, it will also declare an @INCLUDE in case you provided an external Fluent Bit configuration file via the fluentbit option. The runtime file does not define a [SERVICE] section, leaving all default Fluent Bit configuration values. You can still override Fluent Bit's default settings by defining your own [SERVICE] section in your external Fluent Bit configuration file and include it via the fluentbit option. Parameters: config_file: path to an existing Fluent Bit configuration file. Note that any overlapping source results in duplicate messages in New Relic Logs. parsers_file: path to an existing Fluent Bit parsers file. The following parser names are reserved: rfc3164, rfc3164-local and rfc5424. Sample configuration file Here is an example of a logging.d/ configuration file in YAML format. For more configuration examples, see the infrastructure agent repository. logging.d/sample.yaml # Remember to only use spaces for indentation logs: # Example of 'file' source - name: file-with-attributes file: /var/log/test.log # Path to a single file or pattern attributes: # You can use custom attributes to enrich your data logtype: nginx team: The A Team pattern: Error # Regular expression to filter log entries # Example of 'systemd' source (Linux only) - name: systemd-example systemd: cupsd # Examples of 'syslog' source, one per protocol # TCP network socket - name: syslog-tcp-test syslog: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:5140 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format parser: rfc5424 # Default syslog parser is rfc3164 # UDP network socket - name: syslog-udp-test syslog: uri: udp://0.0.0.0:6140 # Use the udp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format max_line_kb: 35 # Paths for Unix sockets are defined by combining protocol and path: # unix_udp:// + /path/socket - for example, unix_udp:///tmp/socket # Unix TCP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-tcp-test syslog: uri: unix_tcp:///var/unix-tcp-socket-test unix_permissions: 0666 # Default is 0644.

No data appears when tailing a file The log forwarding feature requires the agent to have permission to read the data sources. When running the infrastructure agent in privileged or non-privileged modes, make sure that the log files you want to forward (and any intermediary directory in its path) are readable by the user running nri-agent. Example: checking file access under Linux Let's check whether the file /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log can be monitored by the nri-agent user. In Linux, you can do a quick check with the namei command: sudo -u nri-agent namei -ml /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log f: /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log drwxr-xr-x root root / drwxr-xr-x root root var drwxrwxr-x root syslog log drwxr--r-- root root restrictedLogs logFile.log - No such file or directory Copy This command failed because the file is not visible to the nri-agent user. By inspecting the previous output, we can detect that the restrictedLogs directory is missing the execution flag for others\". We can fix this by executing: sudo chmod 755 /var/log/restrictedLogs Copy And then check for file access again: # sudo -u nri-agent namei -ml /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log f: /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log drwxr-xr-x root root / drwxr-xr-x root root var drwxrwxr-x root syslog log drwxr-xr-x root root restrictedLogs -rw-r----- vagrant vagrant logFile.log Copy The file is now visible to the nri-agent user. You must ensure that the file is also readable by the nri-agent user. To check this, use: # sudo -u nri-agent head /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log head: cannot open '/var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log' for reading: Permission denied Copy In this example, the file is missing the read rights for the others group (users other than vagrant and the vagrant user group). You could fix this by granting read permissions to others, but the application could change these permissions upon restart. To avoid this, a better approach is to add the nri-agent user to the vagrant user group. No data appears when capturing via a Syslog socket The log forwarding feature requires that the agent has permission to read the data sources. When running the infrastructure agent in privileged or non-privileged modes: If you're using Unix domain socket files, make sure that the nri-agent user can access these files (please refer to the previous section) and that they have read and write permissions (666) so that other users than nri-agent can write to them. If you're using IP sockets, ensure that the port that you are using is not a system reserved one (like port 80, for example). If no data appears after you enable log management, follow standard log management troubleshooting procedures. No data appears using infrastructure agent proxy As explained in the infrastructure agent configuration guidelines, the proxy parameter must use either HTTP or HTTPS and be in the form https://user:password@hostname:port. The agent can parse the parameter without the HTTP or HTTPS, but the log-forwarder cannot. You will see an error like the following in the agent verbose logs: [ERROR] building HTTP transport: parse \\\"hostname:port\\\": first path segment in URL cannot contain colon Copy To solve this problem, check your newrelic-infra.yml file, and ensure the proxy parameter adheres to this form. Send the agent's logs to New Relic You can configure the infrastructure agent to send its own logs to New Relic. This is useful for troubleshooting issues with log forwarding, the agent, or when contacting support. To forward the infrastructure agent logs to New Relic: Edit your newrelic-infra.yml file. Enable agent logging in troubleshooting mode by adding verbose: 3 Important On Windows and systems that don't use systemd or where journald is inaccessible, verbose:3 causes the agent to write the logs on the disk. Revert to verbose:0 to prevent this. (Recommended): Enable agent logging in JSON format to log_format: json. Restart the agent to load the new settings. This configuration sets up the agent in troubleshooting mode, but the log forwarder (based on Fluent Bit) will continue in a non-verbose mode. Sometimes you can have issues with the log forwarder itself. For example, there may be problems accessing a specific channel when shipping Windows log events or when accessing a particular log file. In these situations, you can also enable the verbose mode for the log forwarder: Set verbose to a value other than 0. Add the following configuration option: trace: [\"log.fw\"]. Caution Check whether you are using the fluentbit option. When setting verbose: 3 and trace: [\"log.fw\"], ensure that you don't define any [OUTPUT] section pointing to stdout in an external Fluent Bit configuration file, Fluent Bit does not start with the infra-agent For Linux versions previous to 2016 you may need to update the OpenSSL library to 1.1.0 (or higher). To check if you have this problem: See if infra-agenthas started Fluent Bit by doing ps -aux | grep fluent-bit Copy If it isn't running go to /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/logging and run ./fluent-bit -i systemd -o stdout Copy If you get the following error, update OpenSSL to 1.1.0 or higher: error while loading shared libraries: libssl.so.1.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory Runtime error on Windows One of the following error messages may appear when enabling log forwarding on Windows: The code execution cannot proceed because VCRUNTIME140.dll was not found. Copy OR error=\"exit status 3221225781\" process=log-forwarder Copy This is caused by a missing DLL. To solve the issue, install the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable: x64 or x86. What's next? Now that you've enabled Logs, here are some potential next steps: Explore your data using the Logs UI. Configure your agent to see contextual log data, such as distributed tracing, stack traces, application logs, and more. Query your data and create custom dashboards or alerts.",

Tip To use log management and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Enable log forwarding using the infrastructure agent To enable log forwarding through the infrastructure agent: Start by verifying the system requirements needed for configuring Logs. Ensure you have installed the infrastructure agent, version 1.11.4 or higher. Create a logging.yml file in the infrastructure agent's logging.d directory. Configure your log sources and other parameters. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your account for data. Explore your log data in the Logs UI and benefit from the log attributes automatically inserted by the infrastructure agent. System Requirements To use the log forwarder of the infrastructure agent, make sure you meet the following requirements: Infrastructure agent version 1.11.4 or higher OpenSSL library 1.1.0 or higher is required by infra-agent starting from v1.16.4. The log forwarding feature is compatible with the following operating systems: Operating system Supported version Amazon Linux Amazon Linux 2 CentOS Version 7 or higher Debian Version 9 (\"Stretch\") or higher Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) Version 7 or higher SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) Version 12 Ubuntu Versions 16.04.x, 18.04.x and 20.04.x (LTS versions) Windows Windows Server 2012, 2016, and 2019, and their service packs. Windows 10 Caution The log forwarding feature is not supported on containerized infrastructure agents. Install the infrastructure agent Starting with version 1.11.4, the infrastructure agent can forward logs to New Relic. To install and run the agent, use a package manager (Linux) or the MSI installer (Windows). To use the following links, make sure you are logged to your New Relic account. Amazon Linux CentOS Debian RHEL SLES Ubuntu Windows If you don't have a New Relic account yet, or prefer to follow the procedure manually, see our tutorial to install the package manager. Configure the infrastructure agent Configuration files describe which log sources are forwarded. The Infrastructure agent uses .yml files for configuring logging. You can add as many config files as you want. To add a new configuration file for the log forwarding feature: Navigate to the logging forwarder configuration folder: Linux: /etc/newrelic-infra/logging.d/ Windows: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\logging.d\\ Create a logging.yml configuration file and add the parameters you need. The logging.d directory has various .yml.example files that can be used as a reference or starting point. The agent automatically processes new configuration files without having to restart the Infrastructure service. The only exception to this is when configuring a custom Fluent Bit configuration. Log forwarding parameters The infrastructure log forwarding .yml config supports the following parameters: Name (required) To start, make sure to define a name for the logs you want to forward: name Name of the log or logs being forwarding to New Relic. Log source (required) What you use for the log source will depend on where you want to forward your logs from. The available options are listed below: file Path to the log file or files. The agent tracks changes on the log files in a way similar to tail -f shell. Example: logs: - name: example-log file: /var/log/example.log # Path to a single log file - name: example-log-two file: /var/log/example-two.log # Path to another single log file Copy The file parameter can point to a specific log file or multiple files by using wildcards applied to names and extensions; for example, /logs/*.log. You can use wildcards in place of directories in a file path, which can be used to tail files located in different directories. Example: logs: - name: docker-logs file: /var/lib/docker/containers/*/*.log # Path to multiple folders and files Copy Important Use of wildcards may significantly increase the number of file descriptors the Fluent Bit process keeps open, which can interfere with log collection if the host's file descriptor limit is reached. We recommend increasing the file descriptor limit on Linux hosts running Fluent Bit by adding the following to the host's /etc/security/limits.conf file: root soft nofile 65536 root hard nofile 65536 *soft nofile 65536 *hard nofile 65536 Copy If you add these changes, reboot the host to ensure your changes are applied. systemd Use the systemd paramater to forward log messages that are collected by the journald daemon in Linux environments. This input type requires the agent to run in root mode. Example: logs: - name: systemd-example systemd: cupsd Copy syslog Syslog data source. Parameters: uri: Syslog socket. Format varies depending on the protocol: TCP/UDP network sockets: [tcp/udp]://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT Unix domain sockets: unix_[tcp/udp]:// + /socket/path parser: Syslog parser. Default is rfc3164. Use rfc5424 if your messages include fractional seconds. Note: rfc3164 currently does not work on SuSE. unix_permissions: default is 0644 for domain sockets; this limits entries to processes running as root. You can use 0666 to listen for non-root processes, at your own risk. When running the agent in privileged mode, ports and sockets must be available or owned by nri-agent, with 0666 file permissions, so that other processes can write logs to the sockets. logs: # TCP network socket - name: syslog-tcp-test syslog: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:5140 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format parser: rfc5424 # Default syslog parser is rfc3164 # UDP network socket - name: syslog-udp-test syslog: uri: udp://0.0.0.0:6140 # Use the udp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format max_line_kb: 35 # Unix TCP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-tcp-test syslog: uri: unix_tcp:///var/unix-tcp-socket-test unix_permissions: 0666 # Default is 0644.

Parameters: channel: name of the channel logs will be collected from. collect-eventids: a list of Windows Event IDs to be collected and forwarded to New Relic. Event ID ranges are supported. exclude-eventids: a list of Windows Event IDs to be excluded from collection. Event ID ranges are supported. All events are collected from the specified channel by default. Configure the collect-eventids and exclude-eventids sections to avoid sending unwanted logs to your New Relic account. Add event IDs or ranges to collect-eventids or exclude-eventids to forward or drop specific events. exclude-eventids takes precedence over collect-eventids if the same event ID is present in both sections. Example: logs: # Winlog log ingestion with eventId filters. - name: windows-security winlog: channel: Security collect-eventids: - 4624 - 4265 - 4700-4800 exclude-eventids: - 4735 # entries for the application, system, powershell, and SCOM channels - name: windows-application winlog: channel: Application - name: windows-system winlog: channel: System - name: windows-pshell winlog: channel: Windows Powershell - name: scom winlog: channel: Operations Manager # Entry for Windows Defender Logs - name: windows-defender winlog: channel: Microsoft-Windows-Windows Defender/Operational # Entry for Windows Clustering Logs - name: windows-clustering winlog: channel: Microsoft-Windows-FailoverClustering/Operational # Entry for IIS logs with logtype attribute for automatic parsing - name: iis-log file: C:\\inetpub\\logs\\LogFiles\\w3svc.log attributes: logtype: iis_w3c Copy Optional Configuration The following are configuration paramaters that are not required but are still recommended. attributes List of custom attributes as key-value pairs that can be used to send additional data with the logs which you can then query. Add attributes to any log source. Example: logs: - name: example-file-attributes file: /var/log/example.log attributes: logtype: nginx region: example-us-02 team: A-team - name: example-tcp-attributes tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:2345 format: json attributes: logtype: nginx region: example-us-02 team: B-team Copy Log attributes automatically inserted by the infrastructure agent(#automatically-inserted-attributes) The infrastructure agent automatically inserts log attributes for your convenience. Some of them are inserted for any log record, while others depend on the configuration parameters you used while setting up the log forwarder. Find a summary of these attributes in the following table: Attribute name Inserting conditions Description entity.guids Always inserted The infrastructure agent inserts the Entity GUID assigned by New Relic to identify the host where it's running. It is available in the entity.guids field. Note: If the captured logs belong to an application instrumented using APM, the entity.guids field contains both the entity GUID of infrastructure, as well as the GUID of APM, separated by a pipe ( | ) delimiter. fb.input Always inserted The underlying Fluent Bit input plugin type used to capture the logs. Currently, its values are tail, systemd, winlog, syslog, and tcp. filePath When using the file input type Absolute file path of the file being monitored. hostname Always inserted The hostname of the machine/VM/container executing the infrastructure agent. plugin.type Always inserted Indicates the utility used to capture the logs. In this case, it is the infrastructure agent itself, so this attribute always has the value nri-agent. pattern Regular expression for filtering records. Only supported for the tail, systemd, syslog, and tcp (only with format none) sources. This field works in a way similar to grep -E in Unix systems. For example, for a given file being captured, you can filter for records containing either WARN or ERROR using: - name: only-records-with-warn-and-error file: /var/log/logFile.log pattern: WARN|ERROR Copy No filtering is applied by default. max_line_kb Maximum size of log entries/lines in KB. If log entries exceed the limit, they are skipped. Default is 128. fluentbit External Fluent Bit configuration and parser files. If defined, they are merged with the existing configuration and parser files generated by the infrastructure agent. The infrastructure agent processes the configuration files located in the logging.d directory and will generate a run-time Fluent Bit configuration file that contains the appropriate [INPUT], [FILTER] and [OUTPUT] sections. Optionally, it will also declare an @INCLUDE in case you provided an external Fluent Bit configuration file via the fluentbit option. The runtime file does not define a [SERVICE] section, leaving all default Fluent Bit configuration values. You can still override Fluent Bit's default settings by defining your own [SERVICE] section in your external Fluent Bit configuration file and include it via the fluentbit option. Parameters: config_file: path to an existing Fluent Bit configuration file. Note that any overlapping source results in duplicate messages in New Relic Logs. parsers_file: path to an existing Fluent Bit parsers file. The following parser names are reserved: rfc3164, rfc3164-local and rfc5424. Sample configuration file Here is an example of a logging.d/ configuration file in YAML format. For more configuration examples, see the infrastructure agent repository. logging.d/sample.yaml # Remember to only use spaces for indentation logs: # Example of 'file' source - name: file-with-attributes file: /var/log/test.log # Path to a single file or pattern attributes: # You can use custom attributes to enrich your data logtype: nginx team: The A Team pattern: Error # Regular expression to filter log entries # Example of 'systemd' source (Linux only) - name: systemd-example systemd: cupsd # Examples of 'syslog' source, one per protocol # TCP network socket - name: syslog-tcp-test syslog: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:5140 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format parser: rfc5424 # Default syslog parser is rfc3164 # UDP network socket - name: syslog-udp-test syslog: uri: udp://0.0.0.0:6140 # Use the udp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format max_line_kb: 35 # Paths for Unix sockets are defined by combining protocol and path: # unix_udp:// + /path/socket - for example, unix_udp:///tmp/socket # Unix TCP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-tcp-test syslog: uri: unix_tcp:///var/unix-tcp-socket-test unix_permissions: 0666 # Default is 0644.

No data appears when tailing a file The log forwarding feature requires the agent to have permission to read the data sources. When running the infrastructure agent in privileged or non-privileged modes, make sure that the log files you want to forward (and any intermediary directory in its path) are readable by the user running nri-agent. Example: checking file access under Linux Let's check whether the file /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log can be monitored by the nri-agent user. In Linux, you can do a quick check with the namei command: sudo -u nri-agent namei -ml /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log f: /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log drwxr-xr-x root root / drwxr-xr-x root root var drwxrwxr-x root syslog log drwxr--r-- root root restrictedLogs logFile.log - No such file or directory Copy This command failed because the file is not visible to the nri-agent user. By inspecting the previous output, we can detect that the restrictedLogs directory is missing the execution flag for others\". We can fix this by executing: sudo chmod 755 /var/log/restrictedLogs Copy And then check for file access again: # sudo -u nri-agent namei -ml /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log f: /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log drwxr-xr-x root root / drwxr-xr-x root root var drwxrwxr-x root syslog log drwxr-xr-x root root restrictedLogs -rw-r----- vagrant vagrant logFile.log Copy The file is now visible to the nri-agent user. You must ensure that the file is also readable by the nri-agent user. To check this, use: # sudo -u nri-agent head /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log head: cannot open '/var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log' for reading: Permission denied Copy In this example, the file is missing the read rights for the others group (users other than vagrant and the vagrant user group). You could fix this by granting read permissions to others, but the application could change these permissions upon restart. To avoid this, a better approach is to add the nri-agent user to the vagrant user group. No data appears when capturing via a Syslog socket The log forwarding feature requires that the agent has permission to read the data sources. When running the infrastructure agent in privileged or non-privileged modes: If you're using Unix domain socket files, make sure that the nri-agent user can access these files (please refer to the previous section) and that they have read and write permissions (666) so that other users than nri-agent can write to them. If you're using IP sockets, ensure that the port that you are using is not a system reserved one (like port 80, for example). If no data appears after you enable log management, follow standard log management troubleshooting procedures. No data appears using infrastructure agent proxy As explained in the infrastructure agent configuration guidelines, the proxy parameter must use either HTTP or HTTPS and be in the form https://user:password@hostname:port. The agent can parse the parameter without the HTTP or HTTPS, but the log-forwarder cannot. You will see an error like the following in the agent verbose logs: [ERROR] building HTTP transport: parse \\\"hostname:port\\\": first path segment in URL cannot contain colon Copy To solve this problem, check your newrelic-infra.yml file, and ensure the proxy parameter adheres to this form. Send the agent's logs to New Relic You can configure the infrastructure agent to send its own logs to New Relic. This is useful for troubleshooting issues with log forwarding, the agent, or when contacting support. To forward the infrastructure agent logs to New Relic: Edit your newrelic-infra.yml file. Enable agent logging in troubleshooting mode by adding verbose: 3 Important On Windows and systems that don't use systemd or where journald is inaccessible, verbose:3 causes the agent to write the logs on the disk. Revert to verbose:0 to prevent this. (Recommended): Enable agent logging in JSON format to log_format: json. Restart the agent to load the new settings. This configuration sets up the agent in troubleshooting mode, but the log forwarder (based on Fluent Bit) will continue in a non-verbose mode. Sometimes you can have issues with the log forwarder itself. For example, there may be problems accessing a specific channel when shipping Windows log events or when accessing a particular log file. In these situations, you can also enable the verbose mode for the log forwarder: Set verbose to a value other than 0. Add the following configuration option: trace: [\"log.fw\"]. Caution Check whether you are using the fluentbit option. When setting verbose: 3 and trace: [\"log.fw\"], ensure that you don't define any [OUTPUT] section pointing to stdout in an external Fluent Bit configuration file, Fluent Bit does not start with the infra-agent For Linux versions previous to 2016 you may need to update the OpenSSL library to 1.1.0 (or higher). To check if you have this problem: See if infra-agenthas started Fluent Bit by doing ps -aux | grep fluent-bit Copy If it isn't running go to /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/logging and run ./fluent-bit -i systemd -o stdout Copy If you get the following error, update OpenSSL to 1.1.0 or higher: error while loading shared libraries: libssl.so.1.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory Runtime error on Windows One of the following error messages may appear when enabling log forwarding on Windows: The code execution cannot proceed because VCRUNTIME140.dll was not found. Copy OR error=\"exit status 3221225781\" process=log-forwarder Copy This is caused by a missing DLL. To solve the issue, install the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable: x64 or x86. What's next? Now that you've enabled Logs, here are some potential next steps: Explore your data using the Logs UI.

Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Enable log forwarding using the infrastructure agent To enable log forwarding through the infrastructure agent: Start by verifying the system requirements needed for configuring Logs. Ensure you have installed the infrastructure agent, version 1.11.4 or higher. Create a logging.yml file in the infrastructure agent's logging.d directory. Configure your log sources and other parameters. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your account for data. Explore your log data in the Logs UI and benefit from the log attributes automatically inserted by the infrastructure agent. System Requirements To use the log forwarder of the infrastructure agent, make sure you meet the following requirements: Infrastructure agent version 1.11.4 or higher OpenSSL library 1.1.0 or higher is required by infra-agent starting from v1.16.4. The log forwarding feature is compatible with the following operating systems: Operating system Supported version Amazon Linux Amazon Linux 2 CentOS Version 7 or higher Debian Version 9 (\"Stretch\") or higher Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) Version 7 or higher SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) Version 12 Ubuntu Versions 16.04.x, 18.04.x and 20.04.x (LTS versions) Windows Windows Server 2012, 2016, and 2019, and their service packs. Windows 10 Caution The log forwarding feature is not supported on containerized infrastructure agents. Install the infrastructure agent Starting with version 1.11.4, the infrastructure agent can forward logs to New Relic. To install and run the agent, use a package manager (Linux) or the MSI installer (Windows). To use the following links, make sure you are logged to your New Relic account. Amazon Linux CentOS Debian RHEL SLES Ubuntu Windows If you don't have a New Relic account yet, or prefer to follow the procedure manually, see our tutorial to install the package manager. Configure the infrastructure agent Configuration files describe which log sources are forwarded. The Infrastructure agent uses .yml files for configuring logging. You can add as many config files as you want. To add a new configuration file for the log forwarding feature: Navigate to the logging forwarder configuration folder: Linux: /etc/newrelic-infra/logging.d/ Windows: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\logging.d\\ Create a logging.yml configuration file and add the parameters you need. The logging.d directory has various .yml.example files that can be used as a reference or starting point. The agent automatically processes new configuration files without having to restart the Infrastructure service. The only exception to this is when configuring a custom Fluent Bit configuration. Log forwarding parameters The infrastructure log forwarding .yml config supports the following parameters: Name (required) To start, make sure to define a name for the logs you want to forward: name Name of the log or logs being forwarding to New Relic. Log source (required) What you use for the log source will depend on where you want to forward your logs from. The available options are listed below: file Path to the log file or files. The agent tracks changes on the log files in a way similar to tail -f shell. Example: logs: - name: example-log file: /var/log/example.log # Path to a single log file - name: example-log-two file: /var/log/example-two.log # Path to another single log file Copy The file parameter can point to a specific log file or multiple files by using wildcards applied to names and extensions; for example, /logs/*.log. You can use wildcards in place of directories in a file path, which can be used to tail files located in different directories. Example: logs: - name: docker-logs file: /var/lib/docker/containers/*/*.log # Path to multiple folders and files Copy Important Use of wildcards may significantly increase the number of file descriptors the Fluent Bit process keeps open, which can interfere with log collection if the host's file descriptor limit is reached. We recommend increasing the file descriptor limit on Linux hosts running Fluent Bit by adding the following to the host's /etc/security/limits.conf file: root soft nofile 65536 root hard nofile 65536 *soft nofile 65536 *hard nofile 65536 Copy If you add these changes, reboot the host to ensure your changes are applied. systemd Use the systemd paramater to forward log messages that are collected by the journald daemon in Linux environments. This input type requires the agent to run in root mode. Example: logs: - name: systemd-example systemd: cupsd Copy syslog Syslog data source. Parameters: uri: Syslog socket. Format varies depending on the protocol: TCP/UDP network sockets: [tcp/udp]://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT Unix domain sockets: unix_[tcp/udp]:// + /socket/path parser: Syslog parser. Default is rfc3164. Use rfc5424 if your messages include fractional seconds. Note: rfc3164 currently does not work on SuSE. unix_permissions: default is 0644 for domain sockets; this limits entries to processes running as root. You can use 0666 to listen for non-root processes, at your own risk. When running the agent in privileged mode, ports and sockets must be available or owned by nri-agent, with 0666 file permissions, so that other processes can write logs to the sockets. logs: # TCP network socket - name: syslog-tcp-test syslog: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:5140 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format parser: rfc5424 # Default syslog parser is rfc3164 # UDP network socket - name: syslog-udp-test syslog: uri: udp://0.0.0.0:6140 # Use the udp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format max_line_kb: 35 # Unix TCP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-tcp-test syslog: uri: unix_tcp:///var/unix-tcp-socket-test unix_permissions: 0666 # Default is 0644. Change at your own risk # Unix UDP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-udp-test syslog: uri: unix_udp:///var/unix-udp-socket-test parser: rfc5424 Copy tcp Logs retrieved over TCP connections. Parameters: uri: TCP/IP socket to listen for incoming data. The URI format is tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format: format of the data. It can be json or none. separator: If format: none is used, you can define a separator string for splitting records (default: \\n). logs: - name: tcp-simple-test tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:1234 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format format: none # Raw text - this is default for 'tcp' separator: \\t # String for separating raw text entries max_line_kb: 32 - name: tcp-json-test tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:2345 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format format: json Copy winlog Collect events from Windows log channels. Parameters: channel: name of the channel logs will be collected from. collect-eventids: a list of Windows Event IDs to be collected and forwarded to New Relic. Event ID ranges are supported. exclude-eventids: a list of Windows Event IDs to be excluded from collection. Event ID ranges are supported. All events are collected from the specified channel by default. Configure the collect-eventids and exclude-eventids sections to avoid sending unwanted logs to your New Relic account. Add event IDs or ranges to collect-eventids or exclude-eventids to forward or drop specific events. exclude-eventids takes precedence over collect-eventids if the same event ID is present in both sections. Example: logs: # Winlog log ingestion with eventId filters. - name: windows-security winlog: channel: Security collect-eventids: - 4624 - 4265 - 4700-4800 exclude-eventids: - 4735 # entries for the application, system, powershell, and SCOM channels - name: windows-application winlog: channel: Application - name: windows-system winlog: channel: System - name: windows-pshell winlog: channel: Windows Powershell - name: scom winlog: channel: Operations Manager # Entry for Windows Defender Logs - name: windows-defender winlog: channel: Microsoft-Windows-Windows Defender/Operational # Entry for Windows Clustering Logs - name: windows-clustering winlog: channel: Microsoft-Windows-FailoverClustering/Operational # Entry for IIS logs with logtype attribute for automatic parsing - name: iis-log file: C:\\inetpub\\logs\\LogFiles\\w3svc.log attributes: logtype: iis_w3c Copy Optional Configuration The following are configuration paramaters that are not required but are still recommended. attributes List of custom attributes as key-value pairs that can be used to send additional data with the logs which you can then query. Add attributes to any log source. Example: logs: - name: example-file-attributes file: /var/log/example.log attributes: logtype: nginx region: example-us-02 team: A-team - name: example-tcp-attributes tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:2345 format: json attributes: logtype: nginx region: example-us-02 team: B-team Copy Log attributes automatically inserted by the infrastructure agent(#automatically-inserted-attributes) The infrastructure agent automatically inserts log attributes for your convenience. Some of them are inserted for any log record, while others depend on the configuration parameters you used while setting up the log forwarder. Find a summary of these attributes in the following table: Attribute name Inserting conditions Description entity.guids Always inserted The infrastructure agent inserts the Entity GUID assigned by New Relic to identify the host where it's running. It is available in the entity.guids field. Note: If the captured logs belong to an application instrumented using APM, the entity.guids field contains both the entity GUID of infrastructure, as well as the GUID of APM, separated by a pipe ( | ) delimiter. fb.input Always inserted The underlying Fluent Bit input plugin type used to capture the logs. Currently, its values are tail, systemd, winlog, syslog, and tcp. filePath When using the file input type Absolute file path of the file being monitored. hostname Always inserted The hostname of the machine/VM/container executing the infrastructure agent. plugin.type Always inserted Indicates the utility used to capture the logs. In this case, it is the infrastructure agent itself, so this attribute always has the value nri-agent. pattern Regular expression for filtering records. Only supported for the tail, systemd, syslog, and tcp (only with format none) sources. This field works in a way similar to grep -E in Unix systems. For example, for a given file being captured, you can filter for records containing either WARN or ERROR using: - name: only-records-with-warn-and-error file: /var/log/logFile.log pattern: WARN|ERROR Copy No filtering is applied by default. max_line_kb Maximum size of log entries/lines in KB. If log entries exceed the limit, they are skipped. Default is 128. fluentbit External Fluent Bit configuration and parser files. If defined, they are merged with the existing configuration and parser files generated by the infrastructure agent. The infrastructure agent processes the configuration files located in the logging.d directory and will generate a run-time Fluent Bit configuration file that contains the appropriate [INPUT], [FILTER] and [OUTPUT] sections. Optionally, it will also declare an @INCLUDE in case you provided an external Fluent Bit configuration file via the fluentbit option. The runtime file does not define a [SERVICE] section, leaving all default Fluent Bit configuration values. You can still override Fluent Bit's default settings by defining your own [SERVICE] section in your external Fluent Bit configuration file and include it via the fluentbit option. Parameters: config_file: path to an existing Fluent Bit configuration file. Note that any overlapping source results in duplicate messages in New Relic Logs. parsers_file: path to an existing Fluent Bit parsers file. The following parser names are reserved: rfc3164, rfc3164-local and rfc5424. Sample configuration file Here is an example of a logging.d/ configuration file in YAML format. For more configuration examples, see the infrastructure agent repository. logging.d/sample.yaml # Remember to only use spaces for indentation logs: # Example of 'file' source - name: file-with-attributes file: /var/log/test.log # Path to a single file or pattern attributes: # You can use custom attributes to enrich your data logtype: nginx team: The A Team pattern: Error # Regular expression to filter log entries # Example of 'systemd' source (Linux only) - name: systemd-example systemd: cupsd # Examples of 'syslog' source, one per protocol # TCP network socket - name: syslog-tcp-test syslog: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:5140 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format parser: rfc5424 # Default syslog parser is rfc3164 # UDP network socket - name: syslog-udp-test syslog: uri: udp://0.0.0.0:6140 # Use the udp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format max_line_kb: 35 # Paths for Unix sockets are defined by combining protocol and path: # unix_udp:// + /path/socket - for example, unix_udp:///tmp/socket # Unix TCP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-tcp-test syslog: uri: unix_tcp:///var/unix-tcp-socket-test unix_permissions: 0666 # Default is 0644.

No data appears when tailing a file The log forwarding feature requires the agent to have permission to read the data sources. When running the infrastructure agent in privileged or non-privileged modes, make sure that the log files you want to forward (and any intermediary directory in its path) are readable by the user running nri-agent. Example: checking file access under Linux Let's check whether the file /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log can be monitored by the nri-agent user. In Linux, you can do a quick check with the namei command: sudo -u nri-agent namei -ml /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log f: /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log drwxr-xr-x root root / drwxr-xr-x root root var drwxrwxr-x root syslog log drwxr--r-- root root restrictedLogs logFile.log - No such file or directory Copy This command failed because the file is not visible to the nri-agent user. By inspecting the previous output, we can detect that the restrictedLogs directory is missing the execution flag for others\". We can fix this by executing: sudo chmod 755 /var/log/restrictedLogs Copy And then check for file access again: # sudo -u nri-agent namei -ml /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log f: /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log drwxr-xr-x root root / drwxr-xr-x root root var drwxrwxr-x root syslog log drwxr-xr-x root root restrictedLogs -rw-r----- vagrant vagrant logFile.log Copy The file is now visible to the nri-agent user. You must ensure that the file is also readable by the nri-agent user. To check this, use: # sudo -u nri-agent head /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log head: cannot open '/var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log' for reading: Permission denied Copy In this example, the file is missing the read rights for the others group (users other than vagrant and the vagrant user group). You could fix this by granting read permissions to others, but the application could change these permissions upon restart. To avoid this, a better approach is to add the nri-agent user to the vagrant user group. No data appears when capturing via a Syslog socket The log forwarding feature requires that the agent has permission to read the data sources. When running the infrastructure agent in privileged or non-privileged modes: If you're using Unix domain socket files, make sure that the nri-agent user can access these files (please refer to the previous section) and that they have read and write permissions (666) so that other users than nri-agent can write to them. If you're using IP sockets, ensure that the port that you are using is not a system reserved one (like port 80, for example). If no data appears after you enable log management, follow standard log management troubleshooting procedures. No data appears using infrastructure agent proxy As explained in the infrastructure agent configuration guidelines, the proxy parameter must use either HTTP or HTTPS and be in the form https://user:password@hostname:port. The agent can parse the parameter without the HTTP or HTTPS, but the log-forwarder cannot. You will see an error like the following in the agent verbose logs: [ERROR] building HTTP transport: parse \\\"hostname:port\\\": first path segment in URL cannot contain colon Copy To solve this problem, check your newrelic-infra.yml file, and ensure the proxy parameter adheres to this form. Send the agent's logs to New Relic You can configure the infrastructure agent to send its own logs to New Relic. This is useful for troubleshooting issues with log forwarding, the agent, or when contacting support. To forward the infrastructure agent logs to New Relic: Edit your newrelic-infra.yml file. Enable agent logging in troubleshooting mode by adding verbose: 3 Important On Windows and systems that don't use systemd or where journald is inaccessible, verbose:3 causes the agent to write the logs on the disk. Revert to verbose:0 to prevent this. (Recommended): Enable agent logging in JSON format to log_format: json. Restart the agent to load the new settings. This configuration sets up the agent in troubleshooting mode, but the log forwarder (based on Fluent Bit) will continue in a non-verbose mode. Sometimes you can have issues with the log forwarder itself. For example, there may be problems accessing a specific channel when shipping Windows log events or when accessing a particular log file. In these situations, you can also enable the verbose mode for the log forwarder: Set verbose to a value other than 0. Add the following configuration option: trace: [\"log.fw\"]. Caution Check whether you are using the fluentbit option. When setting verbose: 3 and trace: [\"log.fw\"], ensure that you don't define any [OUTPUT] section pointing to stdout in an external Fluent Bit configuration file, Fluent Bit does not start with the infra-agent For Linux versions previous to 2016 you may need to update the OpenSSL library to 1.1.0 (or higher). To check if you have this problem: See if infra-agenthas started Fluent Bit by doing ps -aux | grep fluent-bit Copy If it isn't running go to /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/logging and run ./fluent-bit -i systemd -o stdout Copy If you get the following error, update OpenSSL to 1.1.0 or higher: error while loading shared libraries: libssl.so.1.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory Runtime error on Windows One of the following error messages may appear when enabling log forwarding on Windows: The code execution cannot proceed because VCRUNTIME140.dll was not found. Copy OR error=\"exit status 3221225781\" process=log-forwarder Copy This is caused by a missing DLL. To solve the issue, install the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable: x64 or x86. What's next? Now that you've enabled Logs, here are some potential next steps: Explore your data using the Logs UI.

Tip To use log management and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Enable log forwarding using the infrastructure agent To enable log forwarding through the infrastructure agent: Start by verifying the system requirements needed for configuring Logs. Ensure you have installed the infrastructure agent, version 1.11.4 or higher. Create a logging.yml file in the infrastructure agent's logging.d directory. Configure your log sources and other parameters. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your account for data. Explore your log data in the Logs UI and benefit from the log attributes automatically inserted by the infrastructure agent. System Requirements To use the log forwarder of the infrastructure agent, make sure you meet the following requirements: Infrastructure agent version 1.11.4 or higher OpenSSL library 1.1.0 or higher is required by infra-agent starting from v1.16.4. The log forwarding feature is compatible with the following operating systems: Operating system Supported version Amazon Linux Amazon Linux 2 CentOS Version 7 or higher Debian Version 9 (\"Stretch\") or higher Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) Version 7 or higher SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) Version 12 Ubuntu Versions 16.04.x, 18.04.x and 20.04.x (LTS versions) Windows Windows Server 2012, 2016, and 2019, and their service packs. Windows 10 Caution The log forwarding feature is not supported on containerized infrastructure agents. Install the infrastructure agent Starting with version 1.11.4, the infrastructure agent can forward logs to New Relic. To install and run the agent, use a package manager (Linux) or the MSI installer (Windows). To use the following links, make sure you are logged to your New Relic account. Amazon Linux CentOS Debian RHEL SLES Ubuntu Windows If you don't have a New Relic account yet, or prefer to follow the procedure manually, see our tutorial to install the package manager. Configure the infrastructure agent Configuration files describe which log sources are forwarded. The Infrastructure agent uses .yml files for configuring logging. You can add as many config files as you want. To add a new configuration file for the log forwarding feature: Navigate to the logging forwarder configuration folder: Linux: /etc/newrelic-infra/logging.d/ Windows: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\logging.d\\ Create a logging.yml configuration file and add the parameters you need. The logging.d directory has various .yml.example files that can be used as a reference or starting point. The agent automatically processes new configuration files without having to restart the Infrastructure service. The only exception to this is when configuring a custom Fluent Bit configuration. Log forwarding parameters The infrastructure log forwarding .yml config supports the following parameters: Name (required) To start, make sure to define a name for the logs you want to forward: name Name of the log or logs being forwarding to New Relic. Log source (required) What you use for the log source will depend on where you want to forward your logs from. The available options are listed below: file Path to the log file or files. The agent tracks changes on the log files in a way similar to tail -f shell. Example: logs: - name: example-log file: /var/log/example.log # Path to a single log file - name: example-log-two file: /var/log/example-two.log # Path to another single log file Copy The file parameter can point to a specific log file or multiple files by using wildcards applied to names and extensions; for example, /logs/*.log. You can use wildcards in place of directories in a file path, which can be used to tail files located in different directories. Example: logs: - name: docker-logs file: /var/lib/docker/containers/*/*.log # Path to multiple folders and files Copy Important Use of wildcards may significantly increase the number of file descriptors the Fluent Bit process keeps open, which can interfere with log collection if the host's file descriptor limit is reached. We recommend increasing the file descriptor limit on Linux hosts running Fluent Bit by adding the following to the host's /etc/security/limits.conf file: root soft nofile 65536 root hard nofile 65536 *soft nofile 65536 *hard nofile 65536 Copy If you add these changes, reboot the host to ensure your changes are applied. systemd Use the systemd paramater to forward log messages that are collected by the journald daemon in Linux environments. This input type requires the agent to run in root mode. Example: logs: - name: systemd-example systemd: cupsd Copy syslog Syslog data source. Parameters: uri: Syslog socket. Format varies depending on the protocol: TCP/UDP network sockets: [tcp/udp]://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT Unix domain sockets: unix_[tcp/udp]:// + /socket/path parser: Syslog parser. Default is rfc3164. Use rfc5424 if your messages include fractional seconds. Note: rfc3164 currently does not work on SuSE. unix_permissions: default is 0644 for domain sockets; this limits entries to processes running as root. You can use 0666 to listen for non-root processes, at your own risk. When running the agent in privileged mode, ports and sockets must be available or owned by nri-agent, with 0666 file permissions, so that other processes can write logs to the sockets. logs: # TCP network socket - name: syslog-tcp-test syslog: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:5140 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format parser: rfc5424 # Default syslog parser is rfc3164 # UDP network socket - name: syslog-udp-test syslog: uri: udp://0.0.0.0:6140 # Use the udp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format max_line_kb: 35 # Unix TCP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-tcp-test syslog: uri: unix_tcp:///var/unix-tcp-socket-test unix_permissions: 0666 # Default is 0644. Change at your own risk # Unix UDP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-udp-test syslog: uri: unix_udp:///var/unix-udp-socket-test parser: rfc5424 Copy tcp Logs retrieved over TCP connections. Parameters: uri: TCP/IP socket to listen for incoming data. The URI format is tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format: format of the data. It can be json or none. separator: If format: none is used, you can define a separator string for splitting records (default: \\n). logs: - name: tcp-simple-test tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:1234 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format format: none # Raw text - this is default for 'tcp' separator: \\t # String for separating raw text entries max_line_kb: 32 - name: tcp-json-test tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:2345 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format format: json Copy winlog Collect events from Windows log channels. Parameters: channel: name of the channel logs will be collected from. collect-eventids: a list of Windows Event IDs to be collected and forwarded to New Relic. Event ID ranges are supported. exclude-eventids: a list of Windows Event IDs to be excluded from collection. Event ID ranges are supported. All events are collected from the specified channel by default. Configure the collect-eventids and exclude-eventids sections to avoid sending unwanted logs to your New Relic account. Add event IDs or ranges to collect-eventids or exclude-eventids to forward or drop specific events. exclude-eventids takes precedence over collect-eventids if the same event ID is present in both sections. Example: logs: # Winlog log ingestion with eventId filters. - name: windows-security winlog: channel: Security collect-eventids: - 4624 - 4265 - 4700-4800 exclude-eventids: - 4735 # entries for the application, system, powershell, and SCOM channels - name: windows-application winlog: channel: Application - name: windows-system winlog: channel: System - name: windows-pshell winlog: channel: Windows Powershell - name: scom winlog: channel: Operations Manager # Entry for Windows Defender Logs - name: windows-defender winlog: channel: Microsoft-Windows-Windows Defender/Operational # Entry for Windows Clustering Logs - name: windows-clustering winlog: channel: Microsoft-Windows-FailoverClustering/Operational # Entry for IIS logs with logtype attribute for automatic parsing - name: iis-log file: C:\\inetpub\\logs\\LogFiles\\w3svc.log attributes: logtype: iis_w3c Copy Optional Configuration The following are configuration paramaters that are not required but are still recommended. attributes List of custom attributes as key-value pairs that can be used to send additional data with the logs which you can then query. Add attributes to any log source. Example: logs: - name: example-file-attributes file: /var/log/example.log attributes: logtype: nginx region: example-us-02 team: A-team - name: example-tcp-attributes tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:2345 format: json attributes: logtype: nginx region: example-us-02 team: B-team Copy Log attributes automatically inserted by the infrastructure agent(#automatically-inserted-attributes) The infrastructure agent automatically inserts log attributes for your convenience. Some of them are inserted for any log record, while others depend on the configuration parameters you used while setting up the log forwarder. Find a summary of these attributes in the following table: Attribute name Inserting conditions Description entity.guids Always inserted The infrastructure agent inserts the Entity GUID assigned by New Relic to identify the host where it's running. It is available in the entity.guids field. Note: If the captured logs belong to an application instrumented using APM, the entity.guids field contains both the entity GUID of infrastructure, as well as the GUID of APM, separated by a pipe ( | ) delimiter. fb.input Always inserted The underlying Fluent Bit input plugin type used to capture the logs. Currently, its values are tail, systemd, winlog, syslog, and tcp. filePath When using the file input type Absolute file path of the file being monitored. hostname Always inserted The hostname of the machine/VM/container executing the infrastructure agent. plugin.type Always inserted Indicates the utility used to capture the logs. In this case, it is the infrastructure agent itself, so this attribute always has the value nri-agent. pattern Regular expression for filtering records. Only supported for the tail, systemd, syslog, and tcp (only with format none) sources. This field works in a way similar to grep -E in Unix systems. For example, for a given file being captured, you can filter for records containing either WARN or ERROR using: - name: only-records-with-warn-and-error file: /var/log/logFile.log pattern: WARN|ERROR Copy No filtering is applied by default. max_line_kb Maximum size of log entries/lines in KB. If log entries exceed the limit, they are skipped. Default is 128. fluentbit External Fluent Bit configuration and parser files. If defined, they are merged with the existing configuration and parser files generated by the infrastructure agent. The infrastructure agent processes the configuration files located in the logging.d directory and will generate a run-time Fluent Bit configuration file that contains the appropriate [INPUT], [FILTER] and [OUTPUT] sections. Optionally, it will also declare an @INCLUDE in case you provided an external Fluent Bit configuration file via the fluentbit option. The runtime file does not define a [SERVICE] section, leaving all default Fluent Bit configuration values. You can still override Fluent Bit's default settings by defining your own [SERVICE] section in your external Fluent Bit configuration file and include it via the fluentbit option. Parameters: config_file: path to an existing Fluent Bit configuration file. Note that any overlapping source results in duplicate messages in New Relic Logs. parsers_file: path to an existing Fluent Bit parsers file. The following parser names are reserved: rfc3164, rfc3164-local and rfc5424. Sample configuration file Here is an example of a logging.d/ configuration file in YAML format. For more configuration examples, see the infrastructure agent repository. logging.d/sample.yaml # Remember to only use spaces for indentation logs: # Example of 'file' source - name: file-with-attributes file: /var/log/test.log # Path to a single file or pattern attributes: # You can use custom attributes to enrich your data logtype: nginx team: The A Team pattern: Error # Regular expression to filter log entries # Example of 'systemd' source (Linux only) - name: systemd-example systemd: cupsd # Examples of 'syslog' source, one per protocol # TCP network socket - name: syslog-tcp-test syslog: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:5140 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format parser: rfc5424 # Default syslog parser is rfc3164 # UDP network socket - name: syslog-udp-test syslog: uri: udp://0.0.0.0:6140 # Use the udp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format max_line_kb: 35 # Paths for Unix sockets are defined by combining protocol and path: # unix_udp:// + /path/socket - for example, unix_udp:///tmp/socket # Unix TCP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-tcp-test syslog: uri: unix_tcp:///var/unix-tcp-socket-test unix_permissions: 0666 # Default is 0644.

No data appears when tailing a file The log forwarding feature requires the agent to have permission to read the data sources. When running the infrastructure agent in privileged or non-privileged modes, make sure that the log files you want to forward (and any intermediary directory in its path) are readable by the user running nri-agent. Example: checking file access under Linux Let's check whether the file /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log can be monitored by the nri-agent user. In Linux, you can do a quick check with the namei command: sudo -u nri-agent namei -ml /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log f: /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log drwxr-xr-x root root / drwxr-xr-x root root var drwxrwxr-x root syslog log drwxr--r-- root root restrictedLogs logFile.log - No such file or directory Copy This command failed because the file is not visible to the nri-agent user. By inspecting the previous output, we can detect that the restrictedLogs directory is missing the execution flag for others\". We can fix this by executing: sudo chmod 755 /var/log/restrictedLogs Copy And then check for file access again: # sudo -u nri-agent namei -ml /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log f: /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log drwxr-xr-x root root / drwxr-xr-x root root var drwxrwxr-x root syslog log drwxr-xr-x root root restrictedLogs -rw-r----- vagrant vagrant logFile.log Copy The file is now visible to the nri-agent user. You must ensure that the file is also readable by the nri-agent user. To check this, use: # sudo -u nri-agent head /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log head: cannot open '/var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log' for reading: Permission denied Copy In this example, the file is missing the read rights for the others group (users other than vagrant and the vagrant user group). You could fix this by granting read permissions to others, but the application could change these permissions upon restart. To avoid this, a better approach is to add the nri-agent user to the vagrant user group. No data appears when capturing via a Syslog socket The log forwarding feature requires that the agent has permission to read the data sources. When running the infrastructure agent in privileged or non-privileged modes: If you're using Unix domain socket files, make sure that the nri-agent user can access these files (please refer to the previous section) and that they have read and write permissions (666) so that other users than nri-agent can write to them. If you're using IP sockets, ensure that the port that you are using is not a system reserved one (like port 80, for example). If no data appears after you enable log management, follow standard log management troubleshooting procedures. No data appears using infrastructure agent proxy As explained in the infrastructure agent configuration guidelines, the proxy parameter must use either HTTP or HTTPS and be in the form https://user:password@hostname:port. The agent can parse the parameter without the HTTP or HTTPS, but the log-forwarder cannot. You will see an error like the following in the agent verbose logs: [ERROR] building HTTP transport: parse \\\"hostname:port\\\": first path segment in URL cannot contain colon Copy To solve this problem, check your newrelic-infra.yml file, and ensure the proxy parameter adheres to this form. Send the agent's logs to New Relic You can configure the infrastructure agent to send its own logs to New Relic. This is useful for troubleshooting issues with log forwarding, the agent, or when contacting support. To forward the infrastructure agent logs to New Relic: Edit your newrelic-infra.yml file. Enable agent logging in troubleshooting mode by adding verbose: 3 Important On Windows and systems that don't use systemd or where journald is inaccessible, verbose:3 causes the agent to write the logs on the disk. Revert to verbose:0 to prevent this. (Recommended): Enable agent logging in JSON format to log_format: json. Restart the agent to load the new settings. This configuration sets up the agent in troubleshooting mode, but the log forwarder (based on Fluent Bit) will continue in a non-verbose mode. Sometimes you can have issues with the log forwarder itself. For example, there may be problems accessing a specific channel when shipping Windows log events or when accessing a particular log file. In these situations, you can also enable the verbose mode for the log forwarder: Set verbose to a value other than 0. Add the following configuration option: trace: [\"log.fw\"]. Caution Check whether you are using the fluentbit option. When setting verbose: 3 and trace: [\"log.fw\"], ensure that you don't define any [OUTPUT] section pointing to stdout in an external Fluent Bit configuration file, Fluent Bit does not start with the infra-agent For Linux versions previous to 2016 you may need to update the OpenSSL library to 1.1.0 (or higher). To check if you have this problem: See if infra-agenthas started Fluent Bit by doing ps -aux | grep fluent-bit Copy If it isn't running go to /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/logging and run ./fluent-bit -i systemd -o stdout Copy If you get the following error, update OpenSSL to 1.1.0 or higher: error while loading shared libraries: libssl.so.1.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory Runtime error on Windows One of the following error messages may appear when enabling log forwarding on Windows: The code execution cannot proceed because VCRUNTIME140.dll was not found. Copy OR error=\"exit status 3221225781\" process=log-forwarder Copy This is caused by a missing DLL. To solve the issue, install the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable: x64 or x86. What's next?

Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Enable log forwarding using the infrastructure agent To enable log forwarding through the infrastructure agent: Start by verifying the system requirements needed for configuring Logs. Ensure you have installed the infrastructure agent, version 1.11.4 or higher. Create a logging.yml file in the infrastructure agent's logging.d directory. Configure your log sources and other parameters. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your account for data. Explore your log data in the Logs UI and benefit from the log attributes automatically inserted by the infrastructure agent. System Requirements To use the log forwarder of the infrastructure agent, make sure you meet the following requirements: Infrastructure agent version 1.11.4 or higher OpenSSL library 1.1.0 or higher is required by infra-agent starting from v1.16.4. The log forwarding feature is compatible with the following operating systems: Operating system Supported version Amazon Linux Amazon Linux 2 CentOS Version 7 or higher Debian Version 9 (\"Stretch\") or higher Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) Version 7 or higher SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) Version 12 Ubuntu Versions 16.04.x, 18.04.x and 20.04.x (LTS versions) Windows Windows Server 2012, 2016, and 2019, and their service packs. Windows 10 Caution The log forwarding feature is not supported on containerized infrastructure agents. Install the infrastructure agent Starting with version 1.11.4, the infrastructure agent can forward logs to New Relic. To install and run the agent, use a package manager (Linux) or the MSI installer (Windows). To use the following links, make sure you are logged to your New Relic account. Amazon Linux CentOS Debian RHEL SLES Ubuntu Windows If you don't have a New Relic account yet, or prefer to follow the procedure manually, see our tutorial to install the package manager. Configure the infrastructure agent Configuration files describe which log sources are forwarded. The Infrastructure agent uses .yml files for configuring logging. You can add as many config files as you want. To add a new configuration file for the log forwarding feature: Navigate to the logging forwarder configuration folder: Linux: /etc/newrelic-infra/logging.d/ Windows: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\logging.d\\ Create a logging.yml configuration file and add the parameters you need. The logging.d directory has various .yml.example files that can be used as a reference or starting point. The agent automatically processes new configuration files without having to restart the Infrastructure service. The only exception to this is when configuring a custom Fluent Bit configuration. Log forwarding parameters The infrastructure log forwarding .yml config supports the following parameters: Name (required) To start, make sure to define a name for the logs you want to forward: name Name of the log or logs being forwarding to New Relic. Log source (required) What you use for the log source will depend on where you want to forward your logs from. The available options are listed below: file Path to the log file or files. The agent tracks changes on the log files in a way similar to tail -f shell. Example: logs: - name: example-log file: /var/log/example.log # Path to a single log file - name: example-log-two file: /var/log/example-two.log # Path to another single log file Copy The file parameter can point to a specific log file or multiple files by using wildcards applied to names and extensions; for example, /logs/*.log. You can use wildcards in place of directories in a file path, which can be used to tail files located in different directories. Example: logs: - name: docker-logs file: /var/lib/docker/containers/*/*.log # Path to multiple folders and files Copy Important Use of wildcards may significantly increase the number of file descriptors the Fluent Bit process keeps open, which can interfere with log collection if the host's file descriptor limit is reached. We recommend increasing the file descriptor limit on Linux hosts running Fluent Bit by adding the following to the host's /etc/security/limits.conf file: root soft nofile 65536 root hard nofile 65536 *soft nofile 65536 *hard nofile 65536 Copy If you add these changes, reboot the host to ensure your changes are applied. systemd Use the systemd paramater to forward log messages that are collected by the journald daemon in Linux environments. This input type requires the agent to run in root mode. Example: logs: - name: systemd-example systemd: cupsd Copy syslog Syslog data source. Parameters: uri: Syslog socket. Format varies depending on the protocol: TCP/UDP network sockets: [tcp/udp]://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT Unix domain sockets: unix_[tcp/udp]:// + /socket/path parser: Syslog parser. Default is rfc3164. Use rfc5424 if your messages include fractional seconds. Note: rfc3164 currently does not work on SuSE. unix_permissions: default is 0644 for domain sockets; this limits entries to processes running as root. You can use 0666 to listen for non-root processes, at your own risk. When running the agent in privileged mode, ports and sockets must be available or owned by nri-agent, with 0666 file permissions, so that other processes can write logs to the sockets. logs: # TCP network socket - name: syslog-tcp-test syslog: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:5140 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format parser: rfc5424 # Default syslog parser is rfc3164 # UDP network socket - name: syslog-udp-test syslog: uri: udp://0.0.0.0:6140 # Use the udp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format max_line_kb: 35 # Unix TCP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-tcp-test syslog: uri: unix_tcp:///var/unix-tcp-socket-test unix_permissions: 0666 # Default is 0644. Change at your own risk # Unix UDP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-udp-test syslog: uri: unix_udp:///var/unix-udp-socket-test parser: rfc5424 Copy tcp Logs retrieved over TCP connections. Parameters: uri: TCP/IP socket to listen for incoming data. The URI format is tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format: format of the data. It can be json or none. separator: If format: none is used, you can define a separator string for splitting records (default: \\n). logs: - name: tcp-simple-test tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:1234 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format format: none # Raw text - this is default for 'tcp' separator: \\t # String for separating raw text entries max_line_kb: 32 - name: tcp-json-test tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:2345 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format format: json Copy winlog Collect events from Windows log channels. Parameters: channel: name of the channel logs will be collected from. collect-eventids: a list of Windows Event IDs to be collected and forwarded to New Relic. Event ID ranges are supported. exclude-eventids: a list of Windows Event IDs to be excluded from collection. Event ID ranges are supported. All events are collected from the specified channel by default. Configure the collect-eventids and exclude-eventids sections to avoid sending unwanted logs to your New Relic account. Add event IDs or ranges to collect-eventids or exclude-eventids to forward or drop specific events. exclude-eventids takes precedence over collect-eventids if the same event ID is present in both sections. Example: logs: # Winlog log ingestion with eventId filters. - name: windows-security winlog: channel: Security collect-eventids: - 4624 - 4265 - 4700-4800 exclude-eventids: - 4735 # entries for the application, system, powershell, and SCOM channels - name: windows-application winlog: channel: Application - name: windows-system winlog: channel: System - name: windows-pshell winlog: channel: Windows Powershell - name: scom winlog: channel: Operations Manager # Entry for Windows Defender Logs - name: windows-defender winlog: channel: Microsoft-Windows-Windows Defender/Operational # Entry for Windows Clustering Logs - name: windows-clustering winlog: channel: Microsoft-Windows-FailoverClustering/Operational # Entry for IIS logs with logtype attribute for automatic parsing - name: iis-log file: C:\\inetpub\\logs\\LogFiles\\w3svc.log attributes: logtype: iis_w3c Copy Optional Configuration The following are configuration paramaters that are not required but are still recommended. attributes List of custom attributes as key-value pairs that can be used to send additional data with the logs which you can then query. Add attributes to any log source. Example: logs: - name: example-file-attributes file: /var/log/example.log attributes: logtype: nginx region: example-us-02 team: A-team - name: example-tcp-attributes tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:2345 format: json attributes: logtype: nginx region: example-us-02 team: B-team Copy Log attributes automatically inserted by the infrastructure agent(#automatically-inserted-attributes) The infrastructure agent automatically inserts log attributes for your convenience. Some of them are inserted for any log record, while others depend on the configuration parameters you used while setting up the log forwarder. Find a summary of these attributes in the following table: Attribute name Inserting conditions Description entity.guids Always inserted The infrastructure agent inserts the Entity GUID assigned by New Relic to identify the host where it's running. It is available in the entity.guids field. Note: If the captured logs belong to an application instrumented using APM, the entity.guids field contains both the entity GUID of infrastructure, as well as the GUID of APM, separated by a pipe ( | ) delimiter. fb.input Always inserted The underlying Fluent Bit input plugin type used to capture the logs. Currently, its values are tail, systemd, winlog, syslog, and tcp. filePath When using the file input type Absolute file path of the file being monitored. hostname Always inserted The hostname of the machine/VM/container executing the infrastructure agent. plugin.type Always inserted Indicates the utility used to capture the logs. In this case, it is the infrastructure agent itself, so this attribute always has the value nri-agent. pattern Regular expression for filtering records. Only supported for the tail, systemd, syslog, and tcp (only with format none) sources. This field works in a way similar to grep -E in Unix systems. For example, for a given file being captured, you can filter for records containing either WARN or ERROR using: - name: only-records-with-warn-and-error file: /var/log/logFile.log pattern: WARN|ERROR Copy No filtering is applied by default. max_line_kb Maximum size of log entries/lines in KB. If log entries exceed the limit, they are skipped. Default is 128. fluentbit External Fluent Bit configuration and parser files. If defined, they are merged with the existing configuration and parser files generated by the infrastructure agent. The infrastructure agent processes the configuration files located in the logging.d directory and will generate a run-time Fluent Bit configuration file that contains the appropriate [INPUT], [FILTER] and [OUTPUT] sections. Optionally, it will also declare an @INCLUDE in case you provided an external Fluent Bit configuration file via the fluentbit option. The runtime file does not define a [SERVICE] section, leaving all default Fluent Bit configuration values. You can still override Fluent Bit's default settings by defining your own [SERVICE] section in your external Fluent Bit configuration file and include it via the fluentbit option. Parameters: config_file: path to an existing Fluent Bit configuration file. Note that any overlapping source results in duplicate messages in New Relic Logs. parsers_file: path to an existing Fluent Bit parsers file. The following parser names are reserved: rfc3164, rfc3164-local and rfc5424. Sample configuration file Here is an example of a logging.d/ configuration file in YAML format. For more configuration examples, see the infrastructure agent repository. logging.d/sample.yaml # Remember to only use spaces for indentation logs: # Example of 'file' source - name: file-with-attributes file: /var/log/test.log # Path to a single file or pattern attributes: # You can use custom attributes to enrich your data logtype: nginx team: The A Team pattern: Error # Regular expression to filter log entries # Example of 'systemd' source (Linux only) - name: systemd-example systemd: cupsd # Examples of 'syslog' source, one per protocol # TCP network socket - name: syslog-tcp-test syslog: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:5140 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format parser: rfc5424 # Default syslog parser is rfc3164 # UDP network socket - name: syslog-udp-test syslog: uri: udp://0.0.0.0:6140 # Use the udp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format max_line_kb: 35 # Paths for Unix sockets are defined by combining protocol and path: # unix_udp:// + /path/socket - for example, unix_udp:///tmp/socket # Unix TCP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-tcp-test syslog: uri: unix_tcp:///var/unix-tcp-socket-test unix_permissions: 0666 # Default is 0644.

No data appears when tailing a file The log forwarding feature requires the agent to have permission to read the data sources. When running the infrastructure agent in privileged or non-privileged modes, make sure that the log files you want to forward (and any intermediary directory in its path) are readable by the user running nri-agent. Example: checking file access under Linux Let's check whether the file /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log can be monitored by the nri-agent user. In Linux, you can do a quick check with the namei command: sudo -u nri-agent namei -ml /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log f: /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log drwxr-xr-x root root / drwxr-xr-x root root var drwxrwxr-x root syslog log drwxr--r-- root root restrictedLogs logFile.log - No such file or directory Copy This command failed because the file is not visible to the nri-agent user. By inspecting the previous output, we can detect that the restrictedLogs directory is missing the execution flag for others\". We can fix this by executing: sudo chmod 755 /var/log/restrictedLogs Copy And then check for file access again: # sudo -u nri-agent namei -ml /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log f: /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log drwxr-xr-x root root / drwxr-xr-x root root var drwxrwxr-x root syslog log drwxr-xr-x root root restrictedLogs -rw-r----- vagrant vagrant logFile.log Copy The file is now visible to the nri-agent user. You must ensure that the file is also readable by the nri-agent user. To check this, use: # sudo -u nri-agent head /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log head: cannot open '/var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log' for reading: Permission denied Copy In this example, the file is missing the read rights for the others group (users other than vagrant and the vagrant user group). You could fix this by granting read permissions to others, but the application could change these permissions upon restart. To avoid this, a better approach is to add the nri-agent user to the vagrant user group. No data appears when capturing via a Syslog socket The log forwarding feature requires that the agent has permission to read the data sources. When running the infrastructure agent in privileged or non-privileged modes: If you're using Unix domain socket files, make sure that the nri-agent user can access these files (please refer to the previous section) and that they have read and write permissions (666) so that other users than nri-agent can write to them. If you're using IP sockets, ensure that the port that you are using is not a system reserved one (like port 80, for example). If no data appears after you enable log management, follow standard log management troubleshooting procedures. No data appears using infrastructure agent proxy As explained in the infrastructure agent configuration guidelines, the proxy parameter must use either HTTP or HTTPS and be in the form https://user:password@hostname:port. The agent can parse the parameter without the HTTP or HTTPS, but the log-forwarder cannot. You will see an error like the following in the agent verbose logs: [ERROR] building HTTP transport: parse \\\"hostname:port\\\": first path segment in URL cannot contain colon Copy To solve this problem, check your newrelic-infra.yml file, and ensure the proxy parameter adheres to this form. Send the agent's logs to New Relic You can configure the infrastructure agent to send its own logs to New Relic. This is useful for troubleshooting issues with log forwarding, the agent, or when contacting support. To forward the infrastructure agent logs to New Relic: Edit your newrelic-infra.yml file. Enable agent logging in troubleshooting mode by adding verbose: 3 Important On Windows and systems that don't use systemd or where journald is inaccessible, verbose:3 causes the agent to write the logs on the disk. Revert to verbose:0 to prevent this. (Recommended): Enable agent logging in JSON format to log_format: json. Restart the agent to load the new settings. This configuration sets up the agent in troubleshooting mode, but the log forwarder (based on Fluent Bit) will continue in a non-verbose mode. Sometimes you can have issues with the log forwarder itself. For example, there may be problems accessing a specific channel when shipping Windows log events or when accessing a particular log file. In these situations, you can also enable the verbose mode for the log forwarder: Set verbose to a value other than 0. Add the following configuration option: trace: [\"log.fw\"]. Caution Check whether you are using the fluentbit option. When setting verbose: 3 and trace: [\"log.fw\"], ensure that you don't define any [OUTPUT] section pointing to stdout in an external Fluent Bit configuration file, Fluent Bit does not start with the infra-agent For Linux versions previous to 2016 you may need to update the OpenSSL library to 1.1.0 (or higher). To check if you have this problem: See if infra-agenthas started Fluent Bit by doing ps -aux | grep fluent-bit Copy If it isn't running go to /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/logging and run ./fluent-bit -i systemd -o stdout Copy If you get the following error, update OpenSSL to 1.1.0 or higher: error while loading shared libraries: libssl.so.1.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory Runtime error on Windows One of the following error messages may appear when enabling log forwarding on Windows: The code execution cannot proceed because VCRUNTIME140.dll was not found. Copy OR error=\"exit status 3221225781\" process=log-forwarder Copy This is caused by a missing DLL. To solve the issue, install the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable: x64 or x86. What's next? Now that you've enabled Logs, here are some potential next steps: Explore your data using the Logs UI.

Tip To use log management and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Enable log forwarding using the infrastructure agent To enable log forwarding through the infrastructure agent: Start by verifying the system requirements needed for configuring Logs. Ensure you have installed the infrastructure agent, version 1.11.4 or higher. Create a logging.yml file in the infrastructure agent's logging.d directory. Configure your log sources and other parameters. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your account for data. Explore your log data in the Logs UI and benefit from the log attributes automatically inserted by the infrastructure agent. System Requirements To use the log forwarder of the infrastructure agent, make sure you meet the following requirements: Infrastructure agent version 1.11.4 or higher OpenSSL library 1.1.0 or higher is required by infra-agent starting from v1.16.4. The log forwarding feature is compatible with the following operating systems: Operating system Supported version Amazon Linux Amazon Linux 2 CentOS Version 7 or higher Debian Version 9 (\"Stretch\") or higher Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) Version 7 or higher SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) Version 12 Ubuntu Versions 16.04.x, 18.04.x and 20.04.x (LTS versions) Windows Windows Server 2012, 2016, and 2019, and their service packs. Windows 10 Caution The log forwarding feature is not supported on containerized infrastructure agents. Install the infrastructure agent Starting with version 1.11.4, the infrastructure agent can forward logs to New Relic. To install and run the agent, use a package manager (Linux) or the MSI installer (Windows). To use the following links, make sure you are logged to your New Relic account. Amazon Linux CentOS Debian RHEL SLES Ubuntu Windows If you don't have a New Relic account yet, or prefer to follow the procedure manually, see our tutorial to install the package manager. Configure the infrastructure agent Configuration files describe which log sources are forwarded. The Infrastructure agent uses .yml files for configuring logging. You can add as many config files as you want. To add a new configuration file for the log forwarding feature: Navigate to the logging forwarder configuration folder: Linux: /etc/newrelic-infra/logging.d/ Windows: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\logging.d\\ Create a logging.yml configuration file and add the parameters you need. The logging.d directory has various .yml.example files that can be used as a reference or starting point. The agent automatically processes new configuration files without having to restart the Infrastructure service. The only exception to this is when configuring a custom Fluent Bit configuration. Log forwarding parameters The infrastructure log forwarding .yml config supports the following parameters: Name (required) To start, make sure to define a name for the logs you want to forward: name Name of the log or logs being forwarding to New Relic. Log source (required) What you use for the log source will depend on where you want to forward your logs from. The available options are listed below: file Path to the log file or files. The agent tracks changes on the log files in a way similar to tail -f shell. Example: logs: - name: example-log file: /var/log/example.log # Path to a single log file - name: example-log-two file: /var/log/example-two.log # Path to another single log file Copy The file parameter can point to a specific log file or multiple files by using wildcards applied to names and extensions; for example, /logs/*.log. You can use wildcards in place of directories in a file path, which can be used to tail files located in different directories. Example: logs: - name: docker-logs file: /var/lib/docker/containers/*/*.log # Path to multiple folders and files Copy Important Use of wildcards may significantly increase the number of file descriptors the Fluent Bit process keeps open, which can interfere with log collection if the host's file descriptor limit is reached. We recommend increasing the file descriptor limit on Linux hosts running Fluent Bit by adding the following to the host's /etc/security/limits.conf file: root soft nofile 65536 root hard nofile 65536 *soft nofile 65536 *hard nofile 65536 Copy If you add these changes, reboot the host to ensure your changes are applied. systemd Use the systemd paramater to forward log messages that are collected by the journald daemon in Linux environments. This input type requires the agent to run in root mode. Example: logs: - name: systemd-example systemd: cupsd Copy syslog Syslog data source. Parameters: uri: Syslog socket. Format varies depending on the protocol: TCP/UDP network sockets: [tcp/udp]://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT Unix domain sockets: unix_[tcp/udp]:// + /socket/path parser: Syslog parser. Default is rfc3164. Use rfc5424 if your messages include fractional seconds. Note: rfc3164 currently does not work on SuSE. unix_permissions: default is 0644 for domain sockets; this limits entries to processes running as root. You can use 0666 to listen for non-root processes, at your own risk. When running the agent in privileged mode, ports and sockets must be available or owned by nri-agent, with 0666 file permissions, so that other processes can write logs to the sockets. logs: # TCP network socket - name: syslog-tcp-test syslog: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:5140 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format parser: rfc5424 # Default syslog parser is rfc3164 # UDP network socket - name: syslog-udp-test syslog: uri: udp://0.0.0.0:6140 # Use the udp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format max_line_kb: 35 # Unix TCP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-tcp-test syslog: uri: unix_tcp:///var/unix-tcp-socket-test unix_permissions: 0666 # Default is 0644. Change at your own risk # Unix UDP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-udp-test syslog: uri: unix_udp:///var/unix-udp-socket-test parser: rfc5424 Copy tcp Logs retrieved over TCP connections. Parameters: uri: TCP/IP socket to listen for incoming data. The URI format is tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format: format of the data. It can be json or none. separator: If format: none is used, you can define a separator string for splitting records (default: \\n). logs: - name: tcp-simple-test tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:1234 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format format: none # Raw text - this is default for 'tcp' separator: \\t # String for separating raw text entries max_line_kb: 32 - name: tcp-json-test tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:2345 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format format: json Copy winlog Collect events from Windows log channels. Parameters: channel: name of the channel logs will be collected from. collect-eventids: a list of Windows Event IDs to be collected and forwarded to New Relic. Event ID ranges are supported. exclude-eventids: a list of Windows Event IDs to be excluded from collection. Event ID ranges are supported. All events are collected from the specified channel by default. Configure the collect-eventids and exclude-eventids sections to avoid sending unwanted logs to your New Relic account. Add event IDs or ranges to collect-eventids or exclude-eventids to forward or drop specific events. exclude-eventids takes precedence over collect-eventids if the same event ID is present in both sections. Example: logs: # Winlog log ingestion with eventId filters. - name: windows-security winlog: channel: Security collect-eventids: - 4624 - 4265 - 4700-4800 exclude-eventids: - 4735 # entries for the application, system, powershell, and SCOM channels - name: windows-application winlog: channel: Application - name: windows-system winlog: channel: System - name: windows-pshell winlog: channel: Windows Powershell - name: scom winlog: channel: Operations Manager # Entry for Windows Defender Logs - name: windows-defender winlog: channel: Microsoft-Windows-Windows Defender/Operational # Entry for Windows Clustering Logs - name: windows-clustering winlog: channel: Microsoft-Windows-FailoverClustering/Operational # Entry for IIS logs with logtype attribute for automatic parsing - name: iis-log file: C:\\inetpub\\logs\\LogFiles\\w3svc.log attributes: logtype: iis_w3c Copy Optional Configuration The following are configuration paramaters that are not required but are still recommended. attributes List of custom attributes as key-value pairs that can be used to send additional data with the logs which you can then query. Add attributes to any log source. Example: logs: - name: example-file-attributes file: /var/log/example.log attributes: logtype: nginx region: example-us-02 team: A-team - name: example-tcp-attributes tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:2345 format: json attributes: logtype: nginx region: example-us-02 team: B-team Copy Log attributes automatically inserted by the infrastructure agent(#automatically-inserted-attributes) The infrastructure agent automatically inserts log attributes for your convenience. Some of them are inserted for any log record, while others depend on the configuration parameters you used while setting up the log forwarder. Find a summary of these attributes in the following table: Attribute name Inserting conditions Description entity.guids Always inserted The infrastructure agent inserts the Entity GUID assigned by New Relic to identify the host where it's running. It is available in the entity.guids field. Note: If the captured logs belong to an application instrumented using APM, the entity.guids field contains both the entity GUID of infrastructure, as well as the GUID of APM, separated by a pipe ( | ) delimiter. fb.input Always inserted The underlying Fluent Bit input plugin type used to capture the logs. Currently, its values are tail, systemd, winlog, syslog, and tcp. filePath When using the file input type Absolute file path of the file being monitored. hostname Always inserted The hostname of the machine/VM/container executing the infrastructure agent. plugin.type Always inserted Indicates the utility used to capture the logs. In this case, it is the infrastructure agent itself, so this attribute always has the value nri-agent. pattern Regular expression for filtering records. Only supported for the tail, systemd, syslog, and tcp (only with format none) sources. This field works in a way similar to grep -E in Unix systems. For example, for a given file being captured, you can filter for records containing either WARN or ERROR using: - name: only-records-with-warn-and-error file: /var/log/logFile.log pattern: WARN|ERROR Copy No filtering is applied by default. max_line_kb Maximum size of log entries/lines in KB. If log entries exceed the limit, they are skipped. Default is 128. fluentbit External Fluent Bit configuration and parser files. If defined, they are merged with the existing configuration and parser files generated by the infrastructure agent. The infrastructure agent processes the configuration files located in the logging.d directory and will generate a run-time Fluent Bit configuration file that contains the appropriate [INPUT], [FILTER] and [OUTPUT] sections. Optionally, it will also declare an @INCLUDE in case you provided an external Fluent Bit configuration file via the fluentbit option. The runtime file does not define a [SERVICE] section, leaving all default Fluent Bit configuration values. You can still override Fluent Bit's default settings by defining your own [SERVICE] section in your external Fluent Bit configuration file and include it via the fluentbit option. Parameters: config_file: path to an existing Fluent Bit configuration file. Note that any overlapping source results in duplicate messages in New Relic Logs. parsers_file: path to an existing Fluent Bit parsers file. The following parser names are reserved: rfc3164, rfc3164-local and rfc5424. Sample configuration file Here is an example of a logging.d/ configuration file in YAML format. For more configuration examples, see the infrastructure agent repository. logging.d/sample.yaml # Remember to only use spaces for indentation logs: # Example of 'file' source - name: file-with-attributes file: /var/log/test.log # Path to a single file or pattern attributes: # You can use custom attributes to enrich your data logtype: nginx team: The A Team pattern: Error # Regular expression to filter log entries # Example of 'systemd' source (Linux only) - name: systemd-example systemd: cupsd # Examples of 'syslog' source, one per protocol # TCP network socket - name: syslog-tcp-test syslog: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:5140 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format parser: rfc5424 # Default syslog parser is rfc3164 # UDP network socket - name: syslog-udp-test syslog: uri: udp://0.0.0.0:6140 # Use the udp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format max_line_kb: 35 # Paths for Unix sockets are defined by combining protocol and path: # unix_udp:// + /path/socket - for example, unix_udp:///tmp/socket # Unix TCP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-tcp-test syslog: uri: unix_tcp:///var/unix-tcp-socket-test unix_permissions: 0666 # Default is 0644.

No data appears when tailing a file The log forwarding feature requires the agent to have permission to read the data sources. When running the infrastructure agent in privileged or non-privileged modes, make sure that the log files you want to forward (and any intermediary directory in its path) are readable by the user running nri-agent. Example: checking file access under Linux Let's check whether the file /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log can be monitored by the nri-agent user. In Linux, you can do a quick check with the namei command: sudo -u nri-agent namei -ml /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log f: /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log drwxr-xr-x root root / drwxr-xr-x root root var drwxrwxr-x root syslog log drwxr--r-- root root restrictedLogs logFile.log - No such file or directory Copy This command failed because the file is not visible to the nri-agent user. By inspecting the previous output, we can detect that the restrictedLogs directory is missing the execution flag for others\". We can fix this by executing: sudo chmod 755 /var/log/restrictedLogs Copy And then check for file access again: # sudo -u nri-agent namei -ml /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log f: /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log drwxr-xr-x root root / drwxr-xr-x root root var drwxrwxr-x root syslog log drwxr-xr-x root root restrictedLogs -rw-r----- vagrant vagrant logFile.log Copy The file is now visible to the nri-agent user. You must ensure that the file is also readable by the nri-agent user. To check this, use: # sudo -u nri-agent head /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log head: cannot open '/var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log' for reading: Permission denied Copy In this example, the file is missing the read rights for the others group (users other than vagrant and the vagrant user group). You could fix this by granting read permissions to others, but the application could change these permissions upon restart. To avoid this, a better approach is to add the nri-agent user to the vagrant user group. No data appears when capturing via a Syslog socket The log forwarding feature requires that the agent has permission to read the data sources. When running the infrastructure agent in privileged or non-privileged modes: If you're using Unix domain socket files, make sure that the nri-agent user can access these files (please refer to the previous section) and that they have read and write permissions (666) so that other users than nri-agent can write to them. If you're using IP sockets, ensure that the port that you are using is not a system reserved one (like port 80, for example). If no data appears after you enable log management, follow standard log management troubleshooting procedures. No data appears using infrastructure agent proxy As explained in the infrastructure agent configuration guidelines, the proxy parameter must use either HTTP or HTTPS and be in the form https://user:password@hostname:port. The agent can parse the parameter without the HTTP or HTTPS, but the log-forwarder cannot. You will see an error like the following in the agent verbose logs: [ERROR] building HTTP transport: parse \\\"hostname:port\\\": first path segment in URL cannot contain colon Copy To solve this problem, check your newrelic-infra.yml file, and ensure the proxy parameter adheres to this form. Send the agent's logs to New Relic You can configure the infrastructure agent to send its own logs to New Relic. This is useful for troubleshooting issues with log forwarding, the agent, or when contacting support. To forward the infrastructure agent logs to New Relic: Edit your newrelic-infra.yml file. Enable agent logging in troubleshooting mode by adding verbose: 3 Important On Windows and systems that don't use systemd or where journald is inaccessible, verbose:3 causes the agent to write the logs on the disk. Revert to verbose:0 to prevent this. (Recommended): Enable agent logging in JSON format to log_format: json. Restart the agent to load the new settings. This configuration sets up the agent in troubleshooting mode, but the log forwarder (based on Fluent Bit) will continue in a non-verbose mode. Sometimes you can have issues with the log forwarder itself. For example, there may be problems accessing a specific channel when shipping Windows log events or when accessing a particular log file. In these situations, you can also enable the verbose mode for the log forwarder: Set verbose to a value other than 0. Add the following configuration option: trace: [\"log.fw\"]. Caution Check whether you are using the fluentbit option. When setting verbose: 3 and trace: [\"log.fw\"], ensure that you don't define any [OUTPUT] section pointing to stdout in an external Fluent Bit configuration file, Fluent Bit does not start with the infra-agent For Linux versions previous to 2016 you may need to update the OpenSSL library to 1.1.0 (or higher). To check if you have this problem: See if infra-agenthas started Fluent Bit by doing ps -aux | grep fluent-bit Copy If it isn't running go to /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/logging and run ./fluent-bit -i systemd -o stdout Copy If you get the following error, update OpenSSL to 1.1.0 or higher: error while loading shared libraries: libssl.so.1.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory Runtime error on Windows One of the following error messages may appear when enabling log forwarding on Windows: The code execution cannot proceed because VCRUNTIME140.dll was not found. Copy OR error=\"exit status 3221225781\" process=log-forwarder Copy This is caused by a missing DLL. To solve the issue, install the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable: x64 or x86. What's next?

      "body": "You can forward your logs to New Relic using our infrastructure monitoring agent. This makes all of your logging data available in one location and provides deeper visibility into both your application and your platform performance data. Tip To use log management and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Enable log forwarding using the infrastructure agent To enable log forwarding through the infrastructure agent: Start by verifying the system requirements needed for configuring Logs. Ensure you have installed the infrastructure agent, version 1.11.4 or higher. Create a logging.yml file in the infrastructure agent's logging.d directory. Configure your log sources and other parameters. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your account for data. Explore your log data in the Logs UI and benefit from the log attributes automatically inserted by the infrastructure agent. System Requirements To use the log forwarder of the infrastructure agent, make sure you meet the following requirements: Infrastructure agent version 1.11.4 or higher OpenSSL library 1.1.0 or higher is required by infra-agent starting from v1.16.4. The log forwarding feature is compatible with the following operating systems: Operating system Supported version Amazon Linux Amazon Linux 2 CentOS Version 7 or higher Debian Version 9 (\"Stretch\") or higher Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) Version 7 or higher SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) Version 12 Ubuntu Versions 16.04.x, 18.04.x and 20.04.x (LTS versions) Windows Windows Server 2012, 2016, and 2019, and their service packs. Windows 10 Caution The log forwarding feature is not supported on containerized infrastructure agents. Install the infrastructure agent Starting with version 1.11.4, the infrastructure agent can forward logs to New Relic. To install and run the agent, use a package manager (Linux) or the MSI installer (Windows). To use the following links, make sure you are logged to your New Relic account. Amazon Linux CentOS Debian RHEL SLES Ubuntu Windows If you don't have a New Relic account yet, or prefer to follow the procedure manually, see our tutorial to install the package manager. Configure the infrastructure agent Configuration files describe which log sources are forwarded. The Infrastructure agent uses .yml files for configuring logging. You can add as many config files as you want. To add a new configuration file for the log forwarding feature: Navigate to the logging forwarder configuration folder: Linux: /etc/newrelic-infra/logging.d/ Windows: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\logging.d\\ Create a logging.yml configuration file and add the parameters you need. The logging.d directory has various .yml.example files that can be used as a reference or starting point. The agent automatically processes new configuration files without having to restart the Infrastructure service. The only exception to this is when configuring a custom Fluent Bit configuration. Log forwarding parameters The infrastructure log forwarding .yml config supports the following parameters: Name (required) To start, make sure to define a name for the logs you want to forward: name Name of the log or logs being forwarding to New Relic. Log source (required) What you use for the log source will depend on where you want to forward your logs from. The available options are listed below: file Path to the log file or files. The agent tracks changes on the log files in a way similar to tail -f shell. Example: logs: - name: example-log file: /var/log/example.log # Path to a single log file - name: example-log-two file: /var/log/example-two.log # Path to another single log file Copy The file parameter can point to a specific log file or multiple files by using wildcards applied to names and extensions; for example, /logs/*.log. You can use wildcards in place of directories in a file path, which can be used to tail files located in different directories. Example: logs: - name: docker-logs file: /var/lib/docker/containers/*/*.log # Path to multiple folders and files Copy Important Use of wildcards may significantly increase the number of file descriptors the Fluent Bit process keeps open, which can interfere with log collection if the host's file descriptor limit is reached. We recommend increasing the file descriptor limit on Linux hosts running Fluent Bit by adding the following to the host's /etc/security/limits.conf file: root soft nofile 65536 root hard nofile 65536 *soft nofile 65536 *hard nofile 65536 Copy If you add these changes, reboot the host to ensure your changes are applied. systemd Use the systemd paramater to forward log messages that are collected by the journald daemon in Linux environments. This input type requires the agent to run in root mode. Example: logs: - name: systemd-example systemd: cupsd Copy syslog Syslog data source. Parameters: uri: Syslog socket. Format varies depending on the protocol: TCP/UDP network sockets: [tcp/udp]://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT Unix domain sockets: unix_[tcp/udp]:// + /socket/path parser: Syslog parser. Default is rfc3164. Use rfc5424 if your messages include fractional seconds. Note: rfc3164 currently does not work on SuSE. unix_permissions: default is 0644 for domain sockets; this limits entries to processes running as root. You can use 0666 to listen for non-root processes, at your own risk. When running the agent in privileged mode, ports and sockets must be available or owned by nri-agent, with 0666 file permissions, so that other processes can write logs to the sockets. logs: # TCP network socket - name: syslog-tcp-test syslog: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:5140 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format parser: rfc5424 # Default syslog parser is rfc3164 # UDP network socket - name: syslog-udp-test syslog: uri: udp://0.0.0.0:6140 # Use the udp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format max_line_kb: 35 # Unix TCP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-tcp-test syslog: uri: unix_tcp:///var/unix-tcp-socket-test unix_permissions: 0666 # Default is 0644. Change at your own risk # Unix UDP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-udp-test syslog: uri: unix_udp:///var/unix-udp-socket-test parser: rfc5424 Copy tcp Logs retrieved over TCP connections. Parameters: uri: TCP/IP socket to listen for incoming data. The URI format is tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format: format of the data. It can be json or none. separator: If format: none is used, you can define a separator string for splitting records (default: \\n). logs: - name: tcp-simple-test tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:1234 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format format: none # Raw text - this is default for 'tcp' separator: \\t # String for separating raw text entries max_line_kb: 32 - name: tcp-json-test tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:2345 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format format: json Copy winlog Collect events from Windows log channels. Parameters: channel: name of the channel logs will be collected from. collect-eventids: a list of Windows Event IDs to be collected and forwarded to New Relic. Event ID ranges are supported. exclude-eventids: a list of Windows Event IDs to be excluded from collection. Event ID ranges are supported. All events are collected from the specified channel by default. Configure the collect-eventids and exclude-eventids sections to avoid sending unwanted logs to your New Relic account. Add event IDs or ranges to collect-eventids or exclude-eventids to forward or drop specific events. exclude-eventids takes precedence over collect-eventids if the same event ID is present in both sections. Example: logs: # Winlog log ingestion with eventId filters. - name: windows-security winlog: channel: Security collect-eventids: - 4624 - 4265 - 4700-4800 exclude-eventids: - 4735 # entries for the application, system, powershell, and SCOM channels - name: windows-application winlog: channel: Application - name: windows-system winlog: channel: System - name: windows-pshell winlog: channel: Windows Powershell - name: scom winlog: channel: Operations Manager # Entry for Windows Defender Logs - name: windows-defender winlog: channel: Microsoft-Windows-Windows Defender/Operational # Entry for Windows Clustering Logs - name: windows-clustering winlog: channel: Microsoft-Windows-FailoverClustering/Operational # Entry for IIS logs with logtype attribute for automatic parsing - name: iis-log file: C:\\inetpub\\logs\\LogFiles\\w3svc.log attributes: logtype: iis_w3c Copy Optional Configuration The following are configuration paramaters that are not required but are still recommended. attributes List of custom attributes as key-value pairs that can be used to send additional data with the logs which you can then query. Add attributes to any log source. Example: logs: - name: example-file-attributes file: /var/log/example.log attributes: logtype: nginx region: example-us-02 team: A-team - name: example-tcp-attributes tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:2345 format: json attributes: logtype: nginx region: example-us-02 team: B-team Copy Log attributes automatically inserted by the infrastructure agent(#automatically-inserted-attributes) The infrastructure agent automatically inserts log attributes for your convenience. Some of them are inserted for any log record, while others depend on the configuration parameters you used while setting up the log forwarder. Find a summary of these attributes in the following table: Attribute name Inserting conditions Description entity.guids Always inserted The infrastructure agent inserts the Entity GUID assigned by New Relic to identify the host where it's running. It is available in the entity.guids field. Note: If the captured logs belong to an application instrumented using APM, the entity.guids field contains both the entity GUID of infrastructure, as well as the GUID of APM, separated by a pipe ( | ) delimiter. fb.input Always inserted The underlying Fluent Bit input plugin type used to capture the logs. Currently, its values are tail, systemd, winlog, syslog, and tcp. filePath When using the file input type Absolute file path of the file being monitored. hostname Always inserted The hostname of the machine/VM/container executing the infrastructure agent. plugin.type Always inserted Indicates the utility used to capture the logs. In this case, it is the infrastructure agent itself, so this attribute always has the value nri-agent. pattern Regular expression for filtering records. Only supported for the tail, systemd, syslog, and tcp (only with format none) sources. This field works in a way similar to grep -E in Unix systems. For example, for a given file being captured, you can filter for records containing either WARN or ERROR using: - name: only-records-with-warn-and-error file: /var/log/logFile.log pattern: WARN|ERROR Copy No filtering is applied by default. max_line_kb Maximum size of log entries/lines in KB. If log entries exceed the limit, they are skipped. Default is 128. fluentbit External Fluent Bit configuration and parser files. If defined, they are merged with the existing configuration and parser files generated by the infrastructure agent. The infrastructure agent processes the configuration files located in the logging.d directory and will generate a run-time Fluent Bit configuration file that contains the appropriate [INPUT], [FILTER] and [OUTPUT] sections. Optionally, it will also declare an @INCLUDE in case you provided an external Fluent Bit configuration file via the fluentbit option. The runtime file does not define a [SERVICE] section, leaving all default Fluent Bit configuration values. You can still override Fluent Bit's default settings by defining your own [SERVICE] section in your external Fluent Bit configuration file and include it via the fluentbit option. Parameters: config_file: path to an existing Fluent Bit configuration file. Note that any overlapping source results in duplicate messages in New Relic Logs. parsers_file: path to an existing Fluent Bit parsers file. The following parser names are reserved: rfc3164, rfc3164-local and rfc5424. Sample configuration file Here is an example of a logging.d/ configuration file in YAML format. For more configuration examples, see the infrastructure agent repository. logging.d/sample.yaml # Remember to only use spaces for indentation logs: # Example of 'file' source - name: file-with-attributes file: /var/log/test.log # Path to a single file or pattern attributes: # You can use custom attributes to enrich your data logtype: nginx team: The A Team pattern: Error # Regular expression to filter log entries # Example of 'systemd' source (Linux only) - name: systemd-example systemd: cupsd # Examples of 'syslog' source, one per protocol # TCP network socket - name: syslog-tcp-test syslog: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:5140 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format parser: rfc5424 # Default syslog parser is rfc3164 # UDP network socket - name: syslog-udp-test syslog: uri: udp://0.0.0.0:6140 # Use the udp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format max_line_kb: 35 # Paths for Unix sockets are defined by combining protocol and path: # unix_udp:// + /path/socket - for example, unix_udp:///tmp/socket # Unix TCP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-tcp-test syslog: uri: unix_tcp:///var/unix-tcp-socket-test unix_permissions: 0666 # Default is 0644.

No data appears when tailing a file The log forwarding feature requires the agent to have permission to read the data sources. When running the infrastructure agent in privileged or non-privileged modes, make sure that the log files you want to forward (and any intermediary directory in its path) are readable by the user running nri-agent. Example: checking file access under Linux Let's check whether the file /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log can be monitored by the nri-agent user. In Linux, you can do a quick check with the namei command: sudo -u nri-agent namei -ml /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log f: /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log drwxr-xr-x root root / drwxr-xr-x root root var drwxrwxr-x root syslog log drwxr--r-- root root restrictedLogs logFile.log - No such file or directory Copy This command failed because the file is not visible to the nri-agent user. By inspecting the previous output, we can detect that the restrictedLogs directory is missing the execution flag for others\". We can fix this by executing: sudo chmod 755 /var/log/restrictedLogs Copy And then check for file access again: # sudo -u nri-agent namei -ml /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log f: /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log drwxr-xr-x root root / drwxr-xr-x root root var drwxrwxr-x root syslog log drwxr-xr-x root root restrictedLogs -rw-r----- vagrant vagrant logFile.log Copy The file is now visible to the nri-agent user. You must ensure that the file is also readable by the nri-agent user. To check this, use: # sudo -u nri-agent head /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log head: cannot open '/var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log' for reading: Permission denied Copy In this example, the file is missing the read rights for the others group (users other than vagrant and the vagrant user group). You could fix this by granting read permissions to others, but the application could change these permissions upon restart. To avoid this, a better approach is to add the nri-agent user to the vagrant user group. No data appears when capturing via a Syslog socket The log forwarding feature requires that the agent has permission to read the data sources. When running the infrastructure agent in privileged or non-privileged modes: If you're using Unix domain socket files, make sure that the nri-agent user can access these files (please refer to the previous section) and that they have read and write permissions (666) so that other users than nri-agent can write to them. If you're using IP sockets, ensure that the port that you are using is not a system reserved one (like port 80, for example). If no data appears after you enable log management, follow standard log management troubleshooting procedures. No data appears using infrastructure agent proxy As explained in the infrastructure agent configuration guidelines, the proxy parameter must use either HTTP or HTTPS and be in the form https://user:password@hostname:port. The agent can parse the parameter without the HTTP or HTTPS, but the log-forwarder cannot. You will see an error like the following in the agent verbose logs: [ERROR] building HTTP transport: parse \\\"hostname:port\\\": first path segment in URL cannot contain colon Copy To solve this problem, check your newrelic-infra.yml file, and ensure the proxy parameter adheres to this form. Send the agent's logs to New Relic You can configure the infrastructure agent to send its own logs to New Relic. This is useful for troubleshooting issues with log forwarding, the agent, or when contacting support. To forward the infrastructure agent logs to New Relic: Edit your newrelic-infra.yml file. Enable agent logging in troubleshooting mode by adding verbose: 3 Important On Windows and systems that don't use systemd or where journald is inaccessible, verbose:3 causes the agent to write the logs on the disk. Revert to verbose:0 to prevent this. (Recommended): Enable agent logging in JSON format to log_format: json. Restart the agent to load the new settings. This configuration sets up the agent in troubleshooting mode, but the log forwarder (based on Fluent Bit) will continue in a non-verbose mode. Sometimes you can have issues with the log forwarder itself. For example, there may be problems accessing a specific channel when shipping Windows log events or when accessing a particular log file. In these situations, you can also enable the verbose mode for the log forwarder: Set verbose to a value other than 0. Add the following configuration option: trace: [\"log.fw\"]. Caution Check whether you are using the fluentbit option. When setting verbose: 3 and trace: [\"log.fw\"], ensure that you don't define any [OUTPUT] section pointing to stdout in an external Fluent Bit configuration file, Fluent Bit does not start with the infra-agent For Linux versions previous to 2016 you may need to update the OpenSSL library to 1.1.0 (or higher). To check if you have this problem: See if infra-agenthas started Fluent Bit by doing ps -aux | grep fluent-bit Copy If it isn't running go to /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/logging and run ./fluent-bit -i systemd -o stdout Copy If you get the following error, update OpenSSL to 1.1.0 or higher: error while loading shared libraries: libssl.so.1.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory Runtime error on Windows One of the following error messages may appear when enabling log forwarding on Windows: The code execution cannot proceed because VCRUNTIME140.dll was not found. Copy OR error=\"exit status 3221225781\" process=log-forwarder Copy This is caused by a missing DLL. To solve the issue, install the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable: x64 or x86. What's next? Now that you've enabled Logs, here are some potential next steps: Explore your data using the Logs UI. Configure your agent to see contextual log data, such as distributed tracing, stack traces, application logs, and more. Query your data and create custom dashboards or alerts.",

Tip To use log management and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Enable log forwarding using the infrastructure agent To enable log forwarding through the infrastructure agent: Start by verifying the system requirements needed for configuring Logs. Ensure you have installed the infrastructure agent, version 1.11.4 or higher. Create a logging.yml file in the infrastructure agent's logging.d directory. Configure your log sources and other parameters. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your account for data. Explore your log data in the Logs UI and benefit from the log attributes automatically inserted by the infrastructure agent. System Requirements To use the log forwarder of the infrastructure agent, make sure you meet the following requirements: Infrastructure agent version 1.11.4 or higher OpenSSL library 1.1.0 or higher is required by infra-agent starting from v1.16.4. The log forwarding feature is compatible with the following operating systems: Operating system Supported version Amazon Linux Amazon Linux 2 CentOS Version 7 or higher Debian Version 9 (\"Stretch\") or higher Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) Version 7 or higher SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) Version 12 Ubuntu Versions 16.04.x, 18.04.x and 20.04.x (LTS versions) Windows Windows Server 2012, 2016, and 2019, and their service packs. Windows 10 Caution The log forwarding feature is not supported on containerized infrastructure agents. Install the infrastructure agent Starting with version 1.11.4, the infrastructure agent can forward logs to New Relic. To install and run the agent, use a package manager (Linux) or the MSI installer (Windows). To use the following links, make sure you are logged to your New Relic account. Amazon Linux CentOS Debian RHEL SLES Ubuntu Windows If you don't have a New Relic account yet, or prefer to follow the procedure manually, see our tutorial to install the package manager. Configure the infrastructure agent Configuration files describe which log sources are forwarded. The Infrastructure agent uses .yml files for configuring logging. You can add as many config files as you want. To add a new configuration file for the log forwarding feature: Navigate to the logging forwarder configuration folder: Linux: /etc/newrelic-infra/logging.d/ Windows: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\logging.d\\ Create a logging.yml configuration file and add the parameters you need. The logging.d directory has various .yml.example files that can be used as a reference or starting point. The agent automatically processes new configuration files without having to restart the Infrastructure service. The only exception to this is when configuring a custom Fluent Bit configuration. Log forwarding parameters The infrastructure log forwarding .yml config supports the following parameters: Name (required) To start, make sure to define a name for the logs you want to forward: name Name of the log or logs being forwarding to New Relic. Log source (required) What you use for the log source will depend on where you want to forward your logs from. The available options are listed below: file Path to the log file or files. The agent tracks changes on the log files in a way similar to tail -f shell. Example: logs: - name: example-log file: /var/log/example.log # Path to a single log file - name: example-log-two file: /var/log/example-two.log # Path to another single log file Copy The file parameter can point to a specific log file or multiple files by using wildcards applied to names and extensions; for example, /logs/*.log. You can use wildcards in place of directories in a file path, which can be used to tail files located in different directories. Example: logs: - name: docker-logs file: /var/lib/docker/containers/*/*.log # Path to multiple folders and files Copy Important Use of wildcards may significantly increase the number of file descriptors the Fluent Bit process keeps open, which can interfere with log collection if the host's file descriptor limit is reached. We recommend increasing the file descriptor limit on Linux hosts running Fluent Bit by adding the following to the host's /etc/security/limits.conf file: root soft nofile 65536 root hard nofile 65536 *soft nofile 65536 *hard nofile 65536 Copy If you add these changes, reboot the host to ensure your changes are applied. systemd Use the systemd paramater to forward log messages that are collected by the journald daemon in Linux environments. This input type requires the agent to run in root mode. Example: logs: - name: systemd-example systemd: cupsd Copy syslog Syslog data source. Parameters: uri: Syslog socket. Format varies depending on the protocol: TCP/UDP network sockets: [tcp/udp]://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT Unix domain sockets: unix_[tcp/udp]:// + /socket/path parser: Syslog parser. Default is rfc3164. Use rfc5424 if your messages include fractional seconds. Note: rfc3164 currently does not work on SuSE. unix_permissions: default is 0644 for domain sockets; this limits entries to processes running as root. You can use 0666 to listen for non-root processes, at your own risk. When running the agent in privileged mode, ports and sockets must be available or owned by nri-agent, with 0666 file permissions, so that other processes can write logs to the sockets. logs: # TCP network socket - name: syslog-tcp-test syslog: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:5140 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format parser: rfc5424 # Default syslog parser is rfc3164 # UDP network socket - name: syslog-udp-test syslog: uri: udp://0.0.0.0:6140 # Use the udp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format max_line_kb: 35 # Unix TCP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-tcp-test syslog: uri: unix_tcp:///var/unix-tcp-socket-test unix_permissions: 0666 # Default is 0644. Change at your own risk # Unix UDP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-udp-test syslog: uri: unix_udp:///var/unix-udp-socket-test parser: rfc5424 Copy tcp Logs retrieved over TCP connections. Parameters: uri: TCP/IP socket to listen for incoming data. The URI format is tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format: format of the data. It can be json or none. separator: If format: none is used, you can define a separator string for splitting records (default: \\n). logs: - name: tcp-simple-test tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:1234 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format format: none # Raw text - this is default for 'tcp' separator: \\t # String for separating raw text entries max_line_kb: 32 - name: tcp-json-test tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:2345 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format format: json Copy winlog Collect events from Windows log channels. Parameters: channel: name of the channel logs will be collected from. collect-eventids: a list of Windows Event IDs to be collected and forwarded to New Relic. Event ID ranges are supported. exclude-eventids: a list of Windows Event IDs to be excluded from collection. Event ID ranges are supported. All events are collected from the specified channel by default. Configure the collect-eventids and exclude-eventids sections to avoid sending unwanted logs to your New Relic account. Add event IDs or ranges to collect-eventids or exclude-eventids to forward or drop specific events. exclude-eventids takes precedence over collect-eventids if the same event ID is present in both sections. Example: logs: # Winlog log ingestion with eventId filters. - name: windows-security winlog: channel: Security collect-eventids: - 4624 - 4265 - 4700-4800 exclude-eventids: - 4735 # entries for the application, system, powershell, and SCOM channels - name: windows-application winlog: channel: Application - name: windows-system winlog: channel: System - name: windows-pshell winlog: channel: Windows Powershell - name: scom winlog: channel: Operations Manager # Entry for Windows Defender Logs - name: windows-defender winlog: channel: Microsoft-Windows-Windows Defender/Operational # Entry for Windows Clustering Logs - name: windows-clustering winlog: channel: Microsoft-Windows-FailoverClustering/Operational # Entry for IIS logs with logtype attribute for automatic parsing - name: iis-log file: C:\\inetpub\\logs\\LogFiles\\w3svc.log attributes: logtype: iis_w3c Copy Optional Configuration The following are configuration paramaters that are not required but are still recommended. attributes List of custom attributes as key-value pairs that can be used to send additional data with the logs which you can then query. Add attributes to any log source. Example: logs: - name: example-file-attributes file: /var/log/example.log attributes: logtype: nginx region: example-us-02 team: A-team - name: example-tcp-attributes tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:2345 format: json attributes: logtype: nginx region: example-us-02 team: B-team Copy Log attributes automatically inserted by the infrastructure agent(#automatically-inserted-attributes) The infrastructure agent automatically inserts log attributes for your convenience. Some of them are inserted for any log record, while others depend on the configuration parameters you used while setting up the log forwarder. Find a summary of these attributes in the following table: Attribute name Inserting conditions Description entity.guids Always inserted The infrastructure agent inserts the Entity GUID assigned by New Relic to identify the host where it's running. It is available in the entity.guids field. Note: If the captured logs belong to an application instrumented using APM, the entity.guids field contains both the entity GUID of infrastructure, as well as the GUID of APM, separated by a pipe ( | ) delimiter. fb.input Always inserted The underlying Fluent Bit input plugin type used to capture the logs. Currently, its values are tail, systemd, winlog, syslog, and tcp. filePath When using the file input type Absolute file path of the file being monitored. hostname Always inserted The hostname of the machine/VM/container executing the infrastructure agent. plugin.type Always inserted Indicates the utility used to capture the logs. In this case, it is the infrastructure agent itself, so this attribute always has the value nri-agent. pattern Regular expression for filtering records. Only supported for the tail, systemd, syslog, and tcp (only with format none) sources. This field works in a way similar to grep -E in Unix systems. For example, for a given file being captured, you can filter for records containing either WARN or ERROR using: - name: only-records-with-warn-and-error file: /var/log/logFile.log pattern: WARN|ERROR Copy No filtering is applied by default. max_line_kb Maximum size of log entries/lines in KB. If log entries exceed the limit, they are skipped. Default is 128. fluentbit External Fluent Bit configuration and parser files. If defined, they are merged with the existing configuration and parser files generated by the infrastructure agent. The infrastructure agent processes the configuration files located in the logging.d directory and will generate a run-time Fluent Bit configuration file that contains the appropriate [INPUT], [FILTER] and [OUTPUT] sections. Optionally, it will also declare an @INCLUDE in case you provided an external Fluent Bit configuration file via the fluentbit option. The runtime file does not define a [SERVICE] section, leaving all default Fluent Bit configuration values. You can still override Fluent Bit's default settings by defining your own [SERVICE] section in your external Fluent Bit configuration file and include it via the fluentbit option. Parameters: config_file: path to an existing Fluent Bit configuration file.

No data appears when tailing a file The log forwarding feature requires the agent to have permission to read the data sources. When running the infrastructure agent in privileged or non-privileged modes, make sure that the log files you want to forward (and any intermediary directory in its path) are readable by the user running nri-agent. Example: checking file access under Linux Let's check whether the file /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log can be monitored by the nri-agent user. In Linux, you can do a quick check with the namei command: sudo -u nri-agent namei -ml /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log f: /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log drwxr-xr-x root root / drwxr-xr-x root root var drwxrwxr-x root syslog log drwxr--r-- root root restrictedLogs logFile.log - No such file or directory Copy This command failed because the file is not visible to the nri-agent user. By inspecting the previous output, we can detect that the restrictedLogs directory is missing the execution flag for others\". We can fix this by executing: sudo chmod 755 /var/log/restrictedLogs Copy And then check for file access again: # sudo -u nri-agent namei -ml /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log f: /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log drwxr-xr-x root root / drwxr-xr-x root root var drwxrwxr-x root syslog log drwxr-xr-x root root restrictedLogs -rw-r----- vagrant vagrant logFile.log Copy The file is now visible to the nri-agent user. You must ensure that the file is also readable by the nri-agent user. To check this, use: # sudo -u nri-agent head /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log head: cannot open '/var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log' for reading: Permission denied Copy In this example, the file is missing the read rights for the others group (users other than vagrant and the vagrant user group). You could fix this by granting read permissions to others, but the application could change these permissions upon restart. To avoid this, a better approach is to add the nri-agent user to the vagrant user group. No data appears when capturing via a Syslog socket The log forwarding feature requires that the agent has permission to read the data sources. When running the infrastructure agent in privileged or non-privileged modes: If you're using Unix domain socket files, make sure that the nri-agent user can access these files (please refer to the previous section) and that they have read and write permissions (666) so that other users than nri-agent can write to them. If you're using IP sockets, ensure that the port that you are using is not a system reserved one (like port 80, for example). If no data appears after you enable log management, follow standard log management troubleshooting procedures. No data appears using infrastructure agent proxy As explained in the infrastructure agent configuration guidelines, the proxy parameter must use either HTTP or HTTPS and be in the form https://user:password@hostname:port. The agent can parse the parameter without the HTTP or HTTPS, but the log-forwarder cannot. You will see an error like the following in the agent verbose logs: [ERROR] building HTTP transport: parse \\\"hostname:port\\\": first path segment in URL cannot contain colon Copy To solve this problem, check your newrelic-infra.yml file, and ensure the proxy parameter adheres to this form. Send the agent's logs to New Relic You can configure the infrastructure agent to send its own logs to New Relic. This is useful for troubleshooting issues with log forwarding, the agent, or when contacting support. To forward the infrastructure agent logs to New Relic: Edit your newrelic-infra.yml file. Enable agent logging in troubleshooting mode by adding verbose: 3 Important On Windows and systems that don't use systemd or where journald is inaccessible, verbose:3 causes the agent to write the logs on the disk. Revert to verbose:0 to prevent this. (Recommended): Enable agent logging in JSON format to log_format: json. Restart the agent to load the new settings. This configuration sets up the agent in troubleshooting mode, but the log forwarder (based on Fluent Bit) will continue in a non-verbose mode. Sometimes you can have issues with the log forwarder itself. For example, there may be problems accessing a specific channel when shipping Windows log events or when accessing a particular log file. In these situations, you can also enable the verbose mode for the log forwarder: Set verbose to a value other than 0. Add the following configuration option: trace: [\"log.fw\"]. Caution Check whether you are using the fluentbit option. When setting verbose: 3 and trace: [\"log.fw\"], ensure that you don't define any [OUTPUT] section pointing to stdout in an external Fluent Bit configuration file, Fluent Bit does not start with the infra-agent For Linux versions previous to 2016 you may need to update the OpenSSL library to 1.1.0 (or higher). To check if you have this problem: See if infra-agenthas started Fluent Bit by doing ps -aux | grep fluent-bit Copy If it isn't running go to /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/logging and run ./fluent-bit -i systemd -o stdout Copy If you get the following error, update OpenSSL to 1.1.0 or higher: error while loading shared libraries: libssl.so.1.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory Runtime error on Windows One of the following error messages may appear when enabling log forwarding on Windows: The code execution cannot proceed because VCRUNTIME140.dll was not found. Copy OR error=\"exit status 3221225781\" process=log-forwarder Copy This is caused by a missing DLL. To solve the issue, install the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable: x64 or x86. What's next? Now that you've enabled Logs, here are some potential next steps: Explore your data using the Logs UI.

Tip To use log management and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Enable log forwarding using the infrastructure agent To enable log forwarding through the infrastructure agent: Start by verifying the system requirements needed for configuring Logs. Ensure you have installed the infrastructure agent, version 1.11.4 or higher. Create a logging.yml file in the infrastructure agent's logging.d directory. Configure your log sources and other parameters. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your account for data. Explore your log data in the Logs UI and benefit from the log attributes automatically inserted by the infrastructure agent. System Requirements To use the log forwarder of the infrastructure agent, make sure you meet the following requirements: Infrastructure agent version 1.11.4 or higher OpenSSL library 1.1.0 or higher is required by infra-agent starting from v1.16.4. The log forwarding feature is compatible with the following operating systems: Operating system Supported version Amazon Linux Amazon Linux 2 CentOS Version 7 or higher Debian Version 9 (\"Stretch\") or higher Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) Version 7 or higher SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) Version 12 Ubuntu Versions 16.04.x, 18.04.x and 20.04.x (LTS versions) Windows Windows Server 2012, 2016, and 2019, and their service packs. Windows 10 Caution The log forwarding feature is not supported on containerized infrastructure agents. Install the infrastructure agent Starting with version 1.11.4, the infrastructure agent can forward logs to New Relic. To install and run the agent, use a package manager (Linux) or the MSI installer (Windows). To use the following links, make sure you are logged to your New Relic account. Amazon Linux CentOS Debian RHEL SLES Ubuntu Windows If you don't have a New Relic account yet, or prefer to follow the procedure manually, see our tutorial to install the package manager. Configure the infrastructure agent Configuration files describe which log sources are forwarded. The Infrastructure agent uses .yml files for configuring logging. You can add as many config files as you want. To add a new configuration file for the log forwarding feature: Navigate to the logging forwarder configuration folder: Linux: /etc/newrelic-infra/logging.d/ Windows: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\logging.d\\ Create a logging.yml configuration file and add the parameters you need. The logging.d directory has various .yml.example files that can be used as a reference or starting point. The agent automatically processes new configuration files without having to restart the Infrastructure service. The only exception to this is when configuring a custom Fluent Bit configuration. Log forwarding parameters The infrastructure log forwarding .yml config supports the following parameters: Name (required) To start, make sure to define a name for the logs you want to forward: name Name of the log or logs being forwarding to New Relic. Log source (required) What you use for the log source will depend on where you want to forward your logs from. The available options are listed below: file Path to the log file or files. The agent tracks changes on the log files in a way similar to tail -f shell. Example: logs: - name: example-log file: /var/log/example.log # Path to a single log file - name: example-log-two file: /var/log/example-two.log # Path to another single log file Copy The file parameter can point to a specific log file or multiple files by using wildcards applied to names and extensions; for example, /logs/*.log. You can use wildcards in place of directories in a file path, which can be used to tail files located in different directories. Example: logs: - name: docker-logs file: /var/lib/docker/containers/*/*.log # Path to multiple folders and files Copy Important Use of wildcards may significantly increase the number of file descriptors the Fluent Bit process keeps open, which can interfere with log collection if the host's file descriptor limit is reached. We recommend increasing the file descriptor limit on Linux hosts running Fluent Bit by adding the following to the host's /etc/security/limits.conf file: root soft nofile 65536 root hard nofile 65536 *soft nofile 65536 *hard nofile 65536 Copy If you add these changes, reboot the host to ensure your changes are applied. systemd Use the systemd paramater to forward log messages that are collected by the journald daemon in Linux environments. This input type requires the agent to run in root mode. Example: logs: - name: systemd-example systemd: cupsd Copy syslog Syslog data source. Parameters: uri: Syslog socket. Format varies depending on the protocol: TCP/UDP network sockets: [tcp/udp]://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT Unix domain sockets: unix_[tcp/udp]:// + /socket/path parser: Syslog parser. Default is rfc3164. Use rfc5424 if your messages include fractional seconds. Note: rfc3164 currently does not work on SuSE. unix_permissions: default is 0644 for domain sockets; this limits entries to processes running as root. You can use 0666 to listen for non-root processes, at your own risk. When running the agent in privileged mode, ports and sockets must be available or owned by nri-agent, with 0666 file permissions, so that other processes can write logs to the sockets. logs: # TCP network socket - name: syslog-tcp-test syslog: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:5140 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format parser: rfc5424 # Default syslog parser is rfc3164 # UDP network socket - name: syslog-udp-test syslog: uri: udp://0.0.0.0:6140 # Use the udp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format max_line_kb: 35 # Unix TCP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-tcp-test syslog: uri: unix_tcp:///var/unix-tcp-socket-test unix_permissions: 0666 # Default is 0644.

Parameters: channel: name of the channel logs will be collected from. collect-eventids: a list of Windows Event IDs to be collected and forwarded to New Relic. Event ID ranges are supported. exclude-eventids: a list of Windows Event IDs to be excluded from collection. Event ID ranges are supported. All events are collected from the specified channel by default. Configure the collect-eventids and exclude-eventids sections to avoid sending unwanted logs to your New Relic account. Add event IDs or ranges to collect-eventids or exclude-eventids to forward or drop specific events. exclude-eventids takes precedence over collect-eventids if the same event ID is present in both sections. Example: logs: # Winlog log ingestion with eventId filters. - name: windows-security winlog: channel: Security collect-eventids: - 4624 - 4265 - 4700-4800 exclude-eventids: - 4735 # entries for the application, system, powershell, and SCOM channels - name: windows-application winlog: channel: Application - name: windows-system winlog: channel: System - name: windows-pshell winlog: channel: Windows Powershell - name: scom winlog: channel: Operations Manager # Entry for Windows Defender Logs - name: windows-defender winlog: channel: Microsoft-Windows-Windows Defender/Operational # Entry for Windows Clustering Logs - name: windows-clustering winlog: channel: Microsoft-Windows-FailoverClustering/Operational # Entry for IIS logs with logtype attribute for automatic parsing - name: iis-log file: C:\\inetpub\\logs\\LogFiles\\w3svc.log attributes: logtype: iis_w3c Copy Optional Configuration The following are configuration paramaters that are not required but are still recommended. attributes List of custom attributes as key-value pairs that can be used to send additional data with the logs which you can then query. Add attributes to any log source. Example: logs: - name: example-file-attributes file: /var/log/example.log attributes: logtype: nginx region: example-us-02 team: A-team - name: example-tcp-attributes tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:2345 format: json attributes: logtype: nginx region: example-us-02 team: B-team Copy Log attributes automatically inserted by the infrastructure agent(#automatically-inserted-attributes) The infrastructure agent automatically inserts log attributes for your convenience. Some of them are inserted for any log record, while others depend on the configuration parameters you used while setting up the log forwarder. Find a summary of these attributes in the following table: Attribute name Inserting conditions Description entity.guids Always inserted The infrastructure agent inserts the Entity GUID assigned by New Relic to identify the host where it's running. It is available in the entity.guids field. Note: If the captured logs belong to an application instrumented using APM, the entity.guids field contains both the entity GUID of infrastructure, as well as the GUID of APM, separated by a pipe ( | ) delimiter. fb.input Always inserted The underlying Fluent Bit input plugin type used to capture the logs. Currently, its values are tail, systemd, winlog, syslog, and tcp. filePath When using the file input type Absolute file path of the file being monitored. hostname Always inserted The hostname of the machine/VM/container executing the infrastructure agent. plugin.type Always inserted Indicates the utility used to capture the logs. In this case, it is the infrastructure agent itself, so this attribute always has the value nri-agent. pattern Regular expression for filtering records. Only supported for the tail, systemd, syslog, and tcp (only with format none) sources. This field works in a way similar to grep -E in Unix systems. For example, for a given file being captured, you can filter for records containing either WARN or ERROR using: - name: only-records-with-warn-and-error file: /var/log/logFile.log pattern: WARN|ERROR Copy No filtering is applied by default. max_line_kb Maximum size of log entries/lines in KB. If log entries exceed the limit, they are skipped. Default is 128. fluentbit External Fluent Bit configuration and parser files. If defined, they are merged with the existing configuration and parser files generated by the infrastructure agent. The infrastructure agent processes the configuration files located in the logging.d directory and will generate a run-time Fluent Bit configuration file that contains the appropriate [INPUT], [FILTER] and [OUTPUT] sections. Optionally, it will also declare an @INCLUDE in case you provided an external Fluent Bit configuration file via the fluentbit option. The runtime file does not define a [SERVICE] section, leaving all default Fluent Bit configuration values. You can still override Fluent Bit's default settings by defining your own [SERVICE] section in your external Fluent Bit configuration file and include it via the fluentbit option. Parameters: config_file: path to an existing Fluent Bit configuration file. Note that any overlapping source results in duplicate messages in New Relic Logs. parsers_file: path to an existing Fluent Bit parsers file. The following parser names are reserved: rfc3164, rfc3164-local and rfc5424. Sample configuration file Here is an example of a logging.d/ configuration file in YAML format. For more configuration examples, see the infrastructure agent repository. logging.d/sample.yaml # Remember to only use spaces for indentation logs: # Example of 'file' source - name: file-with-attributes file: /var/log/test.log # Path to a single file or pattern attributes: # You can use custom attributes to enrich your data logtype: nginx team: The A Team pattern: Error # Regular expression to filter log entries # Example of 'systemd' source (Linux only) - name: systemd-example systemd: cupsd # Examples of 'syslog' source, one per protocol # TCP network socket - name: syslog-tcp-test syslog: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:5140 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format parser: rfc5424 # Default syslog parser is rfc3164 # UDP network socket - name: syslog-udp-test syslog: uri: udp://0.0.0.0:6140 # Use the udp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format max_line_kb: 35 # Paths for Unix sockets are defined by combining protocol and path: # unix_udp:// + /path/socket - for example, unix_udp:///tmp/socket # Unix TCP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-tcp-test syslog: uri: unix_tcp:///var/unix-tcp-socket-test unix_permissions: 0666 # Default is 0644.

No data appears when tailing a file The log forwarding feature requires the agent to have permission to read the data sources. When running the infrastructure agent in privileged or non-privileged modes, make sure that the log files you want to forward (and any intermediary directory in its path) are readable by the user running nri-agent. Example: checking file access under Linux Let's check whether the file /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log can be monitored by the nri-agent user. In Linux, you can do a quick check with the namei command: sudo -u nri-agent namei -ml /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log f: /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log drwxr-xr-x root root / drwxr-xr-x root root var drwxrwxr-x root syslog log drwxr--r-- root root restrictedLogs logFile.log - No such file or directory Copy This command failed because the file is not visible to the nri-agent user. By inspecting the previous output, we can detect that the restrictedLogs directory is missing the execution flag for others\". We can fix this by executing: sudo chmod 755 /var/log/restrictedLogs Copy And then check for file access again: # sudo -u nri-agent namei -ml /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log f: /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log drwxr-xr-x root root / drwxr-xr-x root root var drwxrwxr-x root syslog log drwxr-xr-x root root restrictedLogs -rw-r----- vagrant vagrant logFile.log Copy The file is now visible to the nri-agent user. You must ensure that the file is also readable by the nri-agent user. To check this, use: # sudo -u nri-agent head /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log head: cannot open '/var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log' for reading: Permission denied Copy In this example, the file is missing the read rights for the others group (users other than vagrant and the vagrant user group). You could fix this by granting read permissions to others, but the application could change these permissions upon restart. To avoid this, a better approach is to add the nri-agent user to the vagrant user group. No data appears when capturing via a Syslog socket The log forwarding feature requires that the agent has permission to read the data sources. When running the infrastructure agent in privileged or non-privileged modes: If you're using Unix domain socket files, make sure that the nri-agent user can access these files (please refer to the previous section) and that they have read and write permissions (666) so that other users than nri-agent can write to them. If you're using IP sockets, ensure that the port that you are using is not a system reserved one (like port 80, for example). If no data appears after you enable log management, follow standard log management troubleshooting procedures. No data appears using infrastructure agent proxy As explained in the infrastructure agent configuration guidelines, the proxy parameter must use either HTTP or HTTPS and be in the form https://user:password@hostname:port. The agent can parse the parameter without the HTTP or HTTPS, but the log-forwarder cannot. You will see an error like the following in the agent verbose logs: [ERROR] building HTTP transport: parse \\\"hostname:port\\\": first path segment in URL cannot contain colon Copy To solve this problem, check your newrelic-infra.yml file, and ensure the proxy parameter adheres to this form. Send the agent's logs to New Relic You can configure the infrastructure agent to send its own logs to New Relic. This is useful for troubleshooting issues with log forwarding, the agent, or when contacting support. To forward the infrastructure agent logs to New Relic: Edit your newrelic-infra.yml file. Enable agent logging in troubleshooting mode by adding verbose: 3 Important On Windows and systems that don't use systemd or where journald is inaccessible, verbose:3 causes the agent to write the logs on the disk. Revert to verbose:0 to prevent this. (Recommended): Enable agent logging in JSON format to log_format: json. Restart the agent to load the new settings. This configuration sets up the agent in troubleshooting mode, but the log forwarder (based on Fluent Bit) will continue in a non-verbose mode. Sometimes you can have issues with the log forwarder itself. For example, there may be problems accessing a specific channel when shipping Windows log events or when accessing a particular log file. In these situations, you can also enable the verbose mode for the log forwarder: Set verbose to a value other than 0. Add the following configuration option: trace: [\"log.fw\"]. Caution Check whether you are using the fluentbit option. When setting verbose: 3 and trace: [\"log.fw\"], ensure that you don't define any [OUTPUT] section pointing to stdout in an external Fluent Bit configuration file, Fluent Bit does not start with the infra-agent For Linux versions previous to 2016 you may need to update the OpenSSL library to 1.1.0 (or higher). To check if you have this problem: See if infra-agenthas started Fluent Bit by doing ps -aux | grep fluent-bit Copy If it isn't running go to /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/logging and run ./fluent-bit -i systemd -o stdout Copy If you get the following error, update OpenSSL to 1.1.0 or higher: error while loading shared libraries: libssl.so.1.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory Runtime error on Windows One of the following error messages may appear when enabling log forwarding on Windows: The code execution cannot proceed because VCRUNTIME140.dll was not found. Copy OR error=\"exit status 3221225781\" process=log-forwarder Copy This is caused by a missing DLL. To solve the issue, install the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable: x64 or x86. What's next? Now that you've enabled Logs, here are some potential next steps: Explore your data using the Logs UI. Configure your agent to see contextual log data, such as distributed tracing, stack traces, application logs, and more. Query your data and create custom dashboards or alerts.",

Enable log forwarding using the infrastructure agent To enable log forwarding through the infrastructure agent: Start by verifying the system requirements needed for configuring Logs. Ensure you have installed the infrastructure agent, version 1.11.4 or higher. Create a logging.yml file in the infrastructure agent's logging.d directory. Configure your log sources and other parameters. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your account for data. Explore your log data in the Logs UI and benefit from the log attributes automatically inserted by the infrastructure agent. System Requirements To use the log forwarder of the infrastructure agent, make sure you meet the following requirements: Infrastructure agent version 1.11.4 or higher OpenSSL library 1.1.0 or higher is required by infra-agent starting from v1.16.4. The log forwarding feature is compatible with the following operating systems: Operating system Supported version Amazon Linux Amazon Linux 2 CentOS Version 7 or higher Debian Version 9 (\"Stretch\") or higher Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) Version 7 or higher SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) Version 12 Ubuntu Versions 16.04.x, 18.04.x and 20.04.x (LTS versions) Windows Windows Server 2012, 2016, and 2019, and their service packs. Windows 10 Caution The log forwarding feature is not supported on containerized infrastructure agents. Install the infrastructure agent Starting with version 1.11.4, the infrastructure agent can forward logs to New Relic. To install and run the agent, use a package manager (Linux) or the MSI installer (Windows). To use the following links, make sure you are logged to your New Relic account. Amazon Linux CentOS Debian RHEL SLES Ubuntu Windows If you don't have a New Relic account yet, or prefer to follow the procedure manually, see our tutorial to install the package manager. Configure the infrastructure agent Configuration files describe which log sources are forwarded. The Infrastructure agent uses .yml files for configuring logging. You can add as many config files as you want. To add a new configuration file for the log forwarding feature: Navigate to the logging forwarder configuration folder: Linux: /etc/newrelic-infra/logging.d/ Windows: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\logging.d\\ Create a logging.yml configuration file and add the parameters you need. The logging.d directory has various .yml.example files that can be used as a reference or starting point. The agent automatically processes new configuration files without having to restart the Infrastructure service. The only exception to this is when configuring a custom Fluent Bit configuration. Log forwarding parameters The infrastructure log forwarding .yml config supports the following parameters: Name (required) To start, make sure to define a name for the logs you want to forward: name Name of the log or logs being forwarding to New Relic. Log source (required) What you use for the log source will depend on where you want to forward your logs from. The available options are listed below: file Path to the log file or files. The agent tracks changes on the log files in a way similar to tail -f shell. Example: logs: - name: example-log file: /var/log/example.log # Path to a single log file - name: example-log-two file: /var/log/example-two.log # Path to another single log file Copy The file parameter can point to a specific log file or multiple files by using wildcards applied to names and extensions; for example, /logs/*.log. You can use wildcards in place of directories in a file path, which can be used to tail files located in different directories. Example: logs: - name: docker-logs file: /var/lib/docker/containers/*/*.log # Path to multiple folders and files Copy Important Use of wildcards may significantly increase the number of file descriptors the Fluent Bit process keeps open, which can interfere with log collection if the host's file descriptor limit is reached. We recommend increasing the file descriptor limit on Linux hosts running Fluent Bit by adding the following to the host's /etc/security/limits.conf file: root soft nofile 65536 root hard nofile 65536 *soft nofile 65536 *hard nofile 65536 Copy If you add these changes, reboot the host to ensure your changes are applied. systemd Use the systemd paramater to forward log messages that are collected by the journald daemon in Linux environments. This input type requires the agent to run in root mode. Example: logs: - name: systemd-example systemd: cupsd Copy syslog Syslog data source. Parameters: uri: Syslog socket. Format varies depending on the protocol: TCP/UDP network sockets: [tcp/udp]://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT Unix domain sockets: unix_[tcp/udp]:// + /socket/path parser: Syslog parser. Default is rfc3164. Use rfc5424 if your messages include fractional seconds. Note: rfc3164 currently does not work on SuSE. unix_permissions: default is 0644 for domain sockets; this limits entries to processes running as root. You can use 0666 to listen for non-root processes, at your own risk. When running the agent in privileged mode, ports and sockets must be available or owned by nri-agent, with 0666 file permissions, so that other processes can write logs to the sockets. logs: # TCP network socket - name: syslog-tcp-test syslog: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:5140 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format parser: rfc5424 # Default syslog parser is rfc3164 # UDP network socket - name: syslog-udp-test syslog: uri: udp://0.0.0.0:6140 # Use the udp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format max_line_kb: 35 # Unix TCP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-tcp-test syslog: uri: unix_tcp:///var/unix-tcp-socket-test unix_permissions: 0666 # Default is 0644. Change at your own risk # Unix UDP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-udp-test syslog: uri: unix_udp:///var/unix-udp-socket-test parser: rfc5424 Copy tcp Logs retrieved over TCP connections. Parameters: uri: TCP/IP socket to listen for incoming data. The URI format is tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format: format of the data. It can be json or none. separator: If format: none is used, you can define a separator string for splitting records (default: \\n). logs: - name: tcp-simple-test tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:1234 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format format: none # Raw text - this is default for 'tcp' separator: \\t # String for separating raw text entries max_line_kb: 32 - name: tcp-json-test tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:2345 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format format: json Copy winlog Collect events from Windows log channels. Parameters: channel: name of the channel logs will be collected from. collect-eventids: a list of Windows Event IDs to be collected and forwarded to New Relic. Event ID ranges are supported. exclude-eventids: a list of Windows Event IDs to be excluded from collection. Event ID ranges are supported. All events are collected from the specified channel by default. Configure the collect-eventids and exclude-eventids sections to avoid sending unwanted logs to your New Relic account. Add event IDs or ranges to collect-eventids or exclude-eventids to forward or drop specific events. exclude-eventids takes precedence over collect-eventids if the same event ID is present in both sections. Example: logs: # Winlog log ingestion with eventId filters. - name: windows-security winlog: channel: Security collect-eventids: - 4624 - 4265 - 4700-4800 exclude-eventids: - 4735 # entries for the application, system, powershell, and SCOM channels - name: windows-application winlog: channel: Application - name: windows-system winlog: channel: System - name: windows-pshell winlog: channel: Windows Powershell - name: scom winlog: channel: Operations Manager # Entry for Windows Defender Logs - name: windows-defender winlog: channel: Microsoft-Windows-Windows Defender/Operational # Entry for Windows Clustering Logs - name: windows-clustering winlog: channel: Microsoft-Windows-FailoverClustering/Operational # Entry for IIS logs with logtype attribute for automatic parsing - name: iis-log file: C:\\inetpub\\logs\\LogFiles\\w3svc.log attributes: logtype: iis_w3c Copy Optional Configuration The following are configuration paramaters that are not required but are still recommended. attributes List of custom attributes as key-value pairs that can be used to send additional data with the logs which you can then query. Add attributes to any log source. Example: logs: - name: example-file-attributes file: /var/log/example.log attributes: logtype: nginx region: example-us-02 team: A-team - name: example-tcp-attributes tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:2345 format: json attributes: logtype: nginx region: example-us-02 team: B-team Copy Log attributes automatically inserted by the infrastructure agent(#automatically-inserted-attributes) The infrastructure agent automatically inserts log attributes for your convenience. Some of them are inserted for any log record, while others depend on the configuration parameters you used while setting up the log forwarder. Find a summary of these attributes in the following table: Attribute name Inserting conditions Description entity.guids Always inserted The infrastructure agent inserts the Entity GUID assigned by New Relic to identify the host where it's running. It is available in the entity.guids field. Note: If the captured logs belong to an application instrumented using APM, the entity.guids field contains both the entity GUID of infrastructure, as well as the GUID of APM, separated by a pipe ( | ) delimiter. fb.input Always inserted The underlying Fluent Bit input plugin type used to capture the logs. Currently, its values are tail, systemd, winlog, syslog, and tcp. filePath When using the file input type Absolute file path of the file being monitored. hostname Always inserted The hostname of the machine/VM/container executing the infrastructure agent. plugin.type Always inserted Indicates the utility used to capture the logs. In this case, it is the infrastructure agent itself, so this attribute always has the value nri-agent. pattern Regular expression for filtering records. Only supported for the tail, systemd, syslog, and tcp (only with format none) sources. This field works in a way similar to grep -E in Unix systems. For example, for a given file being captured, you can filter for records containing either WARN or ERROR using: - name: only-records-with-warn-and-error file: /var/log/logFile.log pattern: WARN|ERROR Copy No filtering is applied by default. max_line_kb Maximum size of log entries/lines in KB. If log entries exceed the limit, they are skipped. Default is 128. fluentbit External Fluent Bit configuration and parser files. If defined, they are merged with the existing configuration and parser files generated by the infrastructure agent. The infrastructure agent processes the configuration files located in the logging.d directory and will generate a run-time Fluent Bit configuration file that contains the appropriate [INPUT], [FILTER] and [OUTPUT] sections. Optionally, it will also declare an @INCLUDE in case you provided an external Fluent Bit configuration file via the fluentbit option. The runtime file does not define a [SERVICE] section, leaving all default Fluent Bit configuration values. You can still override Fluent Bit's default settings by defining your own [SERVICE] section in your external Fluent Bit configuration file and include it via the fluentbit option. Parameters: config_file: path to an existing Fluent Bit configuration file. Note that any overlapping source results in duplicate messages in New Relic Logs. parsers_file: path to an existing Fluent Bit parsers file. The following parser names are reserved: rfc3164, rfc3164-local and rfc5424. Sample configuration file Here is an example of a logging.d/ configuration file in YAML format. For more configuration examples, see the infrastructure agent repository. logging.d/sample.yaml # Remember to only use spaces for indentation logs: # Example of 'file' source - name: file-with-attributes file: /var/log/test.log # Path to a single file or pattern attributes: # You can use custom attributes to enrich your data logtype: nginx team: The A Team pattern: Error # Regular expression to filter log entries # Example of 'systemd' source (Linux only) - name: systemd-example systemd: cupsd # Examples of 'syslog' source, one per protocol # TCP network socket - name: syslog-tcp-test syslog: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:5140 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format parser: rfc5424 # Default syslog parser is rfc3164 # UDP network socket - name: syslog-udp-test syslog: uri: udp://0.0.0.0:6140 # Use the udp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format max_line_kb: 35 # Paths for Unix sockets are defined by combining protocol and path: # unix_udp:// + /path/socket - for example, unix_udp:///tmp/socket # Unix TCP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-tcp-test syslog: uri: unix_tcp:///var/unix-tcp-socket-test unix_permissions: 0666 # Default is 0644.

No data appears when tailing a file The log forwarding feature requires the agent to have permission to read the data sources. When running the infrastructure agent in privileged or non-privileged modes, make sure that the log files you want to forward (and any intermediary directory in its path) are readable by the user running nri-agent. Example: checking file access under Linux Let's check whether the file /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log can be monitored by the nri-agent user. In Linux, you can do a quick check with the namei command: sudo -u nri-agent namei -ml /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log f: /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log drwxr-xr-x root root / drwxr-xr-x root root var drwxrwxr-x root syslog log drwxr--r-- root root restrictedLogs logFile.log - No such file or directory Copy This command failed because the file is not visible to the nri-agent user. By inspecting the previous output, we can detect that the restrictedLogs directory is missing the execution flag for others\". We can fix this by executing: sudo chmod 755 /var/log/restrictedLogs Copy And then check for file access again: # sudo -u nri-agent namei -ml /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log f: /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log drwxr-xr-x root root / drwxr-xr-x root root var drwxrwxr-x root syslog log drwxr-xr-x root root restrictedLogs -rw-r----- vagrant vagrant logFile.log Copy The file is now visible to the nri-agent user. You must ensure that the file is also readable by the nri-agent user. To check this, use: # sudo -u nri-agent head /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log head: cannot open '/var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log' for reading: Permission denied Copy In this example, the file is missing the read rights for the others group (users other than vagrant and the vagrant user group). You could fix this by granting read permissions to others, but the application could change these permissions upon restart. To avoid this, a better approach is to add the nri-agent user to the vagrant user group. No data appears when capturing via a Syslog socket The log forwarding feature requires that the agent has permission to read the data sources. When running the infrastructure agent in privileged or non-privileged modes: If you're using Unix domain socket files, make sure that the nri-agent user can access these files (please refer to the previous section) and that they have read and write permissions (666) so that other users than nri-agent can write to them. If you're using IP sockets, ensure that the port that you are using is not a system reserved one (like port 80, for example). If no data appears after you enable log management, follow standard log management troubleshooting procedures. No data appears using infrastructure agent proxy As explained in the infrastructure agent configuration guidelines, the proxy parameter must use either HTTP or HTTPS and be in the form https://user:password@hostname:port. The agent can parse the parameter without the HTTP or HTTPS, but the log-forwarder cannot. You will see an error like the following in the agent verbose logs: [ERROR] building HTTP transport: parse \\\"hostname:port\\\": first path segment in URL cannot contain colon Copy To solve this problem, check your newrelic-infra.yml file, and ensure the proxy parameter adheres to this form. Send the agent's logs to New Relic You can configure the infrastructure agent to send its own logs to New Relic. This is useful for troubleshooting issues with log forwarding, the agent, or when contacting support. To forward the infrastructure agent logs to New Relic: Edit your newrelic-infra.yml file. Enable agent logging in troubleshooting mode by adding verbose: 3 Important On Windows and systems that don't use systemd or where journald is inaccessible, verbose:3 causes the agent to write the logs on the disk. Revert to verbose:0 to prevent this. (Recommended): Enable agent logging in JSON format to log_format: json. Restart the agent to load the new settings. This configuration sets up the agent in troubleshooting mode, but the log forwarder (based on Fluent Bit) will continue in a non-verbose mode. Sometimes you can have issues with the log forwarder itself. For example, there may be problems accessing a specific channel when shipping Windows log events or when accessing a particular log file. In these situations, you can also enable the verbose mode for the log forwarder: Set verbose to a value other than 0. Add the following configuration option: trace: [\"log.fw\"]. Caution Check whether you are using the fluentbit option. When setting verbose: 3 and trace: [\"log.fw\"], ensure that you don't define any [OUTPUT] section pointing to stdout in an external Fluent Bit configuration file, Fluent Bit does not start with the infra-agent For Linux versions previous to 2016 you may need to update the OpenSSL library to 1.1.0 (or higher). To check if you have this problem: See if infra-agenthas started Fluent Bit by doing ps -aux | grep fluent-bit Copy If it isn't running go to /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/logging and run ./fluent-bit -i systemd -o stdout Copy If you get the following error, update OpenSSL to 1.1.0 or higher: error while loading shared libraries: libssl.so.1.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory Runtime error on Windows One of the following error messages may appear when enabling log forwarding on Windows: The code execution cannot proceed because VCRUNTIME140.dll was not found. Copy OR error=\"exit status 3221225781\" process=log-forwarder Copy This is caused by a missing DLL. To solve the issue, install the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable: x64 or x86. What's next? Now that you've enabled Logs, here are some potential next steps: Explore your data using the Logs UI. Configure your agent to see contextual log data, such as distributed tracing, stack traces, application logs, and more. Query your data and create custom dashboards or alerts.",

Enable log management Confirm that you have log management enabled, with a compatible log forwarding plugin installed to send your application logs to New Relic. Install or update the Ruby agent Install or update to the most recent Ruby agent version, and enable distributed tracing. Configure logs in context for Ruby Configure for Rails Rails logging is controlled by two components: a logger (customizable by setting config.logger) and a log formatter (customizable by setting config.log_formatter). In most cases, logs in context should be configured by setting config.log_formatter to the DecoratingFormatter in your Rails application. For more guidance regarding Rails configuration, see Configuring Rails Applications. In your application's config, require 'newrelic_rpm', then add the following line: module ________ class Application < Rails::Application ... config.log_formatter = ::NewRelic::Agent::Logging::DecoratingFormatter.new end end Copy This will use the New Relic formatter to format log messages, but the rest of the logging configuration will be provided by the other Rails config settings. Please note that Logs in Context for Ruby does not currently support tagged logging; if you are initializing your logger with a log_tags argument, your custom tags may not appear on the final version of your logs. Rails advanced configuration If setting the log_formatter option doesn't meet your needs, replace the entire Rails logger with an instance of the New Relic logger. Provide the parameters to the logger's constructor, like this: module ________ class Application < Rails::Application ... config.logger = ::NewRelic::Agent::Logging::DecoratingLogger.new( \"log/application.log\", #etc... ) end end Copy Configure for Ruby without Rails For non-Rails applications, use the DecoratingLogger in place of the Ruby standard ::Logger, like this: logger = ::NewRelic::Agent::Logging::DecoratingLogger.new( 'log/application.log', #etc... ) ... logger.info(...) Copy The DecoratingLogger is a drop-in replacement for the Ruby standard ::Logger. Their constructors accept the same parameters. Advanced configuration Custom logger configuration To use our logging extension with a different logging implementation, or your own custom logger, use the DecoratingFormatter. Example: module ________ class Application < Rails::Application ... config.logger = ::YourCustomLoggerImplementation.new( $stdout, formatter: ::NewRelic::Agent::Logging::DecoratingFormatter.new ) end end Copy Lograge configuration To configure this extension with the lograge gem, there is no additional configuration required. Check for logging data If you have configured your logging in /config/application.rb, or in /config/environments/development.rb, run your application locally and check its logging output. You should see some output like this: {\"entity.name\":\"your_app_name\",\"entity.type\":\"SERVICE\",\"hostname\":\"79bcbf8d\",\"trace.id\":\"79bcbf8d\",\"span.id\":\"00fc7d46\",\"timestamp\":1567701375543,\"message\":\"example log message one\",\"log.level\":\"DEBUG\"} {\"entity.name\":\"your_app_name\",\"entity.type\":\"SERVICE\",\"hostname\":\"79bcbf8d\",\"trace.id\":\"79bcbf8d\",\"span.id\":\"6754870b\",\"timestamp\":1567702843604,\"message\":\"example log message two\",\"log.level\":\"DEBUG\"} Copy If you have deployed this application to an environment with a log forwarder, your application's logs will appear in the New Relic Logs UI with metadata linking them to a trace and a span. You can find them using a query like this: entity.name:\"your_app_name\" has:trace.id Copy If you see JSON logs in your application's output, but no logs returned by a query like the above, check your log forwarder. Troubleshooting If the logs from your application are not formatted in JSON with fields like trace.id and span.id, there may be a problem with the configuration of the New Relic Logging Extension. Check that: the application is using a supported logging framework. the configuration has been applied to all the environments where you would like to use the New Relic Logging Extension. there is not another logger configured later in the configuration of the application. Incompatible gems The New Relic decorating logger is known to be incompatible with the following gems: logging semantic logger rails_stdout_logger rails_12factor What's next? Now that you've set up APM logs in context, here are some potential next steps: Explore your data using the Logs UI. Troubleshoot errors with distributed tracing, stack traces, application logs, and more. Query your data and create custom dashboards or alerts.",

      "body": "You can forward your logs to New Relic using our infrastructure monitoring agent. This makes all of your logging data available in one location and provides deeper visibility into both your application and your platform performance data. Tip To use log management and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Enable log forwarding using the infrastructure agent To enable log forwarding through the infrastructure agent: Start by verifying the system requirements needed for configuring Logs. Ensure you have installed the infrastructure agent, version 1.11.4 or higher. Create a logging.yml file in the infrastructure agent's logging.d directory. Configure your log sources and other parameters. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your account for data. Explore your log data in the Logs UI and benefit from the log attributes automatically inserted by the infrastructure agent. System Requirements To use the log forwarder of the infrastructure agent, make sure you meet the following requirements: Infrastructure agent version 1.11.4 or higher OpenSSL library 1.1.0 or higher is required by infra-agent starting from v1.16.4. The log forwarding feature is compatible with the following operating systems: Operating system Supported version Amazon Linux Amazon Linux 2 CentOS Version 7 or higher Debian Version 9 (\"Stretch\") or higher Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) Version 7 or higher SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) Version 12 Ubuntu Versions 16.04.x, 18.04.x and 20.04.x (LTS versions) Windows Windows Server 2012, 2016, and 2019, and their service packs. Windows 10 Caution The log forwarding feature is not supported on containerized infrastructure agents. Install the infrastructure agent Starting with version 1.11.4, the infrastructure agent can forward logs to New Relic. To install and run the agent, use a package manager (Linux) or the MSI installer (Windows). To use the following links, make sure you are logged to your New Relic account. Amazon Linux CentOS Debian RHEL SLES Ubuntu Windows If you don't have a New Relic account yet, or prefer to follow the procedure manually, see our tutorial to install the package manager. Configure the infrastructure agent Configuration files describe which log sources are forwarded. The Infrastructure agent uses .yml files for configuring logging. You can add as many config files as you want. To add a new configuration file for the log forwarding feature: Navigate to the logging forwarder configuration folder: Linux: /etc/newrelic-infra/logging.d/ Windows: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\logging.d\\ Create a logging.yml configuration file and add the parameters you need. The logging.d directory has various .yml.example files that can be used as a reference or starting point. The agent automatically processes new configuration files without having to restart the Infrastructure service. The only exception to this is when configuring a custom Fluent Bit configuration. Log forwarding parameters The infrastructure log forwarding .yml config supports the following parameters: Name (required) To start, make sure to define a name for the logs you want to forward: name Name of the log or logs being forwarding to New Relic. Log source (required) What you use for the log source will depend on where you want to forward your logs from. The available options are listed below: file Path to the log file or files. The agent tracks changes on the log files in a way similar to tail -f shell. Example: logs: - name: example-log file: /var/log/example.log # Path to a single log file - name: example-log-two file: /var/log/example-two.log # Path to another single log file Copy The file parameter can point to a specific log file or multiple files by using wildcards applied to names and extensions; for example, /logs/*.log. You can use wildcards in place of directories in a file path, which can be used to tail files located in different directories. Example: logs: - name: docker-logs file: /var/lib/docker/containers/*/*.log # Path to multiple folders and files Copy Important Use of wildcards may significantly increase the number of file descriptors the Fluent Bit process keeps open, which can interfere with log collection if the host's file descriptor limit is reached. We recommend increasing the file descriptor limit on Linux hosts running Fluent Bit by adding the following to the host's /etc/security/limits.conf file: root soft nofile 65536 root hard nofile 65536 *soft nofile 65536 *hard nofile 65536 Copy If you add these changes, reboot the host to ensure your changes are applied. systemd Use the systemd paramater to forward log messages that are collected by the journald daemon in Linux environments. This input type requires the agent to run in root mode. Example: logs: - name: systemd-example systemd: cupsd Copy syslog Syslog data source. Parameters: uri: Syslog socket. Format varies depending on the protocol: TCP/UDP network sockets: [tcp/udp]://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT Unix domain sockets: unix_[tcp/udp]:// + /socket/path parser: Syslog parser. Default is rfc3164. Use rfc5424 if your messages include fractional seconds. Note: rfc3164 currently does not work on SuSE. unix_permissions: default is 0644 for domain sockets; this limits entries to processes running as root. You can use 0666 to listen for non-root processes, at your own risk. When running the agent in privileged mode, ports and sockets must be available or owned by nri-agent, with 0666 file permissions, so that other processes can write logs to the sockets. logs: # TCP network socket - name: syslog-tcp-test syslog: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:5140 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format parser: rfc5424 # Default syslog parser is rfc3164 # UDP network socket - name: syslog-udp-test syslog: uri: udp://0.0.0.0:6140 # Use the udp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format max_line_kb: 35 # Unix TCP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-tcp-test syslog: uri: unix_tcp:///var/unix-tcp-socket-test unix_permissions: 0666 # Default is 0644. Change at your own risk # Unix UDP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-udp-test syslog: uri: unix_udp:///var/unix-udp-socket-test parser: rfc5424 Copy tcp Logs retrieved over TCP connections. Parameters: uri: TCP/IP socket to listen for incoming data. The URI format is tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format: format of the data. It can be json or none. separator: If format: none is used, you can define a separator string for splitting records (default: \\n). logs: - name: tcp-simple-test tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:1234 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format format: none # Raw text - this is default for 'tcp' separator: \\t # String for separating raw text entries max_line_kb: 32 - name: tcp-json-test tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:2345 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format format: json Copy winlog Collect events from Windows log channels. Parameters: channel: name of the channel logs will be collected from. collect-eventids: a list of Windows Event IDs to be collected and forwarded to New Relic. Event ID ranges are supported. exclude-eventids: a list of Windows Event IDs to be excluded from collection. Event ID ranges are supported. All events are collected from the specified channel by default. Configure the collect-eventids and exclude-eventids sections to avoid sending unwanted logs to your New Relic account. Add event IDs or ranges to collect-eventids or exclude-eventids to forward or drop specific events. exclude-eventids takes precedence over collect-eventids if the same event ID is present in both sections. Example: logs: # Winlog log ingestion with eventId filters. - name: windows-security winlog: channel: Security collect-eventids: - 4624 - 4265 - 4700-4800 exclude-eventids: - 4735 # entries for the application, system, powershell, and SCOM channels - name: windows-application winlog: channel: Application - name: windows-system winlog: channel: System - name: windows-pshell winlog: channel: Windows Powershell - name: scom winlog: channel: Operations Manager # Entry for Windows Defender Logs - name: windows-defender winlog: channel: Microsoft-Windows-Windows Defender/Operational # Entry for Windows Clustering Logs - name: windows-clustering winlog: channel: Microsoft-Windows-FailoverClustering/Operational # Entry for IIS logs with logtype attribute for automatic parsing - name: iis-log file: C:\\inetpub\\logs\\LogFiles\\w3svc.log attributes: logtype: iis_w3c Copy Optional Configuration The following are configuration paramaters that are not required but are still recommended. attributes List of custom attributes as key-value pairs that can be used to send additional data with the logs which you can then query. Add attributes to any log source. Example: logs: - name: example-file-attributes file: /var/log/example.log attributes: logtype: nginx region: example-us-02 team: A-team - name: example-tcp-attributes tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:2345 format: json attributes: logtype: nginx region: example-us-02 team: B-team Copy Log attributes automatically inserted by the infrastructure agent(#automatically-inserted-attributes) The infrastructure agent automatically inserts log attributes for your convenience. Some of them are inserted for any log record, while others depend on the configuration parameters you used while setting up the log forwarder. Find a summary of these attributes in the following table: Attribute name Inserting conditions Description entity.guids Always inserted The infrastructure agent inserts the Entity GUID assigned by New Relic to identify the host where it's running. It is available in the entity.guids field. Note: If the captured logs belong to an application instrumented using APM, the entity.guids field contains both the entity GUID of infrastructure, as well as the GUID of APM, separated by a pipe ( | ) delimiter. fb.input Always inserted The underlying Fluent Bit input plugin type used to capture the logs. Currently, its values are tail, systemd, winlog, syslog, and tcp. filePath When using the file input type Absolute file path of the file being monitored. hostname Always inserted The hostname of the machine/VM/container executing the infrastructure agent. plugin.type Always inserted Indicates the utility used to capture the logs. In this case, it is the infrastructure agent itself, so this attribute always has the value nri-agent. pattern Regular expression for filtering records. Only supported for the tail, systemd, syslog, and tcp (only with format none) sources. This field works in a way similar to grep -E in Unix systems. For example, for a given file being captured, you can filter for records containing either WARN or ERROR using: - name: only-records-with-warn-and-error file: /var/log/logFile.log pattern: WARN|ERROR Copy No filtering is applied by default. max_line_kb Maximum size of log entries/lines in KB. If log entries exceed the limit, they are skipped. Default is 128. fluentbit External Fluent Bit configuration and parser files. If defined, they are merged with the existing configuration and parser files generated by the infrastructure agent. The infrastructure agent processes the configuration files located in the logging.d directory and will generate a run-time Fluent Bit configuration file that contains the appropriate [INPUT], [FILTER] and [OUTPUT] sections. Optionally, it will also declare an @INCLUDE in case you provided an external Fluent Bit configuration file via the fluentbit option. The runtime file does not define a [SERVICE] section, leaving all default Fluent Bit configuration values. You can still override Fluent Bit's default settings by defining your own [SERVICE] section in your external Fluent Bit configuration file and include it via the fluentbit option. Parameters: config_file: path to an existing Fluent Bit configuration file. Note that any overlapping source results in duplicate messages in New Relic Logs. parsers_file: path to an existing Fluent Bit parsers file. The following parser names are reserved: rfc3164, rfc3164-local and rfc5424. Sample configuration file Here is an example of a logging.d/ configuration file in YAML format. For more configuration examples, see the infrastructure agent repository. logging.d/sample.yaml # Remember to only use spaces for indentation logs: # Example of 'file' source - name: file-with-attributes file: /var/log/test.log # Path to a single file or pattern attributes: # You can use custom attributes to enrich your data logtype: nginx team: The A Team pattern: Error # Regular expression to filter log entries # Example of 'systemd' source (Linux only) - name: systemd-example systemd: cupsd # Examples of 'syslog' source, one per protocol # TCP network socket - name: syslog-tcp-test syslog: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:5140 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format parser: rfc5424 # Default syslog parser is rfc3164 # UDP network socket - name: syslog-udp-test syslog: uri: udp://0.0.0.0:6140 # Use the udp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format max_line_kb: 35 # Paths for Unix sockets are defined by combining protocol and path: # unix_udp:// + /path/socket - for example, unix_udp:///tmp/socket # Unix TCP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-tcp-test syslog: uri: unix_tcp:///var/unix-tcp-socket-test unix_permissions: 0666 # Default is 0644.

No data appears when tailing a file The log forwarding feature requires the agent to have permission to read the data sources. When running the infrastructure agent in privileged or non-privileged modes, make sure that the log files you want to forward (and any intermediary directory in its path) are readable by the user running nri-agent. Example: checking file access under Linux Let's check whether the file /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log can be monitored by the nri-agent user. In Linux, you can do a quick check with the namei command: sudo -u nri-agent namei -ml /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log f: /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log drwxr-xr-x root root / drwxr-xr-x root root var drwxrwxr-x root syslog log drwxr--r-- root root restrictedLogs logFile.log - No such file or directory Copy This command failed because the file is not visible to the nri-agent user. By inspecting the previous output, we can detect that the restrictedLogs directory is missing the execution flag for others\". We can fix this by executing: sudo chmod 755 /var/log/restrictedLogs Copy And then check for file access again: # sudo -u nri-agent namei -ml /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log f: /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log drwxr-xr-x root root / drwxr-xr-x root root var drwxrwxr-x root syslog log drwxr-xr-x root root restrictedLogs -rw-r----- vagrant vagrant logFile.log Copy The file is now visible to the nri-agent user. You must ensure that the file is also readable by the nri-agent user. To check this, use: # sudo -u nri-agent head /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log head: cannot open '/var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log' for reading: Permission denied Copy In this example, the file is missing the read rights for the others group (users other than vagrant and the vagrant user group). You could fix this by granting read permissions to others, but the application could change these permissions upon restart. To avoid this, a better approach is to add the nri-agent user to the vagrant user group. No data appears when capturing via a Syslog socket The log forwarding feature requires that the agent has permission to read the data sources. When running the infrastructure agent in privileged or non-privileged modes: If you're using Unix domain socket files, make sure that the nri-agent user can access these files (please refer to the previous section) and that they have read and write permissions (666) so that other users than nri-agent can write to them. If you're using IP sockets, ensure that the port that you are using is not a system reserved one (like port 80, for example). If no data appears after you enable log management, follow standard log management troubleshooting procedures. No data appears using infrastructure agent proxy As explained in the infrastructure agent configuration guidelines, the proxy parameter must use either HTTP or HTTPS and be in the form https://user:password@hostname:port. The agent can parse the parameter without the HTTP or HTTPS, but the log-forwarder cannot. You will see an error like the following in the agent verbose logs: [ERROR] building HTTP transport: parse \\\"hostname:port\\\": first path segment in URL cannot contain colon Copy To solve this problem, check your newrelic-infra.yml file, and ensure the proxy parameter adheres to this form. Send the agent's logs to New Relic You can configure the infrastructure agent to send its own logs to New Relic. This is useful for troubleshooting issues with log forwarding, the agent, or when contacting support. To forward the infrastructure agent logs to New Relic: Edit your newrelic-infra.yml file. Enable agent logging in troubleshooting mode by adding verbose: 3 Important On Windows and systems that don't use systemd or where journald is inaccessible, verbose:3 causes the agent to write the logs on the disk. Revert to verbose:0 to prevent this. (Recommended): Enable agent logging in JSON format to log_format: json. Restart the agent to load the new settings. This configuration sets up the agent in troubleshooting mode, but the log forwarder (based on Fluent Bit) will continue in a non-verbose mode. Sometimes you can have issues with the log forwarder itself. For example, there may be problems accessing a specific channel when shipping Windows log events or when accessing a particular log file. In these situations, you can also enable the verbose mode for the log forwarder: Set verbose to a value other than 0. Add the following configuration option: trace: [\"log.fw\"]. Caution Check whether you are using the fluentbit option. When setting verbose: 3 and trace: [\"log.fw\"], ensure that you don't define any [OUTPUT] section pointing to stdout in an external Fluent Bit configuration file, Fluent Bit does not start with the infra-agent For Linux versions previous to 2016 you may need to update the OpenSSL library to 1.1.0 (or higher). To check if you have this problem: See if infra-agenthas started Fluent Bit by doing ps -aux | grep fluent-bit Copy If it isn't running go to /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/logging and run ./fluent-bit -i systemd -o stdout Copy If you get the following error, update OpenSSL to 1.1.0 or higher: error while loading shared libraries: libssl.so.1.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory Runtime error on Windows One of the following error messages may appear when enabling log forwarding on Windows: The code execution cannot proceed because VCRUNTIME140.dll was not found. Copy OR error=\"exit status 3221225781\" process=log-forwarder Copy This is caused by a missing DLL. To solve the issue, install the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable: x64 or x86. What's next? Now that you've enabled Logs, here are some potential next steps: Explore your data using the Logs UI.

      "body": "Logs in context for the Ruby agent connects your logs and APM data in New Relic, giving full context to high-level events and providing high value data to specific log lines. Read on to learn how to configure logs in context and enrich your log data. Compatibility and requirements To use log management with the Ruby agent, ensure your configuration meets the following requirements: Ruby agent 6.7.0 or higher: Install or update Supported Rails version (for Rails applications) Configure logs in context with log management To configure logs in context with Ruby: Enable log management with a compatible log forwarding plugin. Install or update the Ruby agent. Configure logs in context for Ruby. Optional: Advanced configuration. Check for logging data. Enable log management Confirm that you have log management enabled, with a compatible log forwarding plugin installed to send your application logs to New Relic. Install or update the Ruby agent Install or update to the most recent Ruby agent version, and enable distributed tracing. Configure logs in context for Ruby Configure for Rails Rails logging is controlled by two components: a logger (customizable by setting config.logger) and a log formatter (customizable by setting config.log_formatter). In most cases, logs in context should be configured by setting config.log_formatter to the DecoratingFormatter in your Rails application. For more guidance regarding Rails configuration, see Configuring Rails Applications. In your application's config, require 'newrelic_rpm', then add the following line: module ________ class Application < Rails::Application ... config.log_formatter = ::NewRelic::Agent::Logging::DecoratingFormatter.new end end Copy This will use the New Relic formatter to format log messages, but the rest of the logging configuration will be provided by the other Rails config settings. Please note that Logs in Context for Ruby does not currently support tagged logging; if you are initializing your logger with a log_tags argument, your custom tags may not appear on the final version of your logs. Rails advanced configuration If setting the log_formatter option doesn't meet your needs, replace the entire Rails logger with an instance of the New Relic logger. Provide the parameters to the logger's constructor, like this: module ________ class Application < Rails::Application ... config.logger = ::NewRelic::Agent::Logging::DecoratingLogger.new( \"log/application.log\", #etc... ) end end Copy Configure for Ruby without Rails For non-Rails applications, use the DecoratingLogger in place of the Ruby standard ::Logger, like this: logger = ::NewRelic::Agent::Logging::DecoratingLogger.new( 'log/application.log', #etc... ) ... logger.info(...) Copy The DecoratingLogger is a drop-in replacement for the Ruby standard ::Logger. Their constructors accept the same parameters. Advanced configuration Custom logger configuration To use our logging extension with a different logging implementation, or your own custom logger, use the DecoratingFormatter. Example: module ________ class Application < Rails::Application ... config.logger = ::YourCustomLoggerImplementation.new( $stdout, formatter: ::NewRelic::Agent::Logging::DecoratingFormatter.new ) end end Copy Lograge configuration To configure this extension with the lograge gem, there is no additional configuration required. Check for logging data If you have configured your logging in /config/application.rb, or in /config/environments/development.rb, run your application locally and check its logging output. You should see some output like this: {\"entity.name\":\"your_app_name\",\"entity.type\":\"SERVICE\",\"hostname\":\"79bcbf8d\",\"trace.id\":\"79bcbf8d\",\"span.id\":\"00fc7d46\",\"timestamp\":1567701375543,\"message\":\"example log message one\",\"log.level\":\"DEBUG\"} {\"entity.name\":\"your_app_name\",\"entity.type\":\"SERVICE\",\"hostname\":\"79bcbf8d\",\"trace.id\":\"79bcbf8d\",\"span.id\":\"6754870b\",\"timestamp\":1567702843604,\"message\":\"example log message two\",\"log.level\":\"DEBUG\"} Copy If you have deployed this application to an environment with a log forwarder, your application's logs will appear in the New Relic Logs UI with metadata linking them to a trace and a span. You can find them using a query like this: entity.name:\"your_app_name\" has:trace.id Copy If you see JSON logs in your application's output, but no logs returned by a query like the above, check your log forwarder. Troubleshooting If the logs from your application are not formatted in JSON with fields like trace.id and span.id, there may be a problem with the configuration of the New Relic Logging Extension. Check that: the application is using a supported logging framework. the configuration has been applied to all the environments where you would like to use the New Relic Logging Extension. there is not another logger configured later in the configuration of the application. Incompatible gems The New Relic decorating logger is known to be incompatible with the following gems: logging semantic logger rails_stdout_logger rails_12factor What's next?

If you are logging to the console (stdout/stderr), look for ConsoleAppender and replace : <appender name=\"STDOUT\" class=\"ch.qos.logback.core.ConsoleAppender\"> <encoder class=\"com.newrelic.logging.logback.NewRelicEncoder\"/> </appender> Copy If you are logging to a file, look for FileAppender and replace <encoder>: <appender name=\"LOG_FILE\" class=\"ch.qos.logback.core.FileAppender\"> <file>logs/app-log-file.log</file> <encoder class=\"com.newrelic.logging.logback.NewRelicEncoder\"/> </appender> Copy Update your logging configuration xml with the NewRelicAsyncAppender. To ensure that NewRelicAsyncAppender wraps any appenders that will target New Relic's log forwarder, add the following section. Change \"LOG_FILE\" to the name of the appender you updated in the previous step. <appender name=\"ASYNC\" class=\"com.newrelic.logging.logback.NewRelicAsyncAppender\"> <appender-ref ref=\"LOG_FILE\" /> </appender> Copy Make sure NewRelicAsyncAppender is the appender used in your logger. Replace your root logger’s appenders with the ASYNC appender created in the previous step. <root> <appender-ref ref=\"ASYNC\" /> </root> Copy Important It's important that the NewRelicAsyncAppender be the first appender to see the log message. List any other appenders after the NewRelicAsyncAppender in the <root> list. Example configuration files You can find a working example in GitHub. Here are examples of an updated logging .xml file for the Logback extension. Single console appender example Example configuration file after adding in the logging extension information. <configuration> <appender name=\"STDOUT\" class=\"ch.qos.logback.core.ConsoleAppender\"> <!-- changed the encoder --> <encoder class=\"com.newrelic.logging.logback.NewRelicEncoder\"/> </appender> <!-- added the ASYNC appender --> <appender name=\"ASYNC\" class=\"com.newrelic.logging.logback.NewRelicAsyncAppender\"> <appender-ref ref=\"STDOUT\" /> </appender> <root level=\"debug\"> <!-- changed the root logger --> <appender-ref ref=\"ASYNC\" /> </root> </configuration> Copy Two-appender example This example sends New Relic logging to a file, but still sends standard logging to the console. <configuration> <appender name=\"FILE\" class=\"ch.qos.logback.core.FileAppender\"> <file>myApp.log</file> <!-- encoder changed --> <encoder class=\"com.newrelic.logging.logback.NewRelicEncoder\"/> </appender> <!-- this appender does normal console logging --> <appender name=\"STDOUT\" class=\"ch.qos.logback.core.ConsoleAppender\"> <encoder> <pattern>%msg%n</pattern> </encoder> </appender> <!-- The required New Relic ASYNC appender wraps the FILE appender --> <appender name=\"ASYNC\" class=\"com.newrelic.logging.logback.NewRelicAsyncAppender\"> <appender-ref ref=\"FILE\" /> </appender> <root level=\"debug\"> <!-- ASYNC is one of the main appenders --> <appender-ref ref=\"ASYNC\" /> <!-- Send every message to normal console logging, as well. --> <appender-ref ref=\"STDOUT\" /> </root> </configuration> Copy Check for logging data To verify that you have configured the extension correctly, run your application and verify that the logging you have configured contains the following: Includes trace.id and span.id fields Is properly-formatted JSON lines If everything is configured correctly and your data is being reported, you should see data logs in the New Relic Logs UI using the query operator has: span.id/trace.id.

Compatibility and requirements To use New Relic logs in context with Log4j 1.x, ensure your configuration meets the following requirements: Java agent 5.6.0 or higher: Install or update JVM argument -javaagent enabled on the Java agent. Log4j 1.x package installed and working on the application. log4j must be configured in code or via XML. Properties files are not supported because AsyncAppender instances can only be automatically configured via XML. Configure logs in context with log management To configure logs in context with Logs4j 1.x: Enable log management with a compatible log forwarding plugin. Install or update the Java agent. Configure the Log4j 1.x extension. Check for logging data. Enable log management Confirm that you have log management enabled, with a compatible log forwarding plugin installed to send your application logs to New Relic. Install or update the Java agent Install or update to the most recent Java agent version, and enable Distributed tracing. Configure the Log4j 1.x extension To configure logs in context with the Log4j 1.x extension, complete the following steps: Update your project's dependencies to include the Log4j 1.x extension as applicable: To update with Gradle, add the following to your build.gradle file: dependencies { compile(\"com.newrelic.logging:log4j1:2.0\") } Copy To update with Maven, add the following to your pom.xml file: <dependencies> <dependency> <groupId>com.newrelic.logging</groupId> <artifactId>log4j1</artifactId> <version>2.0</version> </dependency> </dependencies> Copy In your logging configuration XML file, update your <appender> element with a NewRelicLayout, adding <layout class=\"com.newrelic.logging.log4j1.NewRelicLayout\"/> as shown below: <appender name=\" TypicalFile \" class=\"org.apache.log4j.FileAppender\"> <param name=\"file\" value=\"logs/log4j1-app.log\"/> <param name=\"append\" value=\"false\"/> <layout class=\" com.newrelic.logging.log4j1.NewRelicLayout \"/> <!-- only this line needs to be added --> </appender> Copy Once updated, use NewRelicAsyncAppender to wrap any appenders that will target New Relic's log forwarder.

If you are logging to the console (stdout/stderr), look for ConsoleAppender and replace : <appender name=\"STDOUT\" class=\"ch.qos.logback.core.ConsoleAppender\"> <encoder class=\"com.newrelic.logging.logback.NewRelicEncoder\"/> </appender> Copy If you are logging to a file, look for FileAppender and replace <encoder>: <appender name=\"LOG_FILE\" class=\"ch.qos.logback.core.FileAppender\"> <file>logs/app-log-file.log</file> <encoder class=\"com.newrelic.logging.logback.NewRelicEncoder\"/> </appender> Copy Update your logging configuration xml with the NewRelicAsyncAppender. To ensure that NewRelicAsyncAppender wraps any appenders that will target New Relic's log forwarder, add the following section. Change \"LOG_FILE\" to the name of the appender you updated in the previous step. <appender name=\"ASYNC\" class=\"com.newrelic.logging.logback.NewRelicAsyncAppender\"> <appender-ref ref=\"LOG_FILE\" /> </appender> Copy Make sure NewRelicAsyncAppender is the appender used in your logger.

Configure the Dropwizard extension To configure logs in context with the Dropwizard 1.3 extension, complete the following steps: Update your project's dependencies to include the Dropwizard 1.3 extension as applicable: To update with Gradle, add the following to your build.gradle file: dependencies { compile(\"com.newrelic.logging:dropwizard:2.0\") } Copy To update with Maven, add the following to your pom.xml file: <dependencies> <dependency> <groupId>com.newrelic.logging</groupId> <artifactId>dropwizard</artifactId> <version>2.0</version> </dependency> </dependencies> Copy Update your Dropwizard .yaml configuration file with a newrelic-json layout, replacing the currently used type: console or type: file with either type: newrelic-console or type: newrelic-file as appropriate. For example: logging: appenders: - type: newrelic-console # Add the two lines below if you don't have a layout specified on the appender. # If you have a layout, remove all parameters to the layout and set the type. layout: type: newrelic-json Copy Alternatively, the New Relic Dropwizard extension also supports a log-format layout type that uses the standard Dropwizard logging. For testing purposes, you can change the type of the layout with a one-line change logging: appenders: - type: newrelic-file # This format will be ignored by the newrelic-json layout, but used by the log-format layout. logFormat: \"%date{ISO8601} %c %-5p: %m trace.id=%mdc{trace.id} span.id=%mdc{span.id}%n\" layout: # type: newrelic-json type: log-format Copy Check for logging data To verify that you have configured the extension correctly, run your application and verify that the logging you have configured contains the following: Includes trace.id and span.id fields Is properly-formatted JSON lines If everything is configured correctly and your data is being reported, you should see data logs in the New Relic Logs UI using the query operator has: span.id/trace.id.

Read on to learn how to configure logs in context and enrich your log data. Compatibility and requirements To use New Relic logs in context with Serilog, ensure your configuration meets the following requirements: Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5+ or .NET Core 2.0+ New Relic .NET agent 8.21+ New Relic .NET agent API 8.21+ Serilog 2.5+ Serilog File Sinks v4.0+ Overview Serilog is a structured logging framework that records log messages from your application and creates a LogEvent to store the message data. Using Enrichers, you can add additional information to the log events, while Sinks and Formatters allow you to format and output those log events for downstream consumption and viewing. This diagram illustrates the flow of log messages through Serilog. This diagram illustrates the flow of log messages through Serilog, highlighting specific components of the New Relic Serilog extension. The above diagram highlights several components of the Serilog extension: New Relic Enricher: The NewRelicEnricher adds contextual information from the .NET agent (using the API) to the log events generated by the application. This contextual information, known as linking metadata, is used by New Relic to link log messages to the transactions and spans from which they were created. New Relic Formatter: The NewRelicFormattertranslates enriched log events into the JSON format expected by New Relic. A sink instructs Serilog to output the JSON to a file in the location that the Log Forwarder expects. New Relic Log Forwarder: The NewRelicFormattertranslates enriched log events into the JSON format expected by New Relic. A sink instructs Serilog to output the JSON to a file in the location that the log forwarder expects. The example below uses the New Relic Fluentd log forwarded, however there are many other log forwarders that can be used. For more information, see Introduction to log management. For more information about Serilog log events, see the Serilog Getting started documentation. Configure logs in context with log management To configure New Relic logs in context with Serilog: Enable log management with a compatible log forwarding plugin. Install or update the .NET agent. Configure the Serilog extension. Check for logging data. Enable log management Confirm that you have log management enabled, with a compatible log forwarding plugin installed to send your application logs to New Relic. Install or update the .NET agent Install or update to the most recent .NET agent version, and enable Distributed tracing. Configure the Serilog extension To configure logs in context with the Serilog extension, complete the following steps: Using the Visual Studio NuGet Package Manager, locate and install the NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Serilog package. In your application code, update your logging configuration to add the NewRelicEnricher and NewRelicFormatter. The following code example enriches log events with New Relic linking metadata. In addition to the existing log files, it outputs new log files in a specific JSON format at C:\\logs\\SerilogExample.log.json for consumption by the Log Forwarder: var loggerConfig = new LoggerConfiguration() loggerConfig .Enrich.WithThreadName() .Enrich.WithThreadId() .Enrich.WithNewRelicLogsInContext() .WriteTo.File( path: @\"C:\\logs\\ExistingLoggingOutput.txt\") .WriteTo.File( formatter: new NewRelicFormatter(), path: @\"C:\\logs\\SerilogExample.log.json\"); var log = loggerConfig.CreateLogger(); Copy Caution The above configuration results in new JSON files that are written to disk. Some of these configuration options may be useful in managing the amount of disk space used and/or the performance of the sink. restrictedToMinimumLevel buffered rollingInterval rollOnFileSizeLimit retainedFileCountLimit Important Though not required, using the Serilog Asynchronous Sink Wrapper may help improve the performance by performing formatting and output of log files on a different thread. Once you have configured the Serilog extension and updated your logging file, you can configure your extension to send data to New Relic Logs. See below for an example of this configuration using the Fluentd plugin for New Relic Logs: <!--NewRelicLoggingExample.conf--> <source> @type tail path C:\\logs\\SerilogExample.log.json pos_file C:\\logs\\SerilogExample.log.json.pos tag logfile.* <parse> @type json </parse> </source> <match **> @type newrelic license_key <YOUR NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY> base_uri https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 </match> Copy File-based configuration Configuration of the New Relic Logs Serilog extension may also be accomplished with file-based configuration providers. appsettings.json based configuration The example code below creates a logger based on settings contained in an appSettings.json file. Important The following additional NuGet Packages are required: Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration Serilog.Settings.Configuration Instantiating Logger using appsettings.json var builder = new ConfigurationBuilder() .AddJsonFile(\"appsettings.json\"); var configuration = builder.Build(); var logger = new LoggerConfiguration() .ReadFrom.Configuration(configuration) .CreateLogger(); Copy Sample appsettings.json file { \"Serilog\": { \"Using\": [ \"Serilog.Sinks.Console\", \"Serilog.Sinks.File\", \"NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Serilog\" ], \"MinimumLevel\": \"Debug\", \"Enrich\": [ \"WithNewRelicLogsInContext\" ], \"WriteTo\": [ { \"Name\": \"File\", \"Args\": { \"path\": \"C:\\\\Logs\\\\SerilogExample.log.json\", \"formatter\": \"NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Serilog.NewRelicFormatter, NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Serilog\" } } ], \"Properties\": { \"Application\": \"NewRelic Logging Serilog Example\" } } } Copy .Config based configuration The example code below creates a logger based on settings contained in an web.config file.

Compatibility and requirements To use New Relic logs in context with NLog, ensure your configuration meets the following requirements: Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5+ or .NET Core 2.0+ New Relic .NET agent 8.21+ New Relic .NET agent API 8.21+ NLog 4.5+ Overview NLog works by having Layouts (which guide what data is added to log events and in what format) and Targets (which control where logging data is sent.) The New Relic NLog extension provides a NewRelicJsonLayout which formats a log event in the way required by the New Relic logging endpoint, and adds contextual information from the .NET agent when attached to your application. A target can then be configured to write logging data to an output folder, which can be monitored by a log forwarder to incrementally send log information to New Relic. This diagram illustrates the flow of log messages through NLog: This diagram illustrates the flow of log messages through NLog, highlighting specific components of the New Relic NLog extension. The above diagram highlights the main components of the NLog Logs-in-Context solution: New Relic JSON Layout: The NewRelicJsonLayout adds contextual information from the .NET agent (using the API) to the log events generated by the application, and outputs log messages in the JSON format expected by New Relic. This contextual information, known as linking metadata, is used by New Relic to link log messages to the transactions and spans from which they were created. File Target: A FileTarget defines a file on disk where log messages will be written. Adding the NewRelicJsonLayout to that target will cause the output to be formatted correctly for forwarding to New Relic. New Relic Log Forwarder: The log forwarder is configured to send the log data from the FileTarget's output to New Relic. The example below uses the New Relic Fluentd log forwarder, however there are many other log forwarders that can be used. For more information, see Introduction to log management. For more information about logging with NLog, see the NLog Getting started documentation. Configure logs in context with log management To configure logs in context with NLog: Enable log management with a compatible log forwarding plugin. Install or update the .NET agent. Configure the NLog extension. Check for logging data. Enable log management Confirm that you have log management enabled, with a compatible log forwarding plugin installed to send your application logs to New Relic. Install or update the .NET agent Install or update to the most recent .NET agent version, and enable Distributed tracing. Configure the NLog extension To configure logs in context with the NLog extension, complete the following steps: Using the Visual Studio NuGet Package Manager, locate and install the NewRelic.LogEnrichers.NLog package. In your application code, update your logging configuration to add the NewRelicJsonLayout. The following code example enriches log events with New Relic linking metadata. In addition to the existing log files, it outputs new log files in a specific JSON format at C:\\logs\\NLogExample.log.json for consumption by the Log Forwarder: var loggerConfig = new LoggingConfiguration(); var newRelicFileTarget = new FileTarget(\"NewRelicFileTarget\"); newRelicFileTarget.Layout = new NewRelicJsonLayout(); newRelicFileTarget.FileName = \"C:\\logs\\NLogExample.json\"; loggerConfig.AddTarget(newRelicFileTarget); loggerConfig.AddRuleForAllLevels(\"NewRelicFileTarget\"); LogManager.Configuration = loggerConfig; var logger = LogManager.GetLogger(\"Example\"); Copy Caution The above configuration results in new JSON files that are written to disk. Some of these configuration options may be useful in managing the amount of disk space used and/or the performance of the target. archiveAboveSize maxArchiveFiles bufferSize enableArchiveFileCompression autoFlush concurrentWrites Important Though not required, using the NLog AsyncWrapper Target may help improve the performance by performing formatting and output of log files on a different thread.

Compatibility and requirements To use New Relic logs in context with NLog, ensure your configuration meets the following requirements: Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5+ or .NET Core 2.0+ New Relic .NET agent 8.21+ New Relic .NET agent API 8.21+ NLog 4.5+ Overview NLog works by having Layouts (which guide what data is added to log events and in what format) and Targets (which control where logging data is sent.) The New Relic NLog extension provides a NewRelicJsonLayout which formats a log event in the way required by the New Relic logging endpoint, and adds contextual information from the .NET agent when attached to your application. A target can then be configured to write logging data to an output folder, which can be monitored by a log forwarder to incrementally send log information to New Relic. This diagram illustrates the flow of log messages through NLog: This diagram illustrates the flow of log messages through NLog, highlighting specific components of the New Relic NLog extension. The above diagram highlights the main components of the NLog Logs-in-Context solution: New Relic JSON Layout: The NewRelicJsonLayout adds contextual information from the .NET agent (using the API) to the log events generated by the application, and outputs log messages in the JSON format expected by New Relic. This contextual information, known as linking metadata, is used by New Relic to link log messages to the transactions and spans from which they were created. File Target: A FileTarget defines a file on disk where log messages will be written. Adding the NewRelicJsonLayout to that target will cause the output to be formatted correctly for forwarding to New Relic. New Relic Log Forwarder: The log forwarder is configured to send the log data from the FileTarget's output to New Relic. The example below uses the New Relic Fluentd log forwarder, however there are many other log forwarders that can be used. For more information, see Introduction to log management. For more information about logging with NLog, see the NLog Getting started documentation. Configure logs in context with log management To configure logs in context with NLog: Enable log management with a compatible log forwarding plugin. Install or update the .NET agent. Configure the NLog extension. Check for logging data. Enable log management Confirm that you have log management enabled, with a compatible log forwarding plugin installed to send your application logs to New Relic. Install or update the .NET agent Install or update to the most recent .NET agent version, and enable Distributed tracing. Configure the NLog extension To configure logs in context with the NLog extension, complete the following steps: Using the Visual Studio NuGet Package Manager, locate and install the NewRelic.LogEnrichers.NLog package. In your application code, update your logging configuration to add the NewRelicJsonLayout. The following code example enriches log events with New Relic linking metadata. In addition to the existing log files, it outputs new log files in a specific JSON format at C:\\logs\\NLogExample.log.json for consumption by the Log Forwarder: var loggerConfig = new LoggingConfiguration(); var newRelicFileTarget = new FileTarget(\"NewRelicFileTarget\"); newRelicFileTarget.Layout = new NewRelicJsonLayout(); newRelicFileTarget.FileName = \"C:\\logs\\NLogExample.json\"; loggerConfig.AddTarget(newRelicFileTarget); loggerConfig.AddRuleForAllLevels(\"NewRelicFileTarget\"); LogManager.Configuration = loggerConfig; var logger = LogManager.GetLogger(\"Example\"); Copy Caution The above configuration results in new JSON files that are written to disk. Some of these configuration options may be useful in managing the amount of disk space used and/or the performance of the target. archiveAboveSize maxArchiveFiles bufferSize enableArchiveFileCompression autoFlush concurrentWrites Important Though not required, using the NLog AsyncWrapper Target may help improve the performance by performing formatting and output of log files on a different thread. Once you have configured the NLog extension and updated your logging file, you can configure your extension to send data to New Relic. See below for an example of this configuration using the Fluentd plugin for New Relic's log management: <!--NewRelicLoggingExample.conf--> <source> @type tail path C:\\logs\\NLogExample.log.json pos_file C:\\logs\\NLogExample.log.json.pos tag logfile.* <parse> @type json </parse> </source> <match **> @type newrelic license_key <YOUR NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY> base_uri https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 </match> Copy File-based configuration Configuration of the New Relic NLog extension may also be accomplished with file based configuration providers. .Config based configuration The example code below creates a logger based on settings contained in an App.config file.

      "body": "Use our NLog extension to link to your log data with related data across the rest of the New Relic platform. Read on to learn how to configure logs in context and enrich your log data. Compatibility and requirements To use New Relic logs in context with NLog, ensure your configuration meets the following requirements: Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5+ or .NET Core 2.0+ New Relic .NET agent 8.21+ New Relic .NET agent API 8.21+ NLog 4.5+ Overview NLog works by having Layouts (which guide what data is added to log events and in what format) and Targets (which control where logging data is sent.) The New Relic NLog extension provides a NewRelicJsonLayout which formats a log event in the way required by the New Relic logging endpoint, and adds contextual information from the .NET agent when attached to your application. A target can then be configured to write logging data to an output folder, which can be monitored by a log forwarder to incrementally send log information to New Relic. This diagram illustrates the flow of log messages through NLog: This diagram illustrates the flow of log messages through NLog, highlighting specific components of the New Relic NLog extension. The above diagram highlights the main components of the NLog Logs-in-Context solution: New Relic JSON Layout: The NewRelicJsonLayout adds contextual information from the .NET agent (using the API) to the log events generated by the application, and outputs log messages in the JSON format expected by New Relic. This contextual information, known as linking metadata, is used by New Relic to link log messages to the transactions and spans from which they were created. File Target: A FileTarget defines a file on disk where log messages will be written. Adding the NewRelicJsonLayout to that target will cause the output to be formatted correctly for forwarding to New Relic. New Relic Log Forwarder: The log forwarder is configured to send the log data from the FileTarget's output to New Relic. The example below uses the New Relic Fluentd log forwarder, however there are many other log forwarders that can be used. For more information, see Introduction to log management. For more information about logging with NLog, see the NLog Getting started documentation. Configure logs in context with log management To configure logs in context with NLog: Enable log management with a compatible log forwarding plugin. Install or update the .NET agent. Configure the NLog extension. Check for logging data. Enable log management Confirm that you have log management enabled, with a compatible log forwarding plugin installed to send your application logs to New Relic. Install or update the .NET agent Install or update to the most recent .NET agent version, and enable Distributed tracing. Configure the NLog extension To configure logs in context with the NLog extension, complete the following steps: Using the Visual Studio NuGet Package Manager, locate and install the NewRelic.LogEnrichers.NLog package. In your application code, update your logging configuration to add the NewRelicJsonLayout. The following code example enriches log events with New Relic linking metadata. In addition to the existing log files, it outputs new log files in a specific JSON format at C:\\logs\\NLogExample.log.json for consumption by the Log Forwarder: var loggerConfig = new LoggingConfiguration(); var newRelicFileTarget = new FileTarget(\"NewRelicFileTarget\"); newRelicFileTarget.Layout = new NewRelicJsonLayout(); newRelicFileTarget.FileName = \"C:\\logs\\NLogExample.json\"; loggerConfig.AddTarget(newRelicFileTarget); loggerConfig.AddRuleForAllLevels(\"NewRelicFileTarget\"); LogManager.Configuration = loggerConfig; var logger = LogManager.GetLogger(\"Example\"); Copy Caution The above configuration results in new JSON files that are written to disk. Some of these configuration options may be useful in managing the amount of disk space used and/or the performance of the target. archiveAboveSize maxArchiveFiles bufferSize enableArchiveFileCompression autoFlush concurrentWrites Important Though not required, using the NLog AsyncWrapper Target may help improve the performance by performing formatting and output of log files on a different thread. Once you have configured the NLog extension and updated your logging file, you can configure your extension to send data to New Relic. See below for an example of this configuration using the Fluentd plugin for New Relic's log management: <!--NewRelicLoggingExample.conf--> <source> @type tail path C:\\logs\\NLogExample.log.json pos_file C:\\logs\\NLogExample.log.json.pos tag logfile.* <parse> @type json </parse> </source> <match **> @type newrelic license_key <YOUR NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY> base_uri https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 </match> Copy File-based configuration Configuration of the New Relic NLog extension may also be accomplished with file based configuration providers. .Config based configuration The example code below creates a logger based on settings contained in an App.config file.

      "body": "You can forward your logs to New Relic using our infrastructure monitoring agent. This makes all of your logging data available in one location and provides deeper visibility into both your application and your platform performance data. Tip To use log management and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Enable log forwarding using the infrastructure agent To enable log forwarding through the infrastructure agent: Start by verifying the system requirements needed for configuring Logs. Ensure you have installed the infrastructure agent, version 1.11.4 or higher. Create a logging.yml file in the infrastructure agent's logging.d directory. Configure your log sources and other parameters. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your account for data. Explore your log data in the Logs UI and benefit from the log attributes automatically inserted by the infrastructure agent. System Requirements To use the log forwarder of the infrastructure agent, make sure you meet the following requirements: Infrastructure agent version 1.11.4 or higher OpenSSL library 1.1.0 or higher is required by infra-agent starting from v1.16.4. The log forwarding feature is compatible with the following operating systems: Operating system Supported version Amazon Linux Amazon Linux 2 CentOS Version 7 or higher Debian Version 9 (\"Stretch\") or higher Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) Version 7 or higher SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) Version 12 Ubuntu Versions 16.04.x, 18.04.x and 20.04.x (LTS versions) Windows Windows Server 2012, 2016, and 2019, and their service packs. Windows 10 Caution The log forwarding feature is not supported on containerized infrastructure agents. Install the infrastructure agent Starting with version 1.11.4, the infrastructure agent can forward logs to New Relic. To install and run the agent, use a package manager (Linux) or the MSI installer (Windows). To use the following links, make sure you are logged to your New Relic account. Amazon Linux CentOS Debian RHEL SLES Ubuntu Windows If you don't have a New Relic account yet, or prefer to follow the procedure manually, see our tutorial to install the package manager. Configure the infrastructure agent Configuration files describe which log sources are forwarded. The Infrastructure agent uses .yml files for configuring logging. You can add as many config files as you want. To add a new configuration file for the log forwarding feature: Navigate to the logging forwarder configuration folder: Linux: /etc/newrelic-infra/logging.d/ Windows: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\logging.d\\ Create a logging.yml configuration file and add the parameters you need. The logging.d directory has various .yml.example files that can be used as a reference or starting point. The agent automatically processes new configuration files without having to restart the Infrastructure service. The only exception to this is when configuring a custom Fluent Bit configuration. Log forwarding parameters The infrastructure log forwarding .yml config supports the following parameters: Name (required) To start, make sure to define a name for the logs you want to forward: name Name of the log or logs being forwarding to New Relic. Log source (required) What you use for the log source will depend on where you want to forward your logs from. The available options are listed below: file Path to the log file or files. The agent tracks changes on the log files in a way similar to tail -f shell. Example: logs: - name: example-log file: /var/log/example.log # Path to a single log file - name: example-log-two file: /var/log/example-two.log # Path to another single log file Copy The file parameter can point to a specific log file or multiple files by using wildcards applied to names and extensions; for example, /logs/*.log. You can use wildcards in place of directories in a file path, which can be used to tail files located in different directories. Example: logs: - name: docker-logs file: /var/lib/docker/containers/*/*.log # Path to multiple folders and files Copy Important Use of wildcards may significantly increase the number of file descriptors the Fluent Bit process keeps open, which can interfere with log collection if the host's file descriptor limit is reached. We recommend increasing the file descriptor limit on Linux hosts running Fluent Bit by adding the following to the host's /etc/security/limits.conf file: root soft nofile 65536 root hard nofile 65536 *soft nofile 65536 *hard nofile 65536 Copy If you add these changes, reboot the host to ensure your changes are applied. systemd Use the systemd paramater to forward log messages that are collected by the journald daemon in Linux environments. This input type requires the agent to run in root mode. Example: logs: - name: systemd-example systemd: cupsd Copy syslog Syslog data source. Parameters: uri: Syslog socket. Format varies depending on the protocol: TCP/UDP network sockets: [tcp/udp]://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT Unix domain sockets: unix_[tcp/udp]:// + /socket/path parser: Syslog parser. Default is rfc3164. Use rfc5424 if your messages include fractional seconds. Note: rfc3164 currently does not work on SuSE. unix_permissions: default is 0644 for domain sockets; this limits entries to processes running as root. You can use 0666 to listen for non-root processes, at your own risk. When running the agent in privileged mode, ports and sockets must be available or owned by nri-agent, with 0666 file permissions, so that other processes can write logs to the sockets. logs: # TCP network socket - name: syslog-tcp-test syslog: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:5140 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format parser: rfc5424 # Default syslog parser is rfc3164 # UDP network socket - name: syslog-udp-test syslog: uri: udp://0.0.0.0:6140 # Use the udp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format max_line_kb: 35 # Unix TCP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-tcp-test syslog: uri: unix_tcp:///var/unix-tcp-socket-test unix_permissions: 0666 # Default is 0644. Change at your own risk # Unix UDP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-udp-test syslog: uri: unix_udp:///var/unix-udp-socket-test parser: rfc5424 Copy tcp Logs retrieved over TCP connections. Parameters: uri: TCP/IP socket to listen for incoming data. The URI format is tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format: format of the data. It can be json or none. separator: If format: none is used, you can define a separator string for splitting records (default: \\n). logs: - name: tcp-simple-test tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:1234 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format format: none # Raw text - this is default for 'tcp' separator: \\t # String for separating raw text entries max_line_kb: 32 - name: tcp-json-test tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:2345 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format format: json Copy winlog Collect events from Windows log channels. Parameters: channel: name of the channel logs will be collected from. collect-eventids: a list of Windows Event IDs to be collected and forwarded to New Relic. Event ID ranges are supported. exclude-eventids: a list of Windows Event IDs to be excluded from collection. Event ID ranges are supported. All events are collected from the specified channel by default. Configure the collect-eventids and exclude-eventids sections to avoid sending unwanted logs to your New Relic account. Add event IDs or ranges to collect-eventids or exclude-eventids to forward or drop specific events. exclude-eventids takes precedence over collect-eventids if the same event ID is present in both sections. Example: logs: # Winlog log ingestion with eventId filters. - name: windows-security winlog: channel: Security collect-eventids: - 4624 - 4265 - 4700-4800 exclude-eventids: - 4735 # entries for the application, system, powershell, and SCOM channels - name: windows-application winlog: channel: Application - name: windows-system winlog: channel: System - name: windows-pshell winlog: channel: Windows Powershell - name: scom winlog: channel: Operations Manager # Entry for Windows Defender Logs - name: windows-defender winlog: channel: Microsoft-Windows-Windows Defender/Operational # Entry for Windows Clustering Logs - name: windows-clustering winlog: channel: Microsoft-Windows-FailoverClustering/Operational # Entry for IIS logs with logtype attribute for automatic parsing - name: iis-log file: C:\\inetpub\\logs\\LogFiles\\w3svc.log attributes: logtype: iis_w3c Copy Optional Configuration The following are configuration paramaters that are not required but are still recommended. attributes List of custom attributes as key-value pairs that can be used to send additional data with the logs which you can then query. Add attributes to any log source. Example: logs: - name: example-file-attributes file: /var/log/example.log attributes: logtype: nginx region: example-us-02 team: A-team - name: example-tcp-attributes tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:2345 format: json attributes: logtype: nginx region: example-us-02 team: B-team Copy Log attributes automatically inserted by the infrastructure agent(#automatically-inserted-attributes) The infrastructure agent automatically inserts log attributes for your convenience. Some of them are inserted for any log record, while others depend on the configuration parameters you used while setting up the log forwarder. Find a summary of these attributes in the following table: Attribute name Inserting conditions Description entity.guids Always inserted The infrastructure agent inserts the Entity GUID assigned by New Relic to identify the host where it's running. It is available in the entity.guids field. Note: If the captured logs belong to an application instrumented using APM, the entity.guids field contains both the entity GUID of infrastructure, as well as the GUID of APM, separated by a pipe ( | ) delimiter. fb.input Always inserted The underlying Fluent Bit input plugin type used to capture the logs. Currently, its values are tail, systemd, winlog, syslog, and tcp. filePath When using the file input type Absolute file path of the file being monitored. hostname Always inserted The hostname of the machine/VM/container executing the infrastructure agent. plugin.type Always inserted Indicates the utility used to capture the logs. In this case, it is the infrastructure agent itself, so this attribute always has the value nri-agent. pattern Regular expression for filtering records. Only supported for the tail, systemd, syslog, and tcp (only with format none) sources. This field works in a way similar to grep -E in Unix systems. For example, for a given file being captured, you can filter for records containing either WARN or ERROR using: - name: only-records-with-warn-and-error file: /var/log/logFile.log pattern: WARN|ERROR Copy No filtering is applied by default. max_line_kb Maximum size of log entries/lines in KB. If log entries exceed the limit, they are skipped. Default is 128. fluentbit External Fluent Bit configuration and parser files. If defined, they are merged with the existing configuration and parser files generated by the infrastructure agent. The infrastructure agent processes the configuration files located in the logging.d directory and will generate a run-time Fluent Bit configuration file that contains the appropriate [INPUT], [FILTER] and [OUTPUT] sections. Optionally, it will also declare an @INCLUDE in case you provided an external Fluent Bit configuration file via the fluentbit option. The runtime file does not define a [SERVICE] section, leaving all default Fluent Bit configuration values. You can still override Fluent Bit's default settings by defining your own [SERVICE] section in your external Fluent Bit configuration file and include it via the fluentbit option. Parameters: config_file: path to an existing Fluent Bit configuration file. Note that any overlapping source results in duplicate messages in New Relic Logs. parsers_file: path to an existing Fluent Bit parsers file. The following parser names are reserved: rfc3164, rfc3164-local and rfc5424. Sample configuration file Here is an example of a logging.d/ configuration file in YAML format. For more configuration examples, see the infrastructure agent repository. logging.d/sample.yaml # Remember to only use spaces for indentation logs: # Example of 'file' source - name: file-with-attributes file: /var/log/test.log # Path to a single file or pattern attributes: # You can use custom attributes to enrich your data logtype: nginx team: The A Team pattern: Error # Regular expression to filter log entries # Example of 'systemd' source (Linux only) - name: systemd-example systemd: cupsd # Examples of 'syslog' source, one per protocol # TCP network socket - name: syslog-tcp-test syslog: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:5140 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format parser: rfc5424 # Default syslog parser is rfc3164 # UDP network socket - name: syslog-udp-test syslog: uri: udp://0.0.0.0:6140 # Use the udp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format max_line_kb: 35 # Paths for Unix sockets are defined by combining protocol and path: # unix_udp:// + /path/socket - for example, unix_udp:///tmp/socket # Unix TCP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-tcp-test syslog: uri: unix_tcp:///var/unix-tcp-socket-test unix_permissions: 0666 # Default is 0644.

No data appears when tailing a file The log forwarding feature requires the agent to have permission to read the data sources. When running the infrastructure agent in privileged or non-privileged modes, make sure that the log files you want to forward (and any intermediary directory in its path) are readable by the user running nri-agent. Example: checking file access under Linux Let's check whether the file /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log can be monitored by the nri-agent user. In Linux, you can do a quick check with the namei command: sudo -u nri-agent namei -ml /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log f: /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log drwxr-xr-x root root / drwxr-xr-x root root var drwxrwxr-x root syslog log drwxr--r-- root root restrictedLogs logFile.log - No such file or directory Copy This command failed because the file is not visible to the nri-agent user. By inspecting the previous output, we can detect that the restrictedLogs directory is missing the execution flag for others\". We can fix this by executing: sudo chmod 755 /var/log/restrictedLogs Copy And then check for file access again: # sudo -u nri-agent namei -ml /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log f: /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log drwxr-xr-x root root / drwxr-xr-x root root var drwxrwxr-x root syslog log drwxr-xr-x root root restrictedLogs -rw-r----- vagrant vagrant logFile.log Copy The file is now visible to the nri-agent user. You must ensure that the file is also readable by the nri-agent user. To check this, use: # sudo -u nri-agent head /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log head: cannot open '/var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log' for reading: Permission denied Copy In this example, the file is missing the read rights for the others group (users other than vagrant and the vagrant user group). You could fix this by granting read permissions to others, but the application could change these permissions upon restart. To avoid this, a better approach is to add the nri-agent user to the vagrant user group. No data appears when capturing via a Syslog socket The log forwarding feature requires that the agent has permission to read the data sources. When running the infrastructure agent in privileged or non-privileged modes: If you're using Unix domain socket files, make sure that the nri-agent user can access these files (please refer to the previous section) and that they have read and write permissions (666) so that other users than nri-agent can write to them. If you're using IP sockets, ensure that the port that you are using is not a system reserved one (like port 80, for example). If no data appears after you enable log management, follow standard log management troubleshooting procedures. No data appears using infrastructure agent proxy As explained in the infrastructure agent configuration guidelines, the proxy parameter must use either HTTP or HTTPS and be in the form https://user:password@hostname:port. The agent can parse the parameter without the HTTP or HTTPS, but the log-forwarder cannot. You will see an error like the following in the agent verbose logs: [ERROR] building HTTP transport: parse \\\"hostname:port\\\": first path segment in URL cannot contain colon Copy To solve this problem, check your newrelic-infra.yml file, and ensure the proxy parameter adheres to this form. Send the agent's logs to New Relic You can configure the infrastructure agent to send its own logs to New Relic. This is useful for troubleshooting issues with log forwarding, the agent, or when contacting support. To forward the infrastructure agent logs to New Relic: Edit your newrelic-infra.yml file. Enable agent logging in troubleshooting mode by adding verbose: 3 Important On Windows and systems that don't use systemd or where journald is inaccessible, verbose:3 causes the agent to write the logs on the disk. Revert to verbose:0 to prevent this. (Recommended): Enable agent logging in JSON format to log_format: json. Restart the agent to load the new settings. This configuration sets up the agent in troubleshooting mode, but the log forwarder (based on Fluent Bit) will continue in a non-verbose mode. Sometimes you can have issues with the log forwarder itself. For example, there may be problems accessing a specific channel when shipping Windows log events or when accessing a particular log file. In these situations, you can also enable the verbose mode for the log forwarder: Set verbose to a value other than 0. Add the following configuration option: trace: [\"log.fw\"]. Caution Check whether you are using the fluentbit option. When setting verbose: 3 and trace: [\"log.fw\"], ensure that you don't define any [OUTPUT] section pointing to stdout in an external Fluent Bit configuration file, Fluent Bit does not start with the infra-agent For Linux versions previous to 2016 you may need to update the OpenSSL library to 1.1.0 (or higher). To check if you have this problem: See if infra-agenthas started Fluent Bit by doing ps -aux | grep fluent-bit Copy If it isn't running go to /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/logging and run ./fluent-bit -i systemd -o stdout Copy If you get the following error, update OpenSSL to 1.1.0 or higher: error while loading shared libraries: libssl.so.1.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory Runtime error on Windows One of the following error messages may appear when enabling log forwarding on Windows: The code execution cannot proceed because VCRUNTIME140.dll was not found. Copy OR error=\"exit status 3221225781\" process=log-forwarder Copy This is caused by a missing DLL. To solve the issue, install the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable: x64 or x86. What's next? Now that you've enabled Logs, here are some potential next steps: Explore your data using the Logs UI. Configure your agent to see contextual log data, such as distributed tracing, stack traces, application logs, and more. Query your data and create custom dashboards or alerts.",

      "body": "You can forward your logs to New Relic using our infrastructure monitoring agent. This makes all of your logging data available in one location and provides deeper visibility into both your application and your platform performance data. Tip To use log management and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Enable log forwarding using the infrastructure agent To enable log forwarding through the infrastructure agent: Start by verifying the system requirements needed for configuring Logs. Ensure you have installed the infrastructure agent, version 1.11.4 or higher. Create a logging.yml file in the infrastructure agent's logging.d directory. Configure your log sources and other parameters. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your account for data. Explore your log data in the Logs UI and benefit from the log attributes automatically inserted by the infrastructure agent. System Requirements To use the log forwarder of the infrastructure agent, make sure you meet the following requirements: Infrastructure agent version 1.11.4 or higher OpenSSL library 1.1.0 or higher is required by infra-agent starting from v1.16.4. The log forwarding feature is compatible with the following operating systems: Operating system Supported version Amazon Linux Amazon Linux 2 CentOS Version 7 or higher Debian Version 9 (\"Stretch\") or higher Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) Version 7 or higher SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) Version 12 Ubuntu Versions 16.04.x, 18.04.x and 20.04.x (LTS versions) Windows Windows Server 2012, 2016, and 2019, and their service packs. Windows 10 Caution The log forwarding feature is not supported on containerized infrastructure agents. Install the infrastructure agent Starting with version 1.11.4, the infrastructure agent can forward logs to New Relic. To install and run the agent, use a package manager (Linux) or the MSI installer (Windows). To use the following links, make sure you are logged to your New Relic account. Amazon Linux CentOS Debian RHEL SLES Ubuntu Windows If you don't have a New Relic account yet, or prefer to follow the procedure manually, see our tutorial to install the package manager. Configure the infrastructure agent Configuration files describe which log sources are forwarded. The Infrastructure agent uses .yml files for configuring logging. You can add as many config files as you want. To add a new configuration file for the log forwarding feature: Navigate to the logging forwarder configuration folder: Linux: /etc/newrelic-infra/logging.d/ Windows: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\logging.d\\ Create a logging.yml configuration file and add the parameters you need. The logging.d directory has various .yml.example files that can be used as a reference or starting point. The agent automatically processes new configuration files without having to restart the Infrastructure service. The only exception to this is when configuring a custom Fluent Bit configuration. Log forwarding parameters The infrastructure log forwarding .yml config supports the following parameters: Name (required) To start, make sure to define a name for the logs you want to forward: name Name of the log or logs being forwarding to New Relic. Log source (required) What you use for the log source will depend on where you want to forward your logs from. The available options are listed below: file Path to the log file or files. The agent tracks changes on the log files in a way similar to tail -f shell. Example: logs: - name: example-log file: /var/log/example.log # Path to a single log file - name: example-log-two file: /var/log/example-two.log # Path to another single log file Copy The file parameter can point to a specific log file or multiple files by using wildcards applied to names and extensions; for example, /logs/*.log. You can use wildcards in place of directories in a file path, which can be used to tail files located in different directories. Example: logs: - name: docker-logs file: /var/lib/docker/containers/*/*.log # Path to multiple folders and files Copy Important Use of wildcards may significantly increase the number of file descriptors the Fluent Bit process keeps open, which can interfere with log collection if the host's file descriptor limit is reached. We recommend increasing the file descriptor limit on Linux hosts running Fluent Bit by adding the following to the host's /etc/security/limits.conf file: root soft nofile 65536 root hard nofile 65536 *soft nofile 65536 *hard nofile 65536 Copy If you add these changes, reboot the host to ensure your changes are applied. systemd Use the systemd paramater to forward log messages that are collected by the journald daemon in Linux environments. This input type requires the agent to run in root mode. Example: logs: - name: systemd-example systemd: cupsd Copy syslog Syslog data source. Parameters: uri: Syslog socket. Format varies depending on the protocol: TCP/UDP network sockets: [tcp/udp]://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT Unix domain sockets: unix_[tcp/udp]:// + /socket/path parser: Syslog parser. Default is rfc3164. Use rfc5424 if your messages include fractional seconds. Note: rfc3164 currently does not work on SuSE. unix_permissions: default is 0644 for domain sockets; this limits entries to processes running as root. You can use 0666 to listen for non-root processes, at your own risk. When running the agent in privileged mode, ports and sockets must be available or owned by nri-agent, with 0666 file permissions, so that other processes can write logs to the sockets. logs: # TCP network socket - name: syslog-tcp-test syslog: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:5140 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format parser: rfc5424 # Default syslog parser is rfc3164 # UDP network socket - name: syslog-udp-test syslog: uri: udp://0.0.0.0:6140 # Use the udp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format max_line_kb: 35 # Unix TCP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-tcp-test syslog: uri: unix_tcp:///var/unix-tcp-socket-test unix_permissions: 0666 # Default is 0644. Change at your own risk # Unix UDP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-udp-test syslog: uri: unix_udp:///var/unix-udp-socket-test parser: rfc5424 Copy tcp Logs retrieved over TCP connections. Parameters: uri: TCP/IP socket to listen for incoming data. The URI format is tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format: format of the data. It can be json or none. separator: If format: none is used, you can define a separator string for splitting records (default: \\n). logs: - name: tcp-simple-test tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:1234 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format format: none # Raw text - this is default for 'tcp' separator: \\t # String for separating raw text entries max_line_kb: 32 - name: tcp-json-test tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:2345 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format format: json Copy winlog Collect events from Windows log channels. Parameters: channel: name of the channel logs will be collected from. collect-eventids: a list of Windows Event IDs to be collected and forwarded to New Relic. Event ID ranges are supported. exclude-eventids: a list of Windows Event IDs to be excluded from collection. Event ID ranges are supported. All events are collected from the specified channel by default. Configure the collect-eventids and exclude-eventids sections to avoid sending unwanted logs to your New Relic account. Add event IDs or ranges to collect-eventids or exclude-eventids to forward or drop specific events. exclude-eventids takes precedence over collect-eventids if the same event ID is present in both sections. Example: logs: # Winlog log ingestion with eventId filters. - name: windows-security winlog: channel: Security collect-eventids: - 4624 - 4265 - 4700-4800 exclude-eventids: - 4735 # entries for the application, system, powershell, and SCOM channels - name: windows-application winlog: channel: Application - name: windows-system winlog: channel: System - name: windows-pshell winlog: channel: Windows Powershell - name: scom winlog: channel: Operations Manager # Entry for Windows Defender Logs - name: windows-defender winlog: channel: Microsoft-Windows-Windows Defender/Operational # Entry for Windows Clustering Logs - name: windows-clustering winlog: channel: Microsoft-Windows-FailoverClustering/Operational # Entry for IIS logs with logtype attribute for automatic parsing - name: iis-log file: C:\\inetpub\\logs\\LogFiles\\w3svc.log attributes: logtype: iis_w3c Copy Optional Configuration The following are configuration paramaters that are not required but are still recommended. attributes List of custom attributes as key-value pairs that can be used to send additional data with the logs which you can then query. Add attributes to any log source. Example: logs: - name: example-file-attributes file: /var/log/example.log attributes: logtype: nginx region: example-us-02 team: A-team - name: example-tcp-attributes tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:2345 format: json attributes: logtype: nginx region: example-us-02 team: B-team Copy Log attributes automatically inserted by the infrastructure agent(#automatically-inserted-attributes) The infrastructure agent automatically inserts log attributes for your convenience. Some of them are inserted for any log record, while others depend on the configuration parameters you used while setting up the log forwarder. Find a summary of these attributes in the following table: Attribute name Inserting conditions Description entity.guids Always inserted The infrastructure agent inserts the Entity GUID assigned by New Relic to identify the host where it's running. It is available in the entity.guids field. Note: If the captured logs belong to an application instrumented using APM, the entity.guids field contains both the entity GUID of infrastructure, as well as the GUID of APM, separated by a pipe ( | ) delimiter. fb.input Always inserted The underlying Fluent Bit input plugin type used to capture the logs. Currently, its values are tail, systemd, winlog, syslog, and tcp. filePath When using the file input type Absolute file path of the file being monitored. hostname Always inserted The hostname of the machine/VM/container executing the infrastructure agent. plugin.type Always inserted Indicates the utility used to capture the logs. In this case, it is the infrastructure agent itself, so this attribute always has the value nri-agent. pattern Regular expression for filtering records. Only supported for the tail, systemd, syslog, and tcp (only with format none) sources. This field works in a way similar to grep -E in Unix systems. For example, for a given file being captured, you can filter for records containing either WARN or ERROR using: - name: only-records-with-warn-and-error file: /var/log/logFile.log pattern: WARN|ERROR Copy No filtering is applied by default. max_line_kb Maximum size of log entries/lines in KB. If log entries exceed the limit, they are skipped. Default is 128. fluentbit External Fluent Bit configuration and parser files. If defined, they are merged with the existing configuration and parser files generated by the infrastructure agent. The infrastructure agent processes the configuration files located in the logging.d directory and will generate a run-time Fluent Bit configuration file that contains the appropriate [INPUT], [FILTER] and [OUTPUT] sections. Optionally, it will also declare an @INCLUDE in case you provided an external Fluent Bit configuration file via the fluentbit option. The runtime file does not define a [SERVICE] section, leaving all default Fluent Bit configuration values. You can still override Fluent Bit's default settings by defining your own [SERVICE] section in your external Fluent Bit configuration file and include it via the fluentbit option. Parameters: config_file: path to an existing Fluent Bit configuration file. Note that any overlapping source results in duplicate messages in New Relic Logs. parsers_file: path to an existing Fluent Bit parsers file. The following parser names are reserved: rfc3164, rfc3164-local and rfc5424. Sample configuration file Here is an example of a logging.d/ configuration file in YAML format. For more configuration examples, see the infrastructure agent repository. logging.d/sample.yaml # Remember to only use spaces for indentation logs: # Example of 'file' source - name: file-with-attributes file: /var/log/test.log # Path to a single file or pattern attributes: # You can use custom attributes to enrich your data logtype: nginx team: The A Team pattern: Error # Regular expression to filter log entries # Example of 'systemd' source (Linux only) - name: systemd-example systemd: cupsd # Examples of 'syslog' source, one per protocol # TCP network socket - name: syslog-tcp-test syslog: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:5140 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format parser: rfc5424 # Default syslog parser is rfc3164 # UDP network socket - name: syslog-udp-test syslog: uri: udp://0.0.0.0:6140 # Use the udp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format max_line_kb: 35 # Paths for Unix sockets are defined by combining protocol and path: # unix_udp:// + /path/socket - for example, unix_udp:///tmp/socket # Unix TCP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-tcp-test syslog: uri: unix_tcp:///var/unix-tcp-socket-test unix_permissions: 0666 # Default is 0644.

No data appears when tailing a file The log forwarding feature requires the agent to have permission to read the data sources. When running the infrastructure agent in privileged or non-privileged modes, make sure that the log files you want to forward (and any intermediary directory in its path) are readable by the user running nri-agent. Example: checking file access under Linux Let's check whether the file /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log can be monitored by the nri-agent user. In Linux, you can do a quick check with the namei command: sudo -u nri-agent namei -ml /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log f: /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log drwxr-xr-x root root / drwxr-xr-x root root var drwxrwxr-x root syslog log drwxr--r-- root root restrictedLogs logFile.log - No such file or directory Copy This command failed because the file is not visible to the nri-agent user. By inspecting the previous output, we can detect that the restrictedLogs directory is missing the execution flag for others\". We can fix this by executing: sudo chmod 755 /var/log/restrictedLogs Copy And then check for file access again: # sudo -u nri-agent namei -ml /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log f: /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log drwxr-xr-x root root / drwxr-xr-x root root var drwxrwxr-x root syslog log drwxr-xr-x root root restrictedLogs -rw-r----- vagrant vagrant logFile.log Copy The file is now visible to the nri-agent user. You must ensure that the file is also readable by the nri-agent user. To check this, use: # sudo -u nri-agent head /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log head: cannot open '/var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log' for reading: Permission denied Copy In this example, the file is missing the read rights for the others group (users other than vagrant and the vagrant user group). You could fix this by granting read permissions to others, but the application could change these permissions upon restart. To avoid this, a better approach is to add the nri-agent user to the vagrant user group. No data appears when capturing via a Syslog socket The log forwarding feature requires that the agent has permission to read the data sources. When running the infrastructure agent in privileged or non-privileged modes: If you're using Unix domain socket files, make sure that the nri-agent user can access these files (please refer to the previous section) and that they have read and write permissions (666) so that other users than nri-agent can write to them. If you're using IP sockets, ensure that the port that you are using is not a system reserved one (like port 80, for example). If no data appears after you enable log management, follow standard log management troubleshooting procedures. No data appears using infrastructure agent proxy As explained in the infrastructure agent configuration guidelines, the proxy parameter must use either HTTP or HTTPS and be in the form https://user:password@hostname:port. The agent can parse the parameter without the HTTP or HTTPS, but the log-forwarder cannot. You will see an error like the following in the agent verbose logs: [ERROR] building HTTP transport: parse \\\"hostname:port\\\": first path segment in URL cannot contain colon Copy To solve this problem, check your newrelic-infra.yml file, and ensure the proxy parameter adheres to this form. Send the agent's logs to New Relic You can configure the infrastructure agent to send its own logs to New Relic. This is useful for troubleshooting issues with log forwarding, the agent, or when contacting support. To forward the infrastructure agent logs to New Relic: Edit your newrelic-infra.yml file. Enable agent logging in troubleshooting mode by adding verbose: 3 Important On Windows and systems that don't use systemd or where journald is inaccessible, verbose:3 causes the agent to write the logs on the disk. Revert to verbose:0 to prevent this. (Recommended): Enable agent logging in JSON format to log_format: json. Restart the agent to load the new settings. This configuration sets up the agent in troubleshooting mode, but the log forwarder (based on Fluent Bit) will continue in a non-verbose mode. Sometimes you can have issues with the log forwarder itself. For example, there may be problems accessing a specific channel when shipping Windows log events or when accessing a particular log file. In these situations, you can also enable the verbose mode for the log forwarder: Set verbose to a value other than 0. Add the following configuration option: trace: [\"log.fw\"]. Caution Check whether you are using the fluentbit option. When setting verbose: 3 and trace: [\"log.fw\"], ensure that you don't define any [OUTPUT] section pointing to stdout in an external Fluent Bit configuration file, Fluent Bit does not start with the infra-agent For Linux versions previous to 2016 you may need to update the OpenSSL library to 1.1.0 (or higher). To check if you have this problem: See if infra-agenthas started Fluent Bit by doing ps -aux | grep fluent-bit Copy If it isn't running go to /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/logging and run ./fluent-bit -i systemd -o stdout Copy If you get the following error, update OpenSSL to 1.1.0 or higher: error while loading shared libraries: libssl.so.1.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory Runtime error on Windows One of the following error messages may appear when enabling log forwarding on Windows: The code execution cannot proceed because VCRUNTIME140.dll was not found. Copy OR error=\"exit status 3221225781\" process=log-forwarder Copy This is caused by a missing DLL. To solve the issue, install the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable: x64 or x86. What's next? Now that you've enabled Logs, here are some potential next steps: Explore your data using the Logs UI. Configure your agent to see contextual log data, such as distributed tracing, stack traces, application logs, and more. Query your data and create custom dashboards or alerts.",

      "body": "You can forward your logs to New Relic using our infrastructure monitoring agent. This makes all of your logging data available in one location and provides deeper visibility into both your application and your platform performance data. Tip To use log management and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Enable log forwarding using the infrastructure agent To enable log forwarding through the infrastructure agent: Start by verifying the system requirements needed for configuring Logs. Ensure you have installed the infrastructure agent, version 1.11.4 or higher. Create a logging.yml file in the infrastructure agent's logging.d directory. Configure your log sources and other parameters. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your account for data. Explore your log data in the Logs UI and benefit from the log attributes automatically inserted by the infrastructure agent. System Requirements To use the log forwarder of the infrastructure agent, make sure you meet the following requirements: Infrastructure agent version 1.11.4 or higher OpenSSL library 1.1.0 or higher is required by infra-agent starting from v1.16.4. The log forwarding feature is compatible with the following operating systems: Operating system Supported version Amazon Linux Amazon Linux 2 CentOS Version 7 or higher Debian Version 9 (\"Stretch\") or higher Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) Version 7 or higher SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) Version 12 Ubuntu Versions 16.04.x, 18.04.x and 20.04.x (LTS versions) Windows Windows Server 2012, 2016, and 2019, and their service packs. Windows 10 Caution The log forwarding feature is not supported on containerized infrastructure agents. Install the infrastructure agent Starting with version 1.11.4, the infrastructure agent can forward logs to New Relic. To install and run the agent, use a package manager (Linux) or the MSI installer (Windows). To use the following links, make sure you are logged to your New Relic account. Amazon Linux CentOS Debian RHEL SLES Ubuntu Windows If you don't have a New Relic account yet, or prefer to follow the procedure manually, see our tutorial to install the package manager. Configure the infrastructure agent Configuration files describe which log sources are forwarded. The Infrastructure agent uses .yml files for configuring logging. You can add as many config files as you want. To add a new configuration file for the log forwarding feature: Navigate to the logging forwarder configuration folder: Linux: /etc/newrelic-infra/logging.d/ Windows: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\logging.d\\ Create a logging.yml configuration file and add the parameters you need. The logging.d directory has various .yml.example files that can be used as a reference or starting point. The agent automatically processes new configuration files without having to restart the Infrastructure service. The only exception to this is when configuring a custom Fluent Bit configuration. Log forwarding parameters The infrastructure log forwarding .yml config supports the following parameters: Name (required) To start, make sure to define a name for the logs you want to forward: name Name of the log or logs being forwarding to New Relic. Log source (required) What you use for the log source will depend on where you want to forward your logs from. The available options are listed below: file Path to the log file or files. The agent tracks changes on the log files in a way similar to tail -f shell. Example: logs: - name: example-log file: /var/log/example.log # Path to a single log file - name: example-log-two file: /var/log/example-two.log # Path to another single log file Copy The file parameter can point to a specific log file or multiple files by using wildcards applied to names and extensions; for example, /logs/*.log. You can use wildcards in place of directories in a file path, which can be used to tail files located in different directories. Example: logs: - name: docker-logs file: /var/lib/docker/containers/*/*.log # Path to multiple folders and files Copy Important Use of wildcards may significantly increase the number of file descriptors the Fluent Bit process keeps open, which can interfere with log collection if the host's file descriptor limit is reached. We recommend increasing the file descriptor limit on Linux hosts running Fluent Bit by adding the following to the host's /etc/security/limits.conf file: root soft nofile 65536 root hard nofile 65536 *soft nofile 65536 *hard nofile 65536 Copy If you add these changes, reboot the host to ensure your changes are applied. systemd Use the systemd paramater to forward log messages that are collected by the journald daemon in Linux environments. This input type requires the agent to run in root mode. Example: logs: - name: systemd-example systemd: cupsd Copy syslog Syslog data source. Parameters: uri: Syslog socket. Format varies depending on the protocol: TCP/UDP network sockets: [tcp/udp]://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT Unix domain sockets: unix_[tcp/udp]:// + /socket/path parser: Syslog parser. Default is rfc3164. Use rfc5424 if your messages include fractional seconds. Note: rfc3164 currently does not work on SuSE. unix_permissions: default is 0644 for domain sockets; this limits entries to processes running as root. You can use 0666 to listen for non-root processes, at your own risk. When running the agent in privileged mode, ports and sockets must be available or owned by nri-agent, with 0666 file permissions, so that other processes can write logs to the sockets. logs: # TCP network socket - name: syslog-tcp-test syslog: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:5140 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format parser: rfc5424 # Default syslog parser is rfc3164 # UDP network socket - name: syslog-udp-test syslog: uri: udp://0.0.0.0:6140 # Use the udp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format max_line_kb: 35 # Unix TCP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-tcp-test syslog: uri: unix_tcp:///var/unix-tcp-socket-test unix_permissions: 0666 # Default is 0644. Change at your own risk # Unix UDP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-udp-test syslog: uri: unix_udp:///var/unix-udp-socket-test parser: rfc5424 Copy tcp Logs retrieved over TCP connections. Parameters: uri: TCP/IP socket to listen for incoming data. The URI format is tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format: format of the data. It can be json or none. separator: If format: none is used, you can define a separator string for splitting records (default: \\n). logs: - name: tcp-simple-test tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:1234 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format format: none # Raw text - this is default for 'tcp' separator: \\t # String for separating raw text entries max_line_kb: 32 - name: tcp-json-test tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:2345 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format format: json Copy winlog Collect events from Windows log channels. Parameters: channel: name of the channel logs will be collected from. collect-eventids: a list of Windows Event IDs to be collected and forwarded to New Relic. Event ID ranges are supported. exclude-eventids: a list of Windows Event IDs to be excluded from collection. Event ID ranges are supported. All events are collected from the specified channel by default. Configure the collect-eventids and exclude-eventids sections to avoid sending unwanted logs to your New Relic account. Add event IDs or ranges to collect-eventids or exclude-eventids to forward or drop specific events. exclude-eventids takes precedence over collect-eventids if the same event ID is present in both sections. Example: logs: # Winlog log ingestion with eventId filters. - name: windows-security winlog: channel: Security collect-eventids: - 4624 - 4265 - 4700-4800 exclude-eventids: - 4735 # entries for the application, system, powershell, and SCOM channels - name: windows-application winlog: channel: Application - name: windows-system winlog: channel: System - name: windows-pshell winlog: channel: Windows Powershell - name: scom winlog: channel: Operations Manager # Entry for Windows Defender Logs - name: windows-defender winlog: channel: Microsoft-Windows-Windows Defender/Operational # Entry for Windows Clustering Logs - name: windows-clustering winlog: channel: Microsoft-Windows-FailoverClustering/Operational # Entry for IIS logs with logtype attribute for automatic parsing - name: iis-log file: C:\\inetpub\\logs\\LogFiles\\w3svc.log attributes: logtype: iis_w3c Copy Optional Configuration The following are configuration paramaters that are not required but are still recommended. attributes List of custom attributes as key-value pairs that can be used to send additional data with the logs which you can then query. Add attributes to any log source. Example: logs: - name: example-file-attributes file: /var/log/example.log attributes: logtype: nginx region: example-us-02 team: A-team - name: example-tcp-attributes tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:2345 format: json attributes: logtype: nginx region: example-us-02 team: B-team Copy Log attributes automatically inserted by the infrastructure agent(#automatically-inserted-attributes) The infrastructure agent automatically inserts log attributes for your convenience. Some of them are inserted for any log record, while others depend on the configuration parameters you used while setting up the log forwarder. Find a summary of these attributes in the following table: Attribute name Inserting conditions Description entity.guids Always inserted The infrastructure agent inserts the Entity GUID assigned by New Relic to identify the host where it's running. It is available in the entity.guids field. Note: If the captured logs belong to an application instrumented using APM, the entity.guids field contains both the entity GUID of infrastructure, as well as the GUID of APM, separated by a pipe ( | ) delimiter. fb.input Always inserted The underlying Fluent Bit input plugin type used to capture the logs. Currently, its values are tail, systemd, winlog, syslog, and tcp. filePath When using the file input type Absolute file path of the file being monitored. hostname Always inserted The hostname of the machine/VM/container executing the infrastructure agent. plugin.type Always inserted Indicates the utility used to capture the logs. In this case, it is the infrastructure agent itself, so this attribute always has the value nri-agent. pattern Regular expression for filtering records. Only supported for the tail, systemd, syslog, and tcp (only with format none) sources. This field works in a way similar to grep -E in Unix systems. For example, for a given file being captured, you can filter for records containing either WARN or ERROR using: - name: only-records-with-warn-and-error file: /var/log/logFile.log pattern: WARN|ERROR Copy No filtering is applied by default. max_line_kb Maximum size of log entries/lines in KB. If log entries exceed the limit, they are skipped. Default is 128. fluentbit External Fluent Bit configuration and parser files. If defined, they are merged with the existing configuration and parser files generated by the infrastructure agent. The infrastructure agent processes the configuration files located in the logging.d directory and will generate a run-time Fluent Bit configuration file that contains the appropriate [INPUT], [FILTER] and [OUTPUT] sections. Optionally, it will also declare an @INCLUDE in case you provided an external Fluent Bit configuration file via the fluentbit option. The runtime file does not define a [SERVICE] section, leaving all default Fluent Bit configuration values. You can still override Fluent Bit's default settings by defining your own [SERVICE] section in your external Fluent Bit configuration file and include it via the fluentbit option. Parameters: config_file: path to an existing Fluent Bit configuration file. Note that any overlapping source results in duplicate messages in New Relic Logs. parsers_file: path to an existing Fluent Bit parsers file. The following parser names are reserved: rfc3164, rfc3164-local and rfc5424. Sample configuration file Here is an example of a logging.d/ configuration file in YAML format. For more configuration examples, see the infrastructure agent repository. logging.d/sample.yaml # Remember to only use spaces for indentation logs: # Example of 'file' source - name: file-with-attributes file: /var/log/test.log # Path to a single file or pattern attributes: # You can use custom attributes to enrich your data logtype: nginx team: The A Team pattern: Error # Regular expression to filter log entries # Example of 'systemd' source (Linux only) - name: systemd-example systemd: cupsd # Examples of 'syslog' source, one per protocol # TCP network socket - name: syslog-tcp-test syslog: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:5140 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format parser: rfc5424 # Default syslog parser is rfc3164 # UDP network socket - name: syslog-udp-test syslog: uri: udp://0.0.0.0:6140 # Use the udp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format max_line_kb: 35 # Paths for Unix sockets are defined by combining protocol and path: # unix_udp:// + /path/socket - for example, unix_udp:///tmp/socket # Unix TCP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-tcp-test syslog: uri: unix_tcp:///var/unix-tcp-socket-test unix_permissions: 0666 # Default is 0644.

No data appears when tailing a file The log forwarding feature requires the agent to have permission to read the data sources. When running the infrastructure agent in privileged or non-privileged modes, make sure that the log files you want to forward (and any intermediary directory in its path) are readable by the user running nri-agent. Example: checking file access under Linux Let's check whether the file /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log can be monitored by the nri-agent user. In Linux, you can do a quick check with the namei command: sudo -u nri-agent namei -ml /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log f: /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log drwxr-xr-x root root / drwxr-xr-x root root var drwxrwxr-x root syslog log drwxr--r-- root root restrictedLogs logFile.log - No such file or directory Copy This command failed because the file is not visible to the nri-agent user. By inspecting the previous output, we can detect that the restrictedLogs directory is missing the execution flag for others\". We can fix this by executing: sudo chmod 755 /var/log/restrictedLogs Copy And then check for file access again: # sudo -u nri-agent namei -ml /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log f: /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log drwxr-xr-x root root / drwxr-xr-x root root var drwxrwxr-x root syslog log drwxr-xr-x root root restrictedLogs -rw-r----- vagrant vagrant logFile.log Copy The file is now visible to the nri-agent user. You must ensure that the file is also readable by the nri-agent user. To check this, use: # sudo -u nri-agent head /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log head: cannot open '/var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log' for reading: Permission denied Copy In this example, the file is missing the read rights for the others group (users other than vagrant and the vagrant user group). You could fix this by granting read permissions to others, but the application could change these permissions upon restart. To avoid this, a better approach is to add the nri-agent user to the vagrant user group. No data appears when capturing via a Syslog socket The log forwarding feature requires that the agent has permission to read the data sources. When running the infrastructure agent in privileged or non-privileged modes: If you're using Unix domain socket files, make sure that the nri-agent user can access these files (please refer to the previous section) and that they have read and write permissions (666) so that other users than nri-agent can write to them. If you're using IP sockets, ensure that the port that you are using is not a system reserved one (like port 80, for example). If no data appears after you enable log management, follow standard log management troubleshooting procedures. No data appears using infrastructure agent proxy As explained in the infrastructure agent configuration guidelines, the proxy parameter must use either HTTP or HTTPS and be in the form https://user:password@hostname:port. The agent can parse the parameter without the HTTP or HTTPS, but the log-forwarder cannot. You will see an error like the following in the agent verbose logs: [ERROR] building HTTP transport: parse \\\"hostname:port\\\": first path segment in URL cannot contain colon Copy To solve this problem, check your newrelic-infra.yml file, and ensure the proxy parameter adheres to this form. Send the agent's logs to New Relic You can configure the infrastructure agent to send its own logs to New Relic. This is useful for troubleshooting issues with log forwarding, the agent, or when contacting support. To forward the infrastructure agent logs to New Relic: Edit your newrelic-infra.yml file. Enable agent logging in troubleshooting mode by adding verbose: 3 Important On Windows and systems that don't use systemd or where journald is inaccessible, verbose:3 causes the agent to write the logs on the disk. Revert to verbose:0 to prevent this. (Recommended): Enable agent logging in JSON format to log_format: json. Restart the agent to load the new settings. This configuration sets up the agent in troubleshooting mode, but the log forwarder (based on Fluent Bit) will continue in a non-verbose mode. Sometimes you can have issues with the log forwarder itself. For example, there may be problems accessing a specific channel when shipping Windows log events or when accessing a particular log file. In these situations, you can also enable the verbose mode for the log forwarder: Set verbose to a value other than 0. Add the following configuration option: trace: [\"log.fw\"]. Caution Check whether you are using the fluentbit option. When setting verbose: 3 and trace: [\"log.fw\"], ensure that you don't define any [OUTPUT] section pointing to stdout in an external Fluent Bit configuration file, Fluent Bit does not start with the infra-agent For Linux versions previous to 2016 you may need to update the OpenSSL library to 1.1.0 (or higher). To check if you have this problem: See if infra-agenthas started Fluent Bit by doing ps -aux | grep fluent-bit Copy If it isn't running go to /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/logging and run ./fluent-bit -i systemd -o stdout Copy If you get the following error, update OpenSSL to 1.1.0 or higher: error while loading shared libraries: libssl.so.1.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory Runtime error on Windows One of the following error messages may appear when enabling log forwarding on Windows: The code execution cannot proceed because VCRUNTIME140.dll was not found. Copy OR error=\"exit status 3221225781\" process=log-forwarder Copy This is caused by a missing DLL. To solve the issue, install the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable: x64 or x86. What's next? Now that you've enabled Logs, here are some potential next steps: Explore your data using the Logs UI. Configure your agent to see contextual log data, such as distributed tracing, stack traces, application logs, and more. Query your data and create custom dashboards or alerts.",

Read on to learn how to configure logs in context and enrich your log data. Compatibility and requirements To use log management with the Ruby agent, ensure your configuration meets the following requirements: Ruby agent 6.7.0 or higher: Install or update Supported Rails version (for Rails applications) Configure logs in context with log management To configure logs in context with Ruby: Enable log management with a compatible log forwarding plugin. Install or update the Ruby agent. Configure logs in context for Ruby. Optional: Advanced configuration. Check for logging data. Enable log management Confirm that you have log management enabled, with a compatible log forwarding plugin installed to send your application logs to New Relic. Install or update the Ruby agent Install or update to the most recent Ruby agent version, and enable distributed tracing. Configure logs in context for Ruby Configure for Rails Rails logging is controlled by two components: a logger (customizable by setting config.logger) and a log formatter (customizable by setting config.log_formatter). In most cases, logs in context should be configured by setting config.log_formatter to the DecoratingFormatter in your Rails application. For more guidance regarding Rails configuration, see Configuring Rails Applications. In your application's config, require 'newrelic_rpm', then add the following line: module ________ class Application < Rails::Application ... config.log_formatter = ::NewRelic::Agent::Logging::DecoratingFormatter.new end end Copy This will use the New Relic formatter to format log messages, but the rest of the logging configuration will be provided by the other Rails config settings. Please note that Logs in Context for Ruby does not currently support tagged logging; if you are initializing your logger with a log_tags argument, your custom tags may not appear on the final version of your logs. Rails advanced configuration If setting the log_formatter option doesn't meet your needs, replace the entire Rails logger with an instance of the New Relic logger. Provide the parameters to the logger's constructor, like this: module ________ class Application < Rails::Application ... config.logger = ::NewRelic::Agent::Logging::DecoratingLogger.new( \"log/application.log\", #etc... ) end end Copy Configure for Ruby without Rails For non-Rails applications, use the DecoratingLogger in place of the Ruby standard ::Logger, like this: logger = ::NewRelic::Agent::Logging::DecoratingLogger.new( 'log/application.log', #etc... ) ... logger.info(...) Copy The DecoratingLogger is a drop-in replacement for the Ruby standard ::Logger. Their constructors accept the same parameters. Advanced configuration Custom logger configuration To use our logging extension with a different logging implementation, or your own custom logger, use the DecoratingFormatter. Example: module ________ class Application < Rails::Application ... config.logger = ::YourCustomLoggerImplementation.new( $stdout, formatter: ::NewRelic::Agent::Logging::DecoratingFormatter.new ) end end Copy Lograge configuration To configure this extension with the lograge gem, there is no additional configuration required. Check for logging data If you have configured your logging in /config/application.rb, or in /config/environments/development.rb, run your application locally and check its logging output. You should see some output like this: {\"entity.name\":\"your_app_name\",\"entity.type\":\"SERVICE\",\"hostname\":\"79bcbf8d\",\"trace.id\":\"79bcbf8d\",\"span.id\":\"00fc7d46\",\"timestamp\":1567701375543,\"message\":\"example log message one\",\"log.level\":\"DEBUG\"} {\"entity.name\":\"your_app_name\",\"entity.type\":\"SERVICE\",\"hostname\":\"79bcbf8d\",\"trace.id\":\"79bcbf8d\",\"span.id\":\"6754870b\",\"timestamp\":1567702843604,\"message\":\"example log message two\",\"log.level\":\"DEBUG\"} Copy If you have deployed this application to an environment with a log forwarder, your application's logs will appear in the New Relic Logs UI with metadata linking them to a trace and a span. You can find them using a query like this: entity.name:\"your_app_name\" has:trace.id Copy If you see JSON logs in your application's output, but no logs returned by a query like the above, check your log forwarder. Troubleshooting If the logs from your application are not formatted in JSON with fields like trace.id and span.id, there may be a problem with the configuration of the New Relic Logging Extension. Check that: the application is using a supported logging framework. the configuration has been applied to all the environments where you would like to use the New Relic Logging Extension. there is not another logger configured later in the configuration of the application. Incompatible gems The New Relic decorating logger is known to be incompatible with the following gems: logging semantic logger rails_stdout_logger rails_12factor What's next?

      "body": "You can forward your logs to New Relic using our infrastructure monitoring agent. This makes all of your logging data available in one location and provides deeper visibility into both your application and your platform performance data. Tip To use log management and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Enable log forwarding using the infrastructure agent To enable log forwarding through the infrastructure agent: Start by verifying the system requirements needed for configuring Logs. Ensure you have installed the infrastructure agent, version 1.11.4 or higher. Create a logging.yml file in the infrastructure agent's logging.d directory. Configure your log sources and other parameters. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your account for data. Explore your log data in the Logs UI and benefit from the log attributes automatically inserted by the infrastructure agent. System Requirements To use the log forwarder of the infrastructure agent, make sure you meet the following requirements: Infrastructure agent version 1.11.4 or higher OpenSSL library 1.1.0 or higher is required by infra-agent starting from v1.16.4. The log forwarding feature is compatible with the following operating systems: Operating system Supported version Amazon Linux Amazon Linux 2 CentOS Version 7 or higher Debian Version 9 (\"Stretch\") or higher Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) Version 7 or higher SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) Version 12 Ubuntu Versions 16.04.x, 18.04.x and 20.04.x (LTS versions) Windows Windows Server 2012, 2016, and 2019, and their service packs. Windows 10 Caution The log forwarding feature is not supported on containerized infrastructure agents. Install the infrastructure agent Starting with version 1.11.4, the infrastructure agent can forward logs to New Relic. To install and run the agent, use a package manager (Linux) or the MSI installer (Windows). To use the following links, make sure you are logged to your New Relic account. Amazon Linux CentOS Debian RHEL SLES Ubuntu Windows If you don't have a New Relic account yet, or prefer to follow the procedure manually, see our tutorial to install the package manager. Configure the infrastructure agent Configuration files describe which log sources are forwarded. The Infrastructure agent uses .yml files for configuring logging. You can add as many config files as you want. To add a new configuration file for the log forwarding feature: Navigate to the logging forwarder configuration folder: Linux: /etc/newrelic-infra/logging.d/ Windows: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\logging.d\\ Create a logging.yml configuration file and add the parameters you need. The logging.d directory has various .yml.example files that can be used as a reference or starting point. The agent automatically processes new configuration files without having to restart the Infrastructure service. The only exception to this is when configuring a custom Fluent Bit configuration. Log forwarding parameters The infrastructure log forwarding .yml config supports the following parameters: Name (required) To start, make sure to define a name for the logs you want to forward: name Name of the log or logs being forwarding to New Relic. Log source (required) What you use for the log source will depend on where you want to forward your logs from. The available options are listed below: file Path to the log file or files. The agent tracks changes on the log files in a way similar to tail -f shell. Example: logs: - name: example-log file: /var/log/example.log # Path to a single log file - name: example-log-two file: /var/log/example-two.log # Path to another single log file Copy The file parameter can point to a specific log file or multiple files by using wildcards applied to names and extensions; for example, /logs/*.log. You can use wildcards in place of directories in a file path, which can be used to tail files located in different directories. Example: logs: - name: docker-logs file: /var/lib/docker/containers/*/*.log # Path to multiple folders and files Copy Important Use of wildcards may significantly increase the number of file descriptors the Fluent Bit process keeps open, which can interfere with log collection if the host's file descriptor limit is reached. We recommend increasing the file descriptor limit on Linux hosts running Fluent Bit by adding the following to the host's /etc/security/limits.conf file: root soft nofile 65536 root hard nofile 65536 *soft nofile 65536 *hard nofile 65536 Copy If you add these changes, reboot the host to ensure your changes are applied. systemd Use the systemd paramater to forward log messages that are collected by the journald daemon in Linux environments. This input type requires the agent to run in root mode. Example: logs: - name: systemd-example systemd: cupsd Copy syslog Syslog data source. Parameters: uri: Syslog socket. Format varies depending on the protocol: TCP/UDP network sockets: [tcp/udp]://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT Unix domain sockets: unix_[tcp/udp]:// + /socket/path parser: Syslog parser. Default is rfc3164. Use rfc5424 if your messages include fractional seconds. Note: rfc3164 currently does not work on SuSE. unix_permissions: default is 0644 for domain sockets; this limits entries to processes running as root. You can use 0666 to listen for non-root processes, at your own risk. When running the agent in privileged mode, ports and sockets must be available or owned by nri-agent, with 0666 file permissions, so that other processes can write logs to the sockets. logs: # TCP network socket - name: syslog-tcp-test syslog: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:5140 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format parser: rfc5424 # Default syslog parser is rfc3164 # UDP network socket - name: syslog-udp-test syslog: uri: udp://0.0.0.0:6140 # Use the udp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format max_line_kb: 35 # Unix TCP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-tcp-test syslog: uri: unix_tcp:///var/unix-tcp-socket-test unix_permissions: 0666 # Default is 0644. Change at your own risk # Unix UDP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-udp-test syslog: uri: unix_udp:///var/unix-udp-socket-test parser: rfc5424 Copy tcp Logs retrieved over TCP connections. Parameters: uri: TCP/IP socket to listen for incoming data. The URI format is tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format: format of the data. It can be json or none. separator: If format: none is used, you can define a separator string for splitting records (default: \\n). logs: - name: tcp-simple-test tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:1234 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format format: none # Raw text - this is default for 'tcp' separator: \\t # String for separating raw text entries max_line_kb: 32 - name: tcp-json-test tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:2345 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format format: json Copy winlog Collect events from Windows log channels. Parameters: channel: name of the channel logs will be collected from. collect-eventids: a list of Windows Event IDs to be collected and forwarded to New Relic. Event ID ranges are supported. exclude-eventids: a list of Windows Event IDs to be excluded from collection. Event ID ranges are supported. All events are collected from the specified channel by default. Configure the collect-eventids and exclude-eventids sections to avoid sending unwanted logs to your New Relic account. Add event IDs or ranges to collect-eventids or exclude-eventids to forward or drop specific events. exclude-eventids takes precedence over collect-eventids if the same event ID is present in both sections. Example: logs: # Winlog log ingestion with eventId filters. - name: windows-security winlog: channel: Security collect-eventids: - 4624 - 4265 - 4700-4800 exclude-eventids: - 4735 # entries for the application, system, powershell, and SCOM channels - name: windows-application winlog: channel: Application - name: windows-system winlog: channel: System - name: windows-pshell winlog: channel: Windows Powershell - name: scom winlog: channel: Operations Manager # Entry for Windows Defender Logs - name: windows-defender winlog: channel: Microsoft-Windows-Windows Defender/Operational # Entry for Windows Clustering Logs - name: windows-clustering winlog: channel: Microsoft-Windows-FailoverClustering/Operational # Entry for IIS logs with logtype attribute for automatic parsing - name: iis-log file: C:\\inetpub\\logs\\LogFiles\\w3svc.log attributes: logtype: iis_w3c Copy Optional Configuration The following are configuration paramaters that are not required but are still recommended. attributes List of custom attributes as key-value pairs that can be used to send additional data with the logs which you can then query. Add attributes to any log source. Example: logs: - name: example-file-attributes file: /var/log/example.log attributes: logtype: nginx region: example-us-02 team: A-team - name: example-tcp-attributes tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:2345 format: json attributes: logtype: nginx region: example-us-02 team: B-team Copy Log attributes automatically inserted by the infrastructure agent(#automatically-inserted-attributes) The infrastructure agent automatically inserts log attributes for your convenience. Some of them are inserted for any log record, while others depend on the configuration parameters you used while setting up the log forwarder. Find a summary of these attributes in the following table: Attribute name Inserting conditions Description entity.guids Always inserted The infrastructure agent inserts the Entity GUID assigned by New Relic to identify the host where it's running. It is available in the entity.guids field. Note: If the captured logs belong to an application instrumented using APM, the entity.guids field contains both the entity GUID of infrastructure, as well as the GUID of APM, separated by a pipe ( | ) delimiter. fb.input Always inserted The underlying Fluent Bit input plugin type used to capture the logs. Currently, its values are tail, systemd, winlog, syslog, and tcp. filePath When using the file input type Absolute file path of the file being monitored. hostname Always inserted The hostname of the machine/VM/container executing the infrastructure agent. plugin.type Always inserted Indicates the utility used to capture the logs. In this case, it is the infrastructure agent itself, so this attribute always has the value nri-agent. pattern Regular expression for filtering records. Only supported for the tail, systemd, syslog, and tcp (only with format none) sources. This field works in a way similar to grep -E in Unix systems. For example, for a given file being captured, you can filter for records containing either WARN or ERROR using: - name: only-records-with-warn-and-error file: /var/log/logFile.log pattern: WARN|ERROR Copy No filtering is applied by default. max_line_kb Maximum size of log entries/lines in KB. If log entries exceed the limit, they are skipped. Default is 128. fluentbit External Fluent Bit configuration and parser files. If defined, they are merged with the existing configuration and parser files generated by the infrastructure agent. The infrastructure agent processes the configuration files located in the logging.d directory and will generate a run-time Fluent Bit configuration file that contains the appropriate [INPUT], [FILTER] and [OUTPUT] sections. Optionally, it will also declare an @INCLUDE in case you provided an external Fluent Bit configuration file via the fluentbit option. The runtime file does not define a [SERVICE] section, leaving all default Fluent Bit configuration values. You can still override Fluent Bit's default settings by defining your own [SERVICE] section in your external Fluent Bit configuration file and include it via the fluentbit option. Parameters: config_file: path to an existing Fluent Bit configuration file. Note that any overlapping source results in duplicate messages in New Relic Logs. parsers_file: path to an existing Fluent Bit parsers file.

No data appears when tailing a file The log forwarding feature requires the agent to have permission to read the data sources. When running the infrastructure agent in privileged or non-privileged modes, make sure that the log files you want to forward (and any intermediary directory in its path) are readable by the user running nri-agent. Example: checking file access under Linux Let's check whether the file /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log can be monitored by the nri-agent user. In Linux, you can do a quick check with the namei command: sudo -u nri-agent namei -ml /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log f: /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log drwxr-xr-x root root / drwxr-xr-x root root var drwxrwxr-x root syslog log drwxr--r-- root root restrictedLogs logFile.log - No such file or directory Copy This command failed because the file is not visible to the nri-agent user. By inspecting the previous output, we can detect that the restrictedLogs directory is missing the execution flag for others\". We can fix this by executing: sudo chmod 755 /var/log/restrictedLogs Copy And then check for file access again: # sudo -u nri-agent namei -ml /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log f: /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log drwxr-xr-x root root / drwxr-xr-x root root var drwxrwxr-x root syslog log drwxr-xr-x root root restrictedLogs -rw-r----- vagrant vagrant logFile.log Copy The file is now visible to the nri-agent user. You must ensure that the file is also readable by the nri-agent user. To check this, use: # sudo -u nri-agent head /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log head: cannot open '/var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log' for reading: Permission denied Copy In this example, the file is missing the read rights for the others group (users other than vagrant and the vagrant user group). You could fix this by granting read permissions to others, but the application could change these permissions upon restart. To avoid this, a better approach is to add the nri-agent user to the vagrant user group. No data appears when capturing via a Syslog socket The log forwarding feature requires that the agent has permission to read the data sources. When running the infrastructure agent in privileged or non-privileged modes: If you're using Unix domain socket files, make sure that the nri-agent user can access these files (please refer to the previous section) and that they have read and write permissions (666) so that other users than nri-agent can write to them. If you're using IP sockets, ensure that the port that you are using is not a system reserved one (like port 80, for example). If no data appears after you enable log management, follow standard log management troubleshooting procedures. No data appears using infrastructure agent proxy As explained in the infrastructure agent configuration guidelines, the proxy parameter must use either HTTP or HTTPS and be in the form https://user:password@hostname:port. The agent can parse the parameter without the HTTP or HTTPS, but the log-forwarder cannot. You will see an error like the following in the agent verbose logs: [ERROR] building HTTP transport: parse \\\"hostname:port\\\": first path segment in URL cannot contain colon Copy To solve this problem, check your newrelic-infra.yml file, and ensure the proxy parameter adheres to this form. Send the agent's logs to New Relic You can configure the infrastructure agent to send its own logs to New Relic. This is useful for troubleshooting issues with log forwarding, the agent, or when contacting support. To forward the infrastructure agent logs to New Relic: Edit your newrelic-infra.yml file. Enable agent logging in troubleshooting mode by adding verbose: 3 Important On Windows and systems that don't use systemd or where journald is inaccessible, verbose:3 causes the agent to write the logs on the disk. Revert to verbose:0 to prevent this. (Recommended): Enable agent logging in JSON format to log_format: json. Restart the agent to load the new settings. This configuration sets up the agent in troubleshooting mode, but the log forwarder (based on Fluent Bit) will continue in a non-verbose mode. Sometimes you can have issues with the log forwarder itself. For example, there may be problems accessing a specific channel when shipping Windows log events or when accessing a particular log file. In these situations, you can also enable the verbose mode for the log forwarder: Set verbose to a value other than 0. Add the following configuration option: trace: [\"log.fw\"]. Caution Check whether you are using the fluentbit option. When setting verbose: 3 and trace: [\"log.fw\"], ensure that you don't define any [OUTPUT] section pointing to stdout in an external Fluent Bit configuration file, Fluent Bit does not start with the infra-agent For Linux versions previous to 2016 you may need to update the OpenSSL library to 1.1.0 (or higher). To check if you have this problem: See if infra-agenthas started Fluent Bit by doing ps -aux | grep fluent-bit Copy If it isn't running go to /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/logging and run ./fluent-bit -i systemd -o stdout Copy If you get the following error, update OpenSSL to 1.1.0 or higher: error while loading shared libraries: libssl.so.1.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory Runtime error on Windows One of the following error messages may appear when enabling log forwarding on Windows: The code execution cannot proceed because VCRUNTIME140.dll was not found. Copy OR error=\"exit status 3221225781\" process=log-forwarder Copy This is caused by a missing DLL. To solve the issue, install the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable: x64 or x86. What's next? Now that you've enabled Logs, here are some potential next steps: Explore your data using the Logs UI. Configure your agent to see contextual log data, such as distributed tracing, stack traces, application logs, and more. Query your data and create custom dashboards or alerts.",

Read on to learn how to configure logs in context and enrich your log data. Compatibility and requirements To use log management with the Ruby agent, ensure your configuration meets the following requirements: Ruby agent 6.7.0 or higher: Install or update Supported Rails version (for Rails applications) Configure logs in context with log management To configure logs in context with Ruby: Enable log management with a compatible log forwarding plugin. Install or update the Ruby agent. Configure logs in context for Ruby. Optional: Advanced configuration. Check for logging data. Enable log management Confirm that you have log management enabled, with a compatible log forwarding plugin installed to send your application logs to New Relic. Install or update the Ruby agent Install or update to the most recent Ruby agent version, and enable distributed tracing. Configure logs in context for Ruby Configure for Rails Rails logging is controlled by two components: a logger (customizable by setting config.logger) and a log formatter (customizable by setting config.log_formatter). In most cases, logs in context should be configured by setting config.log_formatter to the DecoratingFormatter in your Rails application. For more guidance regarding Rails configuration, see Configuring Rails Applications. In your application's config, require 'newrelic_rpm', then add the following line: module ________ class Application < Rails::Application ... config.log_formatter = ::NewRelic::Agent::Logging::DecoratingFormatter.new end end Copy This will use the New Relic formatter to format log messages, but the rest of the logging configuration will be provided by the other Rails config settings. Please note that Logs in Context for Ruby does not currently support tagged logging; if you are initializing your logger with a log_tags argument, your custom tags may not appear on the final version of your logs. Rails advanced configuration If setting the log_formatter option doesn't meet your needs, replace the entire Rails logger with an instance of the New Relic logger. Provide the parameters to the logger's constructor, like this: module ________ class Application < Rails::Application ... config.logger = ::NewRelic::Agent::Logging::DecoratingLogger.new( \"log/application.log\", #etc... ) end end Copy Configure for Ruby without Rails For non-Rails applications, use the DecoratingLogger in place of the Ruby standard ::Logger, like this: logger = ::NewRelic::Agent::Logging::DecoratingLogger.new( 'log/application.log', #etc... ) ... logger.info(...) Copy The DecoratingLogger is a drop-in replacement for the Ruby standard ::Logger. Their constructors accept the same parameters. Advanced configuration Custom logger configuration To use our logging extension with a different logging implementation, or your own custom logger, use the DecoratingFormatter. Example: module ________ class Application < Rails::Application ... config.logger = ::YourCustomLoggerImplementation.new( $stdout, formatter: ::NewRelic::Agent::Logging::DecoratingFormatter.new ) end end Copy Lograge configuration To configure this extension with the lograge gem, there is no additional configuration required. Check for logging data If you have configured your logging in /config/application.rb, or in /config/environments/development.rb, run your application locally and check its logging output. You should see some output like this: {\"entity.name\":\"your_app_name\",\"entity.type\":\"SERVICE\",\"hostname\":\"79bcbf8d\",\"trace.id\":\"79bcbf8d\",\"span.id\":\"00fc7d46\",\"timestamp\":1567701375543,\"message\":\"example log message one\",\"log.level\":\"DEBUG\"} {\"entity.name\":\"your_app_name\",\"entity.type\":\"SERVICE\",\"hostname\":\"79bcbf8d\",\"trace.id\":\"79bcbf8d\",\"span.id\":\"6754870b\",\"timestamp\":1567702843604,\"message\":\"example log message two\",\"log.level\":\"DEBUG\"} Copy If you have deployed this application to an environment with a log forwarder, your application's logs will appear in the New Relic Logs UI with metadata linking them to a trace and a span. You can find them using a query like this: entity.name:\"your_app_name\" has:trace.id Copy If you see JSON logs in your application's output, but no logs returned by a query like the above, check your log forwarder. Troubleshooting If the logs from your application are not formatted in JSON with fields like trace.id and span.id, there may be a problem with the configuration of the New Relic Logging Extension. Check that: the application is using a supported logging framework. the configuration has been applied to all the environments where you would like to use the New Relic Logging Extension. there is not another logger configured later in the configuration of the application. Incompatible gems The New Relic decorating logger is known to be incompatible with the following gems: logging semantic logger rails_stdout_logger rails_12factor What's next?

This makes all of your logging data available in one location and provides deeper visibility into both your application and your platform performance data. Tip To use log management and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Enable log forwarding using the infrastructure agent To enable log forwarding through the infrastructure agent: Start by verifying the system requirements needed for configuring Logs. Ensure you have installed the infrastructure agent, version 1.11.4 or higher. Create a logging.yml file in the infrastructure agent's logging.d directory. Configure your log sources and other parameters. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your account for data. Explore your log data in the Logs UI and benefit from the log attributes automatically inserted by the infrastructure agent. System Requirements To use the log forwarder of the infrastructure agent, make sure you meet the following requirements: Infrastructure agent version 1.11.4 or higher OpenSSL library 1.1.0 or higher is required by infra-agent starting from v1.16.4. The log forwarding feature is compatible with the following operating systems: Operating system Supported version Amazon Linux Amazon Linux 2 CentOS Version 7 or higher Debian Version 9 (\"Stretch\") or higher Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) Version 7 or higher SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) Version 12 Ubuntu Versions 16.04.x, 18.04.x and 20.04.x (LTS versions) Windows Windows Server 2012, 2016, and 2019, and their service packs. Windows 10 Caution The log forwarding feature is not supported on containerized infrastructure agents. Install the infrastructure agent Starting with version 1.11.4, the infrastructure agent can forward logs to New Relic. To install and run the agent, use a package manager (Linux) or the MSI installer (Windows). To use the following links, make sure you are logged to your New Relic account. Amazon Linux CentOS Debian RHEL SLES Ubuntu Windows If you don't have a New Relic account yet, or prefer to follow the procedure manually, see our tutorial to install the package manager. Configure the infrastructure agent Configuration files describe which log sources are forwarded. The Infrastructure agent uses .yml files for configuring logging. You can add as many config files as you want. To add a new configuration file for the log forwarding feature: Navigate to the logging forwarder configuration folder: Linux: /etc/newrelic-infra/logging.d/ Windows: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\logging.d\\ Create a logging.yml configuration file and add the parameters you need. The logging.d directory has various .yml.example files that can be used as a reference or starting point. The agent automatically processes new configuration files without having to restart the Infrastructure service. The only exception to this is when configuring a custom Fluent Bit configuration. Log forwarding parameters The infrastructure log forwarding .yml config supports the following parameters: Name (required) To start, make sure to define a name for the logs you want to forward: name Name of the log or logs being forwarding to New Relic. Log source (required) What you use for the log source will depend on where you want to forward your logs from. The available options are listed below: file Path to the log file or files. The agent tracks changes on the log files in a way similar to tail -f shell. Example: logs: - name: example-log file: /var/log/example.log # Path to a single log file - name: example-log-two file: /var/log/example-two.log # Path to another single log file Copy The file parameter can point to a specific log file or multiple files by using wildcards applied to names and extensions; for example, /logs/*.log. You can use wildcards in place of directories in a file path, which can be used to tail files located in different directories. Example: logs: - name: docker-logs file: /var/lib/docker/containers/*/*.log # Path to multiple folders and files Copy Important Use of wildcards may significantly increase the number of file descriptors the Fluent Bit process keeps open, which can interfere with log collection if the host's file descriptor limit is reached. We recommend increasing the file descriptor limit on Linux hosts running Fluent Bit by adding the following to the host's /etc/security/limits.conf file: root soft nofile 65536 root hard nofile 65536 *soft nofile 65536 *hard nofile 65536 Copy If you add these changes, reboot the host to ensure your changes are applied. systemd Use the systemd paramater to forward log messages that are collected by the journald daemon in Linux environments. This input type requires the agent to run in root mode. Example: logs: - name: systemd-example systemd: cupsd Copy syslog Syslog data source. Parameters: uri: Syslog socket. Format varies depending on the protocol: TCP/UDP network sockets: [tcp/udp]://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT Unix domain sockets: unix_[tcp/udp]:// + /socket/path parser: Syslog parser. Default is rfc3164. Use rfc5424 if your messages include fractional seconds. Note: rfc3164 currently does not work on SuSE. unix_permissions: default is 0644 for domain sockets; this limits entries to processes running as root. You can use 0666 to listen for non-root processes, at your own risk. When running the agent in privileged mode, ports and sockets must be available or owned by nri-agent, with 0666 file permissions, so that other processes can write logs to the sockets. logs: # TCP network socket - name: syslog-tcp-test syslog: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:5140 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format parser: rfc5424 # Default syslog parser is rfc3164 # UDP network socket - name: syslog-udp-test syslog: uri: udp://0.0.0.0:6140 # Use the udp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format max_line_kb: 35 # Unix TCP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-tcp-test syslog: uri: unix_tcp:///var/unix-tcp-socket-test unix_permissions: 0666 # Default is 0644. Change at your own risk # Unix UDP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-udp-test syslog: uri: unix_udp:///var/unix-udp-socket-test parser: rfc5424 Copy tcp Logs retrieved over TCP connections. Parameters: uri: TCP/IP socket to listen for incoming data. The URI format is tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format: format of the data. It can be json or none. separator: If format: none is used, you can define a separator string for splitting records (default: \\n). logs: - name: tcp-simple-test tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:1234 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format format: none # Raw text - this is default for 'tcp' separator: \\t # String for separating raw text entries max_line_kb: 32 - name: tcp-json-test tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:2345 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format format: json Copy winlog Collect events from Windows log channels. Parameters: channel: name of the channel logs will be collected from. collect-eventids: a list of Windows Event IDs to be collected and forwarded to New Relic. Event ID ranges are supported. exclude-eventids: a list of Windows Event IDs to be excluded from collection. Event ID ranges are supported. All events are collected from the specified channel by default. Configure the collect-eventids and exclude-eventids sections to avoid sending unwanted logs to your New Relic account. Add event IDs or ranges to collect-eventids or exclude-eventids to forward or drop specific events. exclude-eventids takes precedence over collect-eventids if the same event ID is present in both sections. Example: logs: # Winlog log ingestion with eventId filters. - name: windows-security winlog: channel: Security collect-eventids: - 4624 - 4265 - 4700-4800 exclude-eventids: - 4735 # entries for the application, system, powershell, and SCOM channels - name: windows-application winlog: channel: Application - name: windows-system winlog: channel: System - name: windows-pshell winlog: channel: Windows Powershell - name: scom winlog: channel: Operations Manager # Entry for Windows Defender Logs - name: windows-defender winlog: channel: Microsoft-Windows-Windows Defender/Operational # Entry for Windows Clustering Logs - name: windows-clustering winlog: channel: Microsoft-Windows-FailoverClustering/Operational # Entry for IIS logs with logtype attribute for automatic parsing - name: iis-log file: C:\\inetpub\\logs\\LogFiles\\w3svc.log attributes: logtype: iis_w3c Copy Optional Configuration The following are configuration paramaters that are not required but are still recommended. attributes List of custom attributes as key-value pairs that can be used to send additional data with the logs which you can then query. Add attributes to any log source. Example: logs: - name: example-file-attributes file: /var/log/example.log attributes: logtype: nginx region: example-us-02 team: A-team - name: example-tcp-attributes tcp: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:2345 format: json attributes: logtype: nginx region: example-us-02 team: B-team Copy Log attributes automatically inserted by the infrastructure agent(#automatically-inserted-attributes) The infrastructure agent automatically inserts log attributes for your convenience. Some of them are inserted for any log record, while others depend on the configuration parameters you used while setting up the log forwarder. Find a summary of these attributes in the following table: Attribute name Inserting conditions Description entity.guids Always inserted The infrastructure agent inserts the Entity GUID assigned by New Relic to identify the host where it's running. It is available in the entity.guids field. Note: If the captured logs belong to an application instrumented using APM, the entity.guids field contains both the entity GUID of infrastructure, as well as the GUID of APM, separated by a pipe ( | ) delimiter. fb.input Always inserted The underlying Fluent Bit input plugin type used to capture the logs. Currently, its values are tail, systemd, winlog, syslog, and tcp. filePath When using the file input type Absolute file path of the file being monitored. hostname Always inserted The hostname of the machine/VM/container executing the infrastructure agent. plugin.type Always inserted Indicates the utility used to capture the logs. In this case, it is the infrastructure agent itself, so this attribute always has the value nri-agent. pattern Regular expression for filtering records. Only supported for the tail, systemd, syslog, and tcp (only with format none) sources. This field works in a way similar to grep -E in Unix systems. For example, for a given file being captured, you can filter for records containing either WARN or ERROR using: - name: only-records-with-warn-and-error file: /var/log/logFile.log pattern: WARN|ERROR Copy No filtering is applied by default. max_line_kb Maximum size of log entries/lines in KB. If log entries exceed the limit, they are skipped. Default is 128. fluentbit External Fluent Bit configuration and parser files. If defined, they are merged with the existing configuration and parser files generated by the infrastructure agent. The infrastructure agent processes the configuration files located in the logging.d directory and will generate a run-time Fluent Bit configuration file that contains the appropriate [INPUT], [FILTER] and [OUTPUT] sections. Optionally, it will also declare an @INCLUDE in case you provided an external Fluent Bit configuration file via the fluentbit option. The runtime file does not define a [SERVICE] section, leaving all default Fluent Bit configuration values. You can still override Fluent Bit's default settings by defining your own [SERVICE] section in your external Fluent Bit configuration file and include it via the fluentbit option. Parameters: config_file: path to an existing Fluent Bit configuration file. Note that any overlapping source results in duplicate messages in New Relic Logs. parsers_file: path to an existing Fluent Bit parsers file. The following parser names are reserved: rfc3164, rfc3164-local and rfc5424. Sample configuration file Here is an example of a logging.d/ configuration file in YAML format. For more configuration examples, see the infrastructure agent repository. logging.d/sample.yaml # Remember to only use spaces for indentation logs: # Example of 'file' source - name: file-with-attributes file: /var/log/test.log # Path to a single file or pattern attributes: # You can use custom attributes to enrich your data logtype: nginx team: The A Team pattern: Error # Regular expression to filter log entries # Example of 'systemd' source (Linux only) - name: systemd-example systemd: cupsd # Examples of 'syslog' source, one per protocol # TCP network socket - name: syslog-tcp-test syslog: uri: tcp://0.0.0.0:5140 # Use the tcp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format parser: rfc5424 # Default syslog parser is rfc3164 # UDP network socket - name: syslog-udp-test syslog: uri: udp://0.0.0.0:6140 # Use the udp://LISTEN_ADDRESS:PORT format max_line_kb: 35 # Paths for Unix sockets are defined by combining protocol and path: # unix_udp:// + /path/socket - for example, unix_udp:///tmp/socket # Unix TCP domain socket - name: syslog-unix-tcp-test syslog: uri: unix_tcp:///var/unix-tcp-socket-test unix_permissions: 0666 # Default is 0644.

No data appears when tailing a file The log forwarding feature requires the agent to have permission to read the data sources. When running the infrastructure agent in privileged or non-privileged modes, make sure that the log files you want to forward (and any intermediary directory in its path) are readable by the user running nri-agent. Example: checking file access under Linux Let's check whether the file /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log can be monitored by the nri-agent user. In Linux, you can do a quick check with the namei command: sudo -u nri-agent namei -ml /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log f: /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log drwxr-xr-x root root / drwxr-xr-x root root var drwxrwxr-x root syslog log drwxr--r-- root root restrictedLogs logFile.log - No such file or directory Copy This command failed because the file is not visible to the nri-agent user. By inspecting the previous output, we can detect that the restrictedLogs directory is missing the execution flag for others\". We can fix this by executing: sudo chmod 755 /var/log/restrictedLogs Copy And then check for file access again: # sudo -u nri-agent namei -ml /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log f: /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log drwxr-xr-x root root / drwxr-xr-x root root var drwxrwxr-x root syslog log drwxr-xr-x root root restrictedLogs -rw-r----- vagrant vagrant logFile.log Copy The file is now visible to the nri-agent user. You must ensure that the file is also readable by the nri-agent user. To check this, use: # sudo -u nri-agent head /var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log head: cannot open '/var/log/restrictedLogs/logFile.log' for reading: Permission denied Copy In this example, the file is missing the read rights for the others group (users other than vagrant and the vagrant user group). You could fix this by granting read permissions to others, but the application could change these permissions upon restart. To avoid this, a better approach is to add the nri-agent user to the vagrant user group. No data appears when capturing via a Syslog socket The log forwarding feature requires that the agent has permission to read the data sources. When running the infrastructure agent in privileged or non-privileged modes: If you're using Unix domain socket files, make sure that the nri-agent user can access these files (please refer to the previous section) and that they have read and write permissions (666) so that other users than nri-agent can write to them. If you're using IP sockets, ensure that the port that you are using is not a system reserved one (like port 80, for example). If no data appears after you enable log management, follow standard log management troubleshooting procedures. No data appears using infrastructure agent proxy As explained in the infrastructure agent configuration guidelines, the proxy parameter must use either HTTP or HTTPS and be in the form https://user:password@hostname:port. The agent can parse the parameter without the HTTP or HTTPS, but the log-forwarder cannot. You will see an error like the following in the agent verbose logs: [ERROR] building HTTP transport: parse \\\"hostname:port\\\": first path segment in URL cannot contain colon Copy To solve this problem, check your newrelic-infra.yml file, and ensure the proxy parameter adheres to this form. Send the agent's logs to New Relic You can configure the infrastructure agent to send its own logs to New Relic. This is useful for troubleshooting issues with log forwarding, the agent, or when contacting support. To forward the infrastructure agent logs to New Relic: Edit your newrelic-infra.yml file. Enable agent logging in troubleshooting mode by adding verbose: 3 Important On Windows and systems that don't use systemd or where journald is inaccessible, verbose:3 causes the agent to write the logs on the disk. Revert to verbose:0 to prevent this. (Recommended): Enable agent logging in JSON format to log_format: json. Restart the agent to load the new settings. This configuration sets up the agent in troubleshooting mode, but the log forwarder (based on Fluent Bit) will continue in a non-verbose mode. Sometimes you can have issues with the log forwarder itself. For example, there may be problems accessing a specific channel when shipping Windows log events or when accessing a particular log file. In these situations, you can also enable the verbose mode for the log forwarder: Set verbose to a value other than 0. Add the following configuration option: trace: [\"log.fw\"]. Caution Check whether you are using the fluentbit option. When setting verbose: 3 and trace: [\"log.fw\"], ensure that you don't define any [OUTPUT] section pointing to stdout in an external Fluent Bit configuration file, Fluent Bit does not start with the infra-agent For Linux versions previous to 2016 you may need to update the OpenSSL library to 1.1.0 (or higher). To check if you have this problem: See if infra-agenthas started Fluent Bit by doing ps -aux | grep fluent-bit Copy If it isn't running go to /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/logging and run ./fluent-bit -i systemd -o stdout Copy If you get the following error, update OpenSSL to 1.1.0 or higher: error while loading shared libraries: libssl.so.1.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory Runtime error on Windows One of the following error messages may appear when enabling log forwarding on Windows: The code execution cannot proceed because VCRUNTIME140.dll was not found. Copy OR error=\"exit status 3221225781\" process=log-forwarder Copy This is caused by a missing DLL. To solve the issue, install the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable: x64 or x86. What's next? Now that you've enabled Logs, here are some potential next steps: Explore your data using the Logs UI. Configure your agent to see contextual log data, such as distributed tracing, stack traces, application logs, and more. Query your data and create custom dashboards or alerts.",

This document explains how to configure logs in context and start getting log data. The code and an example application are available on GitHub. Compatibility and requirements To use New Relic logs in context with Log4j 1.x, ensure your configuration meets the following requirements: Java agent 5.6.0 or higher: Install or update JVM argument -javaagent enabled on the Java agent. Log4j 1.x package installed and working on the application. log4j must be configured in code or via XML. Properties files are not supported because AsyncAppender instances can only be automatically configured via XML. Configure logs in context with log management To configure logs in context with Logs4j 1.x: Enable log management with a compatible log forwarding plugin. Install or update the Java agent. Configure the Log4j 1.x extension. Check for logging data. Enable log management Confirm that you have log management enabled, with a compatible log forwarding plugin installed to send your application logs to New Relic. Install or update the Java agent Install or update to the most recent Java agent version, and enable Distributed tracing. Configure the Log4j 1.x extension To configure logs in context with the Log4j 1.x extension, complete the following steps: Update your project's dependencies to include the Log4j 1.x extension as applicable: To update with Gradle, add the following to your build.gradle file: dependencies { compile(\"com.newrelic.logging:log4j1:2.0\") } Copy To update with Maven, add the following to your pom.xml file: <dependencies> <dependency> <groupId>com.newrelic.logging</groupId> <artifactId>log4j1</artifactId> <version>2.0</version> </dependency> </dependencies> Copy In your logging configuration XML file, update your <appender> element with a NewRelicLayout, adding <layout class=\"com.newrelic.logging.log4j1.NewRelicLayout\"/> as shown below: <appender name=\" TypicalFile \" class=\"org.apache.log4j.FileAppender\"> <param name=\"file\" value=\"logs/log4j1-app.log\"/> <param name=\"append\" value=\"false\"/> <layout class=\" com.newrelic.logging.log4j1.NewRelicLayout \"/> <!-- only this line needs to be added --> </appender> Copy Once updated, use NewRelicAsyncAppender to wrap any appenders that will target New Relic's log forwarder.

To drill down into additional details, click any highlighted attribute. one.newrelic.com > Logs: Each log's summary provides query options to add, exclude, replace, and more. Query structure Using the Logs UI, you can search through your log data by entering either simple keywords, such as new and relic, or phrases such as new relic agent, directly into the search field. You can also combine keywords or phrases with operators to form more complex queries. Tip Log queries in New Relic are based on the Lucene query language, and any Lucene function listed in this document is supported. (If a Lucene function is not listed, we do not support it.) For some helpful examples, check out this Lucene tutorial. General query rules: Log query rules Comments Case sensitive The query syntax is case sensitive for attributes values. Attribute names are always case sensitive. Exception: Wildcard searches are case insensitive for attribute values. Special characters When a term contains special characters, double-quote the term and escape the special characters using a backslash (\\). This includes special characters such as +, -, &, |, !, (, ), {, }, [, ], ^, \", ~, *, ?, :, /, or \\. Example: To query for \"POST /log/v1 HTTP/1.1\" 202, escape the quotes like this: \"\\\"POST /log/v1 HTTP/1.1\\\" 202\" Wildcard searches You can run wildcard searches using an asterisk (*) to replace zero or more characters. Example: new*relic Search with text To return more specific query results, use text searches to join together keywords or phrases. Text operators The Logs query syntax accepts the following text operators: Condition Text operator example Matching (keyword) Search for log results containing keywords entered separately: \"new\" \"relic\" Exact matching (phrase) Search for log results containing the specific phrase entered: \"new relic agent\" Either / Or Search for log results containing either or both of the keywords entered: new OR relic And Search for log results containing both of the keywords entered: new AND relic * Wildcard (zero or more) Search for log results containing both of the keywords entered, with zero or more characters between them: new*relic Negation (keyword) Search for log results that do not contain the specific keyword entered: -new Negation (phrase) Search for log results that do not contain the specific phrase entered. -\"new relic\" Search with attributes Use attribute searches to narrow the query results to a specific attribute or field. General operators The following operators can be used by all types of attributes: Condition General operator example Equal : Search for log results where the attribute equals the keyword specified. Example: The field hostname equals chi: hostname:chi Does not equal - : Search for log results where the attribute does not equal the keyword specified. Example: The field hostname does not equal chi. -hostname:chi Contains * Search for log results where the attribute contains the specified keyword. Example: The field hostname contains chi. hostname:*chi* Does not contain - * Search for log results where the attribute does not contain the specified keyword. Example: The field hostname does not contain chi. -hostname:*chi* Starts with * Search for log results where the attribute starts with the specified keyword specified. Example: The field hostname starts with chi. hostname:chi* Ends with * Search for log results where the attribute ends with the specified keyword specified. Example: The field hostname ends with chi. hostname:*chi Has Search for log results that have the specified field. Example: Has the field user_name. has:user_name Missing Search for log results that are missing the specified field. Example: Missing the field user_name. missing:user_name Numeric operators The following operators can only be used by numeric attributes: Condition Numeric operator example Greater than Search for log results attribute matches that are greater than the given parameter. Example: The field http_response_time_ms is greater than 500. http_response_time_ms:>500 Greater than or equal to Search for log results with attribute matches that are greater than or equal to the given parameter. Example: The field http_response_time_ms is greater than or equal to 500. http_response_time_ms:>=500 Less than Search for log results with attribute matches that are less than the given parameter. Example: The field http_response_time_ms is less than 500. http_response_time_ms:<500 Less than or equal to Search for log results with attribute matches that are less than or equal to the given parameter.

      "body": "We offer a wide range of solutions to get your log data into New Relic. But in other situations where you don't have log forwarders (such as CDNs, hardware devices, or managed services), you can use syslog protocols via a TCP endpoint. You can forward your logs to New Relic using syslog clients such as rsyslog and syslog-ng. Compatibility and requirements To forward logs to New Relic using a syslog client, you need: A valid Insights API Insert key Some minor changes to the syslog client's configuration, as explained in this document Important Currently, our syslog endpoint only supports accounts in our US data center. Configure rsyslog To forward logs to New Relic with rsyslog: Install packages required to allow rsyslog to send logs using TLS encryption: sudo yum install rsyslog-gnutls ca-certificates Copy Optional: Configure rsyslog to tail log files and forward their contents to New Relic. Add the following to the /etc/rsyslog.conf file in order to enable its text file input module: module(load=\"imfile\" PollingInterval=\"10\" statefile.directory=\"/var/spool/rsyslog\" ) Copy In the /etc/rsyslog.d/ directory, create a text file named newrelic.conf. Explicitly include the newly created newrelic.conf to the /etc/rsyslog.d/ file: include(file=\"/etc/rsyslog.conf.d/newrelic.conf\") Copy Add the following to newrelic.conf, replacing YOUR_INSERT_KEY with your New Relic Insights API Insert key: ## Specify each of the files to be tailed in case step 1 is done input(type=\"imfile\" ruleset=\"infiles\" Tag=\"<YOUR_FILE_TAG>\" File=\"<PATH_TO_FILE>\" StateFile=\"<UNIQUE_STATEFILE_NAME >\") ## Template expected by the New Relic Syslog endpoint template(name=\"newrelic-rfc5424\" type=\"string\" string=\"<YOUR_INSERT_KEY> <%pri%>%protocol-version% %timestamp:::date-rfc3339% %hostname% %app-name% %procid% %msgid% %structured-data% %msg%\\n\" ) ## Configure TLS and log forwarding global(DefaultNetstreamDriver=\"gtls\" DefaultNetstreamDriverCAFile=\"/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt\" ) action(type=\"omfwd\" Target=\"newrelic.syslog.nr-data.net\" Port=\"6514\" Protocol=\"tcp\" Template=\"newrelic-rfc5424\" ResendLastMSGOnReconnect=\"on\" StreamDriver=\"gtls\" StreamDriverAuthMode=\"x509/name\" StreamDriverPermittedPeers=\"*.syslog.nr-data.net\" StreamDriverMode=\"1\" ) Copy Restart the rsyslog service by running: sudo systemctl restart rsyslog Copy Check your New Relic account for logs. Legacy config file for rsyslog 7 or earlier If you are using rsyslog version 7 or below, the configuration files need to be adapted to the obsolete legacy format. This format is only kept for retro compatibility purposes. We strongly recommend to avoid using it, as stated in the rsyslog documentation. Install packages required to allow rsyslog to send logs using TLS encryption: sudo yum install rsyslog-gnutls ca-certificates Copy Optional: Configure rsyslog to tail log files and forward their contents to New Relic. Add the following to the /etc/rsyslog.conf file in order to enable its text file input module: $ModLoad imfile $InputFilePollInterval 10 $PrivDropToGroup adm $WorkDirectory /var/spool/rsyslog Copy In the /etc/rsyslog.d/ directory, create a text file named newrelic.conf.

As you apply different filters and time windows, the log patterns adjust to your new target data. Create an alert from a pattern Add the pattern to the query bar and run the query. Then click Create alert condition in the left nav. Troubleshoot log messages that haven't been clustered into a pattern Use the Logs with no pattern tab in the Log patterns UI. Clicking a specific log message will open the log message details panel you're familiar with from the Logs management page. Explore logs with no pattern The Logs with no pattern tab groups all recent log messages in your account that were not clustered into a known pattern yet. These log messages don't represent any problem or flaw in the system; they have no pattern because they are too new to have been processed by the machine learning system. This makes them valuable to explore when you want to understand what has recently changed in your environment. one.newrelic.com > Log management > Log patterns: New Relic's log patterns feature automatically groups logs without a matching pattern. For example: Are any of these logs tied to a recent problem? This is a quick way to discover unique log data that is appearing for the first time in your environment. Does your log data have a new format? Sometimes the logs don't represent a problem, but a new format of log data that deviates from the data model you expect your applications to follow. Catching these logs early gives you the opportunity to ask developers to correct any deviations in their log output. The more consistent people are in the way log data is generated, the easier it becomes to use logs across a diverse set of teams. Masked attributes and wildcards Parts of the log messages in patterns are classified as variables and are substituted by masked attributes. The masking process supports and improves the clustering phase by allowing the algorithm to ignore changing details and focus on the repetitive structure. Masked attributes include: date_time ip url uuid Masked attributes are highlighted and are easy to identify, as shown in the following example. one.newrelic.com > Log management > Log patterns: Here is an example of a pattern that has masked attributes. Log patterns extract other less trivial variables that don't belong to any masked attribute. These variables are indicated as wildcards *. one.newrelic.com > Log management > Log patterns: Here is an example of how wildcards * group variables. Troubleshooting Here are a few reasons why you might have patterns enabled but not see any pattern data. If you're sure none of the items below are true, get help from support.newrelic.com. No data has arrived in the timeframe you're observing. Try expanding the time range you're viewing with the time picker. It's been less than 24 hours since patterns were enabled in the account. This means the ML model may not be generated for the account yet. None of the data coming in has a message field. Patterns will only be generated for values in the message field of a log record. If your logs don't contain message, there will be no data. Put the platform to work with patterns Patterns are a value that is enriched onto the existing log message as a new attribute named newrelic.logPattern. Anything you can do with logs generally can be done with log patterns, such as: Build your own dashboards with patterns, to monitor a specific pattern or group of patterns you care about. Create alerts for patterns by adding NRQL alerts. Use baseline alert conditions to detect anomalies in known log patterns.",

To drill down into additional details, click any highlighted attribute. one.newrelic.com > Logs: Each log's summary provides query options to add, exclude, replace, and more. Query structure Using the Logs UI, you can search through your log data by entering either simple keywords, such as new and relic, or phrases such as new relic agent, directly into the search field. You can also combine keywords or phrases with operators to form more complex queries. Tip Log queries in New Relic are based on the Lucene query language, and any Lucene function listed in this document is supported. (If a Lucene function is not listed, we do not support it.) For some helpful examples, check out this Lucene tutorial. General query rules: Log query rules Comments Case sensitive The query syntax is case sensitive for attributes values. Attribute names are always case sensitive. Exception: Wildcard searches are case insensitive for attribute values. Special characters When a term contains special characters, double-quote the term and escape the special characters using a backslash (\\). This includes special characters such as +, -, &, |, !, (, ), {, }, [, ], ^, \", ~, *, ?, :, /, or \\. Example: To query for \"POST /log/v1 HTTP/1.1\" 202, escape the quotes like this: \"\\\"POST /log/v1 HTTP/1.1\\\" 202\" Wildcard searches You can run wildcard searches using an asterisk (*) to replace zero or more characters. Example: new*relic Search with text To return more specific query results, use text searches to join together keywords or phrases. Text operators The Logs query syntax accepts the following text operators: Condition Text operator example Matching (keyword) Search for log results containing keywords entered separately: \"new\" \"relic\" Exact matching (phrase) Search for log results containing the specific phrase entered: \"new relic agent\" Either / Or Search for log results containing either or both of the keywords entered: new OR relic And Search for log results containing both of the keywords entered: new AND relic * Wildcard (zero or more) Search for log results containing both of the keywords entered, with zero or more characters between them: new*relic Negation (keyword) Search for log results that do not contain the specific keyword entered: -new Negation (phrase) Search for log results that do not contain the specific phrase entered. -\"new relic\" Search with attributes Use attribute searches to narrow the query results to a specific attribute or field. General operators The following operators can be used by all types of attributes: Condition General operator example Equal : Search for log results where the attribute equals the keyword specified. Example: The field hostname equals chi: hostname:chi Does not equal - : Search for log results where the attribute does not equal the keyword specified. Example: The field hostname does not equal chi. -hostname:chi Contains * Search for log results where the attribute contains the specified keyword. Example: The field hostname contains chi. hostname:*chi* Does not contain - * Search for log results where the attribute does not contain the specified keyword. Example: The field hostname does not contain chi. -hostname:*chi* Starts with * Search for log results where the attribute starts with the specified keyword specified. Example: The field hostname starts with chi. hostname:chi* Ends with * Search for log results where the attribute ends with the specified keyword specified. Example: The field hostname ends with chi. hostname:*chi Has Search for log results that have the specified field. Example: Has the field user_name. has:user_name Missing Search for log results that are missing the specified field. Example: Missing the field user_name. missing:user_name Numeric operators The following operators can only be used by numeric attributes: Condition Numeric operator example Greater than Search for log results attribute matches that are greater than the given parameter. Example: The field http_response_time_ms is greater than 500. http_response_time_ms:>500 Greater than or equal to Search for log results with attribute matches that are greater than or equal to the given parameter.

For example: Are any of these logs tied to a recent problem? This is a quick way to discover unique log data that is appearing for the first time in your environment. Does your log data have a new format? Sometimes the logs don't represent a problem, but a new format of log data that deviates from the data model you expect your applications to follow. Catching these logs early gives you the opportunity to ask developers to correct any deviations in their log output. The more consistent people are in the way log data is generated, the easier it becomes to use logs across a diverse set of teams. Masked attributes and wildcards Parts of the log messages in patterns are classified as variables and are substituted by masked attributes. The masking process supports and improves the clustering phase by allowing the algorithm to ignore changing details and focus on the repetitive structure. Masked attributes include: date_time ip url uuid Masked attributes are highlighted and are easy to identify, as shown in the following example. one.newrelic.com > Log management > Log patterns: Here is an example of a pattern that has masked attributes. Log patterns extract other less trivial variables that don't belong to any masked attribute. These variables are indicated as wildcards *. one.newrelic.com > Log management > Log patterns: Here is an example of how wildcards * group variables. Troubleshooting Here are a few reasons why you might have patterns enabled but not see any pattern data. If you're sure none of the items below are true, get help from support.newrelic.com. No data has arrived in the timeframe you're observing. Try expanding the time range you're viewing with the time picker. It's been less than 24 hours since patterns were enabled in the account. This means the ML model may not be generated for the account yet. None of the data coming in has a message field. Patterns will only be generated for values in the message field of a log record. If your logs don't contain message, there will be no data. Put the platform to work with patterns Patterns are a value that is enriched onto the existing log message as a new attribute named newrelic.logPattern. Anything you can do with logs generally can be done with log patterns, such as: Build your own dashboards with patterns, to monitor a specific pattern or group of patterns you care about. Create alerts for patterns by adding NRQL alerts. Use baseline alert conditions to detect anomalies in known log patterns.",

Returns results faster. Accounts can have multiple partitions, and multiple partitions can be queried at the same time. Data partitions also allow data to be mapped to an alternative, or “secondary” namespace with a fixed 30-day retention. This is useful for maintaining compliance with privacy-centric regulations and standards like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Plan your partition Before you start creating partitions, make sure you have the right permissions and a partition plan. Important Logs are routed to partitions during the ingestion process, before data is written to NRDB. Partition rules will not affect logs that were ingested before the rule was created. Required roles and permissions Users require an Admin role to create and modify partition rules. Sizing and organizing a partition You can gain significant performance improvements with proper use of data partitions. Organizing your data into discrete partitions enables you to query them separately or all together. The goals of partitioning your data should be: Create data partitions that align with concepts in your environment or organization that are static or change infrequently (for example, by business unit, team, environment, service, etc.). Ensure each partition remains below 1 TB of daily ingest for optimal performance. Having more partitions allows for more targeted searches, but creating too many partitions can make logs hard to find and increase administrative overhead. Finding the right balance is important. We support 100 partitions maximum per account, but the optimal number for most accounts is 10 to 15 partitions. Choosing a namespace A partition’s namespace determines its retention period. We offer two retention options: Standard: The account’s default retention determined by your New Relic subscription. This is the maximum retention period available in your account and is the namespace you'll select for most of your partitions. Secondary: 30-day retention. All logs sent to a partition that's a member of the Secondary namespace will be purged on a rolling basis 30 days after having been ingested. Secondary retention is not a cost control mechanism; data is billed on ingest. Create partition rules one.newrelic.com > Logs: From the left nav in the Logs UI, select Data partitions, then create a Log_ partition name with the retention namespace, optional description, and matching criteria. To create a new partition rule: Go to one.newrelic.com > Logs. From Manage Data on the left nav of the Logs UI, click Data partitions, then click Create partition rule. Define a Partition name as an alphanumeric string that begins with Log_. Add an optional description. Select the retention namespace for the partition. Set your rule's Matching criteria: Select EQUALS to target logs that match your criteria exactly, or select LIKE to apply a fuzzy match. Click the Enable Rule slider, and click Create. To view a list of data partitions: From Manage Data on the left nav of the Logs UI, click Data partitions. Search data partitions The default partition for all Logs accounts is Log. Any log that is not affected by a partition rule will be stored in the Log partition by default. You can query multiple partitions simultaneously. For best performance, select the smallest number of partitions possible. To search data partitions: From Views and Attributes on the left nav of the Logs UI, click Select partitions. Click one or more partitions you want to query, or search for a partition name. Click Query logs to search your selected partitions. Manage data partitions programatically with NerdGraph If you want to manage your data partitions programatically, you can use NerdGraph, our graphQL API, to do so.

Tip To use log management and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Why New Relic for log management? As applications move towards the cloud, microservices architecture is becoming more dispersed, making the ability to monitor logs essential. Log management provides deeper visibility into application and infrastructure performance data (events and errors) to reduce mean-time-to-resolve (MTTR) and quickly troubleshoot production incidents. It does this by providing super-fast searching capabilities, alerts, and co-location of application, infrastructure, and log data, while visualizing everything from a single pane of glass. Log management features Log management provides a way to connect your log data with the rest of your application and infrastructure data, allowing you to get to the root cause of problems quickly, without losing context switching between tools. Log management's features include: Instantly search through your logs. Visualize your log data directly from the Logs UI. Use logging data to create custom charts, dashboards, and alerts. Troubleshoot performance issues without switching between tools. Bring in your logging data You can bring your log data into New Relic using a compatible log forwarding plugin, or with OpenTelemetry. Forward your logs using our Infrastructure agent or our Kubernetes plugin. Use our plugins for well-known log forwarders, like Fluentd, Fluent Bit, and Logstash. Stream or ship your logs from Amazon using AWS Lambda or Kinesis. Send your logs data using the Logs API. Once log management is enabled, you can also connect your logs with your APM agent, Kubernetes clusters, or distributed tracing to get additional contextual logging data with our logs in context extensions. View your logging data in New Relic Logging data can be found in these locations: In our Logs UI: Logs UI for US Logs UI for EU By querying the Log data type. For example, you can use NRQL to run: SELECT * FROM Log Copy For information on querying in general, see Query your data.",

To drill down into additional details, click any highlighted attribute. one.newrelic.com > Logs: Each log's summary provides query options to add, exclude, replace, and more. Query structure Using the Logs UI, you can search through your log data by entering either simple keywords, such as new and relic, or phrases such as new relic agent, directly into the search field. You can also combine keywords or phrases with operators to form more complex queries. Tip Log queries in New Relic are based on the Lucene query language, and any Lucene function listed in this document is supported. (If a Lucene function is not listed, we do not support it.) For some helpful examples, check out this Lucene tutorial. General query rules: Log query rules Comments Case sensitive The query syntax is case sensitive for attributes values. Attribute names are always case sensitive. Exception: Wildcard searches are case insensitive for attribute values. Special characters When a term contains special characters, double-quote the term and escape the special characters using a backslash (\\). This includes special characters such as +, -, &, |, !, (, ), {, }, [, ], ^, \", ~, *, ?, :, /, or \\. Example: To query for \"POST /log/v1 HTTP/1.1\" 202, escape the quotes like this: \"\\\"POST /log/v1 HTTP/1.1\\\" 202\" Wildcard searches You can run wildcard searches using an asterisk (*) to replace zero or more characters. Example: new*relic Search with text To return more specific query results, use text searches to join together keywords or phrases. Text operators The Logs query syntax accepts the following text operators: Condition Text operator example Matching (keyword) Search for log results containing keywords entered separately: \"new\" \"relic\" Exact matching (phrase) Search for log results containing the specific phrase entered: \"new relic agent\" Either / Or Search for log results containing either or both of the keywords entered: new OR relic And Search for log results containing both of the keywords entered: new AND relic * Wildcard (zero or more) Search for log results containing both of the keywords entered, with zero or more characters between them: new*relic Negation (keyword) Search for log results that do not contain the specific keyword entered: -new Negation (phrase) Search for log results that do not contain the specific phrase entered. -\"new relic\" Search with attributes Use attribute searches to narrow the query results to a specific attribute or field. General operators The following operators can be used by all types of attributes: Condition General operator example Equal : Search for log results where the attribute equals the keyword specified. Example: The field hostname equals chi: hostname:chi Does not equal - : Search for log results where the attribute does not equal the keyword specified. Example: The field hostname does not equal chi. -hostname:chi Contains * Search for log results where the attribute contains the specified keyword. Example: The field hostname contains chi. hostname:*chi* Does not contain - * Search for log results where the attribute does not contain the specified keyword. Example: The field hostname does not contain chi. -hostname:*chi* Starts with * Search for log results where the attribute starts with the specified keyword specified. Example: The field hostname starts with chi. hostname:chi* Ends with * Search for log results where the attribute ends with the specified keyword specified. Example: The field hostname ends with chi. hostname:*chi Has Search for log results that have the specified field. Example: Has the field user_name. has:user_name Missing Search for log results that are missing the specified field. Example: Missing the field user_name. missing:user_name Numeric operators The following operators can only be used by numeric attributes: Condition Numeric operator example Greater than Search for log results attribute matches that are greater than the given parameter. Example: The field http_response_time_ms is greater than 500. http_response_time_ms:>500 Greater than or equal to Search for log results with attribute matches that are greater than or equal to the given parameter.

      "body": "Log patterns are the fastest way to discover value in log data without searching. Log data is high volume telemetry with a low value per individual record. Searching can quickly lead to logs that provide a root cause explanation, but most data is repetitive and hard to contextualize when browsing. Patterns can make log data discoverable without spending a lot of time reading through low value data. one.newrelic.com > Logs > Patterns: Use patterns as the basis for alerts when the frequency of important data changes, or for configuring drop rules to get rid of unnecessary repetitive data. Technical overview Log patterns functionality applies machine learning to normalize and group log messages that are consistent in format but variable in content. These grouped messages can be sorted, making it easy to find the most frequent or rarest sets of logs in your environment. Use patterns as the basis for alerts when the frequency of important data changes, or to configure drop rules to get rid of unnecessary repetitive data. Log patterns use advanced clustering algorithms to group together similar log messages automatically. With patterns, you can: Orient more quickly through millions of logs. Reduce the time it takes to identify unusual behavior in your log estate. Monitor the frequency of known patterns over time to focus your energy on what matters, and exclude what's irrelevant. Availability Important Log patterns are not available in the EU region. The ability to configure this feature is dependent on role-based permissions. If you see Patterns are turned off in your Log management Patterns UI, click the Configure Patterns button and enable it. If you don't see patterns within 30 minutes of enabling the feature, there may be a lack of data with a message attribute for the system to create a pattern from. Log patterns Limitations and considerations Pricing There is no separate pricing for log patterns. The only cost is for additional data generated and added to your log records. A pattern attribute will be added to all logs that match a pattern. Attributes also may be added when common values are discovered, such as GUIDs, IP addresses, URL, or email addresses. These attributes are automatically extracted from the log message as part of the pattern process. HITRUST accounts The log patterns feature is not FedRAMP compliant. FedRAMP or other HITRUST accounts are not eligible to use patterns. Regional availability Availability for this feature depends on whether you have a US or EU region account: US region accounts can use log patterns. EU region accounts cannot enable log patterns at this time. Parsing limits We have a system of safety limits on memory and CPU resources when processing logs and their patterns. These parsing limits can have an impact on the data you get. For more information, see our documentation about parsing limits. Get started To start examining patterns: Go to one.newrelic.com > Log management, and use the account picker dropdown to select the target account where you want to explore patterns. In the left navigation of the Log management UI, click Patterns. The main log UI changes to show patterns that match the query in the query bar. one.newrelic.com > Log management > Log patterns: The line chart shows the top 5 patterns over time. Use the time picker and query bar to adjust the results. Explore log patterns By default the log patterns UI first shows the most frequent occurrence of patterns. To sort to show the rarest patterns first, click the Count column. You can also use the query bar or attributes bar to filter your log patterns. If you want to... Do this... Understand the rate of change in patterns Look at the line chart. The color-coded patterns correspond to the plot column in the table. You can toggle individual plot patterns to narrow your focus. See the individual log messages that match each pattern Click pattern to expand the row and see a table of individual log records. To see additional records, scroll up or down. To explore an individual log in more detail, click it to open the details panel. Group and filter patterns by their attributes Use the query bar and time picker. As you apply different filters and time windows, the log patterns adjust to your new target data. Create an alert from a pattern Add the pattern to the query bar and run the query. Then click Create alert condition in the left nav. Troubleshoot log messages that haven't been clustered into a pattern Use the Logs with no pattern tab in the Log patterns UI. Clicking a specific log message will open the log message details panel you're familiar with from the Logs management page. Explore logs with no pattern The Logs with no pattern tab groups all recent log messages in your account that were not clustered into a known pattern yet. These log messages don't represent any problem or flaw in the system; they have no pattern because they are too new to have been processed by the machine learning system. This makes them valuable to explore when you want to understand what has recently changed in your environment. one.newrelic.com > Log management > Log patterns: New Relic's log patterns feature automatically groups logs without a matching pattern. For example: Are any of these logs tied to a recent problem? This is a quick way to discover unique log data that is appearing for the first time in your environment. Does your log data have a new format? Sometimes the logs don't represent a problem, but a new format of log data that deviates from the data model you expect your applications to follow. Catching these logs early gives you the opportunity to ask developers to correct any deviations in their log output. The more consistent people are in the way log data is generated, the easier it becomes to use logs across a diverse set of teams. Masked attributes and wildcards Parts of the log messages in patterns are classified as variables and are substituted by masked attributes. The masking process supports and improves the clustering phase by allowing the algorithm to ignore changing details and focus on the repetitive structure. Masked attributes include: date_time ip url uuid Masked attributes are highlighted and are easy to identify, as shown in the following example. one.newrelic.com > Log management > Log patterns: Here is an example of a pattern that has masked attributes. Log patterns extract other less trivial variables that don't belong to any masked attribute. These variables are indicated as wildcards *. one.newrelic.com > Log management > Log patterns: Here is an example of how wildcards * group variables. Troubleshooting Here are a few reasons why you might have patterns enabled but not see any pattern data. If you're sure none of the items below are true, get help from support.newrelic.com. No data has arrived in the timeframe you're observing. Try expanding the time range you're viewing with the time picker. It's been less than 24 hours since patterns were enabled in the account. This means the ML model may not be generated for the account yet. None of the data coming in has a message field. Patterns will only be generated for values in the message field of a log record. If your logs don't contain message, there will be no data. Put the platform to work with patterns Patterns are a value that is enriched onto the existing log message as a new attribute named newrelic.logPattern. Anything you can do with logs generally can be done with log patterns, such as: Build your own dashboards with patterns, to monitor a specific pattern or group of patterns you care about. Create alerts for patterns by adding NRQL alerts. Use baseline alert conditions to detect anomalies in known log patterns.",

To drill down into additional details, click any highlighted attribute. one.newrelic.com > Logs: Each log's summary provides query options to add, exclude, replace, and more. Query structure Using the Logs UI, you can search through your log data by entering either simple keywords, such as new and relic, or phrases such as new relic agent, directly into the search field. You can also combine keywords or phrases with operators to form more complex queries. Tip Log queries in New Relic are based on the Lucene query language, and any Lucene function listed in this document is supported. (If a Lucene function is not listed, we do not support it.) For some helpful examples, check out this Lucene tutorial. General query rules: Log query rules Comments Case sensitive The query syntax is case sensitive for attributes values. Attribute names are always case sensitive. Exception: Wildcard searches are case insensitive for attribute values. Special characters When a term contains special characters, double-quote the term and escape the special characters using a backslash (\\). This includes special characters such as +, -, &, |, !, (, ), {, }, [, ], ^, \", ~, *, ?, :, /, or \\. Example: To query for \"POST /log/v1 HTTP/1.1\" 202, escape the quotes like this: \"\\\"POST /log/v1 HTTP/1.1\\\" 202\" Wildcard searches You can run wildcard searches using an asterisk (*) to replace zero or more characters. Example: new*relic Search with text To return more specific query results, use text searches to join together keywords or phrases. Text operators The Logs query syntax accepts the following text operators: Condition Text operator example Matching (keyword) Search for log results containing keywords entered separately: \"new\" \"relic\" Exact matching (phrase) Search for log results containing the specific phrase entered: \"new relic agent\" Either / Or Search for log results containing either or both of the keywords entered: new OR relic And Search for log results containing both of the keywords entered: new AND relic * Wildcard (zero or more) Search for log results containing both of the keywords entered, with zero or more characters between them: new*relic Negation (keyword) Search for log results that do not contain the specific keyword entered: -new Negation (phrase) Search for log results that do not contain the specific phrase entered. -\"new relic\" Search with attributes Use attribute searches to narrow the query results to a specific attribute or field. General operators The following operators can be used by all types of attributes: Condition General operator example Equal : Search for log results where the attribute equals the keyword specified. Example: The field hostname equals chi: hostname:chi Does not equal - : Search for log results where the attribute does not equal the keyword specified. Example: The field hostname does not equal chi. -hostname:chi Contains * Search for log results where the attribute contains the specified keyword. Example: The field hostname contains chi. hostname:*chi* Does not contain - * Search for log results where the attribute does not contain the specified keyword. Example: The field hostname does not contain chi. -hostname:*chi* Starts with * Search for log results where the attribute starts with the specified keyword specified. Example: The field hostname starts with chi. hostname:chi* Ends with * Search for log results where the attribute ends with the specified keyword specified. Example: The field hostname ends with chi. hostname:*chi Has Search for log results that have the specified field. Example: Has the field user_name. has:user_name Missing Search for log results that are missing the specified field. Example: Missing the field user_name. missing:user_name Numeric operators The following operators can only be used by numeric attributes: Condition Numeric operator example Greater than Search for log results attribute matches that are greater than the given parameter. Example: The field http_response_time_ms is greater than 500. http_response_time_ms:>500 Greater than or equal to Search for log results with attribute matches that are greater than or equal to the given parameter.

      "body": "Log patterns are the fastest way to discover value in log data without searching. Log data is high volume telemetry with a low value per individual record. Searching can quickly lead to logs that provide a root cause explanation, but most data is repetitive and hard to contextualize when browsing. Patterns can make log data discoverable without spending a lot of time reading through low value data. one.newrelic.com > Logs > Patterns: Use patterns as the basis for alerts when the frequency of important data changes, or for configuring drop rules to get rid of unnecessary repetitive data. Technical overview Log patterns functionality applies machine learning to normalize and group log messages that are consistent in format but variable in content. These grouped messages can be sorted, making it easy to find the most frequent or rarest sets of logs in your environment. Use patterns as the basis for alerts when the frequency of important data changes, or to configure drop rules to get rid of unnecessary repetitive data. Log patterns use advanced clustering algorithms to group together similar log messages automatically. With patterns, you can: Orient more quickly through millions of logs. Reduce the time it takes to identify unusual behavior in your log estate. Monitor the frequency of known patterns over time to focus your energy on what matters, and exclude what's irrelevant. Availability Important Log patterns are not available in the EU region. The ability to configure this feature is dependent on role-based permissions. If you see Patterns are turned off in your Log management Patterns UI, click the Configure Patterns button and enable it. If you don't see patterns within 30 minutes of enabling the feature, there may be a lack of data with a message attribute for the system to create a pattern from. Log patterns Limitations and considerations Pricing There is no separate pricing for log patterns. The only cost is for additional data generated and added to your log records. A pattern attribute will be added to all logs that match a pattern. Attributes also may be added when common values are discovered, such as GUIDs, IP addresses, URL, or email addresses. These attributes are automatically extracted from the log message as part of the pattern process. HITRUST accounts The log patterns feature is not FedRAMP compliant. FedRAMP or other HITRUST accounts are not eligible to use patterns. Regional availability Availability for this feature depends on whether you have a US or EU region account: US region accounts can use log patterns. EU region accounts cannot enable log patterns at this time. Parsing limits We have a system of safety limits on memory and CPU resources when processing logs and their patterns. These parsing limits can have an impact on the data you get. For more information, see our documentation about parsing limits. Get started To start examining patterns: Go to one.newrelic.com > Log management, and use the account picker dropdown to select the target account where you want to explore patterns. In the left navigation of the Log management UI, click Patterns. The main log UI changes to show patterns that match the query in the query bar. one.newrelic.com > Log management > Log patterns: The line chart shows the top 5 patterns over time. Use the time picker and query bar to adjust the results. Explore log patterns By default the log patterns UI first shows the most frequent occurrence of patterns. To sort to show the rarest patterns first, click the Count column. You can also use the query bar or attributes bar to filter your log patterns. If you want to... Do this... Understand the rate of change in patterns Look at the line chart. The color-coded patterns correspond to the plot column in the table. You can toggle individual plot patterns to narrow your focus. See the individual log messages that match each pattern Click pattern to expand the row and see a table of individual log records. To see additional records, scroll up or down. To explore an individual log in more detail, click it to open the details panel. Group and filter patterns by their attributes Use the query bar and time picker. As you apply different filters and time windows, the log patterns adjust to your new target data. Create an alert from a pattern Add the pattern to the query bar and run the query. Then click Create alert condition in the left nav. Troubleshoot log messages that haven't been clustered into a pattern Use the Logs with no pattern tab in the Log patterns UI. Clicking a specific log message will open the log message details panel you're familiar with from the Logs management page. Explore logs with no pattern The Logs with no pattern tab groups all recent log messages in your account that were not clustered into a known pattern yet. These log messages don't represent any problem or flaw in the system; they have no pattern because they are too new to have been processed by the machine learning system. This makes them valuable to explore when you want to understand what has recently changed in your environment. one.newrelic.com > Log management > Log patterns: New Relic's log patterns feature automatically groups logs without a matching pattern. For example: Are any of these logs tied to a recent problem? This is a quick way to discover unique log data that is appearing for the first time in your environment. Does your log data have a new format? Sometimes the logs don't represent a problem, but a new format of log data that deviates from the data model you expect your applications to follow. Catching these logs early gives you the opportunity to ask developers to correct any deviations in their log output. The more consistent people are in the way log data is generated, the easier it becomes to use logs across a diverse set of teams. Masked attributes and wildcards Parts of the log messages in patterns are classified as variables and are substituted by masked attributes. The masking process supports and improves the clustering phase by allowing the algorithm to ignore changing details and focus on the repetitive structure. Masked attributes include: date_time ip url uuid Masked attributes are highlighted and are easy to identify, as shown in the following example. one.newrelic.com > Log management > Log patterns: Here is an example of a pattern that has masked attributes. Log patterns extract other less trivial variables that don't belong to any masked attribute. These variables are indicated as wildcards *. one.newrelic.com > Log management > Log patterns: Here is an example of how wildcards * group variables. Troubleshooting Here are a few reasons why you might have patterns enabled but not see any pattern data. If you're sure none of the items below are true, get help from support.newrelic.com. No data has arrived in the timeframe you're observing. Try expanding the time range you're viewing with the time picker. It's been less than 24 hours since patterns were enabled in the account. This means the ML model may not be generated for the account yet. None of the data coming in has a message field. Patterns will only be generated for values in the message field of a log record. If your logs don't contain message, there will be no data. Put the platform to work with patterns Patterns are a value that is enriched onto the existing log message as a new attribute named newrelic.logPattern. Anything you can do with logs generally can be done with log patterns, such as: Build your own dashboards with patterns, to monitor a specific pattern or group of patterns you care about. Create alerts for patterns by adding NRQL alerts. Use baseline alert conditions to detect anomalies in known log patterns.",

No Any attributes that are common to all log messages \"logs\" Array See logs. Yes Array with the log entries Limits and restricted characters Caution Avoid calling our API from within the code of a customer-facing application. This could cause performance issues or be blocking if response time is slow. If you must do this, try to do it asynchronously. Restrictions on logs sent to the Log API: Payload total size: 1MB(10^6 bytes) maximum per POST. We highly recommend using compression. The payload must be encoded as UTF-8. Number of attributes per event: 255 maximum Length of attribute name: 255 characters Length of attribute value: 4096 maximum character length Some specific attributes have additional restrictions: accountId: This is a reserved attribute name. If it is included, it will be dropped during ingest. entity.guid, entity.name, and entity.type: These attributes are used internally to identify entities. Any values submitted with these keys in the attributes section of a metric data point may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. For more information please refer to Entity synthesis. appId: Value must be an integer. If it is not an integer, the attribute name and value will be dropped during ingest. eventType: Can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, _ underscores, and : colons. timestamp: Must be a Unix epoch timestamp. You can define timestamps either in seconds or in milliseconds. Rate limits on logs sent to the Log API: Maximum rate for HTTP requests sent to the Log API: 300,000 requests per minute Maximum rate of uncompressed Log JSON bytes sent to the Log API: 10 GB per minute Rate limit violations Exceeding rate limits affects how the Log API behaves. Follow these instructions if this happens. HTTP requests per minute When the maximum request rate limit is exceeded for an account, the New Relic Log API returns a 429 response for the remainder of the minute. This response includes a Retry-After header indicating how long to wait in seconds before resubmitting or sending new data. To resolve this issue, either reduce the number of data points you are sending, or request a rate limit change. Subsequent subscription changes do not impact modified rate limits. If an account change impacts your rate limit, you must notify us to adjust your rate limit. To request rate limit changes, contact your New Relic account representative, or visit our Support portal. JSON bytes per minute When the maximum Log JSON byte limit is exceeded for an account, the New Relic Log API returns a 429 response for the remainder of the minute. This response includes a Retry-After header indicating how long to wait in seconds before resubmitting or sending new data. To resolve this issue, try to reduce the amount of log data you are sending, or spread it out over a larger period of time. To request rate limit changes, contact your New Relic account representative, or visit our Support portal. Log payload format We accept any valid JSON payload. The payload must encoded as UTF-8. Important Log management does not support white space in attribute names. For example, {\"Sample Attribute\": \"Value\"} would cause errors. JSON message attributes Common block attributes This is a block containing attributes that will be common to all log entries in logs: Field Value type Format Required Notes \"timestamp\" Integer Milliseconds or seconds since epoch No Message timestamp default to ingest time \"attributes\" Object JSON No This sub-object contains all other attributes of the message Logs block attributes This is an array containing log entries with the following format: Field Value type Format Required Notes \"timestamp\" Integer Milliseconds or seconds since epoch No Message timestamp default to ingest time \"attributes\" Object JSON No This sub-object contains all other attributes of the message \"message\" String (any string) Yes This is the main log message field that is searched by default \"log\" String (any string) No We will rewrite this string as the field message on ingest \"LOG\" String (any string) No We will rewrite this string as the field message on ingest \"MESSAGE\" String (any string) No We will rewrite this string as the field message on ingest JSON message attribute parsing This will attempt to parse any message attribute as JSON. If the message attribute is JSON, it will be parsed and the resultant JSON attributes will be added to the event. If the message attribute is not JSON, it is left as is. For example, the event: { \"timestamp\": 1562767499238, \"message\": \"{\\\"service-name\\\": \\\"login-service\\\", \\\"user\\\": {\\\"id\\\": 123, \\\"name\\\": \\\"alice\\\"}}\" } Copy Will be treated as: { \"timestamp\": 1562767499238, \"message\": \"{\\\"service-name\\\": \\\"my-service\\\", \\\"user\\\": {\\\"id\\\": 123, \\\"name\\\": \\\"alice\\\"}}\", \"service-name\": \"login-service\", \"user\": { \"id\": 123, \"name\": \"alice\" } } Copy Important Log management does not support white space in attribute names. For example, {\"Sample Attribute\": \"Value\"} would cause errors. Log JSON example Attributes may be scalar JSON types like string and number, but may also be compound (or nested) objects. Compound attributes will have their leaf attributes stored with flattened names. For instance, a compound user attribute in a log entry's attributes: \"attributes\": { \"action\": \"login\", \"user\": { \"id\": 123, \"name\": \"alice\" } } Copy will result in the following attributes being stored with the log event: Attribute Value \"action\" \"login\" \"user.id\" 123 \"user.name\" \"alice\" Log POST example Log POST message example: POST /log/v1 HTTP/1.1 Host: log-api.newrelic.com Content-Type: application/json X-License-Key: <YOUR_LICENSE_KEY> Accept: */* Content-Length: 319 [{ \"common\": { \"attributes\": { \"logtype\": \"accesslogs\", \"service\": \"login-service\", \"hostname\": \"login.example.com\" } }, \"logs\": [{ \"timestamp\": <TIMESTAMP_IN_UNIX_EPOCH>, \"message\": \"User 'xyz' logged in\" },{ \"timestamp\": <TIMESTAMP_IN_UNIX_EPOCH>, \"message\": \"User 'xyz' logged out\", \"attributes\": { \"auditId\": 123 } }] }] Copy The above POST message would result in the following log messages being stored in Log management: Example of stored common block attributes: Attribute Value \"logtype\" \"accesslogs\" \"service\" \"login-service\" \"hostname\" \"login.example.com\" Example of stored logs block attributes example: Attribute Value \"timestamp\" 1550086450124 \"message\" \"User 'xyz' logged out\" \"auditId\" 123 HTTP endpoint Once configured, your JSON data can be sent to the following endpoint in a POST request: United States (US) endpoint: https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 Copy European Union (EU) endpoint: https://log-api.eu.newrelic.com/log/v1 Copy Here's an example of a JSON POST request: POST /log/v1 HTTP/1.1 Host: log-api.newrelic.com Content-Type: application/json X-License-Key: <YOUR_LICENSE_KEY> Accept: */* Content-Length: 133 { \"timestamp\": <TIMESTAMP_IN_UNIX_EPOCH>, \"message\": \"User 'xyz' logged in\", \"logtype\": \"accesslogs\", \"service\": \"login-service\", \"hostname\": \"login.example.com\" } Copy Find log data For where to find data sent via the Log API (including from integrations that use that API), see Find log data.

      "body": "Log patterns are the fastest way to discover value in log data without searching. Log data is high volume telemetry with a low value per individual record. Searching can quickly lead to logs that provide a root cause explanation, but most data is repetitive and hard to contextualize when browsing. Patterns can make log data discoverable without spending a lot of time reading through low value data. one.newrelic.com > Logs > Patterns: Use patterns as the basis for alerts when the frequency of important data changes, or for configuring drop rules to get rid of unnecessary repetitive data. Technical overview Log patterns functionality applies machine learning to normalize and group log messages that are consistent in format but variable in content. These grouped messages can be sorted, making it easy to find the most frequent or rarest sets of logs in your environment. Use patterns as the basis for alerts when the frequency of important data changes, or to configure drop rules to get rid of unnecessary repetitive data. Log patterns use advanced clustering algorithms to group together similar log messages automatically. With patterns, you can: Orient more quickly through millions of logs. Reduce the time it takes to identify unusual behavior in your log estate. Monitor the frequency of known patterns over time to focus your energy on what matters, and exclude what's irrelevant. Availability Important Log patterns are not available in the EU region. The ability to configure this feature is dependent on role-based permissions. If you see Patterns are turned off in your Log management Patterns UI, click the Configure Patterns button and enable it. If you don't see patterns within 30 minutes of enabling the feature, there may be a lack of data with a message attribute for the system to create a pattern from. Log patterns Limitations and considerations Pricing There is no separate pricing for log patterns. The only cost is for additional data generated and added to your log records. A pattern attribute will be added to all logs that match a pattern. Attributes also may be added when common values are discovered, such as GUIDs, IP addresses, URL, or email addresses. These attributes are automatically extracted from the log message as part of the pattern process. HITRUST accounts The log patterns feature is not FedRAMP compliant. FedRAMP or other HITRUST accounts are not eligible to use patterns. Regional availability Availability for this feature depends on whether you have a US or EU region account: US region accounts can use log patterns. EU region accounts cannot enable log patterns at this time. Parsing limits We have a system of safety limits on memory and CPU resources when processing logs and their patterns. These parsing limits can have an impact on the data you get. For more information, see our documentation about parsing limits. Get started To start examining patterns: Go to one.newrelic.com > Log management, and use the account picker dropdown to select the target account where you want to explore patterns. In the left navigation of the Log management UI, click Patterns. The main log UI changes to show patterns that match the query in the query bar. one.newrelic.com > Log management > Log patterns: The line chart shows the top 5 patterns over time. Use the time picker and query bar to adjust the results. Explore log patterns By default the log patterns UI first shows the most frequent occurrence of patterns. To sort to show the rarest patterns first, click the Count column. You can also use the query bar or attributes bar to filter your log patterns. If you want to... Do this... Understand the rate of change in patterns Look at the line chart. The color-coded patterns correspond to the plot column in the table. You can toggle individual plot patterns to narrow your focus. See the individual log messages that match each pattern Click pattern to expand the row and see a table of individual log records. To see additional records, scroll up or down. To explore an individual log in more detail, click it to open the details panel. Group and filter patterns by their attributes Use the query bar and time picker. As you apply different filters and time windows, the log patterns adjust to your new target data. Create an alert from a pattern Add the pattern to the query bar and run the query. Then click Create alert condition in the left nav. Troubleshoot log messages that haven't been clustered into a pattern Use the Logs with no pattern tab in the Log patterns UI. Clicking a specific log message will open the log message details panel you're familiar with from the Logs management page. Explore logs with no pattern The Logs with no pattern tab groups all recent log messages in your account that were not clustered into a known pattern yet. These log messages don't represent any problem or flaw in the system; they have no pattern because they are too new to have been processed by the machine learning system. This makes them valuable to explore when you want to understand what has recently changed in your environment. one.newrelic.com > Log management > Log patterns: New Relic's log patterns feature automatically groups logs without a matching pattern. For example: Are any of these logs tied to a recent problem? This is a quick way to discover unique log data that is appearing for the first time in your environment. Does your log data have a new format? Sometimes the logs don't represent a problem, but a new format of log data that deviates from the data model you expect your applications to follow. Catching these logs early gives you the opportunity to ask developers to correct any deviations in their log output. The more consistent people are in the way log data is generated, the easier it becomes to use logs across a diverse set of teams. Masked attributes and wildcards Parts of the log messages in patterns are classified as variables and are substituted by masked attributes. The masking process supports and improves the clustering phase by allowing the algorithm to ignore changing details and focus on the repetitive structure. Masked attributes include: date_time ip url uuid Masked attributes are highlighted and are easy to identify, as shown in the following example. one.newrelic.com > Log management > Log patterns: Here is an example of a pattern that has masked attributes. Log patterns extract other less trivial variables that don't belong to any masked attribute. These variables are indicated as wildcards *. one.newrelic.com > Log management > Log patterns: Here is an example of how wildcards * group variables. Troubleshooting Here are a few reasons why you might have patterns enabled but not see any pattern data. If you're sure none of the items below are true, get help from support.newrelic.com. No data has arrived in the timeframe you're observing. Try expanding the time range you're viewing with the time picker. It's been less than 24 hours since patterns were enabled in the account. This means the ML model may not be generated for the account yet. None of the data coming in has a message field. Patterns will only be generated for values in the message field of a log record. If your logs don't contain message, there will be no data. Put the platform to work with patterns Patterns are a value that is enriched onto the existing log message as a new attribute named newrelic.logPattern. Anything you can do with logs generally can be done with log patterns, such as: Build your own dashboards with patterns, to monitor a specific pattern or group of patterns you care about. Create alerts for patterns by adding NRQL alerts. Use baseline alert conditions to detect anomalies in known log patterns.",

Searching can quickly lead to logs that provide a root cause explanation, but most data is repetitive and hard to contextualize when browsing. Patterns can make log data discoverable without spending a lot of time reading through low value data. one.newrelic.com > Logs > Patterns: Use patterns as the basis for alerts when the frequency of important data changes, or for configuring drop rules to get rid of unnecessary repetitive data. Technical overview Log patterns functionality applies machine learning to normalize and group log messages that are consistent in format but variable in content. These grouped messages can be sorted, making it easy to find the most frequent or rarest sets of logs in your environment. Use patterns as the basis for alerts when the frequency of important data changes, or to configure drop rules to get rid of unnecessary repetitive data. Log patterns use advanced clustering algorithms to group together similar log messages automatically. With patterns, you can: Orient more quickly through millions of logs. Reduce the time it takes to identify unusual behavior in your log estate. Monitor the frequency of known patterns over time to focus your energy on what matters, and exclude what's irrelevant. Availability Important Log patterns are not available in the EU region. The ability to configure this feature is dependent on role-based permissions. If you see Patterns are turned off in your Log management Patterns UI, click the Configure Patterns button and enable it. If you don't see patterns within 30 minutes of enabling the feature, there may be a lack of data with a message attribute for the system to create a pattern from. Log patterns Limitations and considerations Pricing There is no separate pricing for log patterns. The only cost is for additional data generated and added to your log records. A pattern attribute will be added to all logs that match a pattern. Attributes also may be added when common values are discovered, such as GUIDs, IP addresses, URL, or email addresses. These attributes are automatically extracted from the log message as part of the pattern process. HITRUST accounts The log patterns feature is not FedRAMP compliant. FedRAMP or other HITRUST accounts are not eligible to use patterns. Regional availability Availability for this feature depends on whether you have a US or EU region account: US region accounts can use log patterns. EU region accounts cannot enable log patterns at this time. Parsing limits We have a system of safety limits on memory and CPU resources when processing logs and their patterns. These parsing limits can have an impact on the data you get. For more information, see our documentation about parsing limits. Get started To start examining patterns: Go to one.newrelic.com > Log management, and use the account picker dropdown to select the target account where you want to explore patterns. In the left navigation of the Log management UI, click Patterns. The main log UI changes to show patterns that match the query in the query bar. one.newrelic.com > Log management > Log patterns: The line chart shows the top 5 patterns over time. Use the time picker and query bar to adjust the results. Explore log patterns By default the log patterns UI first shows the most frequent occurrence of patterns. To sort to show the rarest patterns first, click the Count column. You can also use the query bar or attributes bar to filter your log patterns. If you want to... Do this... Understand the rate of change in patterns Look at the line chart. The color-coded patterns correspond to the plot column in the table. You can toggle individual plot patterns to narrow your focus. See the individual log messages that match each pattern Click pattern to expand the row and see a table of individual log records. To see additional records, scroll up or down. To explore an individual log in more detail, click it to open the details panel. Group and filter patterns by their attributes Use the query bar and time picker. As you apply different filters and time windows, the log patterns adjust to your new target data. Create an alert from a pattern Add the pattern to the query bar and run the query. Then click Create alert condition in the left nav. Troubleshoot log messages that haven't been clustered into a pattern Use the Logs with no pattern tab in the Log patterns UI. Clicking a specific log message will open the log message details panel you're familiar with from the Logs management page. Explore logs with no pattern The Logs with no pattern tab groups all recent log messages in your account that were not clustered into a known pattern yet. These log messages don't represent any problem or flaw in the system; they have no pattern because they are too new to have been processed by the machine learning system. This makes them valuable to explore when you want to understand what has recently changed in your environment. one.newrelic.com > Log management > Log patterns: New Relic's log patterns feature automatically groups logs without a matching pattern. For example: Are any of these logs tied to a recent problem? This is a quick way to discover unique log data that is appearing for the first time in your environment. Does your log data have a new format? Sometimes the logs don't represent a problem, but a new format of log data that deviates from the data model you expect your applications to follow. Catching these logs early gives you the opportunity to ask developers to correct any deviations in their log output. The more consistent people are in the way log data is generated, the easier it becomes to use logs across a diverse set of teams. Masked attributes and wildcards Parts of the log messages in patterns are classified as variables and are substituted by masked attributes. The masking process supports and improves the clustering phase by allowing the algorithm to ignore changing details and focus on the repetitive structure. Masked attributes include: date_time ip url uuid Masked attributes are highlighted and are easy to identify, as shown in the following example. one.newrelic.com > Log management > Log patterns: Here is an example of a pattern that has masked attributes. Log patterns extract other less trivial variables that don't belong to any masked attribute. These variables are indicated as wildcards *. one.newrelic.com > Log management > Log patterns: Here is an example of how wildcards * group variables. Troubleshooting Here are a few reasons why you might have patterns enabled but not see any pattern data. If you're sure none of the items below are true, get help from support.newrelic.com. No data has arrived in the timeframe you're observing. Try expanding the time range you're viewing with the time picker. It's been less than 24 hours since patterns were enabled in the account. This means the ML model may not be generated for the account yet. None of the data coming in has a message field. Patterns will only be generated for values in the message field of a log record. If your logs don't contain message, there will be no data. Put the platform to work with patterns Patterns are a value that is enriched onto the existing log message as a new attribute named newrelic.logPattern. Anything you can do with logs generally can be done with log patterns, such as: Build your own dashboards with patterns, to monitor a specific pattern or group of patterns you care about. Create alerts for patterns by adding NRQL alerts. Use baseline alert conditions to detect anomalies in known log patterns.",

      "body": "Data partitions are a way to group or organize log data for faster and more efficient querying. When a query targets a single partition, New Relic Logs: Scans less unrelated data. Returns results faster. Accounts can have multiple partitions, and multiple partitions can be queried at the same time. Data partitions also allow data to be mapped to an alternative, or “secondary” namespace with a fixed 30-day retention. This is useful for maintaining compliance with privacy-centric regulations and standards like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Plan your partition Before you start creating partitions, make sure you have the right permissions and a partition plan. Important Logs are routed to partitions during the ingestion process, before data is written to NRDB. Partition rules will not affect logs that were ingested before the rule was created. Required roles and permissions Users require an Admin role to create and modify partition rules. Sizing and organizing a partition You can gain significant performance improvements with proper use of data partitions. Organizing your data into discrete partitions enables you to query them separately or all together. The goals of partitioning your data should be: Create data partitions that align with concepts in your environment or organization that are static or change infrequently (for example, by business unit, team, environment, service, etc.). Ensure each partition remains below 1 TB of daily ingest for optimal performance. Having more partitions allows for more targeted searches, but creating too many partitions can make logs hard to find and increase administrative overhead. Finding the right balance is important. We support 100 partitions maximum per account, but the optimal number for most accounts is 10 to 15 partitions. Choosing a namespace A partition’s namespace determines its retention period. We offer two retention options: Standard: The account’s default retention determined by your New Relic subscription. This is the maximum retention period available in your account and is the namespace you'll select for most of your partitions. Secondary: 30-day retention. All logs sent to a partition that's a member of the Secondary namespace will be purged on a rolling basis 30 days after having been ingested. Secondary retention is not a cost control mechanism; data is billed on ingest. Create partition rules one.newrelic.com > Logs: From the left nav in the Logs UI, select Data partitions, then create a Log_ partition name with the retention namespace, optional description, and matching criteria. To create a new partition rule: Go to one.newrelic.com > Logs. From Manage Data on the left nav of the Logs UI, click Data partitions, then click Create partition rule. Define a Partition name as an alphanumeric string that begins with Log_. Add an optional description. Select the retention namespace for the partition. Set your rule's Matching criteria: Select EQUALS to target logs that match your criteria exactly, or select LIKE to apply a fuzzy match. Click the Enable Rule slider, and click Create. To view a list of data partitions: From Manage Data on the left nav of the Logs UI, click Data partitions. Search data partitions The default partition for all Logs accounts is Log. Any log that is not affected by a partition rule will be stored in the Log partition by default. You can query multiple partitions simultaneously. For best performance, select the smallest number of partitions possible. To search data partitions: From Views and Attributes on the left nav of the Logs UI, click Select partitions. Click one or more partitions you want to query, or search for a partition name. Click Query logs to search your selected partitions. Manage data partitions programatically with NerdGraph If you want to manage your data partitions programatically, you can use NerdGraph, our graphQL API, to do so.

To drill down into additional details, click any highlighted attribute. one.newrelic.com > Logs: Each log's summary provides query options to add, exclude, replace, and more. Query structure Using the Logs UI, you can search through your log data by entering either simple keywords, such as new and relic, or phrases such as new relic agent, directly into the search field. You can also combine keywords or phrases with operators to form more complex queries. Tip Log queries in New Relic are based on the Lucene query language, and any Lucene function listed in this document is supported. (If a Lucene function is not listed, we do not support it.) For some helpful examples, check out this Lucene tutorial. General query rules: Log query rules Comments Case sensitive The query syntax is case sensitive for attributes values. Attribute names are always case sensitive. Exception: Wildcard searches are case insensitive for attribute values. Special characters When a term contains special characters, double-quote the term and escape the special characters using a backslash (\\). This includes special characters such as +, -, &, |, !, (, ), {, }, [, ], ^, \", ~, *, ?, :, /, or \\. Example: To query for \"POST /log/v1 HTTP/1.1\" 202, escape the quotes like this: \"\\\"POST /log/v1 HTTP/1.1\\\" 202\" Wildcard searches You can run wildcard searches using an asterisk (*) to replace zero or more characters. Example: new*relic Search with text To return more specific query results, use text searches to join together keywords or phrases. Text operators The Logs query syntax accepts the following text operators: Condition Text operator example Matching (keyword) Search for log results containing keywords entered separately: \"new\" \"relic\" Exact matching (phrase) Search for log results containing the specific phrase entered: \"new relic agent\" Either / Or Search for log results containing either or both of the keywords entered: new OR relic And Search for log results containing both of the keywords entered: new AND relic * Wildcard (zero or more) Search for log results containing both of the keywords entered, with zero or more characters between them: new*relic Negation (keyword) Search for log results that do not contain the specific keyword entered: -new Negation (phrase) Search for log results that do not contain the specific phrase entered. -\"new relic\" Search with attributes Use attribute searches to narrow the query results to a specific attribute or field. General operators The following operators can be used by all types of attributes: Condition General operator example Equal : Search for log results where the attribute equals the keyword specified. Example: The field hostname equals chi: hostname:chi Does not equal - : Search for log results where the attribute does not equal the keyword specified. Example: The field hostname does not equal chi. -hostname:chi Contains * Search for log results where the attribute contains the specified keyword. Example: The field hostname contains chi. hostname:*chi* Does not contain - * Search for log results where the attribute does not contain the specified keyword. Example: The field hostname does not contain chi. -hostname:*chi* Starts with * Search for log results where the attribute starts with the specified keyword specified.

Returns results faster. Accounts can have multiple partitions, and multiple partitions can be queried at the same time. Data partitions also allow data to be mapped to an alternative, or “secondary” namespace with a fixed 30-day retention. This is useful for maintaining compliance with privacy-centric regulations and standards like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Plan your partition Before you start creating partitions, make sure you have the right permissions and a partition plan. Important Logs are routed to partitions during the ingestion process, before data is written to NRDB. Partition rules will not affect logs that were ingested before the rule was created. Required roles and permissions Users require an Admin role to create and modify partition rules. Sizing and organizing a partition You can gain significant performance improvements with proper use of data partitions. Organizing your data into discrete partitions enables you to query them separately or all together. The goals of partitioning your data should be: Create data partitions that align with concepts in your environment or organization that are static or change infrequently (for example, by business unit, team, environment, service, etc.). Ensure each partition remains below 1 TB of daily ingest for optimal performance. Having more partitions allows for more targeted searches, but creating too many partitions can make logs hard to find and increase administrative overhead. Finding the right balance is important. We support 100 partitions maximum per account, but the optimal number for most accounts is 10 to 15 partitions. Choosing a namespace A partition’s namespace determines its retention period. We offer two retention options: Standard: The account’s default retention determined by your New Relic subscription. This is the maximum retention period available in your account and is the namespace you'll select for most of your partitions. Secondary: 30-day retention. All logs sent to a partition that's a member of the Secondary namespace will be purged on a rolling basis 30 days after having been ingested. Secondary retention is not a cost control mechanism; data is billed on ingest. Create partition rules one.newrelic.com > Logs: From the left nav in the Logs UI, select Data partitions, then create a Log_ partition name with the retention namespace, optional description, and matching criteria. To create a new partition rule: Go to one.newrelic.com > Logs. From Manage Data on the left nav of the Logs UI, click Data partitions, then click Create partition rule. Define a Partition name as an alphanumeric string that begins with Log_. Add an optional description. Select the retention namespace for the partition. Set your rule's Matching criteria: Select EQUALS to target logs that match your criteria exactly, or select LIKE to apply a fuzzy match. Click the Enable Rule slider, and click Create. To view a list of data partitions: From Manage Data on the left nav of the Logs UI, click Data partitions. Search data partitions The default partition for all Logs accounts is Log. Any log that is not affected by a partition rule will be stored in the Log partition by default. You can query multiple partitions simultaneously. For best performance, select the smallest number of partitions possible. To search data partitions: From Views and Attributes on the left nav of the Logs UI, click Select partitions. Click one or more partitions you want to query, or search for a partition name. Click Query logs to search your selected partitions.

To drill down into additional details, click any highlighted attribute. one.newrelic.com > Logs: Each log's summary provides query options to add, exclude, replace, and more. Query structure Using the Logs UI, you can search through your log data by entering either simple keywords, such as new and relic, or phrases such as new relic agent, directly into the search field. You can also combine keywords or phrases with operators to form more complex queries. Tip Log queries in New Relic are based on the Lucene query language, and any Lucene function listed in this document is supported. (If a Lucene function is not listed, we do not support it.) For some helpful examples, check out this Lucene tutorial. General query rules: Log query rules Comments Case sensitive The query syntax is case sensitive for attributes values. Attribute names are always case sensitive. Exception: Wildcard searches are case insensitive for attribute values. Special characters When a term contains special characters, double-quote the term and escape the special characters using a backslash (\\). This includes special characters such as +, -, &, |, !, (, ), {, }, [, ], ^, \", ~, *, ?, :, /, or \\. Example: To query for \"POST /log/v1 HTTP/1.1\" 202, escape the quotes like this: \"\\\"POST /log/v1 HTTP/1.1\\\" 202\" Wildcard searches You can run wildcard searches using an asterisk (*) to replace zero or more characters. Example: new*relic Search with text To return more specific query results, use text searches to join together keywords or phrases. Text operators The Logs query syntax accepts the following text operators: Condition Text operator example Matching (keyword) Search for log results containing keywords entered separately: \"new\" \"relic\" Exact matching (phrase) Search for log results containing the specific phrase entered: \"new relic agent\" Either / Or Search for log results containing either or both of the keywords entered: new OR relic And Search for log results containing both of the keywords entered: new AND relic * Wildcard (zero or more) Search for log results containing both of the keywords entered, with zero or more characters between them: new*relic Negation (keyword) Search for log results that do not contain the specific keyword entered: -new Negation (phrase) Search for log results that do not contain the specific phrase entered. -\"new relic\" Search with attributes Use attribute searches to narrow the query results to a specific attribute or field. General operators The following operators can be used by all types of attributes: Condition General operator example Equal : Search for log results where the attribute equals the keyword specified. Example: The field hostname equals chi: hostname:chi Does not equal - : Search for log results where the attribute does not equal the keyword specified. Example: The field hostname does not equal chi. -hostname:chi Contains * Search for log results where the attribute contains the specified keyword. Example: The field hostname contains chi. hostname:*chi* Does not contain - * Search for log results where the attribute does not contain the specified keyword. Example: The field hostname does not contain chi. -hostname:*chi* Starts with * Search for log results where the attribute starts with the specified keyword specified. Example: The field hostname starts with chi. hostname:chi* Ends with * Search for log results where the attribute ends with the specified keyword specified. Example: The field hostname ends with chi. hostname:*chi Has Search for log results that have the specified field. Example: Has the field user_name. has:user_name Missing Search for log results that are missing the specified field. Example: Missing the field user_name. missing:user_name Numeric operators The following operators can only be used by numeric attributes: Condition Numeric operator example Greater than Search for log results attribute matches that are greater than the given parameter. Example: The field http_response_time_ms is greater than 500. http_response_time_ms:>500 Greater than or equal to Search for log results with attribute matches that are greater than or equal to the given parameter.

      "body": "Log patterns are the fastest way to discover value in log data without searching. Log data is high volume telemetry with a low value per individual record. Searching can quickly lead to logs that provide a root cause explanation, but most data is repetitive and hard to contextualize when browsing. Patterns can make log data discoverable without spending a lot of time reading through low value data. one.newrelic.com > Logs > Patterns: Use patterns as the basis for alerts when the frequency of important data changes, or for configuring drop rules to get rid of unnecessary repetitive data. Technical overview Log patterns functionality applies machine learning to normalize and group log messages that are consistent in format but variable in content. These grouped messages can be sorted, making it easy to find the most frequent or rarest sets of logs in your environment. Use patterns as the basis for alerts when the frequency of important data changes, or to configure drop rules to get rid of unnecessary repetitive data. Log patterns use advanced clustering algorithms to group together similar log messages automatically. With patterns, you can: Orient more quickly through millions of logs. Reduce the time it takes to identify unusual behavior in your log estate. Monitor the frequency of known patterns over time to focus your energy on what matters, and exclude what's irrelevant. Availability Important Log patterns are not available in the EU region. The ability to configure this feature is dependent on role-based permissions. If you see Patterns are turned off in your Log management Patterns UI, click the Configure Patterns button and enable it. If you don't see patterns within 30 minutes of enabling the feature, there may be a lack of data with a message attribute for the system to create a pattern from. Log patterns Limitations and considerations Pricing There is no separate pricing for log patterns. The only cost is for additional data generated and added to your log records. A pattern attribute will be added to all logs that match a pattern. Attributes also may be added when common values are discovered, such as GUIDs, IP addresses, URL, or email addresses. These attributes are automatically extracted from the log message as part of the pattern process. HITRUST accounts The log patterns feature is not FedRAMP compliant. FedRAMP or other HITRUST accounts are not eligible to use patterns. Regional availability Availability for this feature depends on whether you have a US or EU region account: US region accounts can use log patterns. EU region accounts cannot enable log patterns at this time. Parsing limits We have a system of safety limits on memory and CPU resources when processing logs and their patterns. These parsing limits can have an impact on the data you get. For more information, see our documentation about parsing limits. Get started To start examining patterns: Go to one.newrelic.com > Log management, and use the account picker dropdown to select the target account where you want to explore patterns. In the left navigation of the Log management UI, click Patterns. The main log UI changes to show patterns that match the query in the query bar. one.newrelic.com > Log management > Log patterns: The line chart shows the top 5 patterns over time. Use the time picker and query bar to adjust the results. Explore log patterns By default the log patterns UI first shows the most frequent occurrence of patterns. To sort to show the rarest patterns first, click the Count column. You can also use the query bar or attributes bar to filter your log patterns. If you want to... Do this... Understand the rate of change in patterns Look at the line chart. The color-coded patterns correspond to the plot column in the table. You can toggle individual plot patterns to narrow your focus.

This is the maximum retention period available in your account and is the namespace you'll select for most of your partitions. Secondary: 30-day retention. All logs sent to a partition that's a member of the Secondary namespace will be purged on a rolling basis 30 days after having been ingested. Secondary retention is not a cost control mechanism; data is billed on ingest. Create partition rules one.newrelic.com > Logs: From the left nav in the Logs UI, select Data partitions, then create a Log_ partition name with the retention namespace, optional description, and matching criteria. To create a new partition rule: Go to one.newrelic.com > Logs. From Manage Data on the left nav of the Logs UI, click Data partitions, then click Create partition rule. Define a Partition name as an alphanumeric string that begins with Log_. Add an optional description. Select the retention namespace for the partition. Set your rule's Matching criteria: Select EQUALS to target logs that match your criteria exactly, or select LIKE to apply a fuzzy match. Click the Enable Rule slider, and click Create. To view a list of data partitions: From Manage Data on the left nav of the Logs UI, click Data partitions. Search data partitions The default partition for all Logs accounts is Log. Any log that is not affected by a partition rule will be stored in the Log partition by default. You can query multiple partitions simultaneously. For best performance, select the smallest number of partitions possible. To search data partitions: From Views and Attributes on the left nav of the Logs UI, click Select partitions. Click one or more partitions you want to query, or search for a partition name. Click Query logs to search your selected partitions.

      "body": "Log patterns are the fastest way to discover value in log data without searching. Log data is high volume telemetry with a low value per individual record. Searching can quickly lead to logs that provide a root cause explanation, but most data is repetitive and hard to contextualize when browsing. Patterns can make log data discoverable without spending a lot of time reading through low value data. one.newrelic.com > Logs > Patterns: Use patterns as the basis for alerts when the frequency of important data changes, or for configuring drop rules to get rid of unnecessary repetitive data. Technical overview Log patterns functionality applies machine learning to normalize and group log messages that are consistent in format but variable in content. These grouped messages can be sorted, making it easy to find the most frequent or rarest sets of logs in your environment. Use patterns as the basis for alerts when the frequency of important data changes, or to configure drop rules to get rid of unnecessary repetitive data. Log patterns use advanced clustering algorithms to group together similar log messages automatically. With patterns, you can: Orient more quickly through millions of logs. Reduce the time it takes to identify unusual behavior in your log estate. Monitor the frequency of known patterns over time to focus your energy on what matters, and exclude what's irrelevant. Availability Important Log patterns are not available in the EU region. The ability to configure this feature is dependent on role-based permissions. If you see Patterns are turned off in your Log management Patterns UI, click the Configure Patterns button and enable it. If you don't see patterns within 30 minutes of enabling the feature, there may be a lack of data with a message attribute for the system to create a pattern from. Log patterns Limitations and considerations Pricing There is no separate pricing for log patterns. The only cost is for additional data generated and added to your log records. A pattern attribute will be added to all logs that match a pattern. Attributes also may be added when common values are discovered, such as GUIDs, IP addresses, URL, or email addresses. These attributes are automatically extracted from the log message as part of the pattern process. HITRUST accounts The log patterns feature is not FedRAMP compliant. FedRAMP or other HITRUST accounts are not eligible to use patterns. Regional availability Availability for this feature depends on whether you have a US or EU region account: US region accounts can use log patterns. EU region accounts cannot enable log patterns at this time. Parsing limits We have a system of safety limits on memory and CPU resources when processing logs and their patterns. These parsing limits can have an impact on the data you get. For more information, see our documentation about parsing limits. Get started To start examining patterns: Go to one.newrelic.com > Log management, and use the account picker dropdown to select the target account where you want to explore patterns. In the left navigation of the Log management UI, click Patterns. The main log UI changes to show patterns that match the query in the query bar. one.newrelic.com > Log management > Log patterns: The line chart shows the top 5 patterns over time. Use the time picker and query bar to adjust the results. Explore log patterns By default the log patterns UI first shows the most frequent occurrence of patterns. To sort to show the rarest patterns first, click the Count column. You can also use the query bar or attributes bar to filter your log patterns. If you want to... Do this... Understand the rate of change in patterns Look at the line chart. The color-coded patterns correspond to the plot column in the table. You can toggle individual plot patterns to narrow your focus. See the individual log messages that match each pattern Click pattern to expand the row and see a table of individual log records. To see additional records, scroll up or down. To explore an individual log in more detail, click it to open the details panel. Group and filter patterns by their attributes Use the query bar and time picker. As you apply different filters and time windows, the log patterns adjust to your new target data. Create an alert from a pattern Add the pattern to the query bar and run the query. Then click Create alert condition in the left nav. Troubleshoot log messages that haven't been clustered into a pattern Use the Logs with no pattern tab in the Log patterns UI. Clicking a specific log message will open the log message details panel you're familiar with from the Logs management page. Explore logs with no pattern The Logs with no pattern tab groups all recent log messages in your account that were not clustered into a known pattern yet. These log messages don't represent any problem or flaw in the system; they have no pattern because they are too new to have been processed by the machine learning system. This makes them valuable to explore when you want to understand what has recently changed in your environment. one.newrelic.com > Log management > Log patterns: New Relic's log patterns feature automatically groups logs without a matching pattern. For example: Are any of these logs tied to a recent problem? This is a quick way to discover unique log data that is appearing for the first time in your environment. Does your log data have a new format? Sometimes the logs don't represent a problem, but a new format of log data that deviates from the data model you expect your applications to follow. Catching these logs early gives you the opportunity to ask developers to correct any deviations in their log output. The more consistent people are in the way log data is generated, the easier it becomes to use logs across a diverse set of teams. Masked attributes and wildcards Parts of the log messages in patterns are classified as variables and are substituted by masked attributes. The masking process supports and improves the clustering phase by allowing the algorithm to ignore changing details and focus on the repetitive structure. Masked attributes include: date_time ip url uuid Masked attributes are highlighted and are easy to identify, as shown in the following example. one.newrelic.com > Log management > Log patterns: Here is an example of a pattern that has masked attributes. Log patterns extract other less trivial variables that don't belong to any masked attribute. These variables are indicated as wildcards *. one.newrelic.com > Log management > Log patterns: Here is an example of how wildcards * group variables. Troubleshooting Here are a few reasons why you might have patterns enabled but not see any pattern data. If you're sure none of the items below are true, get help from support.newrelic.com. No data has arrived in the timeframe you're observing. Try expanding the time range you're viewing with the time picker. It's been less than 24 hours since patterns were enabled in the account. This means the ML model may not be generated for the account yet. None of the data coming in has a message field. Patterns will only be generated for values in the message field of a log record. If your logs don't contain message, there will be no data. Put the platform to work with patterns Patterns are a value that is enriched onto the existing log message as a new attribute named newrelic.logPattern. Anything you can do with logs generally can be done with log patterns, such as: Build your own dashboards with patterns, to monitor a specific pattern or group of patterns you care about. Create alerts for patterns by adding NRQL alerts. Use baseline alert conditions to detect anomalies in known log patterns.",

Returns results faster. Accounts can have multiple partitions, and multiple partitions can be queried at the same time. Data partitions also allow data to be mapped to an alternative, or “secondary” namespace with a fixed 30-day retention. This is useful for maintaining compliance with privacy-centric regulations and standards like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Plan your partition Before you start creating partitions, make sure you have the right permissions and a partition plan. Important Logs are routed to partitions during the ingestion process, before data is written to NRDB. Partition rules will not affect logs that were ingested before the rule was created. Required roles and permissions Users require an Admin role to create and modify partition rules. Sizing and organizing a partition You can gain significant performance improvements with proper use of data partitions. Organizing your data into discrete partitions enables you to query them separately or all together. The goals of partitioning your data should be: Create data partitions that align with concepts in your environment or organization that are static or change infrequently (for example, by business unit, team, environment, service, etc.). Ensure each partition remains below 1 TB of daily ingest for optimal performance. Having more partitions allows for more targeted searches, but creating too many partitions can make logs hard to find and increase administrative overhead. Finding the right balance is important.

Technical overview Log patterns functionality applies machine learning to normalize and group log messages that are consistent in format but variable in content. These grouped messages can be sorted, making it easy to find the most frequent or rarest sets of logs in your environment. Use patterns as the basis for alerts when the frequency of important data changes, or to configure drop rules to get rid of unnecessary repetitive data.

Reduce the time it takes to identify unusual behavior in your log estate. Monitor the frequency of known patterns over time to focus your energy on what matters, and exclude what's irrelevant. Availability Important Log patterns are not available in the EU region. The ability to configure this feature is dependent on role-based permissions. If you see Patterns are turned off in your Log management Patterns UI, click the Configure Patterns button and enable it. If you don't see patterns within 30 minutes of enabling the feature, there may be a lack of data with a message attribute for the system to create a pattern from. Log patterns Limitations and considerations Pricing There is no separate pricing for log patterns. The only cost is for additional data generated and added to your log records. A pattern attribute will be added to all logs that match a pattern. Attributes also may be added when common values are discovered, such as GUIDs, IP addresses, URL, or email addresses. These attributes are automatically extracted from the log message as part of the pattern process. HITRUST accounts The log patterns feature is not FedRAMP compliant. FedRAMP or other HITRUST accounts are not eligible to use patterns. Regional availability Availability for this feature depends on whether you have a US or EU region account: US region accounts can use log patterns. EU region accounts cannot enable log patterns at this time. Parsing limits We have a system of safety limits on memory and CPU resources when processing logs and their patterns. These parsing limits can have an impact on the data you get. For more information, see our documentation about parsing limits. Get started To start examining patterns: Go to one.newrelic.com > Log management, and use the account picker dropdown to select the target account where you want to explore patterns. In the left navigation of the Log management UI, click Patterns. The main log UI changes to show patterns that match the query in the query bar. one.newrelic.com > Log management > Log patterns: The line chart shows the top 5 patterns over time. Use the time picker and query bar to adjust the results. Explore log patterns By default the log patterns UI first shows the most frequent occurrence of patterns. To sort to show the rarest patterns first, click the Count column. You can also use the query bar or attributes bar to filter your log patterns. If you want to... Do this... Understand the rate of change in patterns Look at the line chart. The color-coded patterns correspond to the plot column in the table. You can toggle individual plot patterns to narrow your focus. See the individual log messages that match each pattern Click pattern to expand the row and see a table of individual log records. To see additional records, scroll up or down. To explore an individual log in more detail, click it to open the details panel. Group and filter patterns by their attributes Use the query bar and time picker. As you apply different filters and time windows, the log patterns adjust to your new target data. Create an alert from a pattern Add the pattern to the query bar and run the query. Then click Create alert condition in the left nav. Troubleshoot log messages that haven't been clustered into a pattern Use the Logs with no pattern tab in the Log patterns UI. Clicking a specific log message will open the log message details panel you're familiar with from the Logs management page. Explore logs with no pattern The Logs with no pattern tab groups all recent log messages in your account that were not clustered into a known pattern yet. These log messages don't represent any problem or flaw in the system; they have no pattern because they are too new to have been processed by the machine learning system. This makes them valuable to explore when you want to understand what has recently changed in your environment. one.newrelic.com > Log management > Log patterns: New Relic's log patterns feature automatically groups logs without a matching pattern. For example: Are any of these logs tied to a recent problem? This is a quick way to discover unique log data that is appearing for the first time in your environment. Does your log data have a new format? Sometimes the logs don't represent a problem, but a new format of log data that deviates from the data model you expect your applications to follow. Catching these logs early gives you the opportunity to ask developers to correct any deviations in their log output. The more consistent people are in the way log data is generated, the easier it becomes to use logs across a diverse set of teams. Masked attributes and wildcards Parts of the log messages in patterns are classified as variables and are substituted by masked attributes. The masking process supports and improves the clustering phase by allowing the algorithm to ignore changing details and focus on the repetitive structure. Masked attributes include: date_time ip url uuid Masked attributes are highlighted and are easy to identify, as shown in the following example. one.newrelic.com > Log management > Log patterns: Here is an example of a pattern that has masked attributes. Log patterns extract other less trivial variables that don't belong to any masked attribute. These variables are indicated as wildcards *. one.newrelic.com > Log management > Log patterns: Here is an example of how wildcards * group variables. Troubleshooting Here are a few reasons why you might have patterns enabled but not see any pattern data. If you're sure none of the items below are true, get help from support.newrelic.com. No data has arrived in the timeframe you're observing. Try expanding the time range you're viewing with the time picker. It's been less than 24 hours since patterns were enabled in the account. This means the ML model may not be generated for the account yet. None of the data coming in has a message field. Patterns will only be generated for values in the message field of a log record. If your logs don't contain message, there will be no data. Put the platform to work with patterns Patterns are a value that is enriched onto the existing log message as a new attribute named newrelic.logPattern. Anything you can do with logs generally can be done with log patterns, such as: Build your own dashboards with patterns, to monitor a specific pattern or group of patterns you care about. Create alerts for patterns by adding NRQL alerts. Use baseline alert conditions to detect anomalies in known log patterns.",

      "body": "Data partitions are a way to group or organize log data for faster and more efficient querying. When a query targets a single partition, New Relic Logs: Scans less unrelated data. Returns results faster. Accounts can have multiple partitions, and multiple partitions can be queried at the same time. Data partitions also allow data to be mapped to an alternative, or “secondary” namespace with a fixed 30-day retention. This is useful for maintaining compliance with privacy-centric regulations and standards like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Plan your partition Before you start creating partitions, make sure you have the right permissions and a partition plan. Important Logs are routed to partitions during the ingestion process, before data is written to NRDB. Partition rules will not affect logs that were ingested before the rule was created. Required roles and permissions Users require an Admin role to create and modify partition rules. Sizing and organizing a partition You can gain significant performance improvements with proper use of data partitions. Organizing your data into discrete partitions enables you to query them separately or all together. The goals of partitioning your data should be: Create data partitions that align with concepts in your environment or organization that are static or change infrequently (for example, by business unit, team, environment, service, etc.). Ensure each partition remains below 1 TB of daily ingest for optimal performance. Having more partitions allows for more targeted searches, but creating too many partitions can make logs hard to find and increase administrative overhead. Finding the right balance is important. We support 100 partitions maximum per account, but the optimal number for most accounts is 10 to 15 partitions. Choosing a namespace A partition’s namespace determines its retention period. We offer two retention options: Standard: The account’s default retention determined by your New Relic subscription. This is the maximum retention period available in your account and is the namespace you'll select for most of your partitions. Secondary: 30-day retention. All logs sent to a partition that's a member of the Secondary namespace will be purged on a rolling basis 30 days after having been ingested. Secondary retention is not a cost control mechanism; data is billed on ingest. Create partition rules one.newrelic.com > Logs: From the left nav in the Logs UI, select Data partitions, then create a Log_ partition name with the retention namespace, optional description, and matching criteria. To create a new partition rule: Go to one.newrelic.com > Logs. From Manage Data on the left nav of the Logs UI, click Data partitions, then click Create partition rule. Define a Partition name as an alphanumeric string that begins with Log_. Add an optional description. Select the retention namespace for the partition. Set your rule's Matching criteria: Select EQUALS to target logs that match your criteria exactly, or select LIKE to apply a fuzzy match. Click the Enable Rule slider, and click Create. To view a list of data partitions: From Manage Data on the left nav of the Logs UI, click Data partitions. Search data partitions The default partition for all Logs accounts is Log. Any log that is not affected by a partition rule will be stored in the Log partition by default. You can query multiple partitions simultaneously. For best performance, select the smallest number of partitions possible. To search data partitions: From Views and Attributes on the left nav of the Logs UI, click Select partitions. Click one or more partitions you want to query, or search for a partition name. Click Query logs to search your selected partitions. Manage data partitions programatically with NerdGraph If you want to manage your data partitions programatically, you can use NerdGraph, our graphQL API, to do so. This tutorial shows how to query, create, and delete data partitions using our API.",

To drill down into additional details, click any highlighted attribute. one.newrelic.com > Logs: Each log's summary provides query options to add, exclude, replace, and more. Query structure Using the Logs UI, you can search through your log data by entering either simple keywords, such as new and relic, or phrases such as new relic agent, directly into the search field. You can also combine keywords or phrases with operators to form more complex queries. Tip Log queries in New Relic are based on the Lucene query language, and any Lucene function listed in this document is supported. (If a Lucene function is not listed, we do not support it.) For some helpful examples, check out this Lucene tutorial. General query rules: Log query rules Comments Case sensitive The query syntax is case sensitive for attributes values. Attribute names are always case sensitive. Exception: Wildcard searches are case insensitive for attribute values. Special characters When a term contains special characters, double-quote the term and escape the special characters using a backslash (\\). This includes special characters such as +, -, &, |, !, (, ), {, }, [, ], ^, \", ~, *, ?, :, /, or \\. Example: To query for \"POST /log/v1 HTTP/1.1\" 202, escape the quotes like this: \"\\\"POST /log/v1 HTTP/1.1\\\" 202\" Wildcard searches You can run wildcard searches using an asterisk (*) to replace zero or more characters. Example: new*relic Search with text To return more specific query results, use text searches to join together keywords or phrases. Text operators The Logs query syntax accepts the following text operators: Condition Text operator example Matching (keyword) Search for log results containing keywords entered separately: \"new\" \"relic\" Exact matching (phrase) Search for log results containing the specific phrase entered: \"new relic agent\" Either / Or Search for log results containing either or both of the keywords entered: new OR relic And Search for log results containing both of the keywords entered: new AND relic * Wildcard (zero or more) Search for log results containing both of the keywords entered, with zero or more characters between them: new*relic Negation (keyword) Search for log results that do not contain the specific keyword entered: -new Negation (phrase) Search for log results that do not contain the specific phrase entered. -\"new relic\" Search with attributes Use attribute searches to narrow the query results to a specific attribute or field. General operators The following operators can be used by all types of attributes: Condition General operator example Equal : Search for log results where the attribute equals the keyword specified. Example: The field hostname equals chi: hostname:chi Does not equal - : Search for log results where the attribute does not equal the keyword specified. Example: The field hostname does not equal chi. -hostname:chi Contains * Search for log results where the attribute contains the specified keyword. Example: The field hostname contains chi. hostname:*chi* Does not contain - * Search for log results where the attribute does not contain the specified keyword. Example: The field hostname does not contain chi. -hostname:*chi* Starts with * Search for log results where the attribute starts with the specified keyword specified. Example: The field hostname starts with chi. hostname:chi* Ends with * Search for log results where the attribute ends with the specified keyword specified. Example: The field hostname ends with chi. hostname:*chi Has Search for log results that have the specified field. Example: Has the field user_name. has:user_name Missing Search for log results that are missing the specified field. Example: Missing the field user_name. missing:user_name Numeric operators The following operators can only be used by numeric attributes: Condition Numeric operator example Greater than Search for log results attribute matches that are greater than the given parameter. Example: The field http_response_time_ms is greater than 500. http_response_time_ms:>500 Greater than or equal to Search for log results with attribute matches that are greater than or equal to the given parameter.

To sort to show the rarest patterns first, click the Count column. You can also use the query bar or attributes bar to filter your log patterns. If you want to... Do this... Understand the rate of change in patterns Look at the line chart. The color-coded patterns correspond to the plot column in the table. You can toggle individual plot patterns to narrow your focus. See the individual log messages that match each pattern Click pattern to expand the row and see a table of individual log records. To see additional records, scroll up or down. To explore an individual log in more detail, click it to open the details panel. Group and filter patterns by their attributes Use the query bar and time picker. As you apply different filters and time windows, the log patterns adjust to your new target data. Create an alert from a pattern Add the pattern to the query bar and run the query. Then click Create alert condition in the left nav. Troubleshoot log messages that haven't been clustered into a pattern Use the Logs with no pattern tab in the Log patterns UI. Clicking a specific log message will open the log message details panel you're familiar with from the Logs management page. Explore logs with no pattern The Logs with no pattern tab groups all recent log messages in your account that were not clustered into a known pattern yet. These log messages don't represent any problem or flaw in the system; they have no pattern because they are too new to have been processed by the machine learning system. This makes them valuable to explore when you want to understand what has recently changed in your environment. one.newrelic.com > Log management > Log patterns: New Relic's log patterns feature automatically groups logs without a matching pattern. For example: Are any of these logs tied to a recent problem? This is a quick way to discover unique log data that is appearing for the first time in your environment. Does your log data have a new format? Sometimes the logs don't represent a problem, but a new format of log data that deviates from the data model you expect your applications to follow. Catching these logs early gives you the opportunity to ask developers to correct any deviations in their log output. The more consistent people are in the way log data is generated, the easier it becomes to use logs across a diverse set of teams. Masked attributes and wildcards Parts of the log messages in patterns are classified as variables and are substituted by masked attributes. The masking process supports and improves the clustering phase by allowing the algorithm to ignore changing details and focus on the repetitive structure. Masked attributes include: date_time ip url uuid Masked attributes are highlighted and are easy to identify, as shown in the following example. one.newrelic.com > Log management > Log patterns: Here is an example of a pattern that has masked attributes. Log patterns extract other less trivial variables that don't belong to any masked attribute. These variables are indicated as wildcards *. one.newrelic.com > Log management > Log patterns: Here is an example of how wildcards * group variables. Troubleshooting Here are a few reasons why you might have patterns enabled but not see any pattern data. If you're sure none of the items below are true, get help from support.newrelic.com. No data has arrived in the timeframe you're observing. Try expanding the time range you're viewing with the time picker. It's been less than 24 hours since patterns were enabled in the account.

      "body": "After log event data has been shipped to New Relic, it can either be stored in our NRDB database or dropped (discarded). We can drop both log events and event attributes via drop filter rules. You can manage drop filter rules using our Logs UI, as explained in this document. You can also use NerdGraph. Savings, security, speed Drop filter rules help you accomplish several important goals: Lower costs by storing only logs relevant to your account. Protect privacy and security by removing personal identifiable information (PII). Reduce noise by removing irrelevant events and attributes. Caution Use caution when deciding to drop data. The data you drop is not recoverable. Before using this feature, review the responsibilities and considerations for dropping data. How drop filter rules work A drop filter rule matches data based on a query. When triggered, the drop filter rule removes the matching data from the ingestion pipeline before it is written to NRDB. This creates an explicit demarcation between the logs being forwarded from your domain and the data that New Relic collects. Since the data removed by the drop filter rule doesn't reach our backend, it cannot be queried: the data is gone and cannot be restored. During the ingestion process, customer log data can be parsed, transformed, or dropped before being stored in New Relic's database. Cautions when dropping data When creating drop rules, you are responsible for ensuring that the rules accurately identify and discard the data that meets the conditions that you have established. You are also responsible for monitoring the rule, as well as the data you disclose to New Relic. New Relic cannot guarantee that this functionality will completely resolve data disclosure concerns you may have. New Relic doesn't review or monitor how effective the rules you develop are. Creating rules about sensitive data can leak information about what kinds of data you maintain, including the format of your data or systems (for example, through referencing email addresses or specific credit card numbers). Any user with the relevant role-based access control permissions can view and edit all information in the rules you create. Create drop filter rules To create and edit drop filters, you must have admin permissions in New Relic, or you must be a member of a role with create and edit permissions for Logging Parsing Rules. Once a drop filter rule is active, it's applied to all log events ingested from that point onwards. Rules are not applied retroactively. Logs collected before creating a rule are not filtered by that rule. one.newrelic.com > Logs: Filter or query the set of logs that contain the data you want to drop. Then, from Manage Data on the left nav of the Logs UI, click Create drop filter. To create a new drop filter rule, you can use new or existing log queries. Go to one.newrelic.com > Logs. Filter or query to the specific set of logs that contain the data to be dropped. Once the query is active, from Manage Data on the left nav of the Logs UI, click Create drop filter. Recommendation: Change the drop rule's default name to a meaningful name. Choose to either drop the entire log event that matches the query or just a specific subset of attributes in the matching events. Review the log partitions where this drop rule applies. Save the drop filter rule. Types of drop filter rules The drop filters UI prompts you to select whether to drop logs based on the query or on specific attributes. Drop log events The default type of drop filter rule is to drop logs. This option drops the entire log events that match the filter or query. When creating a rule, try to provide a specific query that only matches log data that should be dropped. Our drop filters process won't let you create drop filter rules without values in the matching query. This prevents badly formed rules from dropping all log data. Drop attributes You can specify attributes to be dropped in a log event that matches your query. At least one or more attributes must be selected. Any attribute which is selected will be dropped; all remaining attributes will be kept and stored in NRDB. Tip We recommend this method for removing fields that could contain personal identifiable information (PII) or other sensitive attributes without losing valuable monitoring data. View or delete drop filter rules To view or delete a drop filter rule: Go to one.newrelic.com > Logs. From Manage Data on the left nav of the Logs UI, click Drop filters. Click the delete icon next to the drop filter rule you want to remove. Once deleted, rules no longer filter ingested log events.",

To drill down into additional details, click any highlighted attribute. one.newrelic.com > Logs: Each log's summary provides query options to add, exclude, replace, and more. Query structure Using the Logs UI, you can search through your log data by entering either simple keywords, such as new and relic, or phrases such as new relic agent, directly into the search field. You can also combine keywords or phrases with operators to form more complex queries. Tip Log queries in New Relic are based on the Lucene query language, and any Lucene function listed in this document is supported. (If a Lucene function is not listed, we do not support it.) For some helpful examples, check out this Lucene tutorial. General query rules: Log query rules Comments Case sensitive The query syntax is case sensitive for attributes values. Attribute names are always case sensitive. Exception: Wildcard searches are case insensitive for attribute values. Special characters When a term contains special characters, double-quote the term and escape the special characters using a backslash (\\). This includes special characters such as +, -, &, |, !, (, ), {, }, [, ], ^, \", ~, *, ?, :, /, or \\. Example: To query for \"POST /log/v1 HTTP/1.1\" 202, escape the quotes like this: \"\\\"POST /log/v1 HTTP/1.1\\\" 202\" Wildcard searches You can run wildcard searches using an asterisk (*) to replace zero or more characters. Example: new*relic Search with text To return more specific query results, use text searches to join together keywords or phrases. Text operators The Logs query syntax accepts the following text operators: Condition Text operator example Matching (keyword) Search for log results containing keywords entered separately: \"new\" \"relic\" Exact matching (phrase) Search for log results containing the specific phrase entered: \"new relic agent\" Either / Or Search for log results containing either or both of the keywords entered: new OR relic And Search for log results containing both of the keywords entered: new AND relic * Wildcard (zero or more) Search for log results containing both of the keywords entered, with zero or more characters between them: new*relic Negation (keyword) Search for log results that do not contain the specific keyword entered: -new Negation (phrase) Search for log results that do not contain the specific phrase entered. -\"new relic\" Search with attributes Use attribute searches to narrow the query results to a specific attribute or field. General operators The following operators can be used by all types of attributes: Condition General operator example Equal : Search for log results where the attribute equals the keyword specified. Example: The field hostname equals chi: hostname:chi Does not equal - : Search for log results where the attribute does not equal the keyword specified. Example: The field hostname does not equal chi. -hostname:chi Contains * Search for log results where the attribute contains the specified keyword. Example: The field hostname contains chi. hostname:*chi* Does not contain - * Search for log results where the attribute does not contain the specified keyword. Example: The field hostname does not contain chi. -hostname:*chi* Starts with * Search for log results where the attribute starts with the specified keyword specified. Example: The field hostname starts with chi. hostname:chi* Ends with * Search for log results where the attribute ends with the specified keyword specified. Example: The field hostname ends with chi. hostname:*chi Has Search for log results that have the specified field. Example: Has the field user_name. has:user_name Missing Search for log results that are missing the specified field. Example: Missing the field user_name. missing:user_name Numeric operators The following operators can only be used by numeric attributes: Condition Numeric operator example Greater than Search for log results attribute matches that are greater than the given parameter. Example: The field http_response_time_ms is greater than 500. http_response_time_ms:>500 Greater than or equal to Search for log results with attribute matches that are greater than or equal to the given parameter.

      "body": "Log patterns are the fastest way to discover value in log data without searching. Log data is high volume telemetry with a low value per individual record. Searching can quickly lead to logs that provide a root cause explanation, but most data is repetitive and hard to contextualize when browsing. Patterns can make log data discoverable without spending a lot of time reading through low value data. one.newrelic.com > Logs > Patterns: Use patterns as the basis for alerts when the frequency of important data changes, or for configuring drop rules to get rid of unnecessary repetitive data. Technical overview Log patterns functionality applies machine learning to normalize and group log messages that are consistent in format but variable in content. These grouped messages can be sorted, making it easy to find the most frequent or rarest sets of logs in your environment. Use patterns as the basis for alerts when the frequency of important data changes, or to configure drop rules to get rid of unnecessary repetitive data. Log patterns use advanced clustering algorithms to group together similar log messages automatically. With patterns, you can: Orient more quickly through millions of logs. Reduce the time it takes to identify unusual behavior in your log estate. Monitor the frequency of known patterns over time to focus your energy on what matters, and exclude what's irrelevant. Availability Important Log patterns are not available in the EU region. The ability to configure this feature is dependent on role-based permissions. If you see Patterns are turned off in your Log management Patterns UI, click the Configure Patterns button and enable it. If you don't see patterns within 30 minutes of enabling the feature, there may be a lack of data with a message attribute for the system to create a pattern from. Log patterns Limitations and considerations Pricing There is no separate pricing for log patterns. The only cost is for additional data generated and added to your log records. A pattern attribute will be added to all logs that match a pattern. Attributes also may be added when common values are discovered, such as GUIDs, IP addresses, URL, or email addresses. These attributes are automatically extracted from the log message as part of the pattern process. HITRUST accounts The log patterns feature is not FedRAMP compliant. FedRAMP or other HITRUST accounts are not eligible to use patterns. Regional availability Availability for this feature depends on whether you have a US or EU region account: US region accounts can use log patterns. EU region accounts cannot enable log patterns at this time. Parsing limits We have a system of safety limits on memory and CPU resources when processing logs and their patterns. These parsing limits can have an impact on the data you get. For more information, see our documentation about parsing limits.

Returns results faster. Accounts can have multiple partitions, and multiple partitions can be queried at the same time. Data partitions also allow data to be mapped to an alternative, or “secondary” namespace with a fixed 30-day retention. This is useful for maintaining compliance with privacy-centric regulations and standards like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Plan your partition Before you start creating partitions, make sure you have the right permissions and a partition plan. Important Logs are routed to partitions during the ingestion process, before data is written to NRDB. Partition rules will not affect logs that were ingested before the rule was created. Required roles and permissions Users require an Admin role to create and modify partition rules. Sizing and organizing a partition You can gain significant performance improvements with proper use of data partitions. Organizing your data into discrete partitions enables you to query them separately or all together. The goals of partitioning your data should be: Create data partitions that align with concepts in your environment or organization that are static or change infrequently (for example, by business unit, team, environment, service, etc.). Ensure each partition remains below 1 TB of daily ingest for optimal performance. Having more partitions allows for more targeted searches, but creating too many partitions can make logs hard to find and increase administrative overhead. Finding the right balance is important. We support 100 partitions maximum per account, but the optimal number for most accounts is 10 to 15 partitions. Choosing a namespace A partition’s namespace determines its retention period. We offer two retention options: Standard: The account’s default retention determined by your New Relic subscription. This is the maximum retention period available in your account and is the namespace you'll select for most of your partitions. Secondary: 30-day retention. All logs sent to a partition that's a member of the Secondary namespace will be purged on a rolling basis 30 days after having been ingested. Secondary retention is not a cost control mechanism; data is billed on ingest. Create partition rules one.newrelic.com > Logs: From the left nav in the Logs UI, select Data partitions, then create a Log_ partition name with the retention namespace, optional description, and matching criteria. To create a new partition rule: Go to one.newrelic.com > Logs. From Manage Data on the left nav of the Logs UI, click Data partitions, then click Create partition rule. Define a Partition name as an alphanumeric string that begins with Log_. Add an optional description. Select the retention namespace for the partition. Set your rule's Matching criteria: Select EQUALS to target logs that match your criteria exactly, or select LIKE to apply a fuzzy match. Click the Enable Rule slider, and click Create. To view a list of data partitions: From Manage Data on the left nav of the Logs UI, click Data partitions. Search data partitions The default partition for all Logs accounts is Log. Any log that is not affected by a partition rule will be stored in the Log partition by default. You can query multiple partitions simultaneously. For best performance, select the smallest number of partitions possible. To search data partitions: From Views and Attributes on the left nav of the Logs UI, click Select partitions. Click one or more partitions you want to query, or search for a partition name. Click Query logs to search your selected partitions.

To drill down into additional details, click any highlighted attribute. one.newrelic.com > Logs: Each log's summary provides query options to add, exclude, replace, and more. Query structure Using the Logs UI, you can search through your log data by entering either simple keywords, such as new and relic, or phrases such as new relic agent, directly into the search field. You can also combine keywords or phrases with operators to form more complex queries. Tip Log queries in New Relic are based on the Lucene query language, and any Lucene function listed in this document is supported. (If a Lucene function is not listed, we do not support it.) For some helpful examples, check out this Lucene tutorial. General query rules: Log query rules Comments Case sensitive The query syntax is case sensitive for attributes values. Attribute names are always case sensitive. Exception: Wildcard searches are case insensitive for attribute values. Special characters When a term contains special characters, double-quote the term and escape the special characters using a backslash (\\). This includes special characters such as +, -, &, |, !, (, ), {, }, [, ], ^, \", ~, *, ?, :, /, or \\. Example: To query for \"POST /log/v1 HTTP/1.1\" 202, escape the quotes like this: \"\\\"POST /log/v1 HTTP/1.1\\\" 202\" Wildcard searches You can run wildcard searches using an asterisk (*) to replace zero or more characters. Example: new*relic Search with text To return more specific query results, use text searches to join together keywords or phrases. Text operators The Logs query syntax accepts the following text operators: Condition Text operator example Matching (keyword) Search for log results containing keywords entered separately: \"new\" \"relic\" Exact matching (phrase) Search for log results containing the specific phrase entered: \"new relic agent\" Either / Or Search for log results containing either or both of the keywords entered: new OR relic And Search for log results containing both of the keywords entered: new AND relic * Wildcard (zero or more) Search for log results containing both of the keywords entered, with zero or more characters between them: new*relic Negation (keyword) Search for log results that do not contain the specific keyword entered: -new Negation (phrase) Search for log results that do not contain the specific phrase entered. -\"new relic\" Search with attributes Use attribute searches to narrow the query results to a specific attribute or field. General operators The following operators can be used by all types of attributes: Condition General operator example Equal : Search for log results where the attribute equals the keyword specified. Example: The field hostname equals chi: hostname:chi Does not equal - : Search for log results where the attribute does not equal the keyword specified. Example: The field hostname does not equal chi. -hostname:chi Contains * Search for log results where the attribute contains the specified keyword. Example: The field hostname contains chi. hostname:*chi* Does not contain - * Search for log results where the attribute does not contain the specified keyword. Example: The field hostname does not contain chi. -hostname:*chi* Starts with * Search for log results where the attribute starts with the specified keyword specified. Example: The field hostname starts with chi. hostname:chi* Ends with * Search for log results where the attribute ends with the specified keyword specified. Example: The field hostname ends with chi. hostname:*chi Has Search for log results that have the specified field. Example: Has the field user_name. has:user_name Missing Search for log results that are missing the specified field. Example: Missing the field user_name. missing:user_name Numeric operators The following operators can only be used by numeric attributes: Condition Numeric operator example Greater than Search for log results attribute matches that are greater than the given parameter. Example: The field http_response_time_ms is greater than 500. http_response_time_ms:>500 Greater than or equal to Search for log results with attribute matches that are greater than or equal to the given parameter.

      "body": "After log event data has been shipped to New Relic, it can either be stored in our NRDB database or dropped (discarded). We can drop both log events and event attributes via drop filter rules. You can manage drop filter rules using our Logs UI, as explained in this document. You can also use NerdGraph. Savings, security, speed Drop filter rules help you accomplish several important goals: Lower costs by storing only logs relevant to your account. Protect privacy and security by removing personal identifiable information (PII). Reduce noise by removing irrelevant events and attributes. Caution Use caution when deciding to drop data. The data you drop is not recoverable. Before using this feature, review the responsibilities and considerations for dropping data. How drop filter rules work A drop filter rule matches data based on a query. When triggered, the drop filter rule removes the matching data from the ingestion pipeline before it is written to NRDB. This creates an explicit demarcation between the logs being forwarded from your domain and the data that New Relic collects. Since the data removed by the drop filter rule doesn't reach our backend, it cannot be queried: the data is gone and cannot be restored. During the ingestion process, customer log data can be parsed, transformed, or dropped before being stored in New Relic's database. Cautions when dropping data When creating drop rules, you are responsible for ensuring that the rules accurately identify and discard the data that meets the conditions that you have established. You are also responsible for monitoring the rule, as well as the data you disclose to New Relic. New Relic cannot guarantee that this functionality will completely resolve data disclosure concerns you may have. New Relic doesn't review or monitor how effective the rules you develop are. Creating rules about sensitive data can leak information about what kinds of data you maintain, including the format of your data or systems (for example, through referencing email addresses or specific credit card numbers). Any user with the relevant role-based access control permissions can view and edit all information in the rules you create. Create drop filter rules To create and edit drop filters, you must have admin permissions in New Relic, or you must be a member of a role with create and edit permissions for Logging Parsing Rules. Once a drop filter rule is active, it's applied to all log events ingested from that point onwards. Rules are not applied retroactively. Logs collected before creating a rule are not filtered by that rule. one.newrelic.com > Logs: Filter or query the set of logs that contain the data you want to drop. Then, from Manage Data on the left nav of the Logs UI, click Create drop filter. To create a new drop filter rule, you can use new or existing log queries. Go to one.newrelic.com > Logs. Filter or query to the specific set of logs that contain the data to be dropped. Once the query is active, from Manage Data on the left nav of the Logs UI, click Create drop filter. Recommendation: Change the drop rule's default name to a meaningful name. Choose to either drop the entire log event that matches the query or just a specific subset of attributes in the matching events. Review the log partitions where this drop rule applies. Save the drop filter rule. Types of drop filter rules The drop filters UI prompts you to select whether to drop logs based on the query or on specific attributes. Drop log events The default type of drop filter rule is to drop logs. This option drops the entire log events that match the filter or query. When creating a rule, try to provide a specific query that only matches log data that should be dropped. Our drop filters process won't let you create drop filter rules without values in the matching query. This prevents badly formed rules from dropping all log data. Drop attributes You can specify attributes to be dropped in a log event that matches your query. At least one or more attributes must be selected. Any attribute which is selected will be dropped; all remaining attributes will be kept and stored in NRDB. Tip We recommend this method for removing fields that could contain personal identifiable information (PII) or other sensitive attributes without losing valuable monitoring data. View or delete drop filter rules To view or delete a drop filter rule: Go to one.newrelic.com > Logs. From Manage Data on the left nav of the Logs UI, click Drop filters. Click the delete icon next to the drop filter rule you want to remove. Once deleted, rules no longer filter ingested log events.",

Technical overview Log patterns functionality applies machine learning to normalize and group log messages that are consistent in format but variable in content. These grouped messages can be sorted, making it easy to find the most frequent or rarest sets of logs in your environment. Use patterns as the basis for alerts when the frequency of important data changes, or to configure drop rules to get rid of unnecessary repetitive data. Log patterns use advanced clustering algorithms to group together similar log messages automatically. With patterns, you can: Orient more quickly through millions of logs. Reduce the time it takes to identify unusual behavior in your log estate. Monitor the frequency of known patterns over time to focus your energy on what matters, and exclude what's irrelevant. Availability Important Log patterns are not available in the EU region. The ability to configure this feature is dependent on role-based permissions. If you see Patterns are turned off in your Log management Patterns UI, click the Configure Patterns button and enable it. If you don't see patterns within 30 minutes of enabling the feature, there may be a lack of data with a message attribute for the system to create a pattern from. Log patterns Limitations and considerations Pricing There is no separate pricing for log patterns. The only cost is for additional data generated and added to your log records. A pattern attribute will be added to all logs that match a pattern. Attributes also may be added when common values are discovered, such as GUIDs, IP addresses, URL, or email addresses. These attributes are automatically extracted from the log message as part of the pattern process. HITRUST accounts The log patterns feature is not FedRAMP compliant. FedRAMP or other HITRUST accounts are not eligible to use patterns. Regional availability Availability for this feature depends on whether you have a US or EU region account: US region accounts can use log patterns. EU region accounts cannot enable log patterns at this time. Parsing limits We have a system of safety limits on memory and CPU resources when processing logs and their patterns. These parsing limits can have an impact on the data you get. For more information, see our documentation about parsing limits. Get started To start examining patterns: Go to one.newrelic.com > Log management, and use the account picker dropdown to select the target account where you want to explore patterns. In the left navigation of the Log management UI, click Patterns. The main log UI changes to show patterns that match the query in the query bar. one.newrelic.com > Log management > Log patterns: The line chart shows the top 5 patterns over time. Use the time picker and query bar to adjust the results. Explore log patterns By default the log patterns UI first shows the most frequent occurrence of patterns. To sort to show the rarest patterns first, click the Count column. You can also use the query bar or attributes bar to filter your log patterns. If you want to... Do this... Understand the rate of change in patterns Look at the line chart. The color-coded patterns correspond to the plot column in the table. You can toggle individual plot patterns to narrow your focus. See the individual log messages that match each pattern Click pattern to expand the row and see a table of individual log records. To see additional records, scroll up or down. To explore an individual log in more detail, click it to open the details panel. Group and filter patterns by their attributes Use the query bar and time picker. As you apply different filters and time windows, the log patterns adjust to your new target data. Create an alert from a pattern Add the pattern to the query bar and run the query. Then click Create alert condition in the left nav. Troubleshoot log messages that haven't been clustered into a pattern Use the Logs with no pattern tab in the Log patterns UI. Clicking a specific log message will open the log message details panel you're familiar with from the Logs management page. Explore logs with no pattern The Logs with no pattern tab groups all recent log messages in your account that were not clustered into a known pattern yet. These log messages don't represent any problem or flaw in the system; they have no pattern because they are too new to have been processed by the machine learning system. This makes them valuable to explore when you want to understand what has recently changed in your environment. one.newrelic.com > Log management > Log patterns: New Relic's log patterns feature automatically groups logs without a matching pattern. For example: Are any of these logs tied to a recent problem? This is a quick way to discover unique log data that is appearing for the first time in your environment. Does your log data have a new format? Sometimes the logs don't represent a problem, but a new format of log data that deviates from the data model you expect your applications to follow. Catching these logs early gives you the opportunity to ask developers to correct any deviations in their log output. The more consistent people are in the way log data is generated, the easier it becomes to use logs across a diverse set of teams. Masked attributes and wildcards Parts of the log messages in patterns are classified as variables and are substituted by masked attributes. The masking process supports and improves the clustering phase by allowing the algorithm to ignore changing details and focus on the repetitive structure. Masked attributes include: date_time ip url uuid Masked attributes are highlighted and are easy to identify, as shown in the following example. one.newrelic.com > Log management > Log patterns: Here is an example of a pattern that has masked attributes. Log patterns extract other less trivial variables that don't belong to any masked attribute. These variables are indicated as wildcards *. one.newrelic.com > Log management > Log patterns: Here is an example of how wildcards * group variables. Troubleshooting Here are a few reasons why you might have patterns enabled but not see any pattern data. If you're sure none of the items below are true, get help from support.newrelic.com. No data has arrived in the timeframe you're observing. Try expanding the time range you're viewing with the time picker. It's been less than 24 hours since patterns were enabled in the account. This means the ML model may not be generated for the account yet. None of the data coming in has a message field. Patterns will only be generated for values in the message field of a log record. If your logs don't contain message, there will be no data. Put the platform to work with patterns Patterns are a value that is enriched onto the existing log message as a new attribute named newrelic.logPattern. Anything you can do with logs generally can be done with log patterns, such as: Build your own dashboards with patterns, to monitor a specific pattern or group of patterns you care about.

Returns results faster. Accounts can have multiple partitions, and multiple partitions can be queried at the same time. Data partitions also allow data to be mapped to an alternative, or “secondary” namespace with a fixed 30-day retention. This is useful for maintaining compliance with privacy-centric regulations and standards like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Plan your partition Before you start creating partitions, make sure you have the right permissions and a partition plan. Important Logs are routed to partitions during the ingestion process, before data is written to NRDB. Partition rules will not affect logs that were ingested before the rule was created. Required roles and permissions Users require an Admin role to create and modify partition rules. Sizing and organizing a partition You can gain significant performance improvements with proper use of data partitions. Organizing your data into discrete partitions enables you to query them separately or all together. The goals of partitioning your data should be: Create data partitions that align with concepts in your environment or organization that are static or change infrequently (for example, by business unit, team, environment, service, etc.). Ensure each partition remains below 1 TB of daily ingest for optimal performance. Having more partitions allows for more targeted searches, but creating too many partitions can make logs hard to find and increase administrative overhead. Finding the right balance is important. We support 100 partitions maximum per account, but the optimal number for most accounts is 10 to 15 partitions. Choosing a namespace A partition’s namespace determines its retention period. We offer two retention options: Standard: The account’s default retention determined by your New Relic subscription. This is the maximum retention period available in your account and is the namespace you'll select for most of your partitions. Secondary: 30-day retention. All logs sent to a partition that's a member of the Secondary namespace will be purged on a rolling basis 30 days after having been ingested. Secondary retention is not a cost control mechanism; data is billed on ingest. Create partition rules one.newrelic.com > Logs: From the left nav in the Logs UI, select Data partitions, then create a Log_ partition name with the retention namespace, optional description, and matching criteria. To create a new partition rule: Go to one.newrelic.com > Logs. From Manage Data on the left nav of the Logs UI, click Data partitions, then click Create partition rule. Define a Partition name as an alphanumeric string that begins with Log_. Add an optional description. Select the retention namespace for the partition. Set your rule's Matching criteria: Select EQUALS to target logs that match your criteria exactly, or select LIKE to apply a fuzzy match. Click the Enable Rule slider, and click Create. To view a list of data partitions: From Manage Data on the left nav of the Logs UI, click Data partitions. Search data partitions The default partition for all Logs accounts is Log. Any log that is not affected by a partition rule will be stored in the Log partition by default. You can query multiple partitions simultaneously. For best performance, select the smallest number of partitions possible. To search data partitions: From Views and Attributes on the left nav of the Logs UI, click Select partitions. Click one or more partitions you want to query, or search for a partition name. Click Query logs to search your selected partitions. Manage data partitions programatically with NerdGraph If you want to manage your data partitions programatically, you can use NerdGraph, our graphQL API, to do so.

Having more partitions allows for more targeted searches, but creating too many partitions can make logs hard to find and increase administrative overhead. Finding the right balance is important. We support 100 partitions maximum per account, but the optimal number for most accounts is 10 to 15 partitions. Choosing a namespace A partition’s namespace determines its retention period. We offer two retention options: Standard: The account’s default retention determined by your New Relic subscription. This is the maximum retention period available in your account and is the namespace you'll select for most of your partitions. Secondary: 30-day retention. All logs sent to a partition that's a member of the Secondary namespace will be purged on a rolling basis 30 days after having been ingested. Secondary retention is not a cost control mechanism; data is billed on ingest. Create partition rules one.newrelic.com > Logs: From the left nav in the Logs UI, select Data partitions, then create a Log_ partition name with the retention namespace, optional description, and matching criteria. To create a new partition rule: Go to one.newrelic.com > Logs. From Manage Data on the left nav of the Logs UI, click Data partitions, then click Create partition rule. Define a Partition name as an alphanumeric string that begins with Log_. Add an optional description. Select the retention namespace for the partition. Set your rule's Matching criteria: Select EQUALS to target logs that match your criteria exactly, or select LIKE to apply a fuzzy match. Click the Enable Rule slider, and click Create. To view a list of data partitions: From Manage Data on the left nav of the Logs UI, click Data partitions. Search data partitions The default partition for all Logs accounts is Log. Any log that is not affected by a partition rule will be stored in the Log partition by default. You can query multiple partitions simultaneously. For best performance, select the smallest number of partitions possible. To search data partitions: From Views and Attributes on the left nav of the Logs UI, click Select partitions. Click one or more partitions you want to query, or search for a partition name. Click Query logs to search your selected partitions. Manage data partitions programatically with NerdGraph If you want to manage your data partitions programatically, you can use NerdGraph, our graphQL API, to do so. This tutorial shows how to query, create, and delete data partitions using our API.",

      "body": "After log event data has been shipped to New Relic, it can either be stored in our NRDB database or dropped (discarded). We can drop both log events and event attributes via drop filter rules. You can manage drop filter rules using our Logs UI, as explained in this document. You can also use NerdGraph. Savings, security, speed Drop filter rules help you accomplish several important goals: Lower costs by storing only logs relevant to your account. Protect privacy and security by removing personal identifiable information (PII). Reduce noise by removing irrelevant events and attributes. Caution Use caution when deciding to drop data. The data you drop is not recoverable. Before using this feature, review the responsibilities and considerations for dropping data. How drop filter rules work A drop filter rule matches data based on a query. When triggered, the drop filter rule removes the matching data from the ingestion pipeline before it is written to NRDB. This creates an explicit demarcation between the logs being forwarded from your domain and the data that New Relic collects. Since the data removed by the drop filter rule doesn't reach our backend, it cannot be queried: the data is gone and cannot be restored. During the ingestion process, customer log data can be parsed, transformed, or dropped before being stored in New Relic's database. Cautions when dropping data When creating drop rules, you are responsible for ensuring that the rules accurately identify and discard the data that meets the conditions that you have established. You are also responsible for monitoring the rule, as well as the data you disclose to New Relic. New Relic cannot guarantee that this functionality will completely resolve data disclosure concerns you may have. New Relic doesn't review or monitor how effective the rules you develop are. Creating rules about sensitive data can leak information about what kinds of data you maintain, including the format of your data or systems (for example, through referencing email addresses or specific credit card numbers). Any user with the relevant role-based access control permissions can view and edit all information in the rules you create. Create drop filter rules To create and edit drop filters, you must have admin permissions in New Relic, or you must be a member of a role with create and edit permissions for Logging Parsing Rules. Once a drop filter rule is active, it's applied to all log events ingested from that point onwards. Rules are not applied retroactively. Logs collected before creating a rule are not filtered by that rule. one.newrelic.com > Logs: Filter or query the set of logs that contain the data you want to drop. Then, from Manage Data on the left nav of the Logs UI, click Create drop filter. To create a new drop filter rule, you can use new or existing log queries. Go to one.newrelic.com > Logs. Filter or query to the specific set of logs that contain the data to be dropped. Once the query is active, from Manage Data on the left nav of the Logs UI, click Create drop filter. Recommendation: Change the drop rule's default name to a meaningful name. Choose to either drop the entire log event that matches the query or just a specific subset of attributes in the matching events. Review the log partitions where this drop rule applies. Save the drop filter rule. Types of drop filter rules The drop filters UI prompts you to select whether to drop logs based on the query or on specific attributes. Drop log events The default type of drop filter rule is to drop logs. This option drops the entire log events that match the filter or query. When creating a rule, try to provide a specific query that only matches log data that should be dropped. Our drop filters process won't let you create drop filter rules without values in the matching query. This prevents badly formed rules from dropping all log data. Drop attributes You can specify attributes to be dropped in a log event that matches your query. At least one or more attributes must be selected. Any attribute which is selected will be dropped; all remaining attributes will be kept and stored in NRDB. Tip We recommend this method for removing fields that could contain personal identifiable information (PII) or other sensitive attributes without losing valuable monitoring data. View or delete drop filter rules To view or delete a drop filter rule: Go to one.newrelic.com > Logs. From Manage Data on the left nav of the Logs UI, click Drop filters. Click the delete icon next to the drop filter rule you want to remove. Once deleted, rules no longer filter ingested log events.",

To drill down into additional details, click any highlighted attribute. one.newrelic.com > Logs: Each log's summary provides query options to add, exclude, replace, and more. Query structure Using the Logs UI, you can search through your log data by entering either simple keywords, such as new and relic, or phrases such as new relic agent, directly into the search field. You can also combine keywords or phrases with operators to form more complex queries. Tip Log queries in New Relic are based on the Lucene query language, and any Lucene function listed in this document is supported. (If a Lucene function is not listed, we do not support it.) For some helpful examples, check out this Lucene tutorial. General query rules: Log query rules Comments Case sensitive The query syntax is case sensitive for attributes values. Attribute names are always case sensitive. Exception: Wildcard searches are case insensitive for attribute values. Special characters When a term contains special characters, double-quote the term and escape the special characters using a backslash (\\). This includes special characters such as +, -, &, |, !, (, ), {, }, [, ], ^, \", ~, *, ?, :, /, or \\. Example: To query for \"POST /log/v1 HTTP/1.1\" 202, escape the quotes like this: \"\\\"POST /log/v1 HTTP/1.1\\\" 202\" Wildcard searches You can run wildcard searches using an asterisk (*) to replace zero or more characters. Example: new*relic Search with text To return more specific query results, use text searches to join together keywords or phrases. Text operators The Logs query syntax accepts the following text operators: Condition Text operator example Matching (keyword) Search for log results containing keywords entered separately: \"new\" \"relic\" Exact matching (phrase) Search for log results containing the specific phrase entered: \"new relic agent\" Either / Or Search for log results containing either or both of the keywords entered: new OR relic And Search for log results containing both of the keywords entered: new AND relic * Wildcard (zero or more) Search for log results containing both of the keywords entered, with zero or more characters between them: new*relic Negation (keyword) Search for log results that do not contain the specific keyword entered: -new Negation (phrase) Search for log results that do not contain the specific phrase entered. -\"new relic\" Search with attributes Use attribute searches to narrow the query results to a specific attribute or field. General operators The following operators can be used by all types of attributes: Condition General operator example Equal : Search for log results where the attribute equals the keyword specified. Example: The field hostname equals chi: hostname:chi Does not equal - : Search for log results where the attribute does not equal the keyword specified. Example: The field hostname does not equal chi. -hostname:chi Contains * Search for log results where the attribute contains the specified keyword. Example: The field hostname contains chi. hostname:*chi* Does not contain - * Search for log results where the attribute does not contain the specified keyword. Example: The field hostname does not contain chi. -hostname:*chi* Starts with * Search for log results where the attribute starts with the specified keyword specified. Example: The field hostname starts with chi. hostname:chi* Ends with * Search for log results where the attribute ends with the specified keyword specified. Example: The field hostname ends with chi. hostname:*chi Has Search for log results that have the specified field. Example: Has the field user_name. has:user_name Missing Search for log results that are missing the specified field. Example: Missing the field user_name. missing:user_name Numeric operators The following operators can only be used by numeric attributes: Condition Numeric operator example Greater than Search for log results attribute matches that are greater than the given parameter. Example: The field http_response_time_ms is greater than 500. http_response_time_ms:>500 Greater than or equal to Search for log results with attribute matches that are greater than or equal to the given parameter.

      "body": "Log patterns are the fastest way to discover value in log data without searching. Log data is high volume telemetry with a low value per individual record. Searching can quickly lead to logs that provide a root cause explanation, but most data is repetitive and hard to contextualize when browsing. Patterns can make log data discoverable without spending a lot of time reading through low value data. one.newrelic.com > Logs > Patterns: Use patterns as the basis for alerts when the frequency of important data changes, or for configuring drop rules to get rid of unnecessary repetitive data. Technical overview Log patterns functionality applies machine learning to normalize and group log messages that are consistent in format but variable in content. These grouped messages can be sorted, making it easy to find the most frequent or rarest sets of logs in your environment. Use patterns as the basis for alerts when the frequency of important data changes, or to configure drop rules to get rid of unnecessary repetitive data. Log patterns use advanced clustering algorithms to group together similar log messages automatically. With patterns, you can: Orient more quickly through millions of logs. Reduce the time it takes to identify unusual behavior in your log estate. Monitor the frequency of known patterns over time to focus your energy on what matters, and exclude what's irrelevant. Availability Important Log patterns are not available in the EU region. The ability to configure this feature is dependent on role-based permissions. If you see Patterns are turned off in your Log management Patterns UI, click the Configure Patterns button and enable it. If you don't see patterns within 30 minutes of enabling the feature, there may be a lack of data with a message attribute for the system to create a pattern from. Log patterns Limitations and considerations Pricing There is no separate pricing for log patterns. The only cost is for additional data generated and added to your log records. A pattern attribute will be added to all logs that match a pattern. Attributes also may be added when common values are discovered, such as GUIDs, IP addresses, URL, or email addresses. These attributes are automatically extracted from the log message as part of the pattern process. HITRUST accounts The log patterns feature is not FedRAMP compliant. FedRAMP or other HITRUST accounts are not eligible to use patterns. Regional availability Availability for this feature depends on whether you have a US or EU region account: US region accounts can use log patterns. EU region accounts cannot enable log patterns at this time. Parsing limits We have a system of safety limits on memory and CPU resources when processing logs and their patterns. These parsing limits can have an impact on the data you get. For more information, see our documentation about parsing limits. Get started To start examining patterns: Go to one.newrelic.com > Log management, and use the account picker dropdown to select the target account where you want to explore patterns. In the left navigation of the Log management UI, click Patterns. The main log UI changes to show patterns that match the query in the query bar. one.newrelic.com > Log management > Log patterns: The line chart shows the top 5 patterns over time. Use the time picker and query bar to adjust the results. Explore log patterns By default the log patterns UI first shows the most frequent occurrence of patterns. To sort to show the rarest patterns first, click the Count column. You can also use the query bar or attributes bar to filter your log patterns. If you want to... Do this... Understand the rate of change in patterns Look at the line chart. The color-coded patterns correspond to the plot column in the table. You can toggle individual plot patterns to narrow your focus. See the individual log messages that match each pattern Click pattern to expand the row and see a table of individual log records. To see additional records, scroll up or down. To explore an individual log in more detail, click it to open the details panel. Group and filter patterns by their attributes Use the query bar and time picker. As you apply different filters and time windows, the log patterns adjust to your new target data. Create an alert from a pattern Add the pattern to the query bar and run the query. Then click Create alert condition in the left nav. Troubleshoot log messages that haven't been clustered into a pattern Use the Logs with no pattern tab in the Log patterns UI. Clicking a specific log message will open the log message details panel you're familiar with from the Logs management page. Explore logs with no pattern The Logs with no pattern tab groups all recent log messages in your account that were not clustered into a known pattern yet. These log messages don't represent any problem or flaw in the system; they have no pattern because they are too new to have been processed by the machine learning system. This makes them valuable to explore when you want to understand what has recently changed in your environment. one.newrelic.com > Log management > Log patterns: New Relic's log patterns feature automatically groups logs without a matching pattern. For example: Are any of these logs tied to a recent problem? This is a quick way to discover unique log data that is appearing for the first time in your environment. Does your log data have a new format? Sometimes the logs don't represent a problem, but a new format of log data that deviates from the data model you expect your applications to follow. Catching these logs early gives you the opportunity to ask developers to correct any deviations in their log output. The more consistent people are in the way log data is generated, the easier it becomes to use logs across a diverse set of teams. Masked attributes and wildcards Parts of the log messages in patterns are classified as variables and are substituted by masked attributes. The masking process supports and improves the clustering phase by allowing the algorithm to ignore changing details and focus on the repetitive structure. Masked attributes include: date_time ip url uuid Masked attributes are highlighted and are easy to identify, as shown in the following example. one.newrelic.com > Log management > Log patterns: Here is an example of a pattern that has masked attributes. Log patterns extract other less trivial variables that don't belong to any masked attribute. These variables are indicated as wildcards *. one.newrelic.com > Log management > Log patterns: Here is an example of how wildcards * group variables. Troubleshooting Here are a few reasons why you might have patterns enabled but not see any pattern data. If you're sure none of the items below are true, get help from support.newrelic.com. No data has arrived in the timeframe you're observing. Try expanding the time range you're viewing with the time picker. It's been less than 24 hours since patterns were enabled in the account. This means the ML model may not be generated for the account yet. None of the data coming in has a message field. Patterns will only be generated for values in the message field of a log record. If your logs don't contain message, there will be no data. Put the platform to work with patterns Patterns are a value that is enriched onto the existing log message as a new attribute named newrelic.logPattern. Anything you can do with logs generally can be done with log patterns, such as: Build your own dashboards with patterns, to monitor a specific pattern or group of patterns you care about. Create alerts for patterns by adding NRQL alerts. Use baseline alert conditions to detect anomalies in known log patterns.",

      "body": "Data partitions are a way to group or organize log data for faster and more efficient querying. When a query targets a single partition, New Relic Logs: Scans less unrelated data. Returns results faster. Accounts can have multiple partitions, and multiple partitions can be queried at the same time. Data partitions also allow data to be mapped to an alternative, or “secondary” namespace with a fixed 30-day retention. This is useful for maintaining compliance with privacy-centric regulations and standards like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Plan your partition Before you start creating partitions, make sure you have the right permissions and a partition plan. Important Logs are routed to partitions during the ingestion process, before data is written to NRDB. Partition rules will not affect logs that were ingested before the rule was created. Required roles and permissions Users require an Admin role to create and modify partition rules. Sizing and organizing a partition You can gain significant performance improvements with proper use of data partitions. Organizing your data into discrete partitions enables you to query them separately or all together. The goals of partitioning your data should be: Create data partitions that align with concepts in your environment or organization that are static or change infrequently (for example, by business unit, team, environment, service, etc.). Ensure each partition remains below 1 TB of daily ingest for optimal performance. Having more partitions allows for more targeted searches, but creating too many partitions can make logs hard to find and increase administrative overhead. Finding the right balance is important. We support 100 partitions maximum per account, but the optimal number for most accounts is 10 to 15 partitions. Choosing a namespace A partition’s namespace determines its retention period. We offer two retention options: Standard: The account’s default retention determined by your New Relic subscription. This is the maximum retention period available in your account and is the namespace you'll select for most of your partitions. Secondary: 30-day retention. All logs sent to a partition that's a member of the Secondary namespace will be purged on a rolling basis 30 days after having been ingested. Secondary retention is not a cost control mechanism; data is billed on ingest. Create partition rules one.newrelic.com > Logs: From the left nav in the Logs UI, select Data partitions, then create a Log_ partition name with the retention namespace, optional description, and matching criteria. To create a new partition rule: Go to one.newrelic.com > Logs. From Manage Data on the left nav of the Logs UI, click Data partitions, then click Create partition rule. Define a Partition name as an alphanumeric string that begins with Log_. Add an optional description. Select the retention namespace for the partition. Set your rule's Matching criteria: Select EQUALS to target logs that match your criteria exactly, or select LIKE to apply a fuzzy match. Click the Enable Rule slider, and click Create. To view a list of data partitions: From Manage Data on the left nav of the Logs UI, click Data partitions. Search data partitions The default partition for all Logs accounts is Log. Any log that is not affected by a partition rule will be stored in the Log partition by default. You can query multiple partitions simultaneously. For best performance, select the smallest number of partitions possible. To search data partitions: From Views and Attributes on the left nav of the Logs UI, click Select partitions. Click one or more partitions you want to query, or search for a partition name. Click Query logs to search your selected partitions.

To drill down into additional details, click any highlighted attribute. one.newrelic.com > Logs: Each log's summary provides query options to add, exclude, replace, and more. Query structure Using the Logs UI, you can search through your log data by entering either simple keywords, such as new and relic, or phrases such as new relic agent, directly into the search field. You can also combine keywords or phrases with operators to form more complex queries. Tip Log queries in New Relic are based on the Lucene query language, and any Lucene function listed in this document is supported. (If a Lucene function is not listed, we do not support it.) For some helpful examples, check out this Lucene tutorial. General query rules: Log query rules Comments Case sensitive The query syntax is case sensitive for attributes values. Attribute names are always case sensitive. Exception: Wildcard searches are case insensitive for attribute values. Special characters When a term contains special characters, double-quote the term and escape the special characters using a backslash (\\). This includes special characters such as +, -, &, |, !, (, ), {, }, [, ], ^, \", ~, *, ?, :, /, or \\. Example: To query for \"POST /log/v1 HTTP/1.1\" 202, escape the quotes like this: \"\\\"POST /log/v1 HTTP/1.1\\\" 202\" Wildcard searches You can run wildcard searches using an asterisk (*) to replace zero or more characters. Example: new*relic Search with text To return more specific query results, use text searches to join together keywords or phrases. Text operators The Logs query syntax accepts the following text operators: Condition Text operator example Matching (keyword) Search for log results containing keywords entered separately: \"new\" \"relic\" Exact matching (phrase) Search for log results containing the specific phrase entered: \"new relic agent\" Either / Or Search for log results containing either or both of the keywords entered: new OR relic And Search for log results containing both of the keywords entered: new AND relic * Wildcard (zero or more) Search for log results containing both of the keywords entered, with zero or more characters between them: new*relic Negation (keyword) Search for log results that do not contain the specific keyword entered: -new Negation (phrase) Search for log results that do not contain the specific phrase entered. -\"new relic\" Search with attributes Use attribute searches to narrow the query results to a specific attribute or field. General operators The following operators can be used by all types of attributes: Condition General operator example Equal : Search for log results where the attribute equals the keyword specified. Example: The field hostname equals chi: hostname:chi Does not equal - : Search for log results where the attribute does not equal the keyword specified. Example: The field hostname does not equal chi. -hostname:chi Contains * Search for log results where the attribute contains the specified keyword. Example: The field hostname contains chi. hostname:*chi* Does not contain - * Search for log results where the attribute does not contain the specified keyword. Example: The field hostname does not contain chi. -hostname:*chi* Starts with * Search for log results where the attribute starts with the specified keyword specified. Example: The field hostname starts with chi. hostname:chi* Ends with * Search for log results where the attribute ends with the specified keyword specified. Example: The field hostname ends with chi. hostname:*chi Has Search for log results that have the specified field. Example: Has the field user_name. has:user_name Missing Search for log results that are missing the specified field. Example: Missing the field user_name. missing:user_name Numeric operators The following operators can only be used by numeric attributes: Condition Numeric operator example Greater than Search for log results attribute matches that are greater than the given parameter. Example: The field http_response_time_ms is greater than 500. http_response_time_ms:>500 Greater than or equal to Search for log results with attribute matches that are greater than or equal to the given parameter.

      "body": "Log patterns are the fastest way to discover value in log data without searching. Log data is high volume telemetry with a low value per individual record. Searching can quickly lead to logs that provide a root cause explanation, but most data is repetitive and hard to contextualize when browsing. Patterns can make log data discoverable without spending a lot of time reading through low value data. one.newrelic.com > Logs > Patterns: Use patterns as the basis for alerts when the frequency of important data changes, or for configuring drop rules to get rid of unnecessary repetitive data. Technical overview Log patterns functionality applies machine learning to normalize and group log messages that are consistent in format but variable in content. These grouped messages can be sorted, making it easy to find the most frequent or rarest sets of logs in your environment. Use patterns as the basis for alerts when the frequency of important data changes, or to configure drop rules to get rid of unnecessary repetitive data. Log patterns use advanced clustering algorithms to group together similar log messages automatically. With patterns, you can: Orient more quickly through millions of logs. Reduce the time it takes to identify unusual behavior in your log estate. Monitor the frequency of known patterns over time to focus your energy on what matters, and exclude what's irrelevant. Availability Important Log patterns are not available in the EU region. The ability to configure this feature is dependent on role-based permissions. If you see Patterns are turned off in your Log management Patterns UI, click the Configure Patterns button and enable it. If you don't see patterns within 30 minutes of enabling the feature, there may be a lack of data with a message attribute for the system to create a pattern from. Log patterns Limitations and considerations Pricing There is no separate pricing for log patterns. The only cost is for additional data generated and added to your log records. A pattern attribute will be added to all logs that match a pattern. Attributes also may be added when common values are discovered, such as GUIDs, IP addresses, URL, or email addresses. These attributes are automatically extracted from the log message as part of the pattern process. HITRUST accounts The log patterns feature is not FedRAMP compliant. FedRAMP or other HITRUST accounts are not eligible to use patterns. Regional availability Availability for this feature depends on whether you have a US or EU region account: US region accounts can use log patterns. EU region accounts cannot enable log patterns at this time. Parsing limits We have a system of safety limits on memory and CPU resources when processing logs and their patterns. These parsing limits can have an impact on the data you get. For more information, see our documentation about parsing limits. Get started To start examining patterns: Go to one.newrelic.com > Log management, and use the account picker dropdown to select the target account where you want to explore patterns. In the left navigation of the Log management UI, click Patterns. The main log UI changes to show patterns that match the query in the query bar. one.newrelic.com > Log management > Log patterns: The line chart shows the top 5 patterns over time. Use the time picker and query bar to adjust the results. Explore log patterns By default the log patterns UI first shows the most frequent occurrence of patterns. To sort to show the rarest patterns first, click the Count column. You can also use the query bar or attributes bar to filter your log patterns. If you want to... Do this... Understand the rate of change in patterns Look at the line chart. The color-coded patterns correspond to the plot column in the table. You can toggle individual plot patterns to narrow your focus. See the individual log messages that match each pattern Click pattern to expand the row and see a table of individual log records. To see additional records, scroll up or down. To explore an individual log in more detail, click it to open the details panel. Group and filter patterns by their attributes Use the query bar and time picker. As you apply different filters and time windows, the log patterns adjust to your new target data. Create an alert from a pattern Add the pattern to the query bar and run the query. Then click Create alert condition in the left nav. Troubleshoot log messages that haven't been clustered into a pattern Use the Logs with no pattern tab in the Log patterns UI. Clicking a specific log message will open the log message details panel you're familiar with from the Logs management page. Explore logs with no pattern The Logs with no pattern tab groups all recent log messages in your account that were not clustered into a known pattern yet. These log messages don't represent any problem or flaw in the system; they have no pattern because they are too new to have been processed by the machine learning system. This makes them valuable to explore when you want to understand what has recently changed in your environment. one.newrelic.com > Log management > Log patterns: New Relic's log patterns feature automatically groups logs without a matching pattern. For example: Are any of these logs tied to a recent problem? This is a quick way to discover unique log data that is appearing for the first time in your environment. Does your log data have a new format? Sometimes the logs don't represent a problem, but a new format of log data that deviates from the data model you expect your applications to follow. Catching these logs early gives you the opportunity to ask developers to correct any deviations in their log output. The more consistent people are in the way log data is generated, the easier it becomes to use logs across a diverse set of teams. Masked attributes and wildcards Parts of the log messages in patterns are classified as variables and are substituted by masked attributes. The masking process supports and improves the clustering phase by allowing the algorithm to ignore changing details and focus on the repetitive structure. Masked attributes include: date_time ip url uuid Masked attributes are highlighted and are easy to identify, as shown in the following example. one.newrelic.com > Log management > Log patterns: Here is an example of a pattern that has masked attributes. Log patterns extract other less trivial variables that don't belong to any masked attribute. These variables are indicated as wildcards *. one.newrelic.com > Log management > Log patterns: Here is an example of how wildcards * group variables. Troubleshooting Here are a few reasons why you might have patterns enabled but not see any pattern data. If you're sure none of the items below are true, get help from support.newrelic.com. No data has arrived in the timeframe you're observing. Try expanding the time range you're viewing with the time picker. It's been less than 24 hours since patterns were enabled in the account. This means the ML model may not be generated for the account yet. None of the data coming in has a message field. Patterns will only be generated for values in the message field of a log record. If your logs don't contain message, there will be no data. Put the platform to work with patterns Patterns are a value that is enriched onto the existing log message as a new attribute named newrelic.logPattern. Anything you can do with logs generally can be done with log patterns, such as: Build your own dashboards with patterns, to monitor a specific pattern or group of patterns you care about. Create alerts for patterns by adding NRQL alerts. Use baseline alert conditions to detect anomalies in known log patterns.",

Returns results faster. Accounts can have multiple partitions, and multiple partitions can be queried at the same time. Data partitions also allow data to be mapped to an alternative, or “secondary” namespace with a fixed 30-day retention. This is useful for maintaining compliance with privacy-centric regulations and standards like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Plan your partition Before you start creating partitions, make sure you have the right permissions and a partition plan. Important Logs are routed to partitions during the ingestion process, before data is written to NRDB. Partition rules will not affect logs that were ingested before the rule was created. Required roles and permissions Users require an Admin role to create and modify partition rules. Sizing and organizing a partition You can gain significant performance improvements with proper use of data partitions. Organizing your data into discrete partitions enables you to query them separately or all together. The goals of partitioning your data should be: Create data partitions that align with concepts in your environment or organization that are static or change infrequently (for example, by business unit, team, environment, service, etc.). Ensure each partition remains below 1 TB of daily ingest for optimal performance. Having more partitions allows for more targeted searches, but creating too many partitions can make logs hard to find and increase administrative overhead. Finding the right balance is important.

Time range When viewing an application or host, you can change the visible time frame by using the clock icon in the top right of the page. This feature is similar to the standard New Relic time picker. Features include: Scrub the New Relic charts to move back and forth across the timeline. Select the time picker to choose a time range that ends now (from 30 minutes to 90 days ago). For iPads: to specify an end time other than now, slide the toggle from Ending Now to Custom Date. Synthetic monitoring You can use the iOS app to view your synthetic monitoring data, including charts of your monitor's availability, load times, and load sizes. Select the caret icon to view more detailed charts. You can mute or disable your monitor, and view details of any recent errors. For scripted monitors, you can view and search the script log. Alerts When you connect the iOS app to your New Relic account, your device is automatically associated with your user channel. Then, you can add your user channel to your target policy to receive alerts. For iOS alerts, notifications appear on your lock screen and can be viewed by swiping the alert. You can select any alert to view error details or acknowledge the alert. New Relic also sends a push notification when a colleague acknowledges an open event. Then, New Relic sends a final, closing notification when all Critical events end. Mobile monitoring If you have a mobile application and have installed mobile monitoring, you can monitor its performance directly from your iPhone or iPad. Mobile monitoring includes network errors, API calls, and number of active users. You can also view detailed individual crash reports for a deeper understanding of a particular crash incident.

      "body": "This document provides information on FedRAMP-compliant endpoints in New Relic. For more information about our security accreditation for the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP), see our data encryption documentation. Customer FedRAMP obligations New Relic customers must meet all of the following requirements for New Relic’s FedRAMP environment: New Relic-approved customers: New Relic’s FedRAMP-Moderate authorized environment is only available to New Relic-approved customers. For more information, contact your New Relic account representative. Order form: Customer’s order form with New Relic must include customer’s eligibility for FedRAMP. Subscription level: Customer must have a current and valid subscription to New Relic Full-Stack Observability Enterprise or New Relic-approved subscription. Authorized New Relic endpoints: Customer must send its data only to New Relic’s FedRAMP-designated endpoints. Authorized services and features: Customer must use only FedRAMP audited and authorized New Relic services and features (see below). Overview of data sources There are multiple ways to get data into New Relic. This doc has two sections: Agent settings: for our APM agents, infrastructure agent, browser agent, and mobile agent. Data-ingest APIs: for our Metric API, Event API, Trace API, and Log API, and the integrations that use those APIs. Agents New Relic has several agents for reporting data, like our APM agents, infrastructure agents, mobile agents, and browser agent. Setting these agents to send FedRAMP-compliant data involves setting a configuration setting to use the relevant FedRAMP endpoint. APM agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance, all APM agent configurations must report to gov-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. Depending on the agent, you can either use code-based configuration or an environment variable. Here are details on enabling this: Language Code or environment variable C SDK In code: strcpy(_newrelic_app_config_t->redirect_collector, \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"); Copy Environment variable: none Go In code: app, err = newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"App Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(os.Getenv(\"NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY\")), func(cfg *newrelic.Config) { cfg.Host = \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" }, ) Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Java In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Or set a system property of: newrelic.config.host Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST .NET In your XML config next to the license key: <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" host=\"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"/> Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Node.js In newrelic.js: host: 'gov-collector.newrelic.com' Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST PHP In newrelic.ini: newrelic.daemon.collector_host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: none Python In newrelic.ini: [newrelic] host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Ruby In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Elixir (open source agent) In config.exs: config :new_relic_agent, host: \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST For more on configuring APM agents, see APM configuration. Mobile monitoring agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using our mobile monitoring agents, all agent configurations must report to gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. You must use code-based configuration. Environment variables are not available. Framework-specific configurations: Agent Code or environment variable Android In code: NewRelic.withApplicationToken({APP_TOKEN}) .usingCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\") .usingCrashCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\") .start(this.getApplication()); Copy Environment variable: none iOS In code: [NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:@\"{APP_TOKEN}\" andCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\" andCrashCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\"]; Copy Environment variable: none Infrastructure monitoring If you have infrastructure agent version 1.15.0 or higher, simply enable the FedRAMP configuration option. If you have an older agent version, use the following values to edit your YAML configuration: Infrastructure agent versions below 1.15.0 If you have an infrastructure agent version below 1.15.0, you must change three of the endpoints used for reporting. To set these endpoints, you can change your YAML configuration or use environment variables. YAML config field Endpoint URL collector_url https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy identity_url https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy command_channel_url https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy To edit environment variables, use these values: Environment variable Endpoint URL NRIA_COLLECTOR_URL https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_IDENTITY_URL https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_COMMAND_CHANNEL_URL https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy Browser agent To configure the browser agent to use a FedRAMP-compliant endpoint, you must use the copy-paste method method (other browser agent install methods are not supported) and edit the browser code’s script element tag so that the domain is gov-bam.nr-data.net for both beacon and errorBeacon, like this: window.NREUM||(NREUM={});NREUM.info={\"beacon\":\"gov-bam.nr-data.net\",\"errorBeacon\":\"gov-bam.nr-data.net\"... Copy Note: You only need to modify the beacon and errorBeacon properties in the NREUM.info object. These values will override the default values found in the NR loader script. Data-ingest APIs Below are details about the FedRAMP endpoint for our ingest APIs: Metric API, the Event API, the Log API, and the Trace API. Metric API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the Metric API, instead of sending metric data to the default Metric API endpoint of https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1, it must be sent to https://gov-metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1. The Metric API can be used directly but it's mainly used by various New Relic tools. Below are instructions showing where to edit the configuration for setting the FedRAMP endpoint. Telemetry integrations Here are instructions for our open source telemetry integrations that report metric data: Dropwizard: use the overrideUri configuration. Kamon: use the metric-ingest-url configuration. See Override endpoints. Micrometer: override the public String uri() method on your NewRelicRegistryConfig to return the new endpoint. See an example. Prometheus: Prometheus OpenMetrics: if you are using our nri-prometheus helm chart, you can change the endpoint in your values.yml file, like in this example. If you're using the nri-bundle chart, you need to nest this value under the nri-prometheus key to propagate it to the sub-chart. Remote write integration: not available. Telemetry SDKs Here are instructions for our Telemetry SDKs that report metric data: Go: use the MetricsURLOverride configuration. Java: in the MetricBatchSender section, configure the endpoint. See an example. .NET: use the MetricUrlOverride configuration. Node.js: edit the METRIC_HOST = 'metric-api.newrelic.com' configuration. Python: edit the HOST = \"metric-api.newrelic.com\" configuration. Event API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for the Event API, all traffic reporting to insights-collector.newrelic.com must instead report to gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com. The Event API endpoint is configurable for the following Telemetry SDKs. The Telemetry SDKs are used by our open-source telemetry integrations. Language Solution Java Telemetry SDK In code: SenderConfiguration configuration = SenderConfiguration .builder( \"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\", EventBatchSender.EVENTS_PATH) .build(); EventBatchSender eventBatchSender = EventBatchSender.create(configuration); Copy Python Telemetry SDK In code: event_client = EventClient(host=\"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\") Copy For more information, see our Telemetry API documentation in GitHub. Log API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Log API, the solution for almost all our logging tools is to replace the https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 endpoint with https://gov-log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1. Here are details for various tools: Log forwarders Here are details on changing the endpoint for our log forwarders: AWS Firelens: Add the endpoint property to the options field of the logConfiguration, similar to to the EU account endpoint change shown in these Firelens endpoint configuration instructions. Fluentbit: Use our Fluentbit endpoint configuration. Fluentd: Use our Fluentd endpoint instructions. Infrastructure agent: See FedRAMP for infrastructure. Kubernetes: Our Kubernetes integration logs are based on fluentbit’s output plugin. Use these endpoint instructions. Logstash: Use our Logstash endpoint configuration. Syslog: For configuring syslog clients, see TCP endpoint configuration. S3: Not available. Vector: Not available. To use the Log API directly, you'd edit the Log API endpoint configuration. Trace API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Trace API (including telemetry integrations that use this API), replace the https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1 endpoint with https://gov-trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1. Notes about FedRAMP compliance for other trace data: Trace data is reported by some of our agents, like our APM agents, browser agent, and mobile agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for that data, you would enable FedRAMP for the applicable agent. Currently Infinite Tracing is not FedRAMP compliant.",

      "body": "Currently New Relic supports two versions of the Synthetics API: v1 and v3. Version 3 was released October 2016. Version 1 is deprecated and will eventually no longer be available. No termination date has been announced. However, no further development or modifications will be made to v1. Caution Recommendation: Create new monitors using the v3 Synthetics API and migrate v1 scripts to their v3 equivalent. To use the REST API for New Relic's synthetic monitoring, you must activate API access and generate your Admin User's API key from your account settings. Then you can make standard API calls via the command line. Managing simple and scripted monitors You must use your Admin User's API key to make Synthetics REST API calls. The account's REST API key will not work. Caution The Synthetics REST API limits an account's rate of requests to three requests per second. Requests made in excess of this threshold will return a 429 response code. These examples show curl commands: Get all monitors To view a list of all monitors in New Relic for your account, send a GET request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors. For example: curl -v \\ -H 'X-Api-Key:{Admin_User_Key}' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors Copy A successful request will return a 200 OK response. The data returned will be a JSON object in the following format: { \"count\": integer, \"monitors\": [ { \"id\": UUID, \"name\": string, \"type\": string, \"frequency\": integer, \"uri\": string, \"locations\": array of strings, \"status\": string, \"slaThreshold\": double, \"userId\": integer, \"apiVersion\": string } ] } Copy Get a specific monitor To view a single existing monitor in New Relic, send a GET request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}. Replace the { id} in the following example with the specific monitor ID. curl -v \\ -H 'X-Api-Key:{Admin_User_Key}' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id} Copy A successful request will return a 200 OK response. The data returned will be a JSON object in the following format: { \"id\": UUID, \"name\": string, \"type\": string, \"frequency\": integer, \"uri\": string, \"locations\": array of strings, \"status\": string, \"slaThreshold\": double, \"userId\": integer, \"apiVersion\": string } Copy An invalid monitor ID will return the error 404 Not Found: The specified monitor doesn't exist. Create a monitor To add a new monitor to your account in New Relic, send a POST request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors with a JSON payload that describes the monitor: { \"name\": string [required], \"type\": string (SIMPLE, BROWSER, SCRIPT_API, SCRIPT_BROWSER) [required], \"frequency\": integer (minutes) [required, must be one of 1, 5, 10, 15, 30, 60, 360, 720, or 1440], \"uri\": string [required for SIMPLE and BROWSER type], \"locations\": array of strings (send a GET request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/locations to get a list of valid locations) [at least one required], \"status\": string (ENABLED, MUTED, DISABLED) [required], \"slaThreshold\": double, } Copy In addition, to add a scripted monitor via the REST API, call an additional API endpoint to send the script for the monitor just created. Replace the Synthetics REST API attributes in the following example with your specific values. curl -v \\ -X POST -H 'X-Api-Key:{Admin_User_Key}' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors \\ -d '{ \"name\" : \"monitor1\", \"frequency\" : 15, \"uri\" : \"http://my-uri.com\", \"locations\" : [ \"AWS_US_WEST_1\" ], \"type\" : \"browser\"}' Copy A successful request will return a 201 Created response, with the URI of the newly-created monitor specified in the location header. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: One or more of the monitor values is invalid, or the format of the request is invalid. For example, the frequency is out of bounds or one or more of the specified locations is invalid (See the error message in the body of the response.) 402 Payment Required: Creating the monitor will increase your scheduled checks past your account's purchased check limit. Update an existing monitor To update an existing monitor in New Relic, send a PUT request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}. In addition, for scripted monitors, follow the procedures to update the BASE64 encoded script. Replace the { id} in the following example with the specific monitor ID, and replace the Synthetics REST API attributes with your specific values. curl -v \\ -X PUT -H 'X-Api-Key:{Admin_User_Key}' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id} \\ -d '{ \"name\" : \"updated monitor name\", \"type\" : \"simple\", \"frequency\" : 15, \"uri\" : \"http://my-uri.com/\", \"locations\" : [ \"AWS_US_WEST_1\" ], \"status\" : \"enabled\", \"slaThreshold\": \"7.0\" }' Copy PUT requests are intended to replace target entities, so all attributes required in the JSON payload when creating a new monitor are also required when updating an existing monitor. A successful request will return a 204 No Content response, with an empty body. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: One or more of the monitor values is invalid, or the format of the request is invalid. For example, the frequency is out of bounds or one or more of the specified locations is invalid (See the error message in the body of the response.) 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Delete an existing monitor To delete an existing monitor in New Relic, send a DELETE request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}. Replace the { id} in the following example with the specific monitor ID. curl -v \\ -H 'X-Api-Key:{Admin_User_Key}' \\ -X DELETE https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id} Copy A successful request will return a 204 No Content response, with an empty body. An unsuccessful request will return the response, 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Get list of valid locations To retrieve the list of valid locations in New Relic, use the following command. curl -v \\ -X GET -H 'X-Api-Key:{Admin_User_Key}' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/locations Copy Managing scripted monitors In addition to the general API, there are several API methods for the scripted browser (SCRIPT_BROWSER) and api test (SCRIPT_API) monitor types. These examples show curl commands. Get monitor script To view the script associated with a specific SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API monitor in New Relic for your account, send a GET request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}/script. Replace the { id} with the specific monitor ID. For example: curl -v -H 'X-Api-Key: {Admin_User_Key}' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}/script Copy A successful request will return a 200 OK response. The data returned will be a JSON object in the following format: { \"scriptText\": BASE64 encoded string } Copy Possible error codes include: 403 Forbidden: The specified monitor is not of type SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API. 404 Not Found: The specified monitor doesn't exist or the script associated with the monitor doesn't exist. Add scripted monitor To add a new scripted monitor to New Relic with the REST API: Follow standard API procedures to add a new monitor, and identify the type as a SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API. Update the new monitor with a BASE64 encoded version of the script to the ${MONITOR_UUID}/script endpoint. For more information, refer to the example. Update monitor script To update the script associated with a specific SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API monitor in New Relic for your account, send a PUT request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}/script with a JSON payload that contains the scriptText (required). The scriptLocations data is required only for private locations with Verified Script Execution turned on. The password used to generate the HMAC string must match the password set for the private location. When generating the HMAC string, use the SHA256 algorithm. { \"scriptText\": BASE64 encoded String, \"scriptLocations\": [ { \"name\": Location name, \"hmac\" BASE64 encoded String of SHA256 HMAC for location } ] } Copy Replace the { id} with the specific monitor ID. Here is an example for the script: var assert = require('assert'); assert.equal('1', '1'); Copy This example uses password as the password for the scriptLocation. curl -v -H 'X-Api-Key: '{Admin_User_Key}' -H 'content-type: application/json' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}/script -d '{ \"scriptText\": \"dmFyIGFzc2VydCA9IHJlcXVpcmUoJ2Fzc2VydCcpOw0KYXNzZXJ0LmVxdWFsKCcxJywgJzEnKTs=\",\"scriptLocations\": [ { \"name\": \"my_vse_enabled_location\", \"hmac\": \"MjhiNGE4MjVlMDE1N2M4NDQ4MjNjNDFkZDEyYTRjMmUzZDE3NGJlNjU0MWFmOTJlMzNiODExOGU2ZjhkZTY4\"} ]}' Copy A successful request will return a 204 No Content response with an empty body. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: Invalid BASE64 encoded string for scriptText or hmac. 403 Forbidden: The specified monitor is not of the type SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API. 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Scripted browser example Here is an example of using New Relic's REST API and the bash script to create a scripted browser monitor. Scripted browser API example The following example shows curl commands to create a scripted browser monitor. At the top of the script, replace the variables with your specific values. For the scriptfile variable, identify the filename for the script to be created. Here is a sample script that can be saved as sample_synth_script.js to use in the example: var assert = require(\"assert\"); $browser.get(\"http://example.com\").then(function(){ // Check the H1 title matches \"Example Domain\" return $browser.findElement($driver.By.css(\"h1\")).then(function(element){ return element.getText().then(function(text){ assert.equal(\"Example Domain\", text, \"Page H1 title did not match\"); }); }); }).then(function(){ // Check that the external link matches \"http://www.iana.org/domains/example\" return $browser.findElement($driver.By.css(\"div > p > a\")).then(function(element){ return element.getAttribute(\"href\").then(function(link){ assert.equal(\"http://www.iana.org/domains/example\", link, \"More information link did not match\"); }); }); }); Copy Bash script example This example show the bash script that will create the SCRIPTED_BROWSER monitor. #!/bin/bash # Admin API key from your account settings adminAPIKey='' # Other attributes found at https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/synthetics-rest-api/monitor-examples/attributes-synthetics-rest-api#api-attributes monitorName='Test API Script' monitorType='SCRIPT_BROWSER' frequency=1440 locations='\"AWS_US_WEST_1\", \"AWS_US_EAST_1\"' slaThreshold=7.0 # Location of the file with your script scriptfile=sample_synth_script.js # Test that the script file exists (does not validate content) if [ -e \"$scriptfile\" ] then script=$(cat \"$scriptfile\") payload=\"{ \\\"name\\\" : \\\"$monitorName\\\", \\\"frequency\\\" : $frequency, \\\"locations\\\" : [ $locations ], \\\"status\\\" : \\\"ENABLED\\\", \\\"type\\\" : \\\"$monitorType\\\", \\\"slaThreshold\\\" : $slaThreshold, \\\"uri\\\":\\\"\\\"}\" echo \"Creating monitor\" # Make cURL call to API and parse response headers to get monitor UUID shopt -s extglob # Required to trim whitespace; see below while IFS=':' read key value; do # trim whitespace in \"value\" value=${value##+([[:space:]])}; value=${value%%+([[:space:]])} case \"$key\" in location) LOCATION=\"$value\" ;; HTTP*) read PROTO STATUS MSG <<< \"$key{$value:+:$value}\" ;; esac done < <(curl -sS -i -X POST -H \"X-Api-Key:$adminAPIKey\" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors -d \"$payload\") # Validate monitor creation & add script unless it failed if [ $STATUS = 201 ]; then echo \"Monitor created, $LOCATION \" echo \"Uploading script\" # base64 encode script encoded=`echo \"$script\" | base64` scriptPayload='{\"scriptText\":\"'$encoded'\"}' curl -s -X PUT -H \"X-Api-Key:$adminAPIKey\" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \"$LOCATION/script\" -d $scriptPayload echo \"Script uploaded\" else echo \"Monitor creation failed\" fi else echo \"script file not found, not creating monitor\" fi Copy Synthetics attributes Here are the attributes used with Synthetics REST API calls, listed in alphabetical order. Synthetics API attribute Definition apiVersion String: The version number. emails Array of strings: Email addresses for alert notifications with New Relic. frequency Integer: Number of minutes between checks. Valid values include 1, 5, 15, 30, 60, 360, 720, and 1440. id The UUID for the specific Synthetics monitor. locations Array of strings: Array of locations by full label. name String: The monitor's name. scriptLocations String: The name and hmac values for private locations using Verified Script Execution. scriptText String: The BASE64 encoded text for scripted monitors. slaThreshold Double: Value for the Synthetics SLA report, in seconds. status String: Valid values include ENABLED, MUTED, and DISABLED. type String: Type of monitor. Valid values include: SIMPLE (Ping) BROWSER SCRIPT_BROWSER SCRIPT_API uri String: The URI for SIMPLE and BROWSER monitor types; for example, http://my-site.com. Optional for SCRIPT_BROWSER and SCRIPT_API. userID Integer: The specific user ID. Specific monitor endpoint When making REST API calls for a specific monitor, include the monitor_uuid as part of the endpoint. The monitor_uuid is the GUID which is part of the URL. For example, a selected Synthetics monitor has this URL: https://synthetics.newrelic.com/accounts/nnnn/monitors/ab123-c456d-e78-90123-f45g Copy The monitor_uuid is the value that follows /monitors/.

How version numbers are obtained The way that mobile monitoring obtains the version number varies by platform: Android The Android agent obtains the version information from the android:versionName property in the manifest. iOS The iOS agent uses both CFBundleShortVersionString and CFBundleVersion properties to obtain the app version. The agent accesses those properties through iOS APIs. It does not obtain them by reading the info.plist file.",

Use our standard page functions to look for trends in the HTTP analysis charts. Target specific request and response attributes by grouping, sorting, and filtering the data. Understand HTTP request data Here are some places to find the most important HTTP request information: Response time chart The response time chart shows how your app's network calls are performing across percentiles. Use it to compare the average response time to the 1st, 50th, and 99th percentile. Percentiles let you filter out outliers that may be making your average response time higher than expected.

Select the chart title to go to the HTTP errors page for more detail on the errors and failures. Total requests Sort by Total requests to identify which network requests are being used most frequently. The reason this can be helpful is because your slowest network calls may be only infrequently used, while more frequently used requests might be more worthy of optimization even if they are not the slowest.

This may lead to users deleting your app, which in turn may affect your organization's profitability. With the Handled exceptions UI, mobile development managers and their developer teams can identify significant factors affecting poor mobile app experience, and use filterable data to find a resolution more quickly. Features Handling exceptions as they occur can help improve your mobile app users' experience, but it's not enough to catch exceptions. You also need to know how to prevent them. For example: How many different types of handled exceptions are occurring? A high occurrence rate may necessitate changes to the back-end systems. Why does the user's app usage result in a try/catch? What is the context for the exceptions? When can a test environment's responses to handled exceptions indicate additional, more serious problems? What would have caused a crash if the exception had not been caught in production? What else (in the code or back-end API) is still affecting the users' experience? By using handled exceptions, you can identify and resolve these kinds of issues more quickly. one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Exceptions > Handled exceptions: As you explore the wealth of data in the charts and table, use groups and filters to discover patterns that help you determine the root cause of mobile app exceptions. Handled exception features Comments Slice and dice your exception data. You can view exception data via API as well as the UI: Use the recordHandledException() method within a try{...} catch(){...} block to help understand how often your application is throwing exceptions, and under what conditions. Use groups and filters to analyze trends leading to the exception. For example, you can group by OS Build, then filter a specific appVersion. Understand a particular user's experience. Examine the percentage charts to see overall trends with users and sessions at a glance. Then, use custom attributes to focus on exceptions related to paid accounts than free accounts. Pinpoint when most exceptions occur. For example, group on Last Interaction to get an overall view of problems. To drill down further, use filters, such as: To examine exceptions caused by network problems, filter by carrier and then select wifi. To examine exceptions caused by app releases, filter by appVersion. Align issues with common characteristics. For example: Use groups and filters to determine whether handled exception trends appear in networks (ASN, carrier, location, etc.) or in devices (device model, manufacturer, operating system build, version, etc.). Explore recurring patterns in stack traces with the top five exception locations table. Query data and share your findings via New Relic Insights. Explore the event trail before and after a crash. With mobile monitoring you get a more complete picture of events before and after crashes occur, so you can analyze and resolve problems from multiple angles: Use the handled exception's Occurrences page for expected exceptions. Use the Crash analysis UI and event trail for unanticipated exceptions. Requirements Tip Access to this feature depends on your subscription level and mobile data retention. Additional requirements include: Android: Android agent version 5.15.0 or higher iOS: iOS agent version 5.15.0 or higher Handled exceptions API and event type Mobile monitoring automatically includes default attributes that you can use to explore your handled exceptions data in New Relic Insights and get specific details: Use the recordHandledExceptions() method for the Android or iOS SDK API. Query the MobileHandledException event type in Insights. For more information, see the Insights examples for mobile monitoring. You can also create your own custom attributes and events. Then, select attributes in the Handled exceptions page, and query or share them in Insights.",

Use any of New Relic's standard page functions to drill down into detailed information; for example, zoom into any area of a chart. Look for obvious or general trends in the Users affected and Sessions affected percentage charts. Adjust the types of exceptions shown by using groups and filters. Optional: Query or share the chart data via New Relic Insights. Look for similar patterns where exceptions appear in stack traces with the Top 5 exception locations table. To view stack trace thread details for each occurrence of the exception, select a record from the Top 5 exceptions location table. one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Exceptions > Handled exceptions: As you explore the wealth of data in the charts and table, use groups and filters to discover patterns that help you determine the root cause of mobile app exceptions. Exception percentage charts Start with the Users affected and Sessions affected percentage charts to see at a glance whether there are any unexpected spikes, dips, or patterns with exceptions in general. (If the Users affected chart is empty, there were no user sessions during the selected time period.) For example: Are there any spikes near a recent version release? Is there a time period when the percentage of users has been affected significantly by the exception? Are there uneventful periods? To examine data in greater detail: Below any chart, select Expand chart. Exception percentage charts example one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Exceptions > Handled exceptions: The percentage charts help you quickly see any unexpected spikes, dips, or patterns with exceptions in general. Groups and filters Use the groups and filters to examine attributes for crashes, devices, locations, or other custom attributes in more detail. You can select a group, then filter to specific data. For example: Group the list by exception location (default), cause, app build or version, devices, connections, or other custom attributes. This lets you discover patterns in your exceptions to determine the root cause. Use the time picker to adjust the currently selected time period. Filter by a specific Version or by one or more attribute Filter, such as appVersion, exceptionLocationMethod, lastInteraction, or any of the longer list of standard and custom attributes. The currently selected filters appear at the top of the UI page. You can close them, add other filters, or select other groups and filters. Groups and filters example one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Exceptions > Handled exceptions: Group the data by attributes that matter to the most to you, then select one or more filters to help pinpoint specific causes behind the exceptions. Top five exception locations Use the Top 5 exception locations table to find or sort patterns in the type of exception you selected from the groups and filters. This includes: Recurring locations in the stack trace Mobile app version Number of occurrences Number of users affected during the selected time period For example, you can group by Exception Message, filter to timeout message, then select individual timeout locations from the table to review the stack trace thread and details about each occurrence. To filter or group by other attributes, use the table's search window, or select any of the available filters. For example, filter by type of occurrence, device, a specific location, or any custom attributes. To look for other historical patterns, change the selected time period. Top five exception locations example one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Exceptions > Handled exceptions: This example shows the Expand chart button and links to New Relic Insights, where you can query, create dashboards, and share the handled exceptions data. Insights links Handled exceptions charts use default attributes for mobile events (including MobileHandledException), along with any custom attributes you have added to this event type.

View query link: View the Insights NRQL query used to calculate the chart data. View in Insights link: View the chart in Insights, and share it with others. Exception locations table The Exception locations table supplements the charts. It lists where the top five handled exceptions appear in their stack trace thread, and links them to relevant details. Each row helps you find answers to questions such as: How many of this exception occurred within the selected time period? Does a specific app version have a higher (or lower) number of users affected? Which exception has the fewest number of occurrences? You can change the sort order or filter options to focus on just the types of exceptions that matter the most to you and your teams. To view additional thread details for each occurrence of the exception, select a record from the Top 5 exceptions location table.

Crashes can also result in users deleting your app altogether, which affects your organization's profitability. With the Crash analysis UI, you can identify and deal with one of the largest bottlenecks in the development lifecycle: the time it takes to resolve unanticipated exceptions. Use crash analysis features When your development team receives an emailed crash notification, they can select the email link to review detailed information about the crash in our user interface, or analyze chart data directly through a query. The individual Crash details page also includes tracking tools for your team to follow the issue from reporting to resolution. Our crash analysis feature helps developers to: Slice and dice your crash and network data (using groups and filters) to analyze trends leading to the crash. Understand a particular user's experience by using a custom attribute. Pinpoint when most crashes occur; for example, by filtering by Last Interaction, or by viewing the interaction trail in the Crash report page. Align issues with common characteristics in networks or devices. Examine specific problems in a crash report that may be buried in thread breakdown data, trace details, or the trail of user interactions in the crashed session. Quickly see trends from the Crash profiles tab. View the crash list To view the filterable Crash list in the New Relic UI: Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Exceptions > Crash analysis. OR To view the filterable Crash analysis page directly from the mobile app's Overview page, select the Crash occurrences chart's title. Use any of our standard page functions to drill down into detailed information; for example, zoom into any area of a chart. Use the crash analysis workflow To get the most out of mobile monitoring's Crash analysis UI, use this basic workflow. Start with the Crash rate percentage and Crash-free users percentage charts to see at a glance whether there are any unexpected spikes, dips, or patterns with crash time frames, or uneventful periods within the selected time period. Use the groups and filters to examine attributes (for crashes, devices, locations, or other custom attributes) in more detail. Use the Top 5 occurrences chart to identify patterns for the type of occurrence you selected from the groups and filters. Also correlate any general patterns for the selected type of occurrence to crash percentages that occurred during this time period. Optional: Query or share the chart data. Look for patterns in the Crash location table information, including location, exception type, date and number of occurrences, version, and number of users affected by the crash. Select a crash report from the table to view its interaction trail, its event trail, thread details for individual occurrences, attributes, and more. If necessary, resymbolicate or export the crash details to Xcode so you can debug your source code more easily. When finished, mark the crash occurrences as Resolved. Resolved crashes include a banner identifying who resolved the crash and when. Based on mobile monitoring's data retention policies, you can filter by resolved crashes when you need to track back to historical information. Crash percentages charts: See patterns immediately. Start with the Crash rate percentage and Crash-free users percentage charts to see at a glance whether there are any unexpected spikes, dips, or patterns with crashes in general. For example: Are there any spikes near a recent version release? Is there a time period when the percentage of users has been affected significantly by the crash? (If the Crash-free users percentage chart is empty, there were no user sessions during the selected time period.) Groups and filters: Slice and dice the crash data. You can select a group, and then filter to specific data, including: Group the crash list by type of crash, device, location, or other custom attributes. Show open crashes, resolved crashes, or all crashes. Use the time picker to adjust the currently selected time period. Filter by a specific Version or by one or more attribute Filter, such as Last Interaction, App Build, or any of the longer list of standard and custom attributes). The selected filters appear at the top of the UI page. Top five occurrences: Analyze specific characteristics. Use the Top 5 occurrences chart to identify what types of crashes and how many occurred during the selected time period. This chart shows the top five crash occurrences by the group and filters you select. For example, you can group by email address (if instrumented as a custom attribute), then filter down to a specific email to examine that user's experience. To filter or group by other attributes, use the search window, or select any of the available filters. For example, filter by type of crash, device, a specific location, or any custom attributes. To look for other historical patterns, change the selected time period. one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Exceptions > Crash analysis: Here is an example of the Top 5 occurrences chart filtered by the Crash locations group.

This may lead to users deleting your app, which in turn may affect your organization's profitability. With the Handled exceptions UI, mobile development managers and their developer teams can identify significant factors affecting poor mobile app experience, and use filterable data to find a resolution more quickly. Features Handling exceptions as they occur can help improve your mobile app users' experience, but it's not enough to catch exceptions. You also need to know how to prevent them. For example: How many different types of handled exceptions are occurring? A high occurrence rate may necessitate changes to the back-end systems. Why does the user's app usage result in a try/catch? What is the context for the exceptions? When can a test environment's responses to handled exceptions indicate additional, more serious problems? What would have caused a crash if the exception had not been caught in production? What else (in the code or back-end API) is still affecting the users' experience? By using handled exceptions, you can identify and resolve these kinds of issues more quickly. one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Exceptions > Handled exceptions: As you explore the wealth of data in the charts and table, use groups and filters to discover patterns that help you determine the root cause of mobile app exceptions. Handled exception features Comments Slice and dice your exception data. You can view exception data via API as well as the UI: Use the recordHandledException() method within a try{...} catch(){...} block to help understand how often your application is throwing exceptions, and under what conditions. Use groups and filters to analyze trends leading to the exception. For example, you can group by OS Build, then filter a specific appVersion. Understand a particular user's experience. Examine the percentage charts to see overall trends with users and sessions at a glance. Then, use custom attributes to focus on exceptions related to paid accounts than free accounts. Pinpoint when most exceptions occur. For example, group on Last Interaction to get an overall view of problems. To drill down further, use filters, such as: To examine exceptions caused by network problems, filter by carrier and then select wifi. To examine exceptions caused by app releases, filter by appVersion. Align issues with common characteristics. For example: Use groups and filters to determine whether handled exception trends appear in networks (ASN, carrier, location, etc.) or in devices (device model, manufacturer, operating system build, version, etc.). Explore recurring patterns in stack traces with the top five exception locations table. Query data and share your findings via New Relic Insights. Explore the event trail before and after a crash. With mobile monitoring you get a more complete picture of events before and after crashes occur, so you can analyze and resolve problems from multiple angles: Use the handled exception's Occurrences page for expected exceptions. Use the Crash analysis UI and event trail for unanticipated exceptions. Requirements Tip Access to this feature depends on your subscription level and mobile data retention. Additional requirements include: Android: Android agent version 5.15.0 or higher iOS: iOS agent version 5.15.0 or higher Handled exceptions API and event type Mobile monitoring automatically includes default attributes that you can use to explore your handled exceptions data in New Relic Insights and get specific details: Use the recordHandledExceptions() method for the Android or iOS SDK API.

This may lead to users deleting your app, which in turn may affect your organization's profitability. With the Handled exceptions UI, mobile development managers and their developer teams can identify significant factors affecting poor mobile app experience, and use filterable data to find a resolution more quickly. Features Handling exceptions as they occur can help improve your mobile app users' experience, but it's not enough to catch exceptions. You also need to know how to prevent them. For example: How many different types of handled exceptions are occurring? A high occurrence rate may necessitate changes to the back-end systems. Why does the user's app usage result in a try/catch? What is the context for the exceptions? When can a test environment's responses to handled exceptions indicate additional, more serious problems? What would have caused a crash if the exception had not been caught in production? What else (in the code or back-end API) is still affecting the users' experience? By using handled exceptions, you can identify and resolve these kinds of issues more quickly. one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Exceptions > Handled exceptions: As you explore the wealth of data in the charts and table, use groups and filters to discover patterns that help you determine the root cause of mobile app exceptions. Handled exception features Comments Slice and dice your exception data. You can view exception data via API as well as the UI: Use the recordHandledException() method within a try{...} catch(){...} block to help understand how often your application is throwing exceptions, and under what conditions. Use groups and filters to analyze trends leading to the exception. For example, you can group by OS Build, then filter a specific appVersion. Understand a particular user's experience. Examine the percentage charts to see overall trends with users and sessions at a glance. Then, use custom attributes to focus on exceptions related to paid accounts than free accounts. Pinpoint when most exceptions occur. For example, group on Last Interaction to get an overall view of problems. To drill down further, use filters, such as: To examine exceptions caused by network problems, filter by carrier and then select wifi. To examine exceptions caused by app releases, filter by appVersion. Align issues with common characteristics. For example: Use groups and filters to determine whether handled exception trends appear in networks (ASN, carrier, location, etc.) or in devices (device model, manufacturer, operating system build, version, etc.). Explore recurring patterns in stack traces with the top five exception locations table. Query data and share your findings via New Relic Insights. Explore the event trail before and after a crash. With mobile monitoring you get a more complete picture of events before and after crashes occur, so you can analyze and resolve problems from multiple angles: Use the handled exception's Occurrences page for expected exceptions. Use the Crash analysis UI and event trail for unanticipated exceptions. Requirements Tip Access to this feature depends on your subscription level and mobile data retention. Additional requirements include: Android: Android agent version 5.15.0 or higher iOS: iOS agent version 5.15.0 or higher Handled exceptions API and event type Mobile monitoring automatically includes default attributes that you can use to explore your handled exceptions data in New Relic Insights and get specific details: Use the recordHandledExceptions() method for the Android or iOS SDK API.

Crashes can also result in users deleting your app altogether, which affects your organization's profitability. With the Crash analysis UI, you can identify and deal with one of the largest bottlenecks in the development lifecycle: the time it takes to resolve unanticipated exceptions. Use crash analysis features When your development team receives an emailed crash notification, they can select the email link to review detailed information about the crash in our user interface, or analyze chart data directly through a query. The individual Crash details page also includes tracking tools for your team to follow the issue from reporting to resolution. Our crash analysis feature helps developers to: Slice and dice your crash and network data (using groups and filters) to analyze trends leading to the crash. Understand a particular user's experience by using a custom attribute. Pinpoint when most crashes occur; for example, by filtering by Last Interaction, or by viewing the interaction trail in the Crash report page. Align issues with common characteristics in networks or devices. Examine specific problems in a crash report that may be buried in thread breakdown data, trace details, or the trail of user interactions in the crashed session. Quickly see trends from the Crash profiles tab. View the crash list To view the filterable Crash list in the New Relic UI: Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Exceptions > Crash analysis. OR To view the filterable Crash analysis page directly from the mobile app's Overview page, select the Crash occurrences chart's title. Use any of our standard page functions to drill down into detailed information; for example, zoom into any area of a chart. Use the crash analysis workflow To get the most out of mobile monitoring's Crash analysis UI, use this basic workflow. Start with the Crash rate percentage and Crash-free users percentage charts to see at a glance whether there are any unexpected spikes, dips, or patterns with crash time frames, or uneventful periods within the selected time period. Use the groups and filters to examine attributes (for crashes, devices, locations, or other custom attributes) in more detail. Use the Top 5 occurrences chart to identify patterns for the type of occurrence you selected from the groups and filters. Also correlate any general patterns for the selected type of occurrence to crash percentages that occurred during this time period. Optional: Query or share the chart data. Look for patterns in the Crash location table information, including location, exception type, date and number of occurrences, version, and number of users affected by the crash. Select a crash report from the table to view its interaction trail, its event trail, thread details for individual occurrences, attributes, and more. If necessary, resymbolicate or export the crash details to Xcode so you can debug your source code more easily. When finished, mark the crash occurrences as Resolved. Resolved crashes include a banner identifying who resolved the crash and when. Based on mobile monitoring's data retention policies, you can filter by resolved crashes when you need to track back to historical information. Crash percentages charts: See patterns immediately. Start with the Crash rate percentage and Crash-free users percentage charts to see at a glance whether there are any unexpected spikes, dips, or patterns with crashes in general. For example: Are there any spikes near a recent version release? Is there a time period when the percentage of users has been affected significantly by the crash? (If the Crash-free users percentage chart is empty, there were no user sessions during the selected time period.) Groups and filters: Slice and dice the crash data. You can select a group, and then filter to specific data, including: Group the crash list by type of crash, device, location, or other custom attributes. Show open crashes, resolved crashes, or all crashes. Use the time picker to adjust the currently selected time period. Filter by a specific Version or by one or more attribute Filter, such as Last Interaction, App Build, or any of the longer list of standard and custom attributes). The selected filters appear at the top of the UI page. Top five occurrences: Analyze specific characteristics. Use the Top 5 occurrences chart to identify what types of crashes and how many occurred during the selected time period. This chart shows the top five crash occurrences by the group and filters you select. For example, you can group by email address (if instrumented as a custom attribute), then filter down to a specific email to examine that user's experience. To filter or group by other attributes, use the search window, or select any of the available filters. For example, filter by type of crash, device, a specific location, or any custom attributes. To look for other historical patterns, change the selected time period. one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Exceptions > Crash analysis: Here is an example of the Top 5 occurrences chart filtered by the Crash locations group. Select any groups or filters to analyze your crash data any way you want. Queries and image links: Query crash data and share charts with others. Mobile monitoring's Crash analysis charts use default attributes for mobile events, along with any custom attributes you have added to this event type. To view or share the data, click the ellipsis icon. Add to dashboard link: View the chart, and copy it to a new or existing dashboard. View query link: View the NRQL query used to calculate the chart data. Get as image link: Select this option to get a public URL of the chart, then share it using any media. Crash reports: Dive into the interaction trail, thread breakdown, and more. Supplementing the charts, the Crash report table lists crash types by location, and links them to relevant crash report details. Each row helps you find answers to questions such as: How many of this crash type or exception occurred within the selected time period? What is the most recent exception message? Does a specific app version have a higher (or lower) number of users affected? When did the exception first and last occur? one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Exceptions > Crash analysis: Sort on any column to analyze patterns in the Crash reports table, then select any report to review crash details.

This may lead to users deleting your app, which in turn may affect your organization's profitability. With the Handled exceptions UI, mobile development managers and their developer teams can identify significant factors affecting poor mobile app experience, and use filterable data to find a resolution more quickly. Features Handling exceptions as they occur can help improve your mobile app users' experience, but it's not enough to catch exceptions. You also need to know how to prevent them. For example: How many different types of handled exceptions are occurring? A high occurrence rate may necessitate changes to the back-end systems. Why does the user's app usage result in a try/catch? What is the context for the exceptions? When can a test environment's responses to handled exceptions indicate additional, more serious problems? What would have caused a crash if the exception had not been caught in production? What else (in the code or back-end API) is still affecting the users' experience? By using handled exceptions, you can identify and resolve these kinds of issues more quickly. one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Exceptions > Handled exceptions: As you explore the wealth of data in the charts and table, use groups and filters to discover patterns that help you determine the root cause of mobile app exceptions. Handled exception features Comments Slice and dice your exception data. You can view exception data via API as well as the UI: Use the recordHandledException() method within a try{...} catch(){...} block to help understand how often your application is throwing exceptions, and under what conditions. Use groups and filters to analyze trends leading to the exception. For example, you can group by OS Build, then filter a specific appVersion. Understand a particular user's experience. Examine the percentage charts to see overall trends with users and sessions at a glance. Then, use custom attributes to focus on exceptions related to paid accounts than free accounts. Pinpoint when most exceptions occur. For example, group on Last Interaction to get an overall view of problems. To drill down further, use filters, such as: To examine exceptions caused by network problems, filter by carrier and then select wifi. To examine exceptions caused by app releases, filter by appVersion. Align issues with common characteristics. For example: Use groups and filters to determine whether handled exception trends appear in networks (ASN, carrier, location, etc.) or in devices (device model, manufacturer, operating system build, version, etc.). Explore recurring patterns in stack traces with the top five exception locations table. Query data and share your findings via New Relic Insights. Explore the event trail before and after a crash. With mobile monitoring you get a more complete picture of events before and after crashes occur, so you can analyze and resolve problems from multiple angles: Use the handled exception's Occurrences page for expected exceptions. Use the Crash analysis UI and event trail for unanticipated exceptions. Requirements Tip Access to this feature depends on your subscription level and mobile data retention. Additional requirements include: Android: Android agent version 5.15.0 or higher iOS: iOS agent version 5.15.0 or higher Handled exceptions API and event type Mobile monitoring automatically includes default attributes that you can use to explore your handled exceptions data in New Relic Insights and get specific details: Use the recordHandledExceptions() method for the Android or iOS SDK API. Query the MobileHandledException event type in Insights. For more information, see the Insights examples for mobile monitoring. You can also create your own custom attributes and events. Then, select attributes in the Handled exceptions page, and query or share them in Insights.",

      "body": "Mobile app crashes can result in users submitting negative reviews, which can affect your organization's reputation. Crashes can also result in users deleting your app altogether, which affects your organization's profitability. With the Crash analysis UI, you can identify and deal with one of the largest bottlenecks in the development lifecycle: the time it takes to resolve unanticipated exceptions. Use crash analysis features When your development team receives an emailed crash notification, they can select the email link to review detailed information about the crash in our user interface, or analyze chart data directly through a query. The individual Crash details page also includes tracking tools for your team to follow the issue from reporting to resolution. Our crash analysis feature helps developers to: Slice and dice your crash and network data (using groups and filters) to analyze trends leading to the crash. Understand a particular user's experience by using a custom attribute. Pinpoint when most crashes occur; for example, by filtering by Last Interaction, or by viewing the interaction trail in the Crash report page. Align issues with common characteristics in networks or devices. Examine specific problems in a crash report that may be buried in thread breakdown data, trace details, or the trail of user interactions in the crashed session. Quickly see trends from the Crash profiles tab. View the crash list To view the filterable Crash list in the New Relic UI: Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Exceptions > Crash analysis. OR To view the filterable Crash analysis page directly from the mobile app's Overview page, select the Crash occurrences chart's title. Use any of our standard page functions to drill down into detailed information; for example, zoom into any area of a chart. Use the crash analysis workflow To get the most out of mobile monitoring's Crash analysis UI, use this basic workflow. Start with the Crash rate percentage and Crash-free users percentage charts to see at a glance whether there are any unexpected spikes, dips, or patterns with crash time frames, or uneventful periods within the selected time period. Use the groups and filters to examine attributes (for crashes, devices, locations, or other custom attributes) in more detail. Use the Top 5 occurrences chart to identify patterns for the type of occurrence you selected from the groups and filters. Also correlate any general patterns for the selected type of occurrence to crash percentages that occurred during this time period. Optional: Query or share the chart data. Look for patterns in the Crash location table information, including location, exception type, date and number of occurrences, version, and number of users affected by the crash. Select a crash report from the table to view its interaction trail, its event trail, thread details for individual occurrences, attributes, and more. If necessary, resymbolicate or export the crash details to Xcode so you can debug your source code more easily. When finished, mark the crash occurrences as Resolved. Resolved crashes include a banner identifying who resolved the crash and when. Based on mobile monitoring's data retention policies, you can filter by resolved crashes when you need to track back to historical information. Crash percentages charts: See patterns immediately. Start with the Crash rate percentage and Crash-free users percentage charts to see at a glance whether there are any unexpected spikes, dips, or patterns with crashes in general. For example: Are there any spikes near a recent version release? Is there a time period when the percentage of users has been affected significantly by the crash? (If the Crash-free users percentage chart is empty, there were no user sessions during the selected time period.) Groups and filters: Slice and dice the crash data. You can select a group, and then filter to specific data, including: Group the crash list by type of crash, device, location, or other custom attributes. Show open crashes, resolved crashes, or all crashes. Use the time picker to adjust the currently selected time period. Filter by a specific Version or by one or more attribute Filter, such as Last Interaction, App Build, or any of the longer list of standard and custom attributes). The selected filters appear at the top of the UI page. Top five occurrences: Analyze specific characteristics. Use the Top 5 occurrences chart to identify what types of crashes and how many occurred during the selected time period. This chart shows the top five crash occurrences by the group and filters you select. For example, you can group by email address (if instrumented as a custom attribute), then filter down to a specific email to examine that user's experience. To filter or group by other attributes, use the search window, or select any of the available filters. For example, filter by type of crash, device, a specific location, or any custom attributes. To look for other historical patterns, change the selected time period. one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Exceptions > Crash analysis: Here is an example of the Top 5 occurrences chart filtered by the Crash locations group. Select any groups or filters to analyze your crash data any way you want. Queries and image links: Query crash data and share charts with others. Mobile monitoring's Crash analysis charts use default attributes for mobile events, along with any custom attributes you have added to this event type. To view or share the data, click the ellipsis icon. Add to dashboard link: View the chart, and copy it to a new or existing dashboard. View query link: View the NRQL query used to calculate the chart data. Get as image link: Select this option to get a public URL of the chart, then share it using any media. Crash reports: Dive into the interaction trail, thread breakdown, and more. Supplementing the charts, the Crash report table lists crash types by location, and links them to relevant crash report details. Each row helps you find answers to questions such as: How many of this crash type or exception occurred within the selected time period? What is the most recent exception message? Does a specific app version have a higher (or lower) number of users affected? When did the exception first and last occur? one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Exceptions > Crash analysis: Sort on any column to analyze patterns in the Crash reports table, then select any report to review crash details. Sometimes it may be more useful to examine crash report data from lowest to highest. For example: Which exception has the fewest number of occurrences? When did a particular exception start (Earliest occurrence)? You can change the sort order or filter options to focus on just the types of exceptions that matter the most to you and your teams. Crash profiles: Quickly see key differences between crashed and crash-free accounts. Crash profiles provide quick, clear insight into your mobile crash data by surfacing any anomalies in your mobile application’s performance. Unexpected differences between attributes and behaviors are highlighted, illuminating key differences between crashed and crash-free accounts. You can quickly pinpoint key issues through drill-downs and filters for a fast, streamlined troubleshooting experience. one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Exceptions> Crash analysis > Crash profiles: Compare crashed and crash-free sessions. Crash event trail: See all the events leading up to a crash. The mobile monitoring crash event trail shows you the events leading up to a crash of a mobile app. These can be events monitored by default, or custom events you've created. For more information, see Crash event trail. Examine crash report details: Export to Xcode or resymbolicate your source code. From the Crash report table, you can drill down into a specific Crash report. From here you can: Examine the interaction trail from session start through the crash event. Explore the related thread breakdown. Select Export crash details so you can examine source code using Xcode. Resymbolicate the crash report for easier debugging. File a ticket, and resolve the crash. one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Crashes > Crash report: This is an example of an interaction trail that includes the option to resymbolicate the crash occurrence.

Crashes can also result in users deleting your app altogether, which affects your organization's profitability. With the Crash analysis UI, you can identify and deal with one of the largest bottlenecks in the development lifecycle: the time it takes to resolve unanticipated exceptions. Use crash analysis features When your development team receives an emailed crash notification, they can select the email link to review detailed information about the crash in our user interface, or analyze chart data directly through a query. The individual Crash details page also includes tracking tools for your team to follow the issue from reporting to resolution. Our crash analysis feature helps developers to: Slice and dice your crash and network data (using groups and filters) to analyze trends leading to the crash. Understand a particular user's experience by using a custom attribute. Pinpoint when most crashes occur; for example, by filtering by Last Interaction, or by viewing the interaction trail in the Crash report page. Align issues with common characteristics in networks or devices. Examine specific problems in a crash report that may be buried in thread breakdown data, trace details, or the trail of user interactions in the crashed session. Quickly see trends from the Crash profiles tab. View the crash list To view the filterable Crash list in the New Relic UI: Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Exceptions > Crash analysis. OR To view the filterable Crash analysis page directly from the mobile app's Overview page, select the Crash occurrences chart's title. Use any of our standard page functions to drill down into detailed information; for example, zoom into any area of a chart. Use the crash analysis workflow To get the most out of mobile monitoring's Crash analysis UI, use this basic workflow. Start with the Crash rate percentage and Crash-free users percentage charts to see at a glance whether there are any unexpected spikes, dips, or patterns with crash time frames, or uneventful periods within the selected time period. Use the groups and filters to examine attributes (for crashes, devices, locations, or other custom attributes) in more detail. Use the Top 5 occurrences chart to identify patterns for the type of occurrence you selected from the groups and filters. Also correlate any general patterns for the selected type of occurrence to crash percentages that occurred during this time period. Optional: Query or share the chart data. Look for patterns in the Crash location table information, including location, exception type, date and number of occurrences, version, and number of users affected by the crash. Select a crash report from the table to view its interaction trail, its event trail, thread details for individual occurrences, attributes, and more. If necessary, resymbolicate or export the crash details to Xcode so you can debug your source code more easily. When finished, mark the crash occurrences as Resolved. Resolved crashes include a banner identifying who resolved the crash and when. Based on mobile monitoring's data retention policies, you can filter by resolved crashes when you need to track back to historical information. Crash percentages charts: See patterns immediately. Start with the Crash rate percentage and Crash-free users percentage charts to see at a glance whether there are any unexpected spikes, dips, or patterns with crashes in general. For example: Are there any spikes near a recent version release? Is there a time period when the percentage of users has been affected significantly by the crash? (If the Crash-free users percentage chart is empty, there were no user sessions during the selected time period.) Groups and filters: Slice and dice the crash data. You can select a group, and then filter to specific data, including: Group the crash list by type of crash, device, location, or other custom attributes. Show open crashes, resolved crashes, or all crashes. Use the time picker to adjust the currently selected time period. Filter by a specific Version or by one or more attribute Filter, such as Last Interaction, App Build, or any of the longer list of standard and custom attributes). The selected filters appear at the top of the UI page. Top five occurrences: Analyze specific characteristics. Use the Top 5 occurrences chart to identify what types of crashes and how many occurred during the selected time period. This chart shows the top five crash occurrences by the group and filters you select. For example, you can group by email address (if instrumented as a custom attribute), then filter down to a specific email to examine that user's experience. To filter or group by other attributes, use the search window, or select any of the available filters. For example, filter by type of crash, device, a specific location, or any custom attributes. To look for other historical patterns, change the selected time period. one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Exceptions > Crash analysis: Here is an example of the Top 5 occurrences chart filtered by the Crash locations group.

This may lead to users deleting your app, which in turn may affect your organization's profitability. With the Handled exceptions UI, mobile development managers and their developer teams can identify significant factors affecting poor mobile app experience, and use filterable data to find a resolution more quickly. Features Handling exceptions as they occur can help improve your mobile app users' experience, but it's not enough to catch exceptions. You also need to know how to prevent them. For example: How many different types of handled exceptions are occurring? A high occurrence rate may necessitate changes to the back-end systems. Why does the user's app usage result in a try/catch? What is the context for the exceptions? When can a test environment's responses to handled exceptions indicate additional, more serious problems? What would have caused a crash if the exception had not been caught in production? What else (in the code or back-end API) is still affecting the users' experience? By using handled exceptions, you can identify and resolve these kinds of issues more quickly. one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Exceptions > Handled exceptions: As you explore the wealth of data in the charts and table, use groups and filters to discover patterns that help you determine the root cause of mobile app exceptions. Handled exception features Comments Slice and dice your exception data. You can view exception data via API as well as the UI: Use the recordHandledException() method within a try{...} catch(){...} block to help understand how often your application is throwing exceptions, and under what conditions. Use groups and filters to analyze trends leading to the exception. For example, you can group by OS Build, then filter a specific appVersion. Understand a particular user's experience. Examine the percentage charts to see overall trends with users and sessions at a glance. Then, use custom attributes to focus on exceptions related to paid accounts than free accounts. Pinpoint when most exceptions occur. For example, group on Last Interaction to get an overall view of problems. To drill down further, use filters, such as: To examine exceptions caused by network problems, filter by carrier and then select wifi. To examine exceptions caused by app releases, filter by appVersion. Align issues with common characteristics. For example: Use groups and filters to determine whether handled exception trends appear in networks (ASN, carrier, location, etc.) or in devices (device model, manufacturer, operating system build, version, etc.). Explore recurring patterns in stack traces with the top five exception locations table. Query data and share your findings via New Relic Insights. Explore the event trail before and after a crash. With mobile monitoring you get a more complete picture of events before and after crashes occur, so you can analyze and resolve problems from multiple angles: Use the handled exception's Occurrences page for expected exceptions. Use the Crash analysis UI and event trail for unanticipated exceptions. Requirements Tip Access to this feature depends on your subscription level and mobile data retention. Additional requirements include: Android: Android agent version 5.15.0 or higher iOS: iOS agent version 5.15.0 or higher Handled exceptions API and event type Mobile monitoring automatically includes default attributes that you can use to explore your handled exceptions data in New Relic Insights and get specific details: Use the recordHandledExceptions() method for the Android or iOS SDK API.

This may lead to users deleting your app, which in turn may affect your organization's profitability. With the Handled exceptions UI, mobile development managers and their developer teams can identify significant factors affecting poor mobile app experience, and use filterable data to find a resolution more quickly. Features Handling exceptions as they occur can help improve your mobile app users' experience, but it's not enough to catch exceptions. You also need to know how to prevent them. For example: How many different types of handled exceptions are occurring? A high occurrence rate may necessitate changes to the back-end systems. Why does the user's app usage result in a try/catch? What is the context for the exceptions? When can a test environment's responses to handled exceptions indicate additional, more serious problems? What would have caused a crash if the exception had not been caught in production? What else (in the code or back-end API) is still affecting the users' experience? By using handled exceptions, you can identify and resolve these kinds of issues more quickly. one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Exceptions > Handled exceptions: As you explore the wealth of data in the charts and table, use groups and filters to discover patterns that help you determine the root cause of mobile app exceptions. Handled exception features Comments Slice and dice your exception data. You can view exception data via API as well as the UI: Use the recordHandledException() method within a try{...} catch(){...} block to help understand how often your application is throwing exceptions, and under what conditions. Use groups and filters to analyze trends leading to the exception. For example, you can group by OS Build, then filter a specific appVersion. Understand a particular user's experience. Examine the percentage charts to see overall trends with users and sessions at a glance. Then, use custom attributes to focus on exceptions related to paid accounts than free accounts. Pinpoint when most exceptions occur. For example, group on Last Interaction to get an overall view of problems. To drill down further, use filters, such as: To examine exceptions caused by network problems, filter by carrier and then select wifi. To examine exceptions caused by app releases, filter by appVersion. Align issues with common characteristics. For example: Use groups and filters to determine whether handled exception trends appear in networks (ASN, carrier, location, etc.) or in devices (device model, manufacturer, operating system build, version, etc.). Explore recurring patterns in stack traces with the top five exception locations table. Query data and share your findings via New Relic Insights. Explore the event trail before and after a crash. With mobile monitoring you get a more complete picture of events before and after crashes occur, so you can analyze and resolve problems from multiple angles: Use the handled exception's Occurrences page for expected exceptions. Use the Crash analysis UI and event trail for unanticipated exceptions. Requirements Tip Access to this feature depends on your subscription level and mobile data retention. Additional requirements include: Android: Android agent version 5.15.0 or higher iOS: iOS agent version 5.15.0 or higher Handled exceptions API and event type Mobile monitoring automatically includes default attributes that you can use to explore your handled exceptions data in New Relic Insights and get specific details: Use the recordHandledExceptions() method for the Android or iOS SDK API. Query the MobileHandledException event type in Insights. For more information, see the Insights examples for mobile monitoring. You can also create your own custom attributes and events. Then, select attributes in the Handled exceptions page, and query or share them in Insights.",

You can also use the handled exceptions API to customize the data you send, and use NRQL to query and share the data. Handled exceptions workflow To get the most out of the Handled exceptions UI, use this basic workflow: Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Exceptions > Handled exceptions. Use any of New Relic's standard page functions to drill down into detailed information; for example, zoom into any area of a chart. Look for obvious or general trends in the Users affected and Sessions affected percentage charts. Adjust the types of exceptions shown by using groups and filters. Optional: Query or share the chart data via New Relic Insights. Look for similar patterns where exceptions appear in stack traces with the Top 5 exception locations table. To view stack trace thread details for each occurrence of the exception, select a record from the Top 5 exceptions location table. one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Exceptions > Handled exceptions: As you explore the wealth of data in the charts and table, use groups and filters to discover patterns that help you determine the root cause of mobile app exceptions. Exception percentage charts Start with the Users affected and Sessions affected percentage charts to see at a glance whether there are any unexpected spikes, dips, or patterns with exceptions in general. (If the Users affected chart is empty, there were no user sessions during the selected time period.) For example: Are there any spikes near a recent version release? Is there a time period when the percentage of users has been affected significantly by the exception? Are there uneventful periods? To examine data in greater detail: Below any chart, select Expand chart. Exception percentage charts example one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Exceptions > Handled exceptions: The percentage charts help you quickly see any unexpected spikes, dips, or patterns with exceptions in general. Groups and filters Use the groups and filters to examine attributes for crashes, devices, locations, or other custom attributes in more detail. You can select a group, then filter to specific data. For example: Group the list by exception location (default), cause, app build or version, devices, connections, or other custom attributes. This lets you discover patterns in your exceptions to determine the root cause. Use the time picker to adjust the currently selected time period. Filter by a specific Version or by one or more attribute Filter, such as appVersion, exceptionLocationMethod, lastInteraction, or any of the longer list of standard and custom attributes. The currently selected filters appear at the top of the UI page. You can close them, add other filters, or select other groups and filters. Groups and filters example one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Exceptions > Handled exceptions: Group the data by attributes that matter to the most to you, then select one or more filters to help pinpoint specific causes behind the exceptions. Top five exception locations Use the Top 5 exception locations table to find or sort patterns in the type of exception you selected from the groups and filters. This includes: Recurring locations in the stack trace Mobile app version Number of occurrences Number of users affected during the selected time period For example, you can group by Exception Message, filter to timeout message, then select individual timeout locations from the table to review the stack trace thread and details about each occurrence. To filter or group by other attributes, use the table's search window, or select any of the available filters. For example, filter by type of occurrence, device, a specific location, or any custom attributes. To look for other historical patterns, change the selected time period. Top five exception locations example one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Exceptions > Handled exceptions: This example shows the Expand chart button and links to New Relic Insights, where you can query, create dashboards, and share the handled exceptions data. Insights links Handled exceptions charts use default attributes for mobile events (including MobileHandledException), along with any custom attributes you have added to this event type. When you mouse over the charts, direct links appear below them. These links to New Relic Insights allow you to analyze your mobile app data even deeper. View query link: View the Insights NRQL query used to calculate the chart data. View in Insights link: View the chart in Insights, and share it with others. Exception locations table The Exception locations table supplements the charts. It lists where the top five handled exceptions appear in their stack trace thread, and links them to relevant details. Each row helps you find answers to questions such as: How many of this exception occurred within the selected time period? Does a specific app version have a higher (or lower) number of users affected? Which exception has the fewest number of occurrences? You can change the sort order or filter options to focus on just the types of exceptions that matter the most to you and your teams. To view additional thread details for each occurrence of the exception, select a record from the Top 5 exceptions location table.

      "body": "Mobile monitoring provides an engine that instruments your application code for Android and iOS apps and monitors your code as it services your user interactions. This is useful for analyzing time-consuming user activities. After you set up the SDK API for your Android or iOS app, you can view detailed information from the Interactions page. Instrumentation We offer SDK APIs to instrument interactions for Android and iOS apps. This includes: Android: Activities, AsyncTask threading, and the performance of database, image loading, JSON parsing, and other common APIs iOS: UIViewControllers, GCD dispatch_async, and the performance of CoreData, UIImage, NSJSON, and other common APIs For more information, see Working with the Android SDK API and Working with the iOS SDK API. Viewing the Interactions page The Interactions page includes breakdown charts of the five most expensive interactions (including code executing on the main thread and code executing on worker threads), plus a list of the slowest traces. To view the Interactions page: Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > App > Interactions. To drill down into detailed information, select any interaction, or use any of our standard user interface functions and page functions. Tip To go directly to Interactions from the Mobile apps overview page, select the Slowest interactions chart's title, or select any interaction to view detailed information. Viewing breakdown table details To show the full list of all instrumented methods: From the selected interaction, select the Breakdown table link. If you use custom instrumentation for any of the metrics, the category for the class and method name will indicate custom. For each traced method, the Interactions breakdown table shows: Thread type (foreground or background) Class and method name Percentage of total execution time spent in this method Average number of calls to this method per interaction Overall average execution time of each call to this method Viewing the Interactions timeline Each interaction trace period records traces until a new interaction begins. To view the Interactions timeline for your mobile app: Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > App > Interactions. From the Slowest traces table, select the Activity or Duration link for the trace. OR: Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > App > Interactions > (select an interaction). From the Slowest traces table, select the Duration link for the trace. As you mouse over the timeline, information appears for the method underneath, memory used by your application, and any active network requests. The row labels indicate which thread each method is running on. To view a waterfall of execution flow within a method, select a method block. The Interactions timeline also provides on-device metrics to help you gain insight into your app's device level data. The usage metrics show how your app is interacting with your end users's devices. In addition to operating system metrics, the usage metrics include database, CPU, and memory. To view the on-device usage metrics, mouse over the timeline. To drill down into detailed information, select any location on the timeline. To help provide context for the data, select the Previous interaction link.",

      "body": "The Overview page provides an operational snapshot of your mobile app. All charts, tables, and statistics show data for the currently selected time window and application version. Key app metrics The Overview page captures five key app metrics: Metric Description Application crash rate Plots the number of crashed sessions over time as a percentage of all sessions, broken out by app version. The average crashed session percent, total number of crashes, and count of unique users affected by those crashes during the time window is shown in the upper right. App launches Charts the number of app session launches monitored over the time window. New Relic defines a mobile session as beginning when an app appears on screen and ending when the app is sent to the background. HTTP errors / network failures Charts the number of network requests that result in a http status code error (400 or higher) as a percentage of all completed requests, and the number of failed network calls (for example, a connection failure) as a percentage of completed requests. HTTP response time Charts the average response time of all completed http requests from each of the top five hosts your app communicates with. Top five is calculated based on count of completed requests to each host. Frequent interactions Presents key performance metrics for each of the five most commonly executed Interactions in your app. View the Overview page To view the Overview page for your mobile apps: Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app).

      "body": "The Overview page provides an operational snapshot of your mobile app. All charts, tables, and statistics show data for the currently selected time window and application version. Key app metrics The Overview page captures five key app metrics: Metric Description Application crash rate Plots the number of crashed sessions over time as a percentage of all sessions, broken out by app version. The average crashed session percent, total number of crashes, and count of unique users affected by those crashes during the time window is shown in the upper right. App launches Charts the number of app session launches monitored over the time window. New Relic defines a mobile session as beginning when an app appears on screen and ending when the app is sent to the background. HTTP errors / network failures Charts the number of network requests that result in a http status code error (400 or higher) as a percentage of all completed requests, and the number of failed network calls (for example, a connection failure) as a percentage of completed requests. HTTP response time Charts the average response time of all completed http requests from each of the top five hosts your app communicates with. Top five is calculated based on count of completed requests to each host. Frequent interactions Presents key performance metrics for each of the five most commonly executed Interactions in your app. View the Overview page To view the Overview page for your mobile apps: Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app).

This is useful for analyzing time-consuming user activities. After you set up the SDK API for your Android or iOS app, you can view detailed information from the Interactions page. Instrumentation We offer SDK APIs to instrument interactions for Android and iOS apps. This includes: Android: Activities, AsyncTask threading, and the performance of database, image loading, JSON parsing, and other common APIs iOS: UIViewControllers, GCD dispatch_async, and the performance of CoreData, UIImage, NSJSON, and other common APIs For more information, see Working with the Android SDK API and Working with the iOS SDK API. Viewing the Interactions page The Interactions page includes breakdown charts of the five most expensive interactions (including code executing on the main thread and code executing on worker threads), plus a list of the slowest traces. To view the Interactions page: Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > App > Interactions. To drill down into detailed information, select any interaction, or use any of our standard user interface functions and page functions. Tip To go directly to Interactions from the Mobile apps overview page, select the Slowest interactions chart's title, or select any interaction to view detailed information. Viewing breakdown table details To show the full list of all instrumented methods: From the selected interaction, select the Breakdown table link. If you use custom instrumentation for any of the metrics, the category for the class and method name will indicate custom. For each traced method, the Interactions breakdown table shows: Thread type (foreground or background) Class and method name Percentage of total execution time spent in this method Average number of calls to this method per interaction Overall average execution time of each call to this method Viewing the Interactions timeline Each interaction trace period records traces until a new interaction begins. To view the Interactions timeline for your mobile app: Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > App > Interactions. From the Slowest traces table, select the Activity or Duration link for the trace. OR: Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > App > Interactions > (select an interaction). From the Slowest traces table, select the Duration link for the trace. As you mouse over the timeline, information appears for the method underneath, memory used by your application, and any active network requests. The row labels indicate which thread each method is running on. To view a waterfall of execution flow within a method, select a method block. The Interactions timeline also provides on-device metrics to help you gain insight into your app's device level data. The usage metrics show how your app is interacting with your end users's devices. In addition to operating system metrics, the usage metrics include database, CPU, and memory. To view the on-device usage metrics, mouse over the timeline. To drill down into detailed information, select any location on the timeline. To help provide context for the data, select the Previous interaction link.",
