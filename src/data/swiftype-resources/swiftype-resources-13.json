Tip We may update the URLs in this document without notice. Security Program New Relic follows \"privacy by design\" principles as described here: https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/security/security-privacy/data-privacy/data-privacy-new-relic/. Security Domains New Relic’s policies and procedures cover industry-recognized security domains such as Endpoint Protection; Portable Media Security; Mobile Device Security; Wireless Security; Configuration Management; Vulnerability Management; Network Protection; Transmission Protection; Password Management; Access Control, Audit Logging & Monitoring; Education, Training, and Awareness; Third Party Assurance; Incident Management; Business Continuity and Disaster Recover; Risk Management; Data Protection & Privacy; and Service Management Systems. Security Certifications New Relic audits its Services against industry standards as described at https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/security/security-privacy/compliance/regulatory-audits-new-relic-services/. Data Control, Facilities, and Encryption New Relic's customers can send data to New Relic's APIs by (1) using New Relic's software, (2) using vendor-neutral software that is managed and maintained by a third-party such as via OpenTelemetry instrumentation provided by opentelemetry.io, or (3) from third-party systems that customer's manage and/or control. New Relic's customers can use New Relic's Services such as NerdGraph to filter out and drop data. See https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/telemetry-data-platform/manage-data/drop-data-using-nerdgraph/. New Relic's customers can adjust their data retention periods as appropriate for their needs. See https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/telemetry-data-platform/manage-data/manage-data-retention/#adjust-retention. New Relic Logs obfuscates numbers that match known patterns, such as bank card and social security numbers as described here: https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/logs/log-management/get-started/new-relics-log-management-security-privacy/. New Relic honors requests to delete personal data in accordance with applicable privacy laws. Please see https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/security/security-privacy/data-privacy/data-privacy-new-relic/.

      "body": "This document is about the New Relic One pricing plan. For an explanation of how that plan works, see New Relic One pricing. The document below goes into license-level details. The Usage Plan applies to (i) your Pay As You Go subscription, or (ii) your Commitment Term for the Annual Pool of Funds subscription (see a description of these two plans). New Relic may modify the Usage Plan from time to time. Any changes to the Usage Plan will become effective immediately for changes that provide a benefit or right to the Customer, all other changes will become effective if Customer assents or upon any new or renewal Commitment Term. Usage Plan - Effective as February 19, 2021: The Order and Usage Plan may contain defined terms that are denoted by capitalization. In the event that a capitalized term is not defined in either the Order or the Usage Plan, such terms shall have the meaning set forth in the New Relic One pricing definitions page. Pay As You Go By electing and subscribing to the Pay As You Go subscription model (“Pay As You Go” or “PAYG”), Customer commits to paying for the New Relic Products on a month-to-month consumption basis. Monthly Product Usage will be invoiced regardless if a PO is required or not. Any Customer dispute to Monthly Product Usage from the prior month must be in good-faith and received by New Relic in writing within three (3) business days of the start of the next month or such dispute notice will be considered invalid. The dispute notice will set forth in reasonable detail the information concerning the disputed charges. The parties will use good-faith efforts to promptly resolve any disputed charges. Customer’s usage of the Products in excess of the Free Tier each month shall be billed in arrears on the first business day of the following month based on the Customer’s Per Unit usage of each Product each month multiplied by the corresponding rates set forth in an Order and summed (“Monthly Product Usage”). Annual Pool of Funds By electing and subscribing to the Annual Pool of Funds subscription model (“Annual Pool of Funds” or “APoF”) for the Commitment Term, Customer commits in an Order to: (i) paying the Commitment Fee amounts described in the Subscription table and any additional commitment fees set forth; and (ii) the Monthly Discounted Fee Rates applying to Customer’s Monthly Product Usage. New Relic will invoice the Commitment Fee as per the ‘Billing Terms’ described in an Order. On a monthly cadence during the Commitment Term, Customer’s Per Unit usage of the Products will be multiplied by the corresponding Monthly Discounted Rate and summed (“Monthly Product Usage”). Monthly Product Usage will be deducted from the Commitment Fee amounts that are paid in advance. If Monthly Product Usage exceeds any such remaining unconsumed amounts, Customer will be invoiced for the difference (“Additional Usage”), including for any Monthly Product Usage during the last month of the Commitment Term. Payment of such invoices will be governed as set forth in the Terms. Any Customer dispute to Monthly Product Usage from the prior month must be in good-faith and received by New Relic in writing within three (3) business days of the start of the next month (including for any Monthly Product Usage for the last month of the Commitment Term) or such dispute notice will be considered invalid. The dispute notice will set forth in reasonable detail the information concerning the disputed charges. The parties will use good-faith efforts to promptly resolve any disputed charges. Any unconsumed balances from the Customer payment of each annual Commitment Fee and any additional payments, if applicable, as set out in an Order will expire and lapse at the end of each year of the Commitment Term. Applicable Invoicing and Order Terms All amounts stated in an Order are non-cancelable payment obligations of the Customer for the Commitment Term regardless of usage. Any fees paid are non-refundable and do not represent a deposit for, or a credit towards, the purchase of other products not specified in an Order or for any purchase after the Commitment Term. Customer acknowledges that a final payment for the full outstanding amount of any remaining unpaid Commitment Fee and/or Monthly Product Usage Fee may be invoiced upon each anniversary date of the term start date. Tax will be added where applicable. New Relic may review Customer's use of the Products at any time. If New Relic identifies any Customer usage of the Product(s) that is not in accordance with the Terms or Documentation, New Relic may suspend such unauthorized usage. All existing purchases and related pricing in effect prior to the execution of an Order shall remain in force. Unless otherwise stated in an Order, an Order does not modify or amend any existing purchases. Additional future products or quantities are not subject to promotional pricing unless otherwise stated in an Order. In the event that a Customer indicates in an Order that it requires a purchase order (“PO”) for its subscription, Customer agrees to provide the required PO prior to the provisioning of the Products. If a Customer does not indicate a PO is required, Customer agrees that New Relic may issue invoice(s) and is entitled to such payment without a PO reference. All Additional Usage fees will be invoiced regardless of a PO requirement. The Product(s) are deemed accepted upon its provisioning. User Accounts Use of the Products require Customer users to create Login Credentials. Customer user Login Credential information must be accurate, current, and complete. New Relic’s use and collection of Login Credentials (in accordance with its General Data Privacy Notice) is for account and product management and support of its customers. Customer and Customer users must abide by the New Relic Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) and Login Credentials may not be shared. Each Customer user must have their own user account. Entry into an Order indicates your agreement that the amount of provisioned users (at the rate specified in the Order) applies in lieu of and supersedes any other amount of users of the Products that may be specified in the agreement between Customer and New Relic. New Relic One Pro and Enterprise Service Level Availability Commitment With a subscription to New Relic Full Stack Observability Pro or Enterprise Products, you agree that during the Commitment Term the applicable service level availability commitment set forth on the ‘Service level availability commitment’ page in the Documentation shall apply to the Products. For clarity, if your agreement with New Relic contains a different service level availability commitment or remedies, the above does not apply to your subscription to the New Relic Full Stack Observability Pro or Enterprise Products. If you subscribe to any other New Relic Products with New Relic One pricing, any service level availability commitment or related remedies contained within your agreement with New Relic are vacated and nullified, and New Relic will use commercially reasonable efforts to make New Relic Full Stack Observability Standard and Telemetry Data Platform available in line with industry standards. New Relic One Pro and Enterprise Support Plans With a subscription to New Relic One Users (Full Stack Observability), New Relic provides an updated support plan commitment. By subscribing to New Relic One Users (Full Stack Observability), you agree that during the Commitment Term the applicable Support Plan set forth on the ‘Support plan’ page in the Documentation shall apply in lieu of, and supersedes and replaces, any other support related commitments that may be contained within your agreement with New Relic. For New Relic K.K. customers (Japan), the above does not currently apply to the support offerings provided by New Relic to you. Free tier, ‘lite’, no-charge, preview access, New Relic One - Data, New Relic One - Standard User subscriptions If you are using New Relic’s Products in the free tier only, or on a no-charge, or a ‘lite’ or ‘preview access’ basis you agree that the Unpaid Terms of Service will apply to such Product usage and replace and supersede any other terms. In addition, if your subscription contains the New Relic One - Standard User (Full Stack Observability Standard) Product, you agree that the Paid Terms of Service will apply to your subscription to the Products set forth in an Order and replace and supersede any other terms. Separate Platforms Customer access to any separate platforms for purposes of applicability of governing terms, such as Community Cloud for Pixie, is subject to their own terms of service. For clarity, such other platforms do not form part of the New Relic One offering and New Relic One warranties, indemnities, etc., do not apply to use of any other platforms for purposes of applicability of governing terms.",

App An app means the application software designed to run on smartphones, tablet computers, and other mobile devices. Each app includes a predefined number of users. App transaction An app transaction is an APM application's attempt to process a web or non-web request. In New Relic APM these manifest as throughput TIMESERIES or individually as events in the Transaction event type. AWS Lambda event An AWS Lambda event means the row of data collected from the customer's AWS Lambda function by the New Relic agent or sent from an external service into the New Relic platform. It consists of the AwsLambdaInvocation, AwsLambdaInvocationError, or custom event types. Check A check means the single instance of a Synthetics monitor running in New Relic's monitoring network and reporting back response time, and whether the check was a success or failure. Compute unit A compute unit means the measure of resources associated with a unit of computation on a physical or virtual host. Datapoints per minute Datapoints per minute (DPM) refers to the per-minute rate at which individual metric values are sent to the New Relic Metric Ingest API. For billing purposes, datapoints per minute are calculated as a monthly average value by summing the datapoints ingested during a 30 day period and dividing by the number of minutes in that period (43,200). Event An event means the row of data collected from the customer's application by the New Relic agent or sent from an external service into our database. Host A host means the physical computer or virtual machine instance running a single copy of an operating system. Host usage is tracked monthly by summing the hours that every host in the account is connected to New Relic and dividing by 750. A host is counted if it is connected any time during an hour. Incident event An incident event is an alerting event (open, closed, etc.) created by an alerting engine that is sent into the New Relic Applied Intelligence platform (non-unique) for de-duplication, flapping detection, smart suppression, enrichment, and correlation. Page view A page view means the full page load (triggering an onLoad event) or a recorded URL change (state change). Per GB daily Per GB daily represents a daily average of Log data sent to New Relic over a 30 day period. Span A span represents an operation summary collected from the customer's application via the New Relic APM agent or New Relic Serverless for AWS Lambda agent, or sent from other tracing tools to the New Relic Trace API. User A user means the individual that connects to your app from a single device. Each unique device is considered as a unique user.",

      "body": "Logs in context for the .NET agent connects your logs and APM data in New Relic. Bringing all of this data together in a single tool helps you quickly get to the root cause of an issue and find the log lines that you need to identify and resolve a problem. Set up your .NET app To enable logs in context for APM apps monitored by .NET: Make sure you have already set up logging in New Relic. This includes configuring a supported log forwarder that collects your application logs and extends the metadata that is forwarded to New Relic. Install or update to the latest .NET agent version, and enable distributed tracing. Use .NET agent version 8.21 or higher and the New Relic .NET agent API version 8.21 or higher for logs in context. Install or update to Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5 or higher or .NET Core 2.0 or higher. Install and configure any of the following logging extensions to enrich your log data. Configure log4net extension You can use the Apache log4net version 2.0.8 or higher extension to link your log data with related data across the rest of the New Relic platform. log4net workflow diagram The following diagram illustrates the flow of log messages through Apache log4net, highlighting specific components of the New Relic log4net extension. Many log forwarders are available. This example uses Fluentd. Appender: The NewRelicAppender adds contextual information from the .NET agent (using the API) to the log events generated by the application. This contextual information, known as linking metadata, is used by New Relic to link log messages to the transactions and spans from which they were created. This appender will pass the enriched log events to downstream appenders for further processing. Since the NewRelicAppender is ForwardingAppender type, it needs to be the first appender in the chain. It also requires another appender that can write to an actual output destination as its child in order to work. Layout: The NewRelicLayout formats the enriched log events into the JSON format expected by New Relic. The appender, which this layout is assigned to, instructs log4net to output the JSON to a file in the location that the log forwarder expects. Log Forwarder: The log forwarder monitors an output folder and incrementally sends New Relic formatted log information to the New Relic logging endpoint. log4net 2.0.8 or higher configuration Log4net uses appender and layout to store and format log messages. NewRelicAppender enriches log messages with contextual information from the New Relic .NET agent if it is attached to your application. The appender passes enriched log messages to downstream appenders to handle specific use cases for log messages. For more information about logging with log4net, see the Apache log4net Getting started documentation. To configure logs in context with the log4net extension: Using the Visual Studio NuGet Package Manager, locate and install the NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Log4Net package. In your log4net configuration file, update your logging configuration to use the NewRelicAppender as the first level appender, and reference your existing appenders as its children. Also replace the layout of the appender that writes log messages to an output destination with the NewRelicLayout. The following log4net configuration example enriches log events with New Relic linking metadata. In addition to the existing log files, it outputs new log files in a specific JSON format at C:\\logs\\log4netExample.log.json for consumption by the log forwarder: <log4net> <root> <level value=\"ALL\" /> <appender-ref ref=\"NewRelicAppender\" /> </root> <appender name=\"NewRelicAppender\" type=\"NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Log4Net.NewRelicAppender, NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Log4Net\" > <threshold value=\"ALL\"/> <appender-ref ref=\"FileAppender\" /> </appender> <appender name=\"FileAppender\" type=\"log4net.Appender.FileAppender\"> <file value=\"C:\\logs\\log4netExample.log.json\" /> <param name=\"AppendToFile\" value=\"true\" /> <layout type=\"NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Log4Net.NewRelicLayout, NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Log4Net\"> </layout> </appender> </log4net> Copy After you configure the log4net extension and update your logging file, you can configure your extension to send data to New Relic. Here is an example configuration using the Fluentd plugin for New Relic Logs: <!--NewRelicLoggingExample.conf--> <source> @type tail path C:\\logs\\log4netExample.log.json pos_file C:\\logs\\log4netExample.log.json.pos tag logfile.* <parse> @type json </parse> </source> <match **> @type newrelic license_key <YOUR NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY> base_uri https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 </match> Copy Configure NLog extension You can use our NLog 4.5 or higher extension to link to your log data with related data across the rest of the New Relic platform. Nlog workflow diagram The New Relic NLog extension provides a NewRelicJsonLayout that formats a log event in the way required by the New Relic logging endpoint. Next, it adds contextual information from the .NET agent when attached to your application. Then, a target can be configured to write logging data to an output folder. The log forwarder can monitor this folder and incrementally send log information to New Relic. The following diagram illustrates the flow of log messages through NLog, highlighting specific components of the New Relic NLog extension. New Relic JSON Layout: The NewRelicJsonLayout adds contextual information from the .NET agent (using the API) to the log events generated by the application, and outputs log messages in the JSON format expected by New Relic. This contextual information, known as linking metadata, is used by New Relic to link log messages to the transactions and spans where they were created. Since the NewRelicAppender is ForwardingAppender type, it needs to be the first appender in the chain. It also requires another appender that can write to an actual output destination as its child in order to work. File Target: A FileTarget defines a file on disk where log messages are written. Adding the NewRelicJsonLayout to that target allows the output to be formatted correctly for forwarding to New Relic. Log Forwarder: The log forwarder is configured to send the log data from the FileTarget output to New Relic. The example below uses the New Relic Fluentd log forwarder, however there are many other log forwarders that can be used. For more information about logging with NLog, see the nlog-project.org documentation. Nlog 4.5 or higher configuration Use our NLog 4.5 or higher extension to link to your log data with related data across the rest of the New Relic platform. Using the Visual Studio NuGet Package Manager, locate and install the NewRelic.LogEnrichers.NLog package. In your application code, update your logging configuration to add the NewRelicJsonLayout and decide if you want to collect MappedDiagnosticsContext (MDC) or the MappedDiagnosticsLogicalContext (MDLC) data. The following configuration examples result in new JSON files that are written to disk. Some of these configuration options may be useful for managing the amount of disk space used and/or the performance of the target. archiveAboveSize maxArchiveFiles bufferSize enableArchiveFileCompression autoFlush concurrentWrites Although the NLog AsyncWrapper Target is not required, it may help improve performance by performing formatting and output of log files on a different thread. Don't collect MDC or the MDLC data (default): The following code example enriches log events with New Relic linking metadata, but not with MDC or the MDLC data. In addition to the existing log files, it outputs new log files in a specific JSON format at C:\\logs\\NLogExample.log.json for consumption by the log forwarder: var loggerConfig = new LoggingConfiguration(); var newRelicFileTarget = new FileTarget(\"NewRelicFileTarget\"); newRelicFileTarget.Layout = new NewRelicJsonLayout(); newRelicFileTarget.FileName = \"C:\\logs\\NLogExample.json\"; loggerConfig.AddTarget(newRelicFileTarget); loggerConfig.AddRuleForAllLevels(\"NewRelicFileTarget\"); LogManager.Configuration = loggerConfig; var logger = LogManager.GetLogger(\"Example\"); Copy Collect MDC or the MDLC data: If your application uses the MDC or the MDLC, you can configure the NewRelicJsonLayout to include items in those collections. The following code example adds the additional configuration to enable collecting MDC and MDLC data. As in the previous example, it outputs new log files in a specific JSON format at C:\\logs\\NLogExample.log.json for consumption by the log forwarder: var loggerConfig = new LoggingConfiguration(); var newRelicFileTarget = new FileTarget(\"NewRelicFileTarget\"); var newRelicLayout = new NewRelicJsonLayout { IncludeMdc = `true,` IncludeMdlc = `true` }; newRelicFileTarget.Layout = newRelicLayout; newRelicFileTarget.FileName = \"C:\\logs\\NLogExample.json\"; loggerConfig.AddTarget(newRelicFileTarget); loggerConfig.AddRuleForAllLevels(\"NewRelicFileTarget\"); LogManager.Configuration = loggerConfig; var logger = LogManager.GetLogger(\"Example\"); Copy Once you have configured the NLog extension and updated your logging file, you can configure your extension to send data to New Relic. Here is an example configuration using the Fluentd plugin to forward logs to New Relic: <!--NewRelicLoggingExample.conf--> <source> @type tail path C:\\logs\\NLogExample.log.json pos_file C:\\logs\\NLogExample.log.json.pos tag logfile.* <parse> @type json </parse> </source> <match **> @type newrelic license_key <YOUR NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY> base_uri https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 </match> Copy Nlog file-based configuration You can also configure the New Relic NLog extension with file-based configuration providers. The folowing example code creates a logger based on settings contained in an App.config file. Instantiating Logger using .config file var logger = LogManager.GetLogger(\"NewRelicLog\"); logger.Info(\"Hello, New Relic!\"); Copy Sample App.config file <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\" ?> <configuration> <configSections> <section name=\"nlog\" type=\"NLog.Config.ConfigSectionHandler, NLog\"/> </configSections> <startup> <supportedRuntime version=\"v4.0\" sku=\".NETFramework,Version=v4.5\" /> </startup> <nlog xmlns=\"http://www.nlog-project.org/schemas/NLog.xsd\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"> <extensions> <add assembly=\"NewRelic.LogEnrichers.NLog\" /> </extensions> <targets> <target name=\"NewRelicLogFile\" xsi:type=\"File\" fileName=\"C:/path/to/NewRelicLog.json\"> <layout xsi:type=\"newrelic-jsonlayout\"> </layout> </target> </targets> <rules> <logger name=\"NewRelicLog\" minlevel=\"Info\" writeTo=\"newRelicLogFile\" /> </rules> </nlog> </configuration> Copy Configure Serilog 2.5 or higher extension You can use our Serilog extension to link to your log data with related data across the rest of the New Relic platform. This requires: Serilog 2.5 or higher Serilog File Sinks v4.0 or higher Serilog workflow diagram Serilog is a structured logging framework that records log messages from your application and creates a LogEvent to store the message data. Using Enrichers, you can add additional information to the log events. Sinks and Formatters allow you to format and output those log events for downstream consumption and viewing. The following diagram illustrates the flow of log messages through Serilog, highlighting specific components of the New Relic Serilog extension. Many log forwarders are available. This example uses Fluentd. New Relic Enricher: The NewRelicEnricher adds contextual information from the .NET agent (using the API) to the log events generated by the application. This contextual information, called linking metadata, is used by New Relic to link log messages to the transactions and spans where they were created. New Relic Formatter: The NewRelicFormattertranslates enriched log events into the JSON format expected by New Relic. A sink instructs Serilog to output the JSON to a file in the location that the log forwarder expects. New Relic Log Forwarder: The NewRelicFormatter translates enriched log events into the JSON format expected by New Relic. A sink instructs Serilog to output the JSON to a file in the location that the log forwarder expects. For more information about Serilog log events, see the Serilog documentation on GitHub. Serilog 2.5 or higher configuration To configure logs in context with the Serilog extension: Use the Visual Studio NuGet Package Manager to locate and install the NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Serilog package. In your application code, update your logging configuration to add the NewRelicEnricher and NewRelicFormatter. The following code example enriches log events with New Relic linking metadata. In addition to the existing log files, it outputs new log files in a specific JSON format at C:\\logs\\SerilogExample.log.json for consumption by the log forwarder: var loggerConfig = new LoggerConfiguration() loggerConfig .Enrich.WithThreadName() .Enrich.WithThreadId() .Enrich.WithNewRelicLogsInContext() .WriteTo.File( path: @\"C:\\logs\\ExistingLoggingOutput.txt\") .WriteTo.File( formatter: new NewRelicFormatter(), path: @\"C:\\logs\\SerilogExample.log.json\"); var log = loggerConfig.CreateLogger(); Copy This configuration results in new JSON files that are written to disk. Some of these configuration options may be useful for managing the amount of disk space used and/or the performance of the sink. restrictedToMinimumLevel buffered rollingInterval rollOnFileSizeLimit retainedFileCountLimit Although not required, using the Serilog Asynchronous Sink Wrapper may help improve the performance by performing formatting and output of log files on a different thread. Once you have configured the Serilog extension and updated your logging file, you can configure your extension to send data to New Relic. Here is an example configuration using the Fluentd plugin to forward logs to New Relic: <!--NewRelicLoggingExample.conf--> <source> @type tail path C:\\logs\\SerilogExample.log.json pos_file C:\\logs\\SerilogExample.log.json.pos tag logfile.* <parse> @type json </parse> </source> <match **> @type newrelic license_key <YOUR NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY> base_uri https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 </match> Copy Serilog file-based configuration You can also configure the New Relic Serilog extension with file-based configuration providers.The following additional NuGet Packages are required: Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration/) Serilog.Settings.Configuration The following example code creates a logger based on settings contained in an appSettings.json file. Instantiating logger using appsettings.json var builder = new ConfigurationBuilder() .AddJsonFile(\"appsettings.json\"); var configuration = builder.Build(); var logger = new LoggerConfiguration() .ReadFrom.Configuration(configuration) .CreateLogger(); Copy Sample appsettings.json file { \"Serilog\": { \"Using\": [ \"Serilog.Sinks.Console\", \"Serilog.Sinks.File\", \"NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Serilog\" ], \"MinimumLevel\": \"Debug\", \"Enrich\": [ \"WithNewRelicLogsInContext\" ], \"WriteTo\": [ { \"Name\": \"File\", \"Args\": { \"path\": \"C:\\\\Logs\\\\SerilogExample.log.json\", \"formatter\": \"NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Serilog.NewRelicFormatter, NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Serilog\" } } ], \"Properties\": { \"Application\": \"NewRelic Logging Serilog Example\" } } } Copy The following example code creates a logger based on settings contained in a web.config file. The Serilog.Settings.AppSettings NuGet Package is required. Instantiating logger using .config file var logger = new LoggerConfiguration() .ReadFrom.AppSettings() .CreateLogger(); Copy Sample web.config file <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?> <configuration> <appSettings> <add key=\"serilog:using:NewRelic\" value=\"NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Serilog\" /> <add key=\"serilog:using:File\" value=\"Serilog.Sinks.File\" /> <!--Add other enrichers here--> <add key=\"serilog:enrich:WithNewRelicLogsInContext\" /> <add key=\"serilog:write-to:File.path\" value=\"C:\\logs\\SerilogExample.log.json\" /> <add key=\"serilog:write-to:File.formatter\" value=\"NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Serilog.NewRelicFormatter, NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Serilog\" /> </appSettings> Copy View logs in the UI To verify that you have configured the log appender correctly, run your application, then check your logs data in New Relic One using the query operator has:span.id has:trace.id. If everything is configured correctly and your data is being forwarded to New Relic with the enriched metadata, your logs should now be emitted as JSON and contain trace.id and span.id fields. If you don't see log data in the UI, follow the troubleshooting procedures. What's next? After you set up APM logs in context, make the most of your logging data: Explore the logging data across your platform with our Logs UI. See your logs in context of your app's performance in the APM UI. Troubleshoot errors with distributed tracing, stack traces, application logs, and more. Get deeper visibility into both your application and your platform performance data by forwarding your logs with our infrastructure monitoring agent. Review your infrastructure logs in the UI. Set up alerts. Query your data and create dashboards.",

      "body": "Logs in context for the Java agent connects your logs and APM data in New Relic. Bringing all of this data together in a single tool helps you quickly get to the root cause of an issue and find the log lines that you need to identify and resolve a problem. Set up your Java app To enable logs in context for APM apps monitored by Java: Make sure you have already set up logging in New Relic. This includes configuring a supported log forwarder that collects your application logs and extends the metadata that is forwarded to New Relic. Install or update to the latest Java agent version. Use Java agent version 5.6.0 or higher for logs in context. Enable the JVM argument -javaagent, and enable distributed tracing. Configure logs in context for Java to enrich your log data, using any of the following extensions as applicable. If you use Spring or Spring Boot and aren't sure which extension you need, see our Spring documentation. Dropwizard 1.3 or higher We offer a Dropwizard extension for logs in context with the Java agent. To get started, review the code and an example application on GitHub. To configure logs in context for your Java app with the DropWizard extension: Make sure you have the Dropwizard 1.3 or higher package installed and working on your application. Use the original Dropwizard appenders and logging factory installed and working on the application. Make sure you have the New Relic Java agent version 5.6.0 or higher installed on your application, and that you have enabled the JVM argument -javaagent. Update your project's dependencies to include the Dropwizard 1.3 extension as applicable: Gradle: Add the following to your build.gradle file: dependencies { compile(\"com.newrelic.logging:dropwizard:2.0\") } Copy Maven: Add the following to your pom.xml file: <dependencies> <dependency> <groupId>com.newrelic.logging</groupId> <artifactId>dropwizard</artifactId> <version>2.0</version> </dependency> </dependencies> Copy Update your Dropwizard .yaml configuration file with a newrelic-json layout, replacing the currently used type: console or type: file with either type: newrelic-console or type: newrelic-file as appropriate. For example: logging: appenders: - type: newrelic-console # Add the two lines below if you don't have a layout specified on the appender. # If you have a layout, remove all parameters to the layout and set the type. layout: type: newrelic-json Copy The New Relic Dropwizard extension also supports a log-format layout type that uses the standard Dropwizard logging. For testing purposes, you can change the type of the layout with a one-line change: logging: appenders: - type: newrelic-file # This format will be ignored by the newrelic-json layout, but used by the log-format layout. logFormat: \"%date{ISO8601} %c %-5p: %m trace.id=%mdc{trace.id} span.id=%mdc{span.id}%n\" layout: # type: newrelic-json type: log-format Copy java.util.logging We offer a java.util.logging extension for logs in context with the Java agent. To get started, review the code and an example application on GitHub. To configure logs in context for your Java app with with the java.util.logging extension: Make sure you have the java.util.logging package installed and working on the application. Make sure you have the New Relic Java agent version 5.6.0 or higher installed on your application, and that you have enabled the JVM argument -javaagent. Update your project's dependencies to include the java.util.logging extension as applicable. If you can't edit these files, you can instead add the jars directly to the application classpath. Gradle: Add the following to your build.gradle file: dependencies { compile(\"com.newrelic.logging:jul:2.0\") } Copy Maven: Add the following to your pom.xml file: <dependencies> <dependency> <groupId>com.newrelic.logging</groupId> <artifactId>jul</artifactId> <version>2.0</version> </dependency> </dependencies> Copy Check if your logging file's handlers property is set to something other than NewRelicMemoryHandler. Look for a line listing the root logger's handlers, like this: handlers = java.util.logging.FileHandler Copy Update your logging properties file to set the root logger's handler to NewRelicMemoryHandler so it intercepts messages destined for another handler: handlers = com.newrelic.logging.jul.NewRelicMemoryHandler Copy Configure the NewRelicMemoryHandler by setting the target to the handler that was previously assigned to the root logger, so it captures data New Relic needs on the thread the log message is coming from: com.newrelic.logging.jul.NewRelicMemoryHandler.target = java.util.logging.FileHandler Copy Use a NewRelicFormatter for the final handler. Update your logging properties file to set the formatter property like the following example. Make sure the handler where you set the formatter is the target handler from the previous step (java.util.logging.FileHandler in this example). java.util.logging.FileHandler.formatter = com.newrelic.logging.jul. NewRelicFormatter Copy The New Relic log format is JSON with telemetry metadata we use to correlate transactions and logs together. Currently we do not support any customization of that format. Once complete, JSON is logged instead of text. The JSON should be formatted as single objects, one per line, and should contain fields like log.level and thread.name. The trace.id, which is required for logs in context, should only have a value for log messages that occur within a transaction. java.util.logging classpath additions The most direct way to get the logs-in-context extensions is to add these dependencies to Maven's pom.xml or Gradle's build.gradle. This allows the packaging tools to pick up the correct dependencies. If you can't edit these files, you can instead add the jars directly to the application classpath for your logging framework's configuration. Before you modify the classpath: Enable the JVM argument -javaagent on your app's Java agent. Verify which logging framework the application is using. Make sure you are able to change your logging framework's configuration. Add the following three jars to the classpath if they aren't already present. Generally, we recommend taking the latest versions published on Maven Central. Group ID com.newrelic.logging and Artifact ID: Select the artifact named after your application's logging framework in Maven. Group ID com.fasterxml.jackson.core and Artifact ID: Use jackson-core. Group ID com.newrelic.agent.java and Artifact ID: Use newrelic-api. Log4j 1.x We offer a Log4j 1.x extension extension for logs in context with the Java agent. To get started, review the code and an example application on GitHub. To configure logs in context for your Java app with with the Log4j 1.x extension, you must configure the Log4j extension in code or via XML. Properties files are not supported because AsyncAppender instances can only be automatically configured via XML. Make sure you have the Log4j 1.x package installed and working on the application. Make sure you have the New Relic Java agent version 5.6.0 or higher installed on your application, and that you have enabled the JVM argument -javaagent. Update your project's dependencies to include the Log4j 1.x extension as applicable. Gradle: Add the following to your build.gradle file: dependencies { compile(\"com.newrelic.logging:log4j1:2.0\") } Copy Maven: Add the following to your pom.xml file: <dependencies> <dependency> <groupId>com.newrelic.logging</groupId> <artifactId>log4j1</artifactId> <version>2.0</version> </dependency> </dependencies> Copy In your logging configuration XML file, update your <appender> element with a NewRelicLayout, adding <layout class=\"com.newrelic.logging.log4j1.NewRelicLayout\"/>: <appender name=\" TypicalFile \" class=\"org.apache.log4j.FileAppender\"> <param name=\"file\" value=\"logs/log4j1-app.log\"/> <param name=\"append\" value=\"false\"/> <layout class=\" com.newrelic.logging.log4j1.NewRelicLayout \"/> <!-- only this line needs to be added --> </appender> Copy Use NewRelicAsyncAppender to wrap any appenders that will target New Relic's log forwarder. For example: <appender name=\" NewRelicFile \" class=\"com.newrelic.logging.log4j1.NewRelicAsyncAppender\"> <appender-ref ref=\" TypicalFile \" /> </appender> Copy Use the async appender on the root logger. For example: <root> <appender-ref ref=\" NewRelicFile \" /> </root> Copy Example configuration file for the Log4j 1.x extension: <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\" ?> <!DOCTYPE log4j:configuration SYSTEM \"log4j.dtd\"> <log4j:configuration debug=\"false\"> <appender name=\"TypicalFile\" class=\"org.apache.log4j.FileAppender\"> <param name=\"file\" value=\"logs/log4j1-app.log\"/> <param name=\"append\" value=\"false\"/> <!-- layout has been replaced --> <layout class=\"com.newrelic.logging.log4j1.NewRelicLayout\"/> </appender> <!-- this appender was added --> <appender name=\"NewRelicFile\" class=\"com.newrelic.logging.log4j1.NewRelicAsyncAppender\"> <appender-ref ref=\"TypicalFile\" /> </appender> <appender name=\"TypicalConsole\" class=\"org.apache.log4j.ConsoleAppender\"> <layout class=\"org.apache.log4j.PatternLayout\"> <param name=\"ConversionPattern\" value=\"%-5p %c{1} - %m%n\"/> </layout> </appender> <root> ​ <!-- the new appender was used here -->​​ <appender-ref ref=\"NewRelicFile\" /> <appender-ref ref=\"TypicalConsole\" /> </root> </log4j:configuration> Copy Log4j 2.x We offer a Log4j 2.x extension for logs in context with the Java agent. To get started, review the code and an example application on GitHub. To configure logs in context for your Java app with with the Log4j 2.x extension: Make sure you have the Log4j 2.x or Logs4j 2 binding package installed and working on your application. Make sure you have the New Relic Java agent version 5.6.0 or higher installed on your application, and that you have enabled the JVM argument -javaagent. Update your project's dependencies to include the Log4j 2.x extension as applicable: Gradle: Add the highlighted section to your build.gradle file: dependencies { compile(\"com.newrelic.logging:log4j2:2.0\") } Copy Maven: Add the highlighted section to your pom.xml file: <dependencies> <dependency> <groupId>com.newrelic.logging</groupId> <artifactId>log4j2</artifactId> <version>2.0</version> </dependency> </dependencies> Copy In your logging configuration XML file, update your <configuration> element by adding the highlighted section: <Configuration xmlns=\"http://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.0/config\" packages=\"com.newrelic.logging.log4j2\" > Copy If you're using a properties file, add packages=com.newrelic.logging.log4j2. Add <NewRelicLayout/> to use a NewRelicLayout element within one of the appenders. For example: <File name=\"MyFile\" fileName=\"logs/app-log-file.log\"> <NewRelicLayout/> </File> Copy If you're using a properties file, only change the layout.type: appender.console.type = Console appender.console.name = STDOUT appender.console.layout.type = NewRelicLayout Copy If you only modified an existing appender, skip this step. If you added a new appender, add <AppenderRef/> within <Root> to use this appender. Use the ref attribute to refer to appender name you created in the previous step. For example: <Root level=\"info\"> <AppenderRef ref=\"MyFile\"/> </Root> Copy If you're using a properties file and added a new appender, add: rootLogger.level = info rootLogger.appenderRef.stdout.ref = STDOUT ​​​​​ Copy Logback version 1.2.0 or higher We offer a Logback extension for logs in context with the Java agent. To get started, review the code and an example application on GitHub. To configure logs in context for your Java app with Logback: Make sure you have Logback version 1.2.0 or higher and the New Relic Java agent version 5.6.0 or higher installed and working on your application. Make sure you have the New Relic Java agent version 5.6.0 or higher installed on your application, and that you have enabled the JVM argument -javaagent. Update your project's dependencies to include the Logback extension as applicable: Gradle: Add the highlighted section to your build.gradle file: dependencies { compile(\"com.newrelic.logging:logback:2.0\") } Copy Maven: Add the highlighted section to your pom.xml file: <dependencies> <dependency> <groupId>com.newrelic.logging</groupId> <artifactId>logback</artifactId> <version>2.0</version> </dependency> </dependencies> Copy Update your logging configuration xml to replace any existing <encoder> element. If you're logging to the console (stdout/stderr), look for ConsoleAppender and replace: <appender name=\"STDOUT\" class=\"ch.qos.logback.core.ConsoleAppender\"> <encoder class=\"com.newrelic.logging.logback.NewRelicEncoder\"/> </appender> Copy If you're logging to a file, look for FileAppender and replace <encoder>: <appender name=\"LOG_FILE\" class=\"ch.qos.logback.core.FileAppender\"> <file>logs/app-log-file.log</file> <encoder class=\"com.newrelic.logging.logback.NewRelicEncoder\"/> </appender> Copy Update your logging configuration xml with the NewRelicAsyncAppender. To ensure that NewRelicAsyncAppender wraps any appenders that will target New Relic's log forwarder, add the following section. Change \"LOG_FILE\" to the name of the appender you updated in the previous step. <appender name=\"ASYNC\" class=\"com.newrelic.logging.logback.NewRelicAsyncAppender\"> <appender-ref ref=\"LOG_FILE\" /> </appender> Copy Make sure NewRelicAsyncAppender is the first appender used in your logger. Replace your root logger’s appenders with the ASYNC appender created in the previous step. Then list any other appenders after the NewRelicAsyncAppender in the <root> list. <root> <appender-ref ref=\"ASYNC\" /> </root> Copy Here are examples of an updated logging .xml file for the Logback extension. You can also see a working example in GitHub. Single console appender example Example configuration file after adding in the logging extension information: <configuration> <appender name=\"STDOUT\" class=\"ch.qos.logback.core.ConsoleAppender\"> <!-- changed the encoder --> <encoder class=\"com.newrelic.logging.logback.NewRelicEncoder\"/> </appender> <!-- added the ASYNC appender --> <appender name=\"ASYNC\" class=\"com.newrelic.logging.logback.NewRelicAsyncAppender\"> <appender-ref ref=\"STDOUT\" /> </appender> <root level=\"debug\"> <!-- changed the root logger --> <appender-ref ref=\"ASYNC\" /> </root> </configuration> Copy Two console appenders example This example sends New Relic logging to a file, but still sends standard logging to the console: <configuration> <appender name=\"FILE\" class=\"ch.qos.logback.core.FileAppender\"> <file>myApp.log</file> <!-- encoder changed --> <encoder class=\"com.newrelic.logging.logback.NewRelicEncoder\"/> </appender> <!-- this appender does normal console logging --> <appender name=\"STDOUT\" class=\"ch.qos.logback.core.ConsoleAppender\"> <encoder> <pattern>%msg%n</pattern> </encoder> </appender> <!-- The required New Relic ASYNC appender wraps the FILE appender --> <appender name=\"ASYNC\" class=\"com.newrelic.logging.logback.NewRelicAsyncAppender\"> <appender-ref ref=\"FILE\" /> </appender> <root level=\"debug\"> <!-- ASYNC is one of the main appenders --> <appender-ref ref=\"ASYNC\" /> <!-- Send every message to normal console logging, as well. --> <appender-ref ref=\"STDOUT\" /> </root> </configuration> Copy Spring and Springboot We offer extensions for current versions of Spring and Spring Boot. If you already know the logging library, you can skip directly to that documentation: java.util.logging log4j 1 log4j 2 logback The extensions support default configurations only on Spring Boot 2.0 and higher. With Spring Boot: Here are tips to determine which logging library you have: If you have spring-boot-starter-log4j2 in your dependencies, you're using log4j 2.x. Refer to the Spring Boot log4j 2.x documentation for basic configuration, and the New Relic log4j 2 extension for customizing your configuration. If you're using Spring Boot but not the starter-log4j2, you're using logback by default. Refer to Spring Boot logback documentation for basic configuration, and the New Relic logback extension for customizing your configuration. With Spring (but not Spring Boot): Spring 5 or higher: Spring implements a bridge to other logging libraries that will automatically find them. However, those individual libraries must be configured and explicitly included in your project dependencies. To identify your logging dependency, consult your Gradle, Maven, or other build tool's dependency tree. Then follow the procedures to configure logs in context for your Java app with that extension. Spring 4 or lower: Spring version 4 and lower uses Apache Commons Logging for its bridge. Refer to the Spring documentation for information on configuring its bridge. View logs in UI To verify that you have configured the log appender correctly, run your application, then check your logs data in New Relic One using the query operator has:span.id has:trace.id. If everything is configured correctly and your data is being forwarded to New Relic with the enriched metadata, your logs should now be emitted as JSON and contain trace.id and span.id fields. If you don't see log data in the UI, follow the troubleshooting procedures. What's next? After you set up APM logs in context, make the most of your logging data: Explore the logging data across your platform with our Logs UI. See your logs in context of your app's performance in the APM UI. Troubleshoot errors with distributed tracing, stack traces, application logs, and more. Get deeper visibility into both your application and your platform performance data by forwarding your logs with our infrastructure monitoring agent. Review your infrastructure logs in the UI. Set up alerts. Query your data and create dashboards.",

Logs in context adds metadata that links your logs with related APM data, like errors or distributed traces, or your platform performance data from infrastructure monitoring in New Relic One. See the root cause of issues across your platform By bringing all of your application and infrastructure data together in a single solution, you can get to the root cause of issues faster. Logs in context help you quickly see meaningful patterns and trends. The following diagram shows the lifecycle of a log message, from enrichment with agent metadata (contextual logging), to formatting and forwarding the log data to New Relic: This diagram illustrates the flow of log messages through New Relic. Don't spend extra time trying to narrow down all your logs from different parts of your platform. Instead, enable logs in context to see the exact log lines you need to identify and resolve a problem. Basic process to enable logs in context The process to enable logs in context is basically the same, regardless of which APM agent you use to monitor your application: Make sure you have already set up logging in New Relic. This includes configuring a supported log forwarder that collects your application logs and extends the metadata that is forwarded to New Relic. Update to a supported APM agent version for your app, and enable distributed tracing. Configure logs in context for your APM agent or for your infrastructure monitoring agent. View your logs within the context of your apps or infrastructure in New Relic One.

Bringing all of this data together in a single tool helps you quickly get to the root cause of an issue and find the log lines that you need to identify and resolve a problem. Set up your .NET app To enable logs in context for APM apps monitored by .NET: Make sure you have already set up logging in New Relic. This includes configuring a supported log forwarder that collects your application logs and extends the metadata that is forwarded to New Relic. Install or update to the latest .NET agent version, and enable distributed tracing. Use .NET agent version 8.21 or higher and the New Relic .NET agent API version 8.21 or higher for logs in context. Install or update to Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5 or higher or .NET Core 2.0 or higher. Install and configure any of the following logging extensions to enrich your log data. Configure log4net extension You can use the Apache log4net version 2.0.8 or higher extension to link your log data with related data across the rest of the New Relic platform. log4net workflow diagram The following diagram illustrates the flow of log messages through Apache log4net, highlighting specific components of the New Relic log4net extension. Many log forwarders are available. This example uses Fluentd. Appender: The NewRelicAppender adds contextual information from the .NET agent (using the API) to the log events generated by the application. This contextual information, known as linking metadata, is used by New Relic to link log messages to the transactions and spans from which they were created. This appender will pass the enriched log events to downstream appenders for further processing. Since the NewRelicAppender is ForwardingAppender type, it needs to be the first appender in the chain. It also requires another appender that can write to an actual output destination as its child in order to work. Layout: The NewRelicLayout formats the enriched log events into the JSON format expected by New Relic. The appender, which this layout is assigned to, instructs log4net to output the JSON to a file in the location that the log forwarder expects. Log Forwarder: The log forwarder monitors an output folder and incrementally sends New Relic formatted log information to the New Relic logging endpoint. log4net 2.0.8 or higher configuration Log4net uses appender and layout to store and format log messages. NewRelicAppender enriches log messages with contextual information from the New Relic .NET agent if it is attached to your application. The appender passes enriched log messages to downstream appenders to handle specific use cases for log messages. For more information about logging with log4net, see the Apache log4net Getting started documentation. To configure logs in context with the log4net extension: Using the Visual Studio NuGet Package Manager, locate and install the NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Log4Net package. In your log4net configuration file, update your logging configuration to use the NewRelicAppender as the first level appender, and reference your existing appenders as its children. Also replace the layout of the appender that writes log messages to an output destination with the NewRelicLayout. The following log4net configuration example enriches log events with New Relic linking metadata. In addition to the existing log files, it outputs new log files in a specific JSON format at C:\\logs\\log4netExample.log.json for consumption by the log forwarder: <log4net> <root> <level value=\"ALL\" /> <appender-ref ref=\"NewRelicAppender\" /> </root> <appender name=\"NewRelicAppender\" type=\"NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Log4Net.NewRelicAppender, NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Log4Net\" > <threshold value=\"ALL\"/> <appender-ref ref=\"FileAppender\" /> </appender> <appender name=\"FileAppender\" type=\"log4net.Appender.FileAppender\"> <file value=\"C:\\logs\\log4netExample.log.json\" /> <param name=\"AppendToFile\" value=\"true\" /> <layout type=\"NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Log4Net.NewRelicLayout, NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Log4Net\"> </layout> </appender> </log4net> Copy After you configure the log4net extension and update your logging file, you can configure your extension to send data to New Relic. Here is an example configuration using the Fluentd plugin for New Relic Logs: <!--NewRelicLoggingExample.conf--> <source> @type tail path C:\\logs\\log4netExample.log.json pos_file C:\\logs\\log4netExample.log.json.pos tag logfile.* <parse> @type json </parse> </source> <match **> @type newrelic license_key <YOUR NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY> base_uri https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 </match> Copy Configure NLog extension You can use our NLog 4.5 or higher extension to link to your log data with related data across the rest of the New Relic platform. Nlog workflow diagram The New Relic NLog extension provides a NewRelicJsonLayout that formats a log event in the way required by the New Relic logging endpoint. Next, it adds contextual information from the .NET agent when attached to your application. Then, a target can be configured to write logging data to an output folder. The log forwarder can monitor this folder and incrementally send log information to New Relic. The following diagram illustrates the flow of log messages through NLog, highlighting specific components of the New Relic NLog extension. New Relic JSON Layout: The NewRelicJsonLayout adds contextual information from the .NET agent (using the API) to the log events generated by the application, and outputs log messages in the JSON format expected by New Relic. This contextual information, known as linking metadata, is used by New Relic to link log messages to the transactions and spans where they were created. Since the NewRelicAppender is ForwardingAppender type, it needs to be the first appender in the chain. It also requires another appender that can write to an actual output destination as its child in order to work. File Target: A FileTarget defines a file on disk where log messages are written. Adding the NewRelicJsonLayout to that target allows the output to be formatted correctly for forwarding to New Relic. Log Forwarder: The log forwarder is configured to send the log data from the FileTarget output to New Relic. The example below uses the New Relic Fluentd log forwarder, however there are many other log forwarders that can be used. For more information about logging with NLog, see the nlog-project.org documentation. Nlog 4.5 or higher configuration Use our NLog 4.5 or higher extension to link to your log data with related data across the rest of the New Relic platform. Using the Visual Studio NuGet Package Manager, locate and install the NewRelic.LogEnrichers.NLog package. In your application code, update your logging configuration to add the NewRelicJsonLayout and decide if you want to collect MappedDiagnosticsContext (MDC) or the MappedDiagnosticsLogicalContext (MDLC) data. The following configuration examples result in new JSON files that are written to disk. Some of these configuration options may be useful for managing the amount of disk space used and/or the performance of the target. archiveAboveSize maxArchiveFiles bufferSize enableArchiveFileCompression autoFlush concurrentWrites Although the NLog AsyncWrapper Target is not required, it may help improve performance by performing formatting and output of log files on a different thread. Don't collect MDC or the MDLC data (default): The following code example enriches log events with New Relic linking metadata, but not with MDC or the MDLC data. In addition to the existing log files, it outputs new log files in a specific JSON format at C:\\logs\\NLogExample.log.json for consumption by the log forwarder: var loggerConfig = new LoggingConfiguration(); var newRelicFileTarget = new FileTarget(\"NewRelicFileTarget\"); newRelicFileTarget.Layout = new NewRelicJsonLayout(); newRelicFileTarget.FileName = \"C:\\logs\\NLogExample.json\"; loggerConfig.AddTarget(newRelicFileTarget); loggerConfig.AddRuleForAllLevels(\"NewRelicFileTarget\"); LogManager.Configuration = loggerConfig; var logger = LogManager.GetLogger(\"Example\"); Copy Collect MDC or the MDLC data: If your application uses the MDC or the MDLC, you can configure the NewRelicJsonLayout to include items in those collections. The following code example adds the additional configuration to enable collecting MDC and MDLC data. As in the previous example, it outputs new log files in a specific JSON format at C:\\logs\\NLogExample.log.json for consumption by the log forwarder: var loggerConfig = new LoggingConfiguration(); var newRelicFileTarget = new FileTarget(\"NewRelicFileTarget\"); var newRelicLayout = new NewRelicJsonLayout { IncludeMdc = `true,` IncludeMdlc = `true` }; newRelicFileTarget.Layout = newRelicLayout; newRelicFileTarget.FileName = \"C:\\logs\\NLogExample.json\"; loggerConfig.AddTarget(newRelicFileTarget); loggerConfig.AddRuleForAllLevels(\"NewRelicFileTarget\"); LogManager.Configuration = loggerConfig; var logger = LogManager.GetLogger(\"Example\"); Copy Once you have configured the NLog extension and updated your logging file, you can configure your extension to send data to New Relic. Here is an example configuration using the Fluentd plugin to forward logs to New Relic: <!--NewRelicLoggingExample.conf--> <source> @type tail path C:\\logs\\NLogExample.log.json pos_file C:\\logs\\NLogExample.log.json.pos tag logfile.* <parse> @type json </parse> </source> <match **> @type newrelic license_key <YOUR NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY> base_uri https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 </match> Copy Nlog file-based configuration You can also configure the New Relic NLog extension with file-based configuration providers. The folowing example code creates a logger based on settings contained in an App.config file. Instantiating Logger using .config file var logger = LogManager.GetLogger(\"NewRelicLog\"); logger.Info(\"Hello, New Relic!\"); Copy Sample App.config file <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\" ?> <configuration> <configSections> <section name=\"nlog\" type=\"NLog.Config.ConfigSectionHandler, NLog\"/> </configSections> <startup> <supportedRuntime version=\"v4.0\" sku=\".NETFramework,Version=v4.5\" /> </startup> <nlog xmlns=\"http://www.nlog-project.org/schemas/NLog.xsd\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"> <extensions> <add assembly=\"NewRelic.LogEnrichers.NLog\" /> </extensions> <targets> <target name=\"NewRelicLogFile\" xsi:type=\"File\" fileName=\"C:/path/to/NewRelicLog.json\"> <layout xsi:type=\"newrelic-jsonlayout\"> </layout> </target> </targets> <rules> <logger name=\"NewRelicLog\" minlevel=\"Info\" writeTo=\"newRelicLogFile\" /> </rules> </nlog> </configuration> Copy Configure Serilog 2.5 or higher extension You can use our Serilog extension to link to your log data with related data across the rest of the New Relic platform. This requires: Serilog 2.5 or higher Serilog File Sinks v4.0 or higher Serilog workflow diagram Serilog is a structured logging framework that records log messages from your application and creates a LogEvent to store the message data. Using Enrichers, you can add additional information to the log events. Sinks and Formatters allow you to format and output those log events for downstream consumption and viewing. The following diagram illustrates the flow of log messages through Serilog, highlighting specific components of the New Relic Serilog extension. Many log forwarders are available. This example uses Fluentd. New Relic Enricher: The NewRelicEnricher adds contextual information from the .NET agent (using the API) to the log events generated by the application. This contextual information, called linking metadata, is used by New Relic to link log messages to the transactions and spans where they were created. New Relic Formatter: The NewRelicFormattertranslates enriched log events into the JSON format expected by New Relic. A sink instructs Serilog to output the JSON to a file in the location that the log forwarder expects. New Relic Log Forwarder: The NewRelicFormatter translates enriched log events into the JSON format expected by New Relic. A sink instructs Serilog to output the JSON to a file in the location that the log forwarder expects. For more information about Serilog log events, see the Serilog documentation on GitHub. Serilog 2.5 or higher configuration To configure logs in context with the Serilog extension: Use the Visual Studio NuGet Package Manager to locate and install the NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Serilog package. In your application code, update your logging configuration to add the NewRelicEnricher and NewRelicFormatter. The following code example enriches log events with New Relic linking metadata. In addition to the existing log files, it outputs new log files in a specific JSON format at C:\\logs\\SerilogExample.log.json for consumption by the log forwarder: var loggerConfig = new LoggerConfiguration() loggerConfig .Enrich.WithThreadName() .Enrich.WithThreadId() .Enrich.WithNewRelicLogsInContext() .WriteTo.File( path: @\"C:\\logs\\ExistingLoggingOutput.txt\") .WriteTo.File( formatter: new NewRelicFormatter(), path: @\"C:\\logs\\SerilogExample.log.json\"); var log = loggerConfig.CreateLogger(); Copy This configuration results in new JSON files that are written to disk. Some of these configuration options may be useful for managing the amount of disk space used and/or the performance of the sink. restrictedToMinimumLevel buffered rollingInterval rollOnFileSizeLimit retainedFileCountLimit Although not required, using the Serilog Asynchronous Sink Wrapper may help improve the performance by performing formatting and output of log files on a different thread. Once you have configured the Serilog extension and updated your logging file, you can configure your extension to send data to New Relic. Here is an example configuration using the Fluentd plugin to forward logs to New Relic: <!--NewRelicLoggingExample.conf--> <source> @type tail path C:\\logs\\SerilogExample.log.json pos_file C:\\logs\\SerilogExample.log.json.pos tag logfile.* <parse> @type json </parse> </source> <match **> @type newrelic license_key <YOUR NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY> base_uri https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 </match> Copy Serilog file-based configuration You can also configure the New Relic Serilog extension with file-based configuration providers.The following additional NuGet Packages are required: Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration/) Serilog.Settings.Configuration The following example code creates a logger based on settings contained in an appSettings.json file. Instantiating logger using appsettings.json var builder = new ConfigurationBuilder() .AddJsonFile(\"appsettings.json\"); var configuration = builder.Build(); var logger = new LoggerConfiguration() .ReadFrom.Configuration(configuration) .CreateLogger(); Copy Sample appsettings.json file { \"Serilog\": { \"Using\": [ \"Serilog.Sinks.Console\", \"Serilog.Sinks.File\", \"NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Serilog\" ], \"MinimumLevel\": \"Debug\", \"Enrich\": [ \"WithNewRelicLogsInContext\" ], \"WriteTo\": [ { \"Name\": \"File\", \"Args\": { \"path\": \"C:\\\\Logs\\\\SerilogExample.log.json\", \"formatter\": \"NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Serilog.NewRelicFormatter, NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Serilog\" } } ], \"Properties\": { \"Application\": \"NewRelic Logging Serilog Example\" } } } Copy The following example code creates a logger based on settings contained in a web.config file. The Serilog.Settings.AppSettings NuGet Package is required. Instantiating logger using .config file var logger = new LoggerConfiguration() .ReadFrom.AppSettings() .CreateLogger(); Copy Sample web.config file <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?> <configuration> <appSettings> <add key=\"serilog:using:NewRelic\" value=\"NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Serilog\" /> <add key=\"serilog:using:File\" value=\"Serilog.Sinks.File\" /> <!--Add other enrichers here--> <add key=\"serilog:enrich:WithNewRelicLogsInContext\" /> <add key=\"serilog:write-to:File.path\" value=\"C:\\logs\\SerilogExample.log.json\" /> <add key=\"serilog:write-to:File.formatter\" value=\"NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Serilog.NewRelicFormatter, NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Serilog\" /> </appSettings> Copy View logs in the UI To verify that you have configured the log appender correctly, run your application, then check your logs data in New Relic One using the query operator has:span.id has:trace.id. If everything is configured correctly and your data is being forwarded to New Relic with the enriched metadata, your logs should now be emitted as JSON and contain trace.id and span.id fields. If you don't see log data in the UI, follow the troubleshooting procedures. What's next? After you set up APM logs in context, make the most of your logging data: Explore the logging data across your platform with our Logs UI.

      "body": "Logs in context for the Java agent connects your logs and APM data in New Relic. Bringing all of this data together in a single tool helps you quickly get to the root cause of an issue and find the log lines that you need to identify and resolve a problem. Set up your Java app To enable logs in context for APM apps monitored by Java: Make sure you have already set up logging in New Relic. This includes configuring a supported log forwarder that collects your application logs and extends the metadata that is forwarded to New Relic. Install or update to the latest Java agent version. Use Java agent version 5.6.0 or higher for logs in context. Enable the JVM argument -javaagent, and enable distributed tracing. Configure logs in context for Java to enrich your log data, using any of the following extensions as applicable. If you use Spring or Spring Boot and aren't sure which extension you need, see our Spring documentation. Dropwizard 1.3 or higher We offer a Dropwizard extension for logs in context with the Java agent. To get started, review the code and an example application on GitHub. To configure logs in context for your Java app with the DropWizard extension: Make sure you have the Dropwizard 1.3 or higher package installed and working on your application. Use the original Dropwizard appenders and logging factory installed and working on the application. Make sure you have the New Relic Java agent version 5.6.0 or higher installed on your application, and that you have enabled the JVM argument -javaagent. Update your project's dependencies to include the Dropwizard 1.3 extension as applicable: Gradle: Add the following to your build.gradle file: dependencies { compile(\"com.newrelic.logging:dropwizard:2.0\") } Copy Maven: Add the following to your pom.xml file: <dependencies> <dependency> <groupId>com.newrelic.logging</groupId> <artifactId>dropwizard</artifactId> <version>2.0</version> </dependency> </dependencies> Copy Update your Dropwizard .yaml configuration file with a newrelic-json layout, replacing the currently used type: console or type: file with either type: newrelic-console or type: newrelic-file as appropriate. For example: logging: appenders: - type: newrelic-console # Add the two lines below if you don't have a layout specified on the appender. # If you have a layout, remove all parameters to the layout and set the type. layout: type: newrelic-json Copy The New Relic Dropwizard extension also supports a log-format layout type that uses the standard Dropwizard logging. For testing purposes, you can change the type of the layout with a one-line change: logging: appenders: - type: newrelic-file # This format will be ignored by the newrelic-json layout, but used by the log-format layout. logFormat: \"%date{ISO8601} %c %-5p: %m trace.id=%mdc{trace.id} span.id=%mdc{span.id}%n\" layout: # type: newrelic-json type: log-format Copy java.util.logging We offer a java.util.logging extension for logs in context with the Java agent. To get started, review the code and an example application on GitHub. To configure logs in context for your Java app with with the java.util.logging extension: Make sure you have the java.util.logging package installed and working on the application. Make sure you have the New Relic Java agent version 5.6.0 or higher installed on your application, and that you have enabled the JVM argument -javaagent. Update your project's dependencies to include the java.util.logging extension as applicable. If you can't edit these files, you can instead add the jars directly to the application classpath. Gradle: Add the following to your build.gradle file: dependencies { compile(\"com.newrelic.logging:jul:2.0\") } Copy Maven: Add the following to your pom.xml file: <dependencies> <dependency> <groupId>com.newrelic.logging</groupId> <artifactId>jul</artifactId> <version>2.0</version> </dependency> </dependencies> Copy Check if your logging file's handlers property is set to something other than NewRelicMemoryHandler. Look for a line listing the root logger's handlers, like this: handlers = java.util.logging.FileHandler Copy Update your logging properties file to set the root logger's handler to NewRelicMemoryHandler so it intercepts messages destined for another handler: handlers = com.newrelic.logging.jul.NewRelicMemoryHandler Copy Configure the NewRelicMemoryHandler by setting the target to the handler that was previously assigned to the root logger, so it captures data New Relic needs on the thread the log message is coming from: com.newrelic.logging.jul.NewRelicMemoryHandler.target = java.util.logging.FileHandler Copy Use a NewRelicFormatter for the final handler. Update your logging properties file to set the formatter property like the following example. Make sure the handler where you set the formatter is the target handler from the previous step (java.util.logging.FileHandler in this example). java.util.logging.FileHandler.formatter = com.newrelic.logging.jul. NewRelicFormatter Copy The New Relic log format is JSON with telemetry metadata we use to correlate transactions and logs together. Currently we do not support any customization of that format. Once complete, JSON is logged instead of text. The JSON should be formatted as single objects, one per line, and should contain fields like log.level and thread.name. The trace.id, which is required for logs in context, should only have a value for log messages that occur within a transaction. java.util.logging classpath additions The most direct way to get the logs-in-context extensions is to add these dependencies to Maven's pom.xml or Gradle's build.gradle. This allows the packaging tools to pick up the correct dependencies. If you can't edit these files, you can instead add the jars directly to the application classpath for your logging framework's configuration. Before you modify the classpath: Enable the JVM argument -javaagent on your app's Java agent. Verify which logging framework the application is using. Make sure you are able to change your logging framework's configuration. Add the following three jars to the classpath if they aren't already present. Generally, we recommend taking the latest versions published on Maven Central. Group ID com.newrelic.logging and Artifact ID: Select the artifact named after your application's logging framework in Maven. Group ID com.fasterxml.jackson.core and Artifact ID: Use jackson-core. Group ID com.newrelic.agent.java and Artifact ID: Use newrelic-api. Log4j 1.x We offer a Log4j 1.x extension extension for logs in context with the Java agent. To get started, review the code and an example application on GitHub. To configure logs in context for your Java app with with the Log4j 1.x extension, you must configure the Log4j extension in code or via XML. Properties files are not supported because AsyncAppender instances can only be automatically configured via XML. Make sure you have the Log4j 1.x package installed and working on the application. Make sure you have the New Relic Java agent version 5.6.0 or higher installed on your application, and that you have enabled the JVM argument -javaagent. Update your project's dependencies to include the Log4j 1.x extension as applicable. Gradle: Add the following to your build.gradle file: dependencies { compile(\"com.newrelic.logging:log4j1:2.0\") } Copy Maven: Add the following to your pom.xml file: <dependencies> <dependency> <groupId>com.newrelic.logging</groupId> <artifactId>log4j1</artifactId> <version>2.0</version> </dependency> </dependencies> Copy In your logging configuration XML file, update your <appender> element with a NewRelicLayout, adding <layout class=\"com.newrelic.logging.log4j1.NewRelicLayout\"/>: <appender name=\" TypicalFile \" class=\"org.apache.log4j.FileAppender\"> <param name=\"file\" value=\"logs/log4j1-app.log\"/> <param name=\"append\" value=\"false\"/> <layout class=\" com.newrelic.logging.log4j1.NewRelicLayout \"/> <!-- only this line needs to be added --> </appender> Copy Use NewRelicAsyncAppender to wrap any appenders that will target New Relic's log forwarder. For example: <appender name=\" NewRelicFile \" class=\"com.newrelic.logging.log4j1.NewRelicAsyncAppender\"> <appender-ref ref=\" TypicalFile \" /> </appender> Copy Use the async appender on the root logger. For example: <root> <appender-ref ref=\" NewRelicFile \" /> </root> Copy Example configuration file for the Log4j 1.x extension: <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\" ?> <!DOCTYPE log4j:configuration SYSTEM \"log4j.dtd\"> <log4j:configuration debug=\"false\"> <appender name=\"TypicalFile\" class=\"org.apache.log4j.FileAppender\"> <param name=\"file\" value=\"logs/log4j1-app.log\"/> <param name=\"append\" value=\"false\"/> <!-- layout has been replaced --> <layout class=\"com.newrelic.logging.log4j1.NewRelicLayout\"/> </appender> <!-- this appender was added --> <appender name=\"NewRelicFile\" class=\"com.newrelic.logging.log4j1.NewRelicAsyncAppender\"> <appender-ref ref=\"TypicalFile\" /> </appender> <appender name=\"TypicalConsole\" class=\"org.apache.log4j.ConsoleAppender\"> <layout class=\"org.apache.log4j.PatternLayout\"> <param name=\"ConversionPattern\" value=\"%-5p %c{1} - %m%n\"/> </layout> </appender> <root> ​ <!-- the new appender was used here -->​​ <appender-ref ref=\"NewRelicFile\" /> <appender-ref ref=\"TypicalConsole\" /> </root> </log4j:configuration> Copy Log4j 2.x We offer a Log4j 2.x extension for logs in context with the Java agent. To get started, review the code and an example application on GitHub. To configure logs in context for your Java app with with the Log4j 2.x extension: Make sure you have the Log4j 2.x or Logs4j 2 binding package installed and working on your application. Make sure you have the New Relic Java agent version 5.6.0 or higher installed on your application, and that you have enabled the JVM argument -javaagent. Update your project's dependencies to include the Log4j 2.x extension as applicable: Gradle: Add the highlighted section to your build.gradle file: dependencies { compile(\"com.newrelic.logging:log4j2:2.0\") } Copy Maven: Add the highlighted section to your pom.xml file: <dependencies> <dependency> <groupId>com.newrelic.logging</groupId> <artifactId>log4j2</artifactId> <version>2.0</version> </dependency> </dependencies> Copy In your logging configuration XML file, update your <configuration> element by adding the highlighted section: <Configuration xmlns=\"http://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.0/config\" packages=\"com.newrelic.logging.log4j2\" > Copy If you're using a properties file, add packages=com.newrelic.logging.log4j2. Add <NewRelicLayout/> to use a NewRelicLayout element within one of the appenders. For example: <File name=\"MyFile\" fileName=\"logs/app-log-file.log\"> <NewRelicLayout/> </File> Copy If you're using a properties file, only change the layout.type: appender.console.type = Console appender.console.name = STDOUT appender.console.layout.type = NewRelicLayout Copy If you only modified an existing appender, skip this step. If you added a new appender, add <AppenderRef/> within <Root> to use this appender. Use the ref attribute to refer to appender name you created in the previous step. For example: <Root level=\"info\"> <AppenderRef ref=\"MyFile\"/> </Root> Copy If you're using a properties file and added a new appender, add: rootLogger.level = info rootLogger.appenderRef.stdout.ref = STDOUT ​​​​​ Copy Logback version 1.2.0 or higher We offer a Logback extension for logs in context with the Java agent. To get started, review the code and an example application on GitHub. To configure logs in context for your Java app with Logback: Make sure you have Logback version 1.2.0 or higher and the New Relic Java agent version 5.6.0 or higher installed and working on your application. Make sure you have the New Relic Java agent version 5.6.0 or higher installed on your application, and that you have enabled the JVM argument -javaagent. Update your project's dependencies to include the Logback extension as applicable: Gradle: Add the highlighted section to your build.gradle file: dependencies { compile(\"com.newrelic.logging:logback:2.0\") } Copy Maven: Add the highlighted section to your pom.xml file: <dependencies> <dependency> <groupId>com.newrelic.logging</groupId> <artifactId>logback</artifactId> <version>2.0</version> </dependency> </dependencies> Copy Update your logging configuration xml to replace any existing <encoder> element. If you're logging to the console (stdout/stderr), look for ConsoleAppender and replace: <appender name=\"STDOUT\" class=\"ch.qos.logback.core.ConsoleAppender\"> <encoder class=\"com.newrelic.logging.logback.NewRelicEncoder\"/> </appender> Copy If you're logging to a file, look for FileAppender and replace <encoder>: <appender name=\"LOG_FILE\" class=\"ch.qos.logback.core.FileAppender\"> <file>logs/app-log-file.log</file> <encoder class=\"com.newrelic.logging.logback.NewRelicEncoder\"/> </appender> Copy Update your logging configuration xml with the NewRelicAsyncAppender. To ensure that NewRelicAsyncAppender wraps any appenders that will target New Relic's log forwarder, add the following section. Change \"LOG_FILE\" to the name of the appender you updated in the previous step. <appender name=\"ASYNC\" class=\"com.newrelic.logging.logback.NewRelicAsyncAppender\"> <appender-ref ref=\"LOG_FILE\" /> </appender> Copy Make sure NewRelicAsyncAppender is the first appender used in your logger. Replace your root logger’s appenders with the ASYNC appender created in the previous step. Then list any other appenders after the NewRelicAsyncAppender in the <root> list. <root> <appender-ref ref=\"ASYNC\" /> </root> Copy Here are examples of an updated logging .xml file for the Logback extension. You can also see a working example in GitHub. Single console appender example Example configuration file after adding in the logging extension information: <configuration> <appender name=\"STDOUT\" class=\"ch.qos.logback.core.ConsoleAppender\"> <!-- changed the encoder --> <encoder class=\"com.newrelic.logging.logback.NewRelicEncoder\"/> </appender> <!-- added the ASYNC appender --> <appender name=\"ASYNC\" class=\"com.newrelic.logging.logback.NewRelicAsyncAppender\"> <appender-ref ref=\"STDOUT\" /> </appender> <root level=\"debug\"> <!-- changed the root logger --> <appender-ref ref=\"ASYNC\" /> </root> </configuration> Copy Two console appenders example This example sends New Relic logging to a file, but still sends standard logging to the console: <configuration> <appender name=\"FILE\" class=\"ch.qos.logback.core.FileAppender\"> <file>myApp.log</file> <!-- encoder changed --> <encoder class=\"com.newrelic.logging.logback.NewRelicEncoder\"/> </appender> <!-- this appender does normal console logging --> <appender name=\"STDOUT\" class=\"ch.qos.logback.core.ConsoleAppender\"> <encoder> <pattern>%msg%n</pattern> </encoder> </appender> <!-- The required New Relic ASYNC appender wraps the FILE appender --> <appender name=\"ASYNC\" class=\"com.newrelic.logging.logback.NewRelicAsyncAppender\"> <appender-ref ref=\"FILE\" /> </appender> <root level=\"debug\"> <!-- ASYNC is one of the main appenders --> <appender-ref ref=\"ASYNC\" /> <!-- Send every message to normal console logging, as well. --> <appender-ref ref=\"STDOUT\" /> </root> </configuration> Copy Spring and Springboot We offer extensions for current versions of Spring and Spring Boot. If you already know the logging library, you can skip directly to that documentation: java.util.logging log4j 1 log4j 2 logback The extensions support default configurations only on Spring Boot 2.0 and higher. With Spring Boot: Here are tips to determine which logging library you have: If you have spring-boot-starter-log4j2 in your dependencies, you're using log4j 2.x. Refer to the Spring Boot log4j 2.x documentation for basic configuration, and the New Relic log4j 2 extension for customizing your configuration. If you're using Spring Boot but not the starter-log4j2, you're using logback by default. Refer to Spring Boot logback documentation for basic configuration, and the New Relic logback extension for customizing your configuration. With Spring (but not Spring Boot): Spring 5 or higher: Spring implements a bridge to other logging libraries that will automatically find them. However, those individual libraries must be configured and explicitly included in your project dependencies. To identify your logging dependency, consult your Gradle, Maven, or other build tool's dependency tree. Then follow the procedures to configure logs in context for your Java app with that extension. Spring 4 or lower: Spring version 4 and lower uses Apache Commons Logging for its bridge. Refer to the Spring documentation for information on configuring its bridge. View logs in UI To verify that you have configured the log appender correctly, run your application, then check your logs data in New Relic One using the query operator has:span.id has:trace.id. If everything is configured correctly and your data is being forwarded to New Relic with the enriched metadata, your logs should now be emitted as JSON and contain trace.id and span.id fields. If you don't see log data in the UI, follow the troubleshooting procedures. What's next?

Bringing all of this data together in a single tool helps you quickly get to the root cause of an issue and find the log lines that you need to identify and resolve a problem. Set up your .NET app To enable logs in context for APM apps monitored by .NET: Make sure you have already set up logging in New Relic. This includes configuring a supported log forwarder that collects your application logs and extends the metadata that is forwarded to New Relic. Install or update to the latest .NET agent version, and enable distributed tracing. Use .NET agent version 8.21 or higher and the New Relic .NET agent API version 8.21 or higher for logs in context. Install or update to Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5 or higher or .NET Core 2.0 or higher. Install and configure any of the following logging extensions to enrich your log data. Configure log4net extension You can use the Apache log4net version 2.0.8 or higher extension to link your log data with related data across the rest of the New Relic platform. log4net workflow diagram The following diagram illustrates the flow of log messages through Apache log4net, highlighting specific components of the New Relic log4net extension. Many log forwarders are available. This example uses Fluentd. Appender: The NewRelicAppender adds contextual information from the .NET agent (using the API) to the log events generated by the application. This contextual information, known as linking metadata, is used by New Relic to link log messages to the transactions and spans from which they were created. This appender will pass the enriched log events to downstream appenders for further processing. Since the NewRelicAppender is ForwardingAppender type, it needs to be the first appender in the chain. It also requires another appender that can write to an actual output destination as its child in order to work. Layout: The NewRelicLayout formats the enriched log events into the JSON format expected by New Relic. The appender, which this layout is assigned to, instructs log4net to output the JSON to a file in the location that the log forwarder expects. Log Forwarder: The log forwarder monitors an output folder and incrementally sends New Relic formatted log information to the New Relic logging endpoint. log4net 2.0.8 or higher configuration Log4net uses appender and layout to store and format log messages. NewRelicAppender enriches log messages with contextual information from the New Relic .NET agent if it is attached to your application. The appender passes enriched log messages to downstream appenders to handle specific use cases for log messages. For more information about logging with log4net, see the Apache log4net Getting started documentation. To configure logs in context with the log4net extension: Using the Visual Studio NuGet Package Manager, locate and install the NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Log4Net package. In your log4net configuration file, update your logging configuration to use the NewRelicAppender as the first level appender, and reference your existing appenders as its children. Also replace the layout of the appender that writes log messages to an output destination with the NewRelicLayout. The following log4net configuration example enriches log events with New Relic linking metadata. In addition to the existing log files, it outputs new log files in a specific JSON format at C:\\logs\\log4netExample.log.json for consumption by the log forwarder: <log4net> <root> <level value=\"ALL\" /> <appender-ref ref=\"NewRelicAppender\" /> </root> <appender name=\"NewRelicAppender\" type=\"NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Log4Net.NewRelicAppender, NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Log4Net\" > <threshold value=\"ALL\"/> <appender-ref ref=\"FileAppender\" /> </appender> <appender name=\"FileAppender\" type=\"log4net.Appender.FileAppender\"> <file value=\"C:\\logs\\log4netExample.log.json\" /> <param name=\"AppendToFile\" value=\"true\" /> <layout type=\"NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Log4Net.NewRelicLayout, NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Log4Net\"> </layout> </appender> </log4net> Copy After you configure the log4net extension and update your logging file, you can configure your extension to send data to New Relic. Here is an example configuration using the Fluentd plugin for New Relic Logs: <!--NewRelicLoggingExample.conf--> <source> @type tail path C:\\logs\\log4netExample.log.json pos_file C:\\logs\\log4netExample.log.json.pos tag logfile.* <parse> @type json </parse> </source> <match **> @type newrelic license_key <YOUR NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY> base_uri https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 </match> Copy Configure NLog extension You can use our NLog 4.5 or higher extension to link to your log data with related data across the rest of the New Relic platform. Nlog workflow diagram The New Relic NLog extension provides a NewRelicJsonLayout that formats a log event in the way required by the New Relic logging endpoint. Next, it adds contextual information from the .NET agent when attached to your application. Then, a target can be configured to write logging data to an output folder. The log forwarder can monitor this folder and incrementally send log information to New Relic. The following diagram illustrates the flow of log messages through NLog, highlighting specific components of the New Relic NLog extension. New Relic JSON Layout: The NewRelicJsonLayout adds contextual information from the .NET agent (using the API) to the log events generated by the application, and outputs log messages in the JSON format expected by New Relic. This contextual information, known as linking metadata, is used by New Relic to link log messages to the transactions and spans where they were created. Since the NewRelicAppender is ForwardingAppender type, it needs to be the first appender in the chain. It also requires another appender that can write to an actual output destination as its child in order to work. File Target: A FileTarget defines a file on disk where log messages are written. Adding the NewRelicJsonLayout to that target allows the output to be formatted correctly for forwarding to New Relic. Log Forwarder: The log forwarder is configured to send the log data from the FileTarget output to New Relic. The example below uses the New Relic Fluentd log forwarder, however there are many other log forwarders that can be used. For more information about logging with NLog, see the nlog-project.org documentation. Nlog 4.5 or higher configuration Use our NLog 4.5 or higher extension to link to your log data with related data across the rest of the New Relic platform. Using the Visual Studio NuGet Package Manager, locate and install the NewRelic.LogEnrichers.NLog package. In your application code, update your logging configuration to add the NewRelicJsonLayout and decide if you want to collect MappedDiagnosticsContext (MDC) or the MappedDiagnosticsLogicalContext (MDLC) data. The following configuration examples result in new JSON files that are written to disk. Some of these configuration options may be useful for managing the amount of disk space used and/or the performance of the target. archiveAboveSize maxArchiveFiles bufferSize enableArchiveFileCompression autoFlush concurrentWrites Although the NLog AsyncWrapper Target is not required, it may help improve performance by performing formatting and output of log files on a different thread. Don't collect MDC or the MDLC data (default): The following code example enriches log events with New Relic linking metadata, but not with MDC or the MDLC data. In addition to the existing log files, it outputs new log files in a specific JSON format at C:\\logs\\NLogExample.log.json for consumption by the log forwarder: var loggerConfig = new LoggingConfiguration(); var newRelicFileTarget = new FileTarget(\"NewRelicFileTarget\"); newRelicFileTarget.Layout = new NewRelicJsonLayout(); newRelicFileTarget.FileName = \"C:\\logs\\NLogExample.json\"; loggerConfig.AddTarget(newRelicFileTarget); loggerConfig.AddRuleForAllLevels(\"NewRelicFileTarget\"); LogManager.Configuration = loggerConfig; var logger = LogManager.GetLogger(\"Example\"); Copy Collect MDC or the MDLC data: If your application uses the MDC or the MDLC, you can configure the NewRelicJsonLayout to include items in those collections. The following code example adds the additional configuration to enable collecting MDC and MDLC data. As in the previous example, it outputs new log files in a specific JSON format at C:\\logs\\NLogExample.log.json for consumption by the log forwarder: var loggerConfig = new LoggingConfiguration(); var newRelicFileTarget = new FileTarget(\"NewRelicFileTarget\"); var newRelicLayout = new NewRelicJsonLayout { IncludeMdc = `true,` IncludeMdlc = `true` }; newRelicFileTarget.Layout = newRelicLayout; newRelicFileTarget.FileName = \"C:\\logs\\NLogExample.json\"; loggerConfig.AddTarget(newRelicFileTarget); loggerConfig.AddRuleForAllLevels(\"NewRelicFileTarget\"); LogManager.Configuration = loggerConfig; var logger = LogManager.GetLogger(\"Example\"); Copy Once you have configured the NLog extension and updated your logging file, you can configure your extension to send data to New Relic. Here is an example configuration using the Fluentd plugin to forward logs to New Relic: <!--NewRelicLoggingExample.conf--> <source> @type tail path C:\\logs\\NLogExample.log.json pos_file C:\\logs\\NLogExample.log.json.pos tag logfile.* <parse> @type json </parse> </source> <match **> @type newrelic license_key <YOUR NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY> base_uri https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 </match> Copy Nlog file-based configuration You can also configure the New Relic NLog extension with file-based configuration providers. The folowing example code creates a logger based on settings contained in an App.config file. Instantiating Logger using .config file var logger = LogManager.GetLogger(\"NewRelicLog\"); logger.Info(\"Hello, New Relic!\"); Copy Sample App.config file <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\" ?> <configuration> <configSections> <section name=\"nlog\" type=\"NLog.Config.ConfigSectionHandler, NLog\"/> </configSections> <startup> <supportedRuntime version=\"v4.0\" sku=\".NETFramework,Version=v4.5\" /> </startup> <nlog xmlns=\"http://www.nlog-project.org/schemas/NLog.xsd\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"> <extensions> <add assembly=\"NewRelic.LogEnrichers.NLog\" /> </extensions> <targets> <target name=\"NewRelicLogFile\" xsi:type=\"File\" fileName=\"C:/path/to/NewRelicLog.json\"> <layout xsi:type=\"newrelic-jsonlayout\"> </layout> </target> </targets> <rules> <logger name=\"NewRelicLog\" minlevel=\"Info\" writeTo=\"newRelicLogFile\" /> </rules> </nlog> </configuration> Copy Configure Serilog 2.5 or higher extension You can use our Serilog extension to link to your log data with related data across the rest of the New Relic platform. This requires: Serilog 2.5 or higher Serilog File Sinks v4.0 or higher Serilog workflow diagram Serilog is a structured logging framework that records log messages from your application and creates a LogEvent to store the message data. Using Enrichers, you can add additional information to the log events. Sinks and Formatters allow you to format and output those log events for downstream consumption and viewing. The following diagram illustrates the flow of log messages through Serilog, highlighting specific components of the New Relic Serilog extension. Many log forwarders are available. This example uses Fluentd. New Relic Enricher: The NewRelicEnricher adds contextual information from the .NET agent (using the API) to the log events generated by the application. This contextual information, called linking metadata, is used by New Relic to link log messages to the transactions and spans where they were created. New Relic Formatter: The NewRelicFormattertranslates enriched log events into the JSON format expected by New Relic. A sink instructs Serilog to output the JSON to a file in the location that the log forwarder expects. New Relic Log Forwarder: The NewRelicFormatter translates enriched log events into the JSON format expected by New Relic. A sink instructs Serilog to output the JSON to a file in the location that the log forwarder expects. For more information about Serilog log events, see the Serilog documentation on GitHub. Serilog 2.5 or higher configuration To configure logs in context with the Serilog extension: Use the Visual Studio NuGet Package Manager to locate and install the NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Serilog package. In your application code, update your logging configuration to add the NewRelicEnricher and NewRelicFormatter. The following code example enriches log events with New Relic linking metadata. In addition to the existing log files, it outputs new log files in a specific JSON format at C:\\logs\\SerilogExample.log.json for consumption by the log forwarder: var loggerConfig = new LoggerConfiguration() loggerConfig .Enrich.WithThreadName() .Enrich.WithThreadId() .Enrich.WithNewRelicLogsInContext() .WriteTo.File( path: @\"C:\\logs\\ExistingLoggingOutput.txt\") .WriteTo.File( formatter: new NewRelicFormatter(), path: @\"C:\\logs\\SerilogExample.log.json\"); var log = loggerConfig.CreateLogger(); Copy This configuration results in new JSON files that are written to disk. Some of these configuration options may be useful for managing the amount of disk space used and/or the performance of the sink. restrictedToMinimumLevel buffered rollingInterval rollOnFileSizeLimit retainedFileCountLimit Although not required, using the Serilog Asynchronous Sink Wrapper may help improve the performance by performing formatting and output of log files on a different thread. Once you have configured the Serilog extension and updated your logging file, you can configure your extension to send data to New Relic. Here is an example configuration using the Fluentd plugin to forward logs to New Relic: <!--NewRelicLoggingExample.conf--> <source> @type tail path C:\\logs\\SerilogExample.log.json pos_file C:\\logs\\SerilogExample.log.json.pos tag logfile.* <parse> @type json </parse> </source> <match **> @type newrelic license_key <YOUR NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY> base_uri https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 </match> Copy Serilog file-based configuration You can also configure the New Relic Serilog extension with file-based configuration providers.The following additional NuGet Packages are required: Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration/) Serilog.Settings.Configuration The following example code creates a logger based on settings contained in an appSettings.json file. Instantiating logger using appsettings.json var builder = new ConfigurationBuilder() .AddJsonFile(\"appsettings.json\"); var configuration = builder.Build(); var logger = new LoggerConfiguration() .ReadFrom.Configuration(configuration) .CreateLogger(); Copy Sample appsettings.json file { \"Serilog\": { \"Using\": [ \"Serilog.Sinks.Console\", \"Serilog.Sinks.File\", \"NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Serilog\" ], \"MinimumLevel\": \"Debug\", \"Enrich\": [ \"WithNewRelicLogsInContext\" ], \"WriteTo\": [ { \"Name\": \"File\", \"Args\": { \"path\": \"C:\\\\Logs\\\\SerilogExample.log.json\", \"formatter\": \"NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Serilog.NewRelicFormatter, NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Serilog\" } } ], \"Properties\": { \"Application\": \"NewRelic Logging Serilog Example\" } } } Copy The following example code creates a logger based on settings contained in a web.config file. The Serilog.Settings.AppSettings NuGet Package is required. Instantiating logger using .config file var logger = new LoggerConfiguration() .ReadFrom.AppSettings() .CreateLogger(); Copy Sample web.config file <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?> <configuration> <appSettings> <add key=\"serilog:using:NewRelic\" value=\"NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Serilog\" /> <add key=\"serilog:using:File\" value=\"Serilog.Sinks.File\" /> <!--Add other enrichers here--> <add key=\"serilog:enrich:WithNewRelicLogsInContext\" /> <add key=\"serilog:write-to:File.path\" value=\"C:\\logs\\SerilogExample.log.json\" /> <add key=\"serilog:write-to:File.formatter\" value=\"NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Serilog.NewRelicFormatter, NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Serilog\" /> </appSettings> Copy View logs in the UI To verify that you have configured the log appender correctly, run your application, then check your logs data in New Relic One using the query operator has:span.id has:trace.id.

Configure logs in context for Java to enrich your log data, using any of the following extensions as applicable. If you use Spring or Spring Boot and aren't sure which extension you need, see our Spring documentation. Dropwizard 1.3 or higher We offer a Dropwizard extension for logs in context with the Java agent. To get started, review the code and an example application on GitHub. To configure logs in context for your Java app with the DropWizard extension: Make sure you have the Dropwizard 1.3 or higher package installed and working on your application. Use the original Dropwizard appenders and logging factory installed and working on the application. Make sure you have the New Relic Java agent version 5.6.0 or higher installed on your application, and that you have enabled the JVM argument -javaagent. Update your project's dependencies to include the Dropwizard 1.3 extension as applicable: Gradle: Add the following to your build.gradle file: dependencies { compile(\"com.newrelic.logging:dropwizard:2.0\") } Copy Maven: Add the following to your pom.xml file: <dependencies> <dependency> <groupId>com.newrelic.logging</groupId> <artifactId>dropwizard</artifactId> <version>2.0</version> </dependency> </dependencies> Copy Update your Dropwizard .yaml configuration file with a newrelic-json layout, replacing the currently used type: console or type: file with either type: newrelic-console or type: newrelic-file as appropriate. For example: logging: appenders: - type: newrelic-console # Add the two lines below if you don't have a layout specified on the appender. # If you have a layout, remove all parameters to the layout and set the type. layout: type: newrelic-json Copy The New Relic Dropwizard extension also supports a log-format layout type that uses the standard Dropwizard logging. For testing purposes, you can change the type of the layout with a one-line change: logging: appenders: - type: newrelic-file # This format will be ignored by the newrelic-json layout, but used by the log-format layout. logFormat: \"%date{ISO8601} %c %-5p: %m trace.id=%mdc{trace.id} span.id=%mdc{span.id}%n\" layout: # type: newrelic-json type: log-format Copy java.util.logging We offer a java.util.logging extension for logs in context with the Java agent. To get started, review the code and an example application on GitHub. To configure logs in context for your Java app with with the java.util.logging extension: Make sure you have the java.util.logging package installed and working on the application. Make sure you have the New Relic Java agent version 5.6.0 or higher installed on your application, and that you have enabled the JVM argument -javaagent. Update your project's dependencies to include the java.util.logging extension as applicable. If you can't edit these files, you can instead add the jars directly to the application classpath. Gradle: Add the following to your build.gradle file: dependencies { compile(\"com.newrelic.logging:jul:2.0\") } Copy Maven: Add the following to your pom.xml file: <dependencies> <dependency> <groupId>com.newrelic.logging</groupId> <artifactId>jul</artifactId> <version>2.0</version> </dependency> </dependencies> Copy Check if your logging file's handlers property is set to something other than NewRelicMemoryHandler. Look for a line listing the root logger's handlers, like this: handlers = java.util.logging.FileHandler Copy Update your logging properties file to set the root logger's handler to NewRelicMemoryHandler so it intercepts messages destined for another handler: handlers = com.newrelic.logging.jul.NewRelicMemoryHandler Copy Configure the NewRelicMemoryHandler by setting the target to the handler that was previously assigned to the root logger, so it captures data New Relic needs on the thread the log message is coming from: com.newrelic.logging.jul.NewRelicMemoryHandler.target = java.util.logging.FileHandler Copy Use a NewRelicFormatter for the final handler. Update your logging properties file to set the formatter property like the following example. Make sure the handler where you set the formatter is the target handler from the previous step (java.util.logging.FileHandler in this example). java.util.logging.FileHandler.formatter = com.newrelic.logging.jul. NewRelicFormatter Copy The New Relic log format is JSON with telemetry metadata we use to correlate transactions and logs together. Currently we do not support any customization of that format. Once complete, JSON is logged instead of text. The JSON should be formatted as single objects, one per line, and should contain fields like log.level and thread.name. The trace.id, which is required for logs in context, should only have a value for log messages that occur within a transaction. java.util.logging classpath additions The most direct way to get the logs-in-context extensions is to add these dependencies to Maven's pom.xml or Gradle's build.gradle. This allows the packaging tools to pick up the correct dependencies. If you can't edit these files, you can instead add the jars directly to the application classpath for your logging framework's configuration. Before you modify the classpath: Enable the JVM argument -javaagent on your app's Java agent. Verify which logging framework the application is using. Make sure you are able to change your logging framework's configuration. Add the following three jars to the classpath if they aren't already present. Generally, we recommend taking the latest versions published on Maven Central. Group ID com.newrelic.logging and Artifact ID: Select the artifact named after your application's logging framework in Maven. Group ID com.fasterxml.jackson.core and Artifact ID: Use jackson-core. Group ID com.newrelic.agent.java and Artifact ID: Use newrelic-api. Log4j 1.x We offer a Log4j 1.x extension extension for logs in context with the Java agent. To get started, review the code and an example application on GitHub. To configure logs in context for your Java app with with the Log4j 1.x extension, you must configure the Log4j extension in code or via XML. Properties files are not supported because AsyncAppender instances can only be automatically configured via XML. Make sure you have the Log4j 1.x package installed and working on the application. Make sure you have the New Relic Java agent version 5.6.0 or higher installed on your application, and that you have enabled the JVM argument -javaagent. Update your project's dependencies to include the Log4j 1.x extension as applicable. Gradle: Add the following to your build.gradle file: dependencies { compile(\"com.newrelic.logging:log4j1:2.0\") } Copy Maven: Add the following to your pom.xml file: <dependencies> <dependency> <groupId>com.newrelic.logging</groupId> <artifactId>log4j1</artifactId> <version>2.0</version> </dependency> </dependencies> Copy In your logging configuration XML file, update your <appender> element with a NewRelicLayout, adding <layout class=\"com.newrelic.logging.log4j1.NewRelicLayout\"/>: <appender name=\" TypicalFile \" class=\"org.apache.log4j.FileAppender\"> <param name=\"file\" value=\"logs/log4j1-app.log\"/> <param name=\"append\" value=\"false\"/> <layout class=\" com.newrelic.logging.log4j1.NewRelicLayout \"/> <!-- only this line needs to be added --> </appender> Copy Use NewRelicAsyncAppender to wrap any appenders that will target New Relic's log forwarder. For example: <appender name=\" NewRelicFile \" class=\"com.newrelic.logging.log4j1.NewRelicAsyncAppender\"> <appender-ref ref=\" TypicalFile \" /> </appender> Copy Use the async appender on the root logger. For example: <root> <appender-ref ref=\" NewRelicFile \" /> </root> Copy Example configuration file for the Log4j 1.x extension: <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\" ?> <!DOCTYPE log4j:configuration SYSTEM \"log4j.dtd\"> <log4j:configuration debug=\"false\"> <appender name=\"TypicalFile\" class=\"org.apache.log4j.FileAppender\"> <param name=\"file\" value=\"logs/log4j1-app.log\"/> <param name=\"append\" value=\"false\"/> <!-- layout has been replaced --> <layout class=\"com.newrelic.logging.log4j1.NewRelicLayout\"/> </appender> <!-- this appender was added --> <appender name=\"NewRelicFile\" class=\"com.newrelic.logging.log4j1.NewRelicAsyncAppender\"> <appender-ref ref=\"TypicalFile\" /> </appender> <appender name=\"TypicalConsole\" class=\"org.apache.log4j.ConsoleAppender\"> <layout class=\"org.apache.log4j.PatternLayout\"> <param name=\"ConversionPattern\" value=\"%-5p %c{1} - %m%n\"/> </layout> </appender> <root> ​ <!-- the new appender was used here -->​​ <appender-ref ref=\"NewRelicFile\" /> <appender-ref ref=\"TypicalConsole\" /> </root> </log4j:configuration> Copy Log4j 2.x We offer a Log4j 2.x extension for logs in context with the Java agent. To get started, review the code and an example application on GitHub. To configure logs in context for your Java app with with the Log4j 2.x extension: Make sure you have the Log4j 2.x or Logs4j 2 binding package installed and working on your application. Make sure you have the New Relic Java agent version 5.6.0 or higher installed on your application, and that you have enabled the JVM argument -javaagent. Update your project's dependencies to include the Log4j 2.x extension as applicable: Gradle: Add the highlighted section to your build.gradle file: dependencies { compile(\"com.newrelic.logging:log4j2:2.0\") } Copy Maven: Add the highlighted section to your pom.xml file: <dependencies> <dependency> <groupId>com.newrelic.logging</groupId> <artifactId>log4j2</artifactId> <version>2.0</version> </dependency> </dependencies> Copy In your logging configuration XML file, update your <configuration> element by adding the highlighted section: <Configuration xmlns=\"http://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.0/config\" packages=\"com.newrelic.logging.log4j2\" > Copy If you're using a properties file, add packages=com.newrelic.logging.log4j2. Add <NewRelicLayout/> to use a NewRelicLayout element within one of the appenders. For example: <File name=\"MyFile\" fileName=\"logs/app-log-file.log\"> <NewRelicLayout/> </File> Copy If you're using a properties file, only change the layout.type: appender.console.type = Console appender.console.name = STDOUT appender.console.layout.type = NewRelicLayout Copy If you only modified an existing appender, skip this step. If you added a new appender, add <AppenderRef/> within <Root> to use this appender. Use the ref attribute to refer to appender name you created in the previous step. For example: <Root level=\"info\"> <AppenderRef ref=\"MyFile\"/> </Root> Copy If you're using a properties file and added a new appender, add: rootLogger.level = info rootLogger.appenderRef.stdout.ref = STDOUT ​​​​​ Copy Logback version 1.2.0 or higher We offer a Logback extension for logs in context with the Java agent. To get started, review the code and an example application on GitHub. To configure logs in context for your Java app with Logback: Make sure you have Logback version 1.2.0 or higher and the New Relic Java agent version 5.6.0 or higher installed and working on your application. Make sure you have the New Relic Java agent version 5.6.0 or higher installed on your application, and that you have enabled the JVM argument -javaagent. Update your project's dependencies to include the Logback extension as applicable: Gradle: Add the highlighted section to your build.gradle file: dependencies { compile(\"com.newrelic.logging:logback:2.0\") } Copy Maven: Add the highlighted section to your pom.xml file: <dependencies> <dependency> <groupId>com.newrelic.logging</groupId> <artifactId>logback</artifactId> <version>2.0</version> </dependency> </dependencies> Copy Update your logging configuration xml to replace any existing <encoder> element. If you're logging to the console (stdout/stderr), look for ConsoleAppender and replace: <appender name=\"STDOUT\" class=\"ch.qos.logback.core.ConsoleAppender\"> <encoder class=\"com.newrelic.logging.logback.NewRelicEncoder\"/> </appender> Copy If you're logging to a file, look for FileAppender and replace <encoder>: <appender name=\"LOG_FILE\" class=\"ch.qos.logback.core.FileAppender\"> <file>logs/app-log-file.log</file> <encoder class=\"com.newrelic.logging.logback.NewRelicEncoder\"/> </appender> Copy Update your logging configuration xml with the NewRelicAsyncAppender. To ensure that NewRelicAsyncAppender wraps any appenders that will target New Relic's log forwarder, add the following section. Change \"LOG_FILE\" to the name of the appender you updated in the previous step. <appender name=\"ASYNC\" class=\"com.newrelic.logging.logback.NewRelicAsyncAppender\"> <appender-ref ref=\"LOG_FILE\" /> </appender> Copy Make sure NewRelicAsyncAppender is the first appender used in your logger. Replace your root logger’s appenders with the ASYNC appender created in the previous step. Then list any other appenders after the NewRelicAsyncAppender in the <root> list. <root> <appender-ref ref=\"ASYNC\" /> </root> Copy Here are examples of an updated logging .xml file for the Logback extension. You can also see a working example in GitHub. Single console appender example Example configuration file after adding in the logging extension information: <configuration> <appender name=\"STDOUT\" class=\"ch.qos.logback.core.ConsoleAppender\"> <!-- changed the encoder --> <encoder class=\"com.newrelic.logging.logback.NewRelicEncoder\"/> </appender> <!-- added the ASYNC appender --> <appender name=\"ASYNC\" class=\"com.newrelic.logging.logback.NewRelicAsyncAppender\"> <appender-ref ref=\"STDOUT\" /> </appender> <root level=\"debug\"> <!-- changed the root logger --> <appender-ref ref=\"ASYNC\" /> </root> </configuration> Copy Two console appenders example This example sends New Relic logging to a file, but still sends standard logging to the console: <configuration> <appender name=\"FILE\" class=\"ch.qos.logback.core.FileAppender\"> <file>myApp.log</file> <!-- encoder changed --> <encoder class=\"com.newrelic.logging.logback.NewRelicEncoder\"/> </appender> <!-- this appender does normal console logging --> <appender name=\"STDOUT\" class=\"ch.qos.logback.core.ConsoleAppender\"> <encoder> <pattern>%msg%n</pattern> </encoder> </appender> <!-- The required New Relic ASYNC appender wraps the FILE appender --> <appender name=\"ASYNC\" class=\"com.newrelic.logging.logback.NewRelicAsyncAppender\"> <appender-ref ref=\"FILE\" /> </appender> <root level=\"debug\"> <!-- ASYNC is one of the main appenders --> <appender-ref ref=\"ASYNC\" /> <!-- Send every message to normal console logging, as well. --> <appender-ref ref=\"STDOUT\" /> </root> </configuration> Copy Spring and Springboot We offer extensions for current versions of Spring and Spring Boot. If you already know the logging library, you can skip directly to that documentation: java.util.logging log4j 1 log4j 2 logback The extensions support default configurations only on Spring Boot 2.0 and higher. With Spring Boot: Here are tips to determine which logging library you have: If you have spring-boot-starter-log4j2 in your dependencies, you're using log4j 2.x. Refer to the Spring Boot log4j 2.x documentation for basic configuration, and the New Relic log4j 2 extension for customizing your configuration. If you're using Spring Boot but not the starter-log4j2, you're using logback by default. Refer to Spring Boot logback documentation for basic configuration, and the New Relic logback extension for customizing your configuration. With Spring (but not Spring Boot): Spring 5 or higher: Spring implements a bridge to other logging libraries that will automatically find them. However, those individual libraries must be configured and explicitly included in your project dependencies. To identify your logging dependency, consult your Gradle, Maven, or other build tool's dependency tree. Then follow the procedures to configure logs in context for your Java app with that extension. Spring 4 or lower: Spring version 4 and lower uses Apache Commons Logging for its bridge. Refer to the Spring documentation for information on configuring its bridge. View logs in UI To verify that you have configured the log appender correctly, run your application, then check your logs data in New Relic One using the query operator has:span.id has:trace.id. If everything is configured correctly and your data is being forwarded to New Relic with the enriched metadata, your logs should now be emitted as JSON and contain trace.id and span.id fields. If you don't see log data in the UI, follow the troubleshooting procedures. What's next? After you set up APM logs in context, make the most of your logging data: Explore the logging data across your platform with our Logs UI. See your logs in context of your app's performance in the APM UI. Troubleshoot errors with distributed tracing, stack traces, application logs, and more. Get deeper visibility into both your application and your platform performance data by forwarding your logs with our infrastructure monitoring agent. Review your infrastructure logs in the UI.

Bringing all of this data together in a single tool helps you quickly get to the root cause of an issue and find the log lines that you need to identify and resolve a problem. Set up your .NET app To enable logs in context for APM apps monitored by .NET: Make sure you have already set up logging in New Relic. This includes configuring a supported log forwarder that collects your application logs and extends the metadata that is forwarded to New Relic. Install or update to the latest .NET agent version, and enable distributed tracing. Use .NET agent version 8.21 or higher and the New Relic .NET agent API version 8.21 or higher for logs in context. Install or update to Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5 or higher or .NET Core 2.0 or higher. Install and configure any of the following logging extensions to enrich your log data. Configure log4net extension You can use the Apache log4net version 2.0.8 or higher extension to link your log data with related data across the rest of the New Relic platform. log4net workflow diagram The following diagram illustrates the flow of log messages through Apache log4net, highlighting specific components of the New Relic log4net extension. Many log forwarders are available. This example uses Fluentd. Appender: The NewRelicAppender adds contextual information from the .NET agent (using the API) to the log events generated by the application. This contextual information, known as linking metadata, is used by New Relic to link log messages to the transactions and spans from which they were created. This appender will pass the enriched log events to downstream appenders for further processing. Since the NewRelicAppender is ForwardingAppender type, it needs to be the first appender in the chain. It also requires another appender that can write to an actual output destination as its child in order to work. Layout: The NewRelicLayout formats the enriched log events into the JSON format expected by New Relic. The appender, which this layout is assigned to, instructs log4net to output the JSON to a file in the location that the log forwarder expects. Log Forwarder: The log forwarder monitors an output folder and incrementally sends New Relic formatted log information to the New Relic logging endpoint. log4net 2.0.8 or higher configuration Log4net uses appender and layout to store and format log messages. NewRelicAppender enriches log messages with contextual information from the New Relic .NET agent if it is attached to your application. The appender passes enriched log messages to downstream appenders to handle specific use cases for log messages. For more information about logging with log4net, see the Apache log4net Getting started documentation. To configure logs in context with the log4net extension: Using the Visual Studio NuGet Package Manager, locate and install the NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Log4Net package. In your log4net configuration file, update your logging configuration to use the NewRelicAppender as the first level appender, and reference your existing appenders as its children. Also replace the layout of the appender that writes log messages to an output destination with the NewRelicLayout. The following log4net configuration example enriches log events with New Relic linking metadata. In addition to the existing log files, it outputs new log files in a specific JSON format at C:\\logs\\log4netExample.log.json for consumption by the log forwarder: <log4net> <root> <level value=\"ALL\" /> <appender-ref ref=\"NewRelicAppender\" /> </root> <appender name=\"NewRelicAppender\" type=\"NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Log4Net.NewRelicAppender, NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Log4Net\" > <threshold value=\"ALL\"/> <appender-ref ref=\"FileAppender\" /> </appender> <appender name=\"FileAppender\" type=\"log4net.Appender.FileAppender\"> <file value=\"C:\\logs\\log4netExample.log.json\" /> <param name=\"AppendToFile\" value=\"true\" /> <layout type=\"NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Log4Net.NewRelicLayout, NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Log4Net\"> </layout> </appender> </log4net> Copy After you configure the log4net extension and update your logging file, you can configure your extension to send data to New Relic. Here is an example configuration using the Fluentd plugin for New Relic Logs: <!--NewRelicLoggingExample.conf--> <source> @type tail path C:\\logs\\log4netExample.log.json pos_file C:\\logs\\log4netExample.log.json.pos tag logfile.* <parse> @type json </parse> </source> <match **> @type newrelic license_key <YOUR NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY> base_uri https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 </match> Copy Configure NLog extension You can use our NLog 4.5 or higher extension to link to your log data with related data across the rest of the New Relic platform. Nlog workflow diagram The New Relic NLog extension provides a NewRelicJsonLayout that formats a log event in the way required by the New Relic logging endpoint. Next, it adds contextual information from the .NET agent when attached to your application. Then, a target can be configured to write logging data to an output folder. The log forwarder can monitor this folder and incrementally send log information to New Relic. The following diagram illustrates the flow of log messages through NLog, highlighting specific components of the New Relic NLog extension. New Relic JSON Layout: The NewRelicJsonLayout adds contextual information from the .NET agent (using the API) to the log events generated by the application, and outputs log messages in the JSON format expected by New Relic. This contextual information, known as linking metadata, is used by New Relic to link log messages to the transactions and spans where they were created. Since the NewRelicAppender is ForwardingAppender type, it needs to be the first appender in the chain. It also requires another appender that can write to an actual output destination as its child in order to work. File Target: A FileTarget defines a file on disk where log messages are written. Adding the NewRelicJsonLayout to that target allows the output to be formatted correctly for forwarding to New Relic. Log Forwarder: The log forwarder is configured to send the log data from the FileTarget output to New Relic. The example below uses the New Relic Fluentd log forwarder, however there are many other log forwarders that can be used. For more information about logging with NLog, see the nlog-project.org documentation. Nlog 4.5 or higher configuration Use our NLog 4.5 or higher extension to link to your log data with related data across the rest of the New Relic platform. Using the Visual Studio NuGet Package Manager, locate and install the NewRelic.LogEnrichers.NLog package. In your application code, update your logging configuration to add the NewRelicJsonLayout and decide if you want to collect MappedDiagnosticsContext (MDC) or the MappedDiagnosticsLogicalContext (MDLC) data. The following configuration examples result in new JSON files that are written to disk. Some of these configuration options may be useful for managing the amount of disk space used and/or the performance of the target. archiveAboveSize maxArchiveFiles bufferSize enableArchiveFileCompression autoFlush concurrentWrites Although the NLog AsyncWrapper Target is not required, it may help improve performance by performing formatting and output of log files on a different thread. Don't collect MDC or the MDLC data (default): The following code example enriches log events with New Relic linking metadata, but not with MDC or the MDLC data. In addition to the existing log files, it outputs new log files in a specific JSON format at C:\\logs\\NLogExample.log.json for consumption by the log forwarder: var loggerConfig = new LoggingConfiguration(); var newRelicFileTarget = new FileTarget(\"NewRelicFileTarget\"); newRelicFileTarget.Layout = new NewRelicJsonLayout(); newRelicFileTarget.FileName = \"C:\\logs\\NLogExample.json\"; loggerConfig.AddTarget(newRelicFileTarget); loggerConfig.AddRuleForAllLevels(\"NewRelicFileTarget\"); LogManager.Configuration = loggerConfig; var logger = LogManager.GetLogger(\"Example\"); Copy Collect MDC or the MDLC data: If your application uses the MDC or the MDLC, you can configure the NewRelicJsonLayout to include items in those collections. The following code example adds the additional configuration to enable collecting MDC and MDLC data. As in the previous example, it outputs new log files in a specific JSON format at C:\\logs\\NLogExample.log.json for consumption by the log forwarder: var loggerConfig = new LoggingConfiguration(); var newRelicFileTarget = new FileTarget(\"NewRelicFileTarget\"); var newRelicLayout = new NewRelicJsonLayout { IncludeMdc = `true,` IncludeMdlc = `true` }; newRelicFileTarget.Layout = newRelicLayout; newRelicFileTarget.FileName = \"C:\\logs\\NLogExample.json\"; loggerConfig.AddTarget(newRelicFileTarget); loggerConfig.AddRuleForAllLevels(\"NewRelicFileTarget\"); LogManager.Configuration = loggerConfig; var logger = LogManager.GetLogger(\"Example\"); Copy Once you have configured the NLog extension and updated your logging file, you can configure your extension to send data to New Relic. Here is an example configuration using the Fluentd plugin to forward logs to New Relic: <!--NewRelicLoggingExample.conf--> <source> @type tail path C:\\logs\\NLogExample.log.json pos_file C:\\logs\\NLogExample.log.json.pos tag logfile.* <parse> @type json </parse> </source> <match **> @type newrelic license_key <YOUR NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY> base_uri https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 </match> Copy Nlog file-based configuration You can also configure the New Relic NLog extension with file-based configuration providers. The folowing example code creates a logger based on settings contained in an App.config file. Instantiating Logger using .config file var logger = LogManager.GetLogger(\"NewRelicLog\"); logger.Info(\"Hello, New Relic!\"); Copy Sample App.config file <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\" ?> <configuration> <configSections> <section name=\"nlog\" type=\"NLog.Config.ConfigSectionHandler, NLog\"/> </configSections> <startup> <supportedRuntime version=\"v4.0\" sku=\".NETFramework,Version=v4.5\" /> </startup> <nlog xmlns=\"http://www.nlog-project.org/schemas/NLog.xsd\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"> <extensions> <add assembly=\"NewRelic.LogEnrichers.NLog\" /> </extensions> <targets> <target name=\"NewRelicLogFile\" xsi:type=\"File\" fileName=\"C:/path/to/NewRelicLog.json\"> <layout xsi:type=\"newrelic-jsonlayout\"> </layout> </target> </targets> <rules> <logger name=\"NewRelicLog\" minlevel=\"Info\" writeTo=\"newRelicLogFile\" /> </rules> </nlog> </configuration> Copy Configure Serilog 2.5 or higher extension You can use our Serilog extension to link to your log data with related data across the rest of the New Relic platform. This requires: Serilog 2.5 or higher Serilog File Sinks v4.0 or higher Serilog workflow diagram Serilog is a structured logging framework that records log messages from your application and creates a LogEvent to store the message data. Using Enrichers, you can add additional information to the log events. Sinks and Formatters allow you to format and output those log events for downstream consumption and viewing. The following diagram illustrates the flow of log messages through Serilog, highlighting specific components of the New Relic Serilog extension. Many log forwarders are available. This example uses Fluentd. New Relic Enricher: The NewRelicEnricher adds contextual information from the .NET agent (using the API) to the log events generated by the application. This contextual information, called linking metadata, is used by New Relic to link log messages to the transactions and spans where they were created. New Relic Formatter: The NewRelicFormattertranslates enriched log events into the JSON format expected by New Relic. A sink instructs Serilog to output the JSON to a file in the location that the log forwarder expects. New Relic Log Forwarder: The NewRelicFormatter translates enriched log events into the JSON format expected by New Relic. A sink instructs Serilog to output the JSON to a file in the location that the log forwarder expects. For more information about Serilog log events, see the Serilog documentation on GitHub. Serilog 2.5 or higher configuration To configure logs in context with the Serilog extension: Use the Visual Studio NuGet Package Manager to locate and install the NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Serilog package. In your application code, update your logging configuration to add the NewRelicEnricher and NewRelicFormatter. The following code example enriches log events with New Relic linking metadata. In addition to the existing log files, it outputs new log files in a specific JSON format at C:\\logs\\SerilogExample.log.json for consumption by the log forwarder: var loggerConfig = new LoggerConfiguration() loggerConfig .Enrich.WithThreadName() .Enrich.WithThreadId() .Enrich.WithNewRelicLogsInContext() .WriteTo.File( path: @\"C:\\logs\\ExistingLoggingOutput.txt\") .WriteTo.File( formatter: new NewRelicFormatter(), path: @\"C:\\logs\\SerilogExample.log.json\"); var log = loggerConfig.CreateLogger(); Copy This configuration results in new JSON files that are written to disk. Some of these configuration options may be useful for managing the amount of disk space used and/or the performance of the sink. restrictedToMinimumLevel buffered rollingInterval rollOnFileSizeLimit retainedFileCountLimit Although not required, using the Serilog Asynchronous Sink Wrapper may help improve the performance by performing formatting and output of log files on a different thread. Once you have configured the Serilog extension and updated your logging file, you can configure your extension to send data to New Relic. Here is an example configuration using the Fluentd plugin to forward logs to New Relic: <!--NewRelicLoggingExample.conf--> <source> @type tail path C:\\logs\\SerilogExample.log.json pos_file C:\\logs\\SerilogExample.log.json.pos tag logfile.* <parse> @type json </parse> </source> <match **> @type newrelic license_key <YOUR NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY> base_uri https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 </match> Copy Serilog file-based configuration You can also configure the New Relic Serilog extension with file-based configuration providers.The following additional NuGet Packages are required: Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration/) Serilog.Settings.Configuration The following example code creates a logger based on settings contained in an appSettings.json file. Instantiating logger using appsettings.json var builder = new ConfigurationBuilder() .AddJsonFile(\"appsettings.json\"); var configuration = builder.Build(); var logger = new LoggerConfiguration() .ReadFrom.Configuration(configuration) .CreateLogger(); Copy Sample appsettings.json file { \"Serilog\": { \"Using\": [ \"Serilog.Sinks.Console\", \"Serilog.Sinks.File\", \"NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Serilog\" ], \"MinimumLevel\": \"Debug\", \"Enrich\": [ \"WithNewRelicLogsInContext\" ], \"WriteTo\": [ { \"Name\": \"File\", \"Args\": { \"path\": \"C:\\\\Logs\\\\SerilogExample.log.json\", \"formatter\": \"NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Serilog.NewRelicFormatter, NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Serilog\" } } ], \"Properties\": { \"Application\": \"NewRelic Logging Serilog Example\" } } } Copy The following example code creates a logger based on settings contained in a web.config file. The Serilog.Settings.AppSettings NuGet Package is required. Instantiating logger using .config file var logger = new LoggerConfiguration() .ReadFrom.AppSettings() .CreateLogger(); Copy Sample web.config file <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?> <configuration> <appSettings> <add key=\"serilog:using:NewRelic\" value=\"NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Serilog\" /> <add key=\"serilog:using:File\" value=\"Serilog.Sinks.File\" /> <!--Add other enrichers here--> <add key=\"serilog:enrich:WithNewRelicLogsInContext\" /> <add key=\"serilog:write-to:File.path\" value=\"C:\\logs\\SerilogExample.log.json\" /> <add key=\"serilog:write-to:File.formatter\" value=\"NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Serilog.NewRelicFormatter, NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Serilog\" /> </appSettings> Copy View logs in the UI To verify that you have configured the log appender correctly, run your application, then check your logs data in New Relic One using the query operator has:span.id has:trace.id. If everything is configured correctly and your data is being forwarded to New Relic with the enriched metadata, your logs should now be emitted as JSON and contain trace.id and span.id fields.

      "body": "Logs in context for the Java agent connects your logs and APM data in New Relic. Bringing all of this data together in a single tool helps you quickly get to the root cause of an issue and find the log lines that you need to identify and resolve a problem. Set up your Java app To enable logs in context for APM apps monitored by Java: Make sure you have already set up logging in New Relic. This includes configuring a supported log forwarder that collects your application logs and extends the metadata that is forwarded to New Relic. Install or update to the latest Java agent version. Use Java agent version 5.6.0 or higher for logs in context. Enable the JVM argument -javaagent, and enable distributed tracing. Configure logs in context for Java to enrich your log data, using any of the following extensions as applicable. If you use Spring or Spring Boot and aren't sure which extension you need, see our Spring documentation. Dropwizard 1.3 or higher We offer a Dropwizard extension for logs in context with the Java agent. To get started, review the code and an example application on GitHub. To configure logs in context for your Java app with the DropWizard extension: Make sure you have the Dropwizard 1.3 or higher package installed and working on your application. Use the original Dropwizard appenders and logging factory installed and working on the application. Make sure you have the New Relic Java agent version 5.6.0 or higher installed on your application, and that you have enabled the JVM argument -javaagent. Update your project's dependencies to include the Dropwizard 1.3 extension as applicable: Gradle: Add the following to your build.gradle file: dependencies { compile(\"com.newrelic.logging:dropwizard:2.0\") } Copy Maven: Add the following to your pom.xml file: <dependencies> <dependency> <groupId>com.newrelic.logging</groupId> <artifactId>dropwizard</artifactId> <version>2.0</version> </dependency> </dependencies> Copy Update your Dropwizard .yaml configuration file with a newrelic-json layout, replacing the currently used type: console or type: file with either type: newrelic-console or type: newrelic-file as appropriate. For example: logging: appenders: - type: newrelic-console # Add the two lines below if you don't have a layout specified on the appender. # If you have a layout, remove all parameters to the layout and set the type. layout: type: newrelic-json Copy The New Relic Dropwizard extension also supports a log-format layout type that uses the standard Dropwizard logging. For testing purposes, you can change the type of the layout with a one-line change: logging: appenders: - type: newrelic-file # This format will be ignored by the newrelic-json layout, but used by the log-format layout. logFormat: \"%date{ISO8601} %c %-5p: %m trace.id=%mdc{trace.id} span.id=%mdc{span.id}%n\" layout: # type: newrelic-json type: log-format Copy java.util.logging We offer a java.util.logging extension for logs in context with the Java agent. To get started, review the code and an example application on GitHub. To configure logs in context for your Java app with with the java.util.logging extension: Make sure you have the java.util.logging package installed and working on the application. Make sure you have the New Relic Java agent version 5.6.0 or higher installed on your application, and that you have enabled the JVM argument -javaagent. Update your project's dependencies to include the java.util.logging extension as applicable. If you can't edit these files, you can instead add the jars directly to the application classpath. Gradle: Add the following to your build.gradle file: dependencies { compile(\"com.newrelic.logging:jul:2.0\") } Copy Maven: Add the following to your pom.xml file: <dependencies> <dependency> <groupId>com.newrelic.logging</groupId> <artifactId>jul</artifactId> <version>2.0</version> </dependency> </dependencies> Copy Check if your logging file's handlers property is set to something other than NewRelicMemoryHandler. Look for a line listing the root logger's handlers, like this: handlers = java.util.logging.FileHandler Copy Update your logging properties file to set the root logger's handler to NewRelicMemoryHandler so it intercepts messages destined for another handler: handlers = com.newrelic.logging.jul.NewRelicMemoryHandler Copy Configure the NewRelicMemoryHandler by setting the target to the handler that was previously assigned to the root logger, so it captures data New Relic needs on the thread the log message is coming from: com.newrelic.logging.jul.NewRelicMemoryHandler.target = java.util.logging.FileHandler Copy Use a NewRelicFormatter for the final handler. Update your logging properties file to set the formatter property like the following example. Make sure the handler where you set the formatter is the target handler from the previous step (java.util.logging.FileHandler in this example). java.util.logging.FileHandler.formatter = com.newrelic.logging.jul. NewRelicFormatter Copy The New Relic log format is JSON with telemetry metadata we use to correlate transactions and logs together. Currently we do not support any customization of that format. Once complete, JSON is logged instead of text. The JSON should be formatted as single objects, one per line, and should contain fields like log.level and thread.name. The trace.id, which is required for logs in context, should only have a value for log messages that occur within a transaction. java.util.logging classpath additions The most direct way to get the logs-in-context extensions is to add these dependencies to Maven's pom.xml or Gradle's build.gradle. This allows the packaging tools to pick up the correct dependencies. If you can't edit these files, you can instead add the jars directly to the application classpath for your logging framework's configuration. Before you modify the classpath: Enable the JVM argument -javaagent on your app's Java agent. Verify which logging framework the application is using. Make sure you are able to change your logging framework's configuration. Add the following three jars to the classpath if they aren't already present. Generally, we recommend taking the latest versions published on Maven Central. Group ID com.newrelic.logging and Artifact ID: Select the artifact named after your application's logging framework in Maven. Group ID com.fasterxml.jackson.core and Artifact ID: Use jackson-core. Group ID com.newrelic.agent.java and Artifact ID: Use newrelic-api. Log4j 1.x We offer a Log4j 1.x extension extension for logs in context with the Java agent. To get started, review the code and an example application on GitHub. To configure logs in context for your Java app with with the Log4j 1.x extension, you must configure the Log4j extension in code or via XML. Properties files are not supported because AsyncAppender instances can only be automatically configured via XML. Make sure you have the Log4j 1.x package installed and working on the application. Make sure you have the New Relic Java agent version 5.6.0 or higher installed on your application, and that you have enabled the JVM argument -javaagent. Update your project's dependencies to include the Log4j 1.x extension as applicable. Gradle: Add the following to your build.gradle file: dependencies { compile(\"com.newrelic.logging:log4j1:2.0\") } Copy Maven: Add the following to your pom.xml file: <dependencies> <dependency> <groupId>com.newrelic.logging</groupId> <artifactId>log4j1</artifactId> <version>2.0</version> </dependency> </dependencies> Copy In your logging configuration XML file, update your <appender> element with a NewRelicLayout, adding <layout class=\"com.newrelic.logging.log4j1.NewRelicLayout\"/>: <appender name=\" TypicalFile \" class=\"org.apache.log4j.FileAppender\"> <param name=\"file\" value=\"logs/log4j1-app.log\"/> <param name=\"append\" value=\"false\"/> <layout class=\" com.newrelic.logging.log4j1.NewRelicLayout \"/> <!-- only this line needs to be added --> </appender> Copy Use NewRelicAsyncAppender to wrap any appenders that will target New Relic's log forwarder. For example: <appender name=\" NewRelicFile \" class=\"com.newrelic.logging.log4j1.NewRelicAsyncAppender\"> <appender-ref ref=\" TypicalFile \" /> </appender> Copy Use the async appender on the root logger. For example: <root> <appender-ref ref=\" NewRelicFile \" /> </root> Copy Example configuration file for the Log4j 1.x extension: <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\" ?> <!DOCTYPE log4j:configuration SYSTEM \"log4j.dtd\"> <log4j:configuration debug=\"false\"> <appender name=\"TypicalFile\" class=\"org.apache.log4j.FileAppender\"> <param name=\"file\" value=\"logs/log4j1-app.log\"/> <param name=\"append\" value=\"false\"/> <!-- layout has been replaced --> <layout class=\"com.newrelic.logging.log4j1.NewRelicLayout\"/> </appender> <!-- this appender was added --> <appender name=\"NewRelicFile\" class=\"com.newrelic.logging.log4j1.NewRelicAsyncAppender\"> <appender-ref ref=\"TypicalFile\" /> </appender> <appender name=\"TypicalConsole\" class=\"org.apache.log4j.ConsoleAppender\"> <layout class=\"org.apache.log4j.PatternLayout\"> <param name=\"ConversionPattern\" value=\"%-5p %c{1} - %m%n\"/> </layout> </appender> <root> ​ <!-- the new appender was used here -->​​ <appender-ref ref=\"NewRelicFile\" /> <appender-ref ref=\"TypicalConsole\" /> </root> </log4j:configuration> Copy Log4j 2.x We offer a Log4j 2.x extension for logs in context with the Java agent. To get started, review the code and an example application on GitHub. To configure logs in context for your Java app with with the Log4j 2.x extension: Make sure you have the Log4j 2.x or Logs4j 2 binding package installed and working on your application. Make sure you have the New Relic Java agent version 5.6.0 or higher installed on your application, and that you have enabled the JVM argument -javaagent. Update your project's dependencies to include the Log4j 2.x extension as applicable: Gradle: Add the highlighted section to your build.gradle file: dependencies { compile(\"com.newrelic.logging:log4j2:2.0\") } Copy Maven: Add the highlighted section to your pom.xml file: <dependencies> <dependency> <groupId>com.newrelic.logging</groupId> <artifactId>log4j2</artifactId> <version>2.0</version> </dependency> </dependencies> Copy In your logging configuration XML file, update your <configuration> element by adding the highlighted section: <Configuration xmlns=\"http://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.0/config\" packages=\"com.newrelic.logging.log4j2\" > Copy If you're using a properties file, add packages=com.newrelic.logging.log4j2. Add <NewRelicLayout/> to use a NewRelicLayout element within one of the appenders. For example: <File name=\"MyFile\" fileName=\"logs/app-log-file.log\"> <NewRelicLayout/> </File> Copy If you're using a properties file, only change the layout.type: appender.console.type = Console appender.console.name = STDOUT appender.console.layout.type = NewRelicLayout Copy If you only modified an existing appender, skip this step. If you added a new appender, add <AppenderRef/> within <Root> to use this appender. Use the ref attribute to refer to appender name you created in the previous step. For example: <Root level=\"info\"> <AppenderRef ref=\"MyFile\"/> </Root> Copy If you're using a properties file and added a new appender, add: rootLogger.level = info rootLogger.appenderRef.stdout.ref = STDOUT ​​​​​ Copy Logback version 1.2.0 or higher We offer a Logback extension for logs in context with the Java agent. To get started, review the code and an example application on GitHub. To configure logs in context for your Java app with Logback: Make sure you have Logback version 1.2.0 or higher and the New Relic Java agent version 5.6.0 or higher installed and working on your application. Make sure you have the New Relic Java agent version 5.6.0 or higher installed on your application, and that you have enabled the JVM argument -javaagent. Update your project's dependencies to include the Logback extension as applicable: Gradle: Add the highlighted section to your build.gradle file: dependencies { compile(\"com.newrelic.logging:logback:2.0\") } Copy Maven: Add the highlighted section to your pom.xml file: <dependencies> <dependency> <groupId>com.newrelic.logging</groupId> <artifactId>logback</artifactId> <version>2.0</version> </dependency> </dependencies> Copy Update your logging configuration xml to replace any existing <encoder> element. If you're logging to the console (stdout/stderr), look for ConsoleAppender and replace: <appender name=\"STDOUT\" class=\"ch.qos.logback.core.ConsoleAppender\"> <encoder class=\"com.newrelic.logging.logback.NewRelicEncoder\"/> </appender> Copy If you're logging to a file, look for FileAppender and replace <encoder>: <appender name=\"LOG_FILE\" class=\"ch.qos.logback.core.FileAppender\"> <file>logs/app-log-file.log</file> <encoder class=\"com.newrelic.logging.logback.NewRelicEncoder\"/> </appender> Copy Update your logging configuration xml with the NewRelicAsyncAppender. To ensure that NewRelicAsyncAppender wraps any appenders that will target New Relic's log forwarder, add the following section. Change \"LOG_FILE\" to the name of the appender you updated in the previous step. <appender name=\"ASYNC\" class=\"com.newrelic.logging.logback.NewRelicAsyncAppender\"> <appender-ref ref=\"LOG_FILE\" /> </appender> Copy Make sure NewRelicAsyncAppender is the first appender used in your logger. Replace your root logger’s appenders with the ASYNC appender created in the previous step. Then list any other appenders after the NewRelicAsyncAppender in the <root> list. <root> <appender-ref ref=\"ASYNC\" /> </root> Copy Here are examples of an updated logging .xml file for the Logback extension. You can also see a working example in GitHub. Single console appender example Example configuration file after adding in the logging extension information: <configuration> <appender name=\"STDOUT\" class=\"ch.qos.logback.core.ConsoleAppender\"> <!-- changed the encoder --> <encoder class=\"com.newrelic.logging.logback.NewRelicEncoder\"/> </appender> <!-- added the ASYNC appender --> <appender name=\"ASYNC\" class=\"com.newrelic.logging.logback.NewRelicAsyncAppender\"> <appender-ref ref=\"STDOUT\" /> </appender> <root level=\"debug\"> <!-- changed the root logger --> <appender-ref ref=\"ASYNC\" /> </root> </configuration> Copy Two console appenders example This example sends New Relic logging to a file, but still sends standard logging to the console: <configuration> <appender name=\"FILE\" class=\"ch.qos.logback.core.FileAppender\"> <file>myApp.log</file> <!-- encoder changed --> <encoder class=\"com.newrelic.logging.logback.NewRelicEncoder\"/> </appender> <!-- this appender does normal console logging --> <appender name=\"STDOUT\" class=\"ch.qos.logback.core.ConsoleAppender\"> <encoder> <pattern>%msg%n</pattern> </encoder> </appender> <!-- The required New Relic ASYNC appender wraps the FILE appender --> <appender name=\"ASYNC\" class=\"com.newrelic.logging.logback.NewRelicAsyncAppender\"> <appender-ref ref=\"FILE\" /> </appender> <root level=\"debug\"> <!-- ASYNC is one of the main appenders --> <appender-ref ref=\"ASYNC\" /> <!-- Send every message to normal console logging, as well. --> <appender-ref ref=\"STDOUT\" /> </root> </configuration> Copy Spring and Springboot We offer extensions for current versions of Spring and Spring Boot. If you already know the logging library, you can skip directly to that documentation: java.util.logging log4j 1 log4j 2 logback The extensions support default configurations only on Spring Boot 2.0 and higher. With Spring Boot: Here are tips to determine which logging library you have: If you have spring-boot-starter-log4j2 in your dependencies, you're using log4j 2.x. Refer to the Spring Boot log4j 2.x documentation for basic configuration, and the New Relic log4j 2 extension for customizing your configuration. If you're using Spring Boot but not the starter-log4j2, you're using logback by default. Refer to Spring Boot logback documentation for basic configuration, and the New Relic logback extension for customizing your configuration. With Spring (but not Spring Boot): Spring 5 or higher: Spring implements a bridge to other logging libraries that will automatically find them. However, those individual libraries must be configured and explicitly included in your project dependencies. To identify your logging dependency, consult your Gradle, Maven, or other build tool's dependency tree. Then follow the procedures to configure logs in context for your Java app with that extension. Spring 4 or lower: Spring version 4 and lower uses Apache Commons Logging for its bridge. Refer to the Spring documentation for information on configuring its bridge. View logs in UI To verify that you have configured the log appender correctly, run your application, then check your logs data in New Relic One using the query operator has:span.id has:trace.id. If everything is configured correctly and your data is being forwarded to New Relic with the enriched metadata, your logs should now be emitted as JSON and contain trace.id and span.id fields.

Bringing all of this data together in a single tool helps you quickly get to the root cause of an issue and find the log lines that you need to identify and resolve a problem. Set up your .NET app To enable logs in context for APM apps monitored by .NET: Make sure you have already set up logging in New Relic. This includes configuring a supported log forwarder that collects your application logs and extends the metadata that is forwarded to New Relic. Install or update to the latest .NET agent version, and enable distributed tracing. Use .NET agent version 8.21 or higher and the New Relic .NET agent API version 8.21 or higher for logs in context. Install or update to Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5 or higher or .NET Core 2.0 or higher. Install and configure any of the following logging extensions to enrich your log data. Configure log4net extension You can use the Apache log4net version 2.0.8 or higher extension to link your log data with related data across the rest of the New Relic platform. log4net workflow diagram The following diagram illustrates the flow of log messages through Apache log4net, highlighting specific components of the New Relic log4net extension. Many log forwarders are available. This example uses Fluentd. Appender: The NewRelicAppender adds contextual information from the .NET agent (using the API) to the log events generated by the application. This contextual information, known as linking metadata, is used by New Relic to link log messages to the transactions and spans from which they were created. This appender will pass the enriched log events to downstream appenders for further processing. Since the NewRelicAppender is ForwardingAppender type, it needs to be the first appender in the chain. It also requires another appender that can write to an actual output destination as its child in order to work. Layout: The NewRelicLayout formats the enriched log events into the JSON format expected by New Relic. The appender, which this layout is assigned to, instructs log4net to output the JSON to a file in the location that the log forwarder expects. Log Forwarder: The log forwarder monitors an output folder and incrementally sends New Relic formatted log information to the New Relic logging endpoint. log4net 2.0.8 or higher configuration Log4net uses appender and layout to store and format log messages. NewRelicAppender enriches log messages with contextual information from the New Relic .NET agent if it is attached to your application. The appender passes enriched log messages to downstream appenders to handle specific use cases for log messages. For more information about logging with log4net, see the Apache log4net Getting started documentation. To configure logs in context with the log4net extension: Using the Visual Studio NuGet Package Manager, locate and install the NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Log4Net package. In your log4net configuration file, update your logging configuration to use the NewRelicAppender as the first level appender, and reference your existing appenders as its children. Also replace the layout of the appender that writes log messages to an output destination with the NewRelicLayout. The following log4net configuration example enriches log events with New Relic linking metadata. In addition to the existing log files, it outputs new log files in a specific JSON format at C:\\logs\\log4netExample.log.json for consumption by the log forwarder: <log4net> <root> <level value=\"ALL\" /> <appender-ref ref=\"NewRelicAppender\" /> </root> <appender name=\"NewRelicAppender\" type=\"NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Log4Net.NewRelicAppender, NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Log4Net\" > <threshold value=\"ALL\"/> <appender-ref ref=\"FileAppender\" /> </appender> <appender name=\"FileAppender\" type=\"log4net.Appender.FileAppender\"> <file value=\"C:\\logs\\log4netExample.log.json\" /> <param name=\"AppendToFile\" value=\"true\" /> <layout type=\"NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Log4Net.NewRelicLayout, NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Log4Net\"> </layout> </appender> </log4net> Copy After you configure the log4net extension and update your logging file, you can configure your extension to send data to New Relic. Here is an example configuration using the Fluentd plugin for New Relic Logs: <!--NewRelicLoggingExample.conf--> <source> @type tail path C:\\logs\\log4netExample.log.json pos_file C:\\logs\\log4netExample.log.json.pos tag logfile.* <parse> @type json </parse> </source> <match **> @type newrelic license_key <YOUR NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY> base_uri https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 </match> Copy Configure NLog extension You can use our NLog 4.5 or higher extension to link to your log data with related data across the rest of the New Relic platform. Nlog workflow diagram The New Relic NLog extension provides a NewRelicJsonLayout that formats a log event in the way required by the New Relic logging endpoint. Next, it adds contextual information from the .NET agent when attached to your application. Then, a target can be configured to write logging data to an output folder. The log forwarder can monitor this folder and incrementally send log information to New Relic. The following diagram illustrates the flow of log messages through NLog, highlighting specific components of the New Relic NLog extension. New Relic JSON Layout: The NewRelicJsonLayout adds contextual information from the .NET agent (using the API) to the log events generated by the application, and outputs log messages in the JSON format expected by New Relic. This contextual information, known as linking metadata, is used by New Relic to link log messages to the transactions and spans where they were created. Since the NewRelicAppender is ForwardingAppender type, it needs to be the first appender in the chain. It also requires another appender that can write to an actual output destination as its child in order to work. File Target: A FileTarget defines a file on disk where log messages are written. Adding the NewRelicJsonLayout to that target allows the output to be formatted correctly for forwarding to New Relic. Log Forwarder: The log forwarder is configured to send the log data from the FileTarget output to New Relic. The example below uses the New Relic Fluentd log forwarder, however there are many other log forwarders that can be used. For more information about logging with NLog, see the nlog-project.org documentation. Nlog 4.5 or higher configuration Use our NLog 4.5 or higher extension to link to your log data with related data across the rest of the New Relic platform. Using the Visual Studio NuGet Package Manager, locate and install the NewRelic.LogEnrichers.NLog package. In your application code, update your logging configuration to add the NewRelicJsonLayout and decide if you want to collect MappedDiagnosticsContext (MDC) or the MappedDiagnosticsLogicalContext (MDLC) data. The following configuration examples result in new JSON files that are written to disk. Some of these configuration options may be useful for managing the amount of disk space used and/or the performance of the target. archiveAboveSize maxArchiveFiles bufferSize enableArchiveFileCompression autoFlush concurrentWrites Although the NLog AsyncWrapper Target is not required, it may help improve performance by performing formatting and output of log files on a different thread. Don't collect MDC or the MDLC data (default): The following code example enriches log events with New Relic linking metadata, but not with MDC or the MDLC data. In addition to the existing log files, it outputs new log files in a specific JSON format at C:\\logs\\NLogExample.log.json for consumption by the log forwarder: var loggerConfig = new LoggingConfiguration(); var newRelicFileTarget = new FileTarget(\"NewRelicFileTarget\"); newRelicFileTarget.Layout = new NewRelicJsonLayout(); newRelicFileTarget.FileName = \"C:\\logs\\NLogExample.json\"; loggerConfig.AddTarget(newRelicFileTarget); loggerConfig.AddRuleForAllLevels(\"NewRelicFileTarget\"); LogManager.Configuration = loggerConfig; var logger = LogManager.GetLogger(\"Example\"); Copy Collect MDC or the MDLC data: If your application uses the MDC or the MDLC, you can configure the NewRelicJsonLayout to include items in those collections. The following code example adds the additional configuration to enable collecting MDC and MDLC data. As in the previous example, it outputs new log files in a specific JSON format at C:\\logs\\NLogExample.log.json for consumption by the log forwarder: var loggerConfig = new LoggingConfiguration(); var newRelicFileTarget = new FileTarget(\"NewRelicFileTarget\"); var newRelicLayout = new NewRelicJsonLayout { IncludeMdc = `true,` IncludeMdlc = `true` }; newRelicFileTarget.Layout = newRelicLayout; newRelicFileTarget.FileName = \"C:\\logs\\NLogExample.json\"; loggerConfig.AddTarget(newRelicFileTarget); loggerConfig.AddRuleForAllLevels(\"NewRelicFileTarget\"); LogManager.Configuration = loggerConfig; var logger = LogManager.GetLogger(\"Example\"); Copy Once you have configured the NLog extension and updated your logging file, you can configure your extension to send data to New Relic. Here is an example configuration using the Fluentd plugin to forward logs to New Relic: <!--NewRelicLoggingExample.conf--> <source> @type tail path C:\\logs\\NLogExample.log.json pos_file C:\\logs\\NLogExample.log.json.pos tag logfile.* <parse> @type json </parse> </source> <match **> @type newrelic license_key <YOUR NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY> base_uri https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 </match> Copy Nlog file-based configuration You can also configure the New Relic NLog extension with file-based configuration providers. The folowing example code creates a logger based on settings contained in an App.config file. Instantiating Logger using .config file var logger = LogManager.GetLogger(\"NewRelicLog\"); logger.Info(\"Hello, New Relic!\"); Copy Sample App.config file <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\" ?> <configuration> <configSections> <section name=\"nlog\" type=\"NLog.Config.ConfigSectionHandler, NLog\"/> </configSections> <startup> <supportedRuntime version=\"v4.0\" sku=\".NETFramework,Version=v4.5\" /> </startup> <nlog xmlns=\"http://www.nlog-project.org/schemas/NLog.xsd\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"> <extensions> <add assembly=\"NewRelic.LogEnrichers.NLog\" /> </extensions> <targets> <target name=\"NewRelicLogFile\" xsi:type=\"File\" fileName=\"C:/path/to/NewRelicLog.json\"> <layout xsi:type=\"newrelic-jsonlayout\"> </layout> </target> </targets> <rules> <logger name=\"NewRelicLog\" minlevel=\"Info\" writeTo=\"newRelicLogFile\" /> </rules> </nlog> </configuration> Copy Configure Serilog 2.5 or higher extension You can use our Serilog extension to link to your log data with related data across the rest of the New Relic platform. This requires: Serilog 2.5 or higher Serilog File Sinks v4.0 or higher Serilog workflow diagram Serilog is a structured logging framework that records log messages from your application and creates a LogEvent to store the message data. Using Enrichers, you can add additional information to the log events. Sinks and Formatters allow you to format and output those log events for downstream consumption and viewing. The following diagram illustrates the flow of log messages through Serilog, highlighting specific components of the New Relic Serilog extension. Many log forwarders are available. This example uses Fluentd. New Relic Enricher: The NewRelicEnricher adds contextual information from the .NET agent (using the API) to the log events generated by the application. This contextual information, called linking metadata, is used by New Relic to link log messages to the transactions and spans where they were created. New Relic Formatter: The NewRelicFormattertranslates enriched log events into the JSON format expected by New Relic. A sink instructs Serilog to output the JSON to a file in the location that the log forwarder expects. New Relic Log Forwarder: The NewRelicFormatter translates enriched log events into the JSON format expected by New Relic. A sink instructs Serilog to output the JSON to a file in the location that the log forwarder expects. For more information about Serilog log events, see the Serilog documentation on GitHub. Serilog 2.5 or higher configuration To configure logs in context with the Serilog extension: Use the Visual Studio NuGet Package Manager to locate and install the NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Serilog package. In your application code, update your logging configuration to add the NewRelicEnricher and NewRelicFormatter. The following code example enriches log events with New Relic linking metadata. In addition to the existing log files, it outputs new log files in a specific JSON format at C:\\logs\\SerilogExample.log.json for consumption by the log forwarder: var loggerConfig = new LoggerConfiguration() loggerConfig .Enrich.WithThreadName() .Enrich.WithThreadId() .Enrich.WithNewRelicLogsInContext() .WriteTo.File( path: @\"C:\\logs\\ExistingLoggingOutput.txt\") .WriteTo.File( formatter: new NewRelicFormatter(), path: @\"C:\\logs\\SerilogExample.log.json\"); var log = loggerConfig.CreateLogger(); Copy This configuration results in new JSON files that are written to disk. Some of these configuration options may be useful for managing the amount of disk space used and/or the performance of the sink. restrictedToMinimumLevel buffered rollingInterval rollOnFileSizeLimit retainedFileCountLimit Although not required, using the Serilog Asynchronous Sink Wrapper may help improve the performance by performing formatting and output of log files on a different thread. Once you have configured the Serilog extension and updated your logging file, you can configure your extension to send data to New Relic. Here is an example configuration using the Fluentd plugin to forward logs to New Relic: <!--NewRelicLoggingExample.conf--> <source> @type tail path C:\\logs\\SerilogExample.log.json pos_file C:\\logs\\SerilogExample.log.json.pos tag logfile.* <parse> @type json </parse> </source> <match **> @type newrelic license_key <YOUR NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY> base_uri https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 </match> Copy Serilog file-based configuration You can also configure the New Relic Serilog extension with file-based configuration providers.The following additional NuGet Packages are required: Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration/) Serilog.Settings.Configuration The following example code creates a logger based on settings contained in an appSettings.json file. Instantiating logger using appsettings.json var builder = new ConfigurationBuilder() .AddJsonFile(\"appsettings.json\"); var configuration = builder.Build(); var logger = new LoggerConfiguration() .ReadFrom.Configuration(configuration) .CreateLogger(); Copy Sample appsettings.json file { \"Serilog\": { \"Using\": [ \"Serilog.Sinks.Console\", \"Serilog.Sinks.File\", \"NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Serilog\" ], \"MinimumLevel\": \"Debug\", \"Enrich\": [ \"WithNewRelicLogsInContext\" ], \"WriteTo\": [ { \"Name\": \"File\", \"Args\": { \"path\": \"C:\\\\Logs\\\\SerilogExample.log.json\", \"formatter\": \"NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Serilog.NewRelicFormatter, NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Serilog\" } } ], \"Properties\": { \"Application\": \"NewRelic Logging Serilog Example\" } } } Copy The following example code creates a logger based on settings contained in a web.config file. The Serilog.Settings.AppSettings NuGet Package is required. Instantiating logger using .config file var logger = new LoggerConfiguration() .ReadFrom.AppSettings() .CreateLogger(); Copy Sample web.config file <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?> <configuration> <appSettings> <add key=\"serilog:using:NewRelic\" value=\"NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Serilog\" /> <add key=\"serilog:using:File\" value=\"Serilog.Sinks.File\" /> <!--Add other enrichers here--> <add key=\"serilog:enrich:WithNewRelicLogsInContext\" /> <add key=\"serilog:write-to:File.path\" value=\"C:\\logs\\SerilogExample.log.json\" /> <add key=\"serilog:write-to:File.formatter\" value=\"NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Serilog.NewRelicFormatter, NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Serilog\" /> </appSettings> Copy View logs in the UI To verify that you have configured the log appender correctly, run your application, then check your logs data in New Relic One using the query operator has:span.id has:trace.id.

For example: logging: appenders: - type: newrelic-console # Add the two lines below if you don't have a layout specified on the appender. # If you have a layout, remove all parameters to the layout and set the type. layout: type: newrelic-json Copy The New Relic Dropwizard extension also supports a log-format layout type that uses the standard Dropwizard logging. For testing purposes, you can change the type of the layout with a one-line change: logging: appenders: - type: newrelic-file # This format will be ignored by the newrelic-json layout, but used by the log-format layout. logFormat: \"%date{ISO8601} %c %-5p: %m trace.id=%mdc{trace.id} span.id=%mdc{span.id}%n\" layout: # type: newrelic-json type: log-format Copy java.util.logging We offer a java.util.logging extension for logs in context with the Java agent. To get started, review the code and an example application on GitHub. To configure logs in context for your Java app with with the java.util.logging extension: Make sure you have the java.util.logging package installed and working on the application. Make sure you have the New Relic Java agent version 5.6.0 or higher installed on your application, and that you have enabled the JVM argument -javaagent. Update your project's dependencies to include the java.util.logging extension as applicable. If you can't edit these files, you can instead add the jars directly to the application classpath. Gradle: Add the following to your build.gradle file: dependencies { compile(\"com.newrelic.logging:jul:2.0\") } Copy Maven: Add the following to your pom.xml file: <dependencies> <dependency> <groupId>com.newrelic.logging</groupId> <artifactId>jul</artifactId> <version>2.0</version> </dependency> </dependencies> Copy Check if your logging file's handlers property is set to something other than NewRelicMemoryHandler. Look for a line listing the root logger's handlers, like this: handlers = java.util.logging.FileHandler Copy Update your logging properties file to set the root logger's handler to NewRelicMemoryHandler so it intercepts messages destined for another handler: handlers = com.newrelic.logging.jul.NewRelicMemoryHandler Copy Configure the NewRelicMemoryHandler by setting the target to the handler that was previously assigned to the root logger, so it captures data New Relic needs on the thread the log message is coming from: com.newrelic.logging.jul.NewRelicMemoryHandler.target = java.util.logging.FileHandler Copy Use a NewRelicFormatter for the final handler. Update your logging properties file to set the formatter property like the following example. Make sure the handler where you set the formatter is the target handler from the previous step (java.util.logging.FileHandler in this example). java.util.logging.FileHandler.formatter = com.newrelic.logging.jul. NewRelicFormatter Copy The New Relic log format is JSON with telemetry metadata we use to correlate transactions and logs together. Currently we do not support any customization of that format. Once complete, JSON is logged instead of text. The JSON should be formatted as single objects, one per line, and should contain fields like log.level and thread.name. The trace.id, which is required for logs in context, should only have a value for log messages that occur within a transaction. java.util.logging classpath additions The most direct way to get the logs-in-context extensions is to add these dependencies to Maven's pom.xml or Gradle's build.gradle. This allows the packaging tools to pick up the correct dependencies. If you can't edit these files, you can instead add the jars directly to the application classpath for your logging framework's configuration. Before you modify the classpath: Enable the JVM argument -javaagent on your app's Java agent. Verify which logging framework the application is using. Make sure you are able to change your logging framework's configuration. Add the following three jars to the classpath if they aren't already present. Generally, we recommend taking the latest versions published on Maven Central. Group ID com.newrelic.logging and Artifact ID: Select the artifact named after your application's logging framework in Maven. Group ID com.fasterxml.jackson.core and Artifact ID: Use jackson-core. Group ID com.newrelic.agent.java and Artifact ID: Use newrelic-api. Log4j 1.x We offer a Log4j 1.x extension extension for logs in context with the Java agent. To get started, review the code and an example application on GitHub. To configure logs in context for your Java app with with the Log4j 1.x extension, you must configure the Log4j extension in code or via XML. Properties files are not supported because AsyncAppender instances can only be automatically configured via XML. Make sure you have the Log4j 1.x package installed and working on the application. Make sure you have the New Relic Java agent version 5.6.0 or higher installed on your application, and that you have enabled the JVM argument -javaagent. Update your project's dependencies to include the Log4j 1.x extension as applicable. Gradle: Add the following to your build.gradle file: dependencies { compile(\"com.newrelic.logging:log4j1:2.0\") } Copy Maven: Add the following to your pom.xml file: <dependencies> <dependency> <groupId>com.newrelic.logging</groupId> <artifactId>log4j1</artifactId> <version>2.0</version> </dependency> </dependencies> Copy In your logging configuration XML file, update your <appender> element with a NewRelicLayout, adding <layout class=\"com.newrelic.logging.log4j1.NewRelicLayout\"/>: <appender name=\" TypicalFile \" class=\"org.apache.log4j.FileAppender\"> <param name=\"file\" value=\"logs/log4j1-app.log\"/> <param name=\"append\" value=\"false\"/> <layout class=\" com.newrelic.logging.log4j1.NewRelicLayout \"/> <!-- only this line needs to be added --> </appender> Copy Use NewRelicAsyncAppender to wrap any appenders that will target New Relic's log forwarder. For example: <appender name=\" NewRelicFile \" class=\"com.newrelic.logging.log4j1.NewRelicAsyncAppender\"> <appender-ref ref=\" TypicalFile \" /> </appender> Copy Use the async appender on the root logger. For example: <root> <appender-ref ref=\" NewRelicFile \" /> </root> Copy Example configuration file for the Log4j 1.x extension: <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\" ?> <!DOCTYPE log4j:configuration SYSTEM \"log4j.dtd\"> <log4j:configuration debug=\"false\"> <appender name=\"TypicalFile\" class=\"org.apache.log4j.FileAppender\"> <param name=\"file\" value=\"logs/log4j1-app.log\"/> <param name=\"append\" value=\"false\"/> <!-- layout has been replaced --> <layout class=\"com.newrelic.logging.log4j1.NewRelicLayout\"/> </appender> <!-- this appender was added --> <appender name=\"NewRelicFile\" class=\"com.newrelic.logging.log4j1.NewRelicAsyncAppender\"> <appender-ref ref=\"TypicalFile\" /> </appender> <appender name=\"TypicalConsole\" class=\"org.apache.log4j.ConsoleAppender\"> <layout class=\"org.apache.log4j.PatternLayout\"> <param name=\"ConversionPattern\" value=\"%-5p %c{1} - %m%n\"/> </layout> </appender> <root> ​ <!-- the new appender was used here -->​​ <appender-ref ref=\"NewRelicFile\" /> <appender-ref ref=\"TypicalConsole\" /> </root> </log4j:configuration> Copy Log4j 2.x We offer a Log4j 2.x extension for logs in context with the Java agent. To get started, review the code and an example application on GitHub. To configure logs in context for your Java app with with the Log4j 2.x extension: Make sure you have the Log4j 2.x or Logs4j 2 binding package installed and working on your application. Make sure you have the New Relic Java agent version 5.6.0 or higher installed on your application, and that you have enabled the JVM argument -javaagent. Update your project's dependencies to include the Log4j 2.x extension as applicable: Gradle: Add the highlighted section to your build.gradle file: dependencies { compile(\"com.newrelic.logging:log4j2:2.0\") } Copy Maven: Add the highlighted section to your pom.xml file: <dependencies> <dependency> <groupId>com.newrelic.logging</groupId> <artifactId>log4j2</artifactId> <version>2.0</version> </dependency> </dependencies> Copy In your logging configuration XML file, update your <configuration> element by adding the highlighted section: <Configuration xmlns=\"http://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.0/config\" packages=\"com.newrelic.logging.log4j2\" > Copy If you're using a properties file, add packages=com.newrelic.logging.log4j2. Add <NewRelicLayout/> to use a NewRelicLayout element within one of the appenders. For example: <File name=\"MyFile\" fileName=\"logs/app-log-file.log\"> <NewRelicLayout/> </File> Copy If you're using a properties file, only change the layout.type: appender.console.type = Console appender.console.name = STDOUT appender.console.layout.type = NewRelicLayout Copy If you only modified an existing appender, skip this step. If you added a new appender, add <AppenderRef/> within <Root> to use this appender. Use the ref attribute to refer to appender name you created in the previous step. For example: <Root level=\"info\"> <AppenderRef ref=\"MyFile\"/> </Root> Copy If you're using a properties file and added a new appender, add: rootLogger.level = info rootLogger.appenderRef.stdout.ref = STDOUT ​​​​​ Copy Logback version 1.2.0 or higher We offer a Logback extension for logs in context with the Java agent. To get started, review the code and an example application on GitHub. To configure logs in context for your Java app with Logback: Make sure you have Logback version 1.2.0 or higher and the New Relic Java agent version 5.6.0 or higher installed and working on your application. Make sure you have the New Relic Java agent version 5.6.0 or higher installed on your application, and that you have enabled the JVM argument -javaagent. Update your project's dependencies to include the Logback extension as applicable: Gradle: Add the highlighted section to your build.gradle file: dependencies { compile(\"com.newrelic.logging:logback:2.0\") } Copy Maven: Add the highlighted section to your pom.xml file: <dependencies> <dependency> <groupId>com.newrelic.logging</groupId> <artifactId>logback</artifactId> <version>2.0</version> </dependency> </dependencies> Copy Update your logging configuration xml to replace any existing <encoder> element. If you're logging to the console (stdout/stderr), look for ConsoleAppender and replace: <appender name=\"STDOUT\" class=\"ch.qos.logback.core.ConsoleAppender\"> <encoder class=\"com.newrelic.logging.logback.NewRelicEncoder\"/> </appender> Copy If you're logging to a file, look for FileAppender and replace <encoder>: <appender name=\"LOG_FILE\" class=\"ch.qos.logback.core.FileAppender\"> <file>logs/app-log-file.log</file> <encoder class=\"com.newrelic.logging.logback.NewRelicEncoder\"/> </appender> Copy Update your logging configuration xml with the NewRelicAsyncAppender. To ensure that NewRelicAsyncAppender wraps any appenders that will target New Relic's log forwarder, add the following section. Change \"LOG_FILE\" to the name of the appender you updated in the previous step. <appender name=\"ASYNC\" class=\"com.newrelic.logging.logback.NewRelicAsyncAppender\"> <appender-ref ref=\"LOG_FILE\" /> </appender> Copy Make sure NewRelicAsyncAppender is the first appender used in your logger. Replace your root logger’s appenders with the ASYNC appender created in the previous step. Then list any other appenders after the NewRelicAsyncAppender in the <root> list. <root> <appender-ref ref=\"ASYNC\" /> </root> Copy Here are examples of an updated logging .xml file for the Logback extension. You can also see a working example in GitHub. Single console appender example Example configuration file after adding in the logging extension information: <configuration> <appender name=\"STDOUT\" class=\"ch.qos.logback.core.ConsoleAppender\"> <!-- changed the encoder --> <encoder class=\"com.newrelic.logging.logback.NewRelicEncoder\"/> </appender> <!-- added the ASYNC appender --> <appender name=\"ASYNC\" class=\"com.newrelic.logging.logback.NewRelicAsyncAppender\"> <appender-ref ref=\"STDOUT\" /> </appender> <root level=\"debug\"> <!-- changed the root logger --> <appender-ref ref=\"ASYNC\" /> </root> </configuration> Copy Two console appenders example This example sends New Relic logging to a file, but still sends standard logging to the console: <configuration> <appender name=\"FILE\" class=\"ch.qos.logback.core.FileAppender\"> <file>myApp.log</file> <!-- encoder changed --> <encoder class=\"com.newrelic.logging.logback.NewRelicEncoder\"/> </appender> <!-- this appender does normal console logging --> <appender name=\"STDOUT\" class=\"ch.qos.logback.core.ConsoleAppender\"> <encoder> <pattern>%msg%n</pattern> </encoder> </appender> <!-- The required New Relic ASYNC appender wraps the FILE appender --> <appender name=\"ASYNC\" class=\"com.newrelic.logging.logback.NewRelicAsyncAppender\"> <appender-ref ref=\"FILE\" /> </appender> <root level=\"debug\"> <!-- ASYNC is one of the main appenders --> <appender-ref ref=\"ASYNC\" /> <!-- Send every message to normal console logging, as well. --> <appender-ref ref=\"STDOUT\" /> </root> </configuration> Copy Spring and Springboot We offer extensions for current versions of Spring and Spring Boot. If you already know the logging library, you can skip directly to that documentation: java.util.logging log4j 1 log4j 2 logback The extensions support default configurations only on Spring Boot 2.0 and higher. With Spring Boot: Here are tips to determine which logging library you have: If you have spring-boot-starter-log4j2 in your dependencies, you're using log4j 2.x. Refer to the Spring Boot log4j 2.x documentation for basic configuration, and the New Relic log4j 2 extension for customizing your configuration. If you're using Spring Boot but not the starter-log4j2, you're using logback by default. Refer to Spring Boot logback documentation for basic configuration, and the New Relic logback extension for customizing your configuration. With Spring (but not Spring Boot): Spring 5 or higher: Spring implements a bridge to other logging libraries that will automatically find them. However, those individual libraries must be configured and explicitly included in your project dependencies. To identify your logging dependency, consult your Gradle, Maven, or other build tool's dependency tree. Then follow the procedures to configure logs in context for your Java app with that extension. Spring 4 or lower: Spring version 4 and lower uses Apache Commons Logging for its bridge. Refer to the Spring documentation for information on configuring its bridge. View logs in UI To verify that you have configured the log appender correctly, run your application, then check your logs data in New Relic One using the query operator has:span.id has:trace.id. If everything is configured correctly and your data is being forwarded to New Relic with the enriched metadata, your logs should now be emitted as JSON and contain trace.id and span.id fields. If you don't see log data in the UI, follow the troubleshooting procedures. What's next? After you set up APM logs in context, make the most of your logging data: Explore the logging data across your platform with our Logs UI. See your logs in context of your app's performance in the APM UI. Troubleshoot errors with distributed tracing, stack traces, application logs, and more.

Bringing all of this data together in a single tool helps you quickly get to the root cause of an issue and find the log lines that you need to identify and resolve a problem. Set up your .NET app To enable logs in context for APM apps monitored by .NET: Make sure you have already set up logging in New Relic. This includes configuring a supported log forwarder that collects your application logs and extends the metadata that is forwarded to New Relic. Install or update to the latest .NET agent version, and enable distributed tracing. Use .NET agent version 8.21 or higher and the New Relic .NET agent API version 8.21 or higher for logs in context. Install or update to Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5 or higher or .NET Core 2.0 or higher. Install and configure any of the following logging extensions to enrich your log data. Configure log4net extension You can use the Apache log4net version 2.0.8 or higher extension to link your log data with related data across the rest of the New Relic platform. log4net workflow diagram The following diagram illustrates the flow of log messages through Apache log4net, highlighting specific components of the New Relic log4net extension. Many log forwarders are available. This example uses Fluentd. Appender: The NewRelicAppender adds contextual information from the .NET agent (using the API) to the log events generated by the application. This contextual information, known as linking metadata, is used by New Relic to link log messages to the transactions and spans from which they were created. This appender will pass the enriched log events to downstream appenders for further processing. Since the NewRelicAppender is ForwardingAppender type, it needs to be the first appender in the chain. It also requires another appender that can write to an actual output destination as its child in order to work. Layout: The NewRelicLayout formats the enriched log events into the JSON format expected by New Relic. The appender, which this layout is assigned to, instructs log4net to output the JSON to a file in the location that the log forwarder expects. Log Forwarder: The log forwarder monitors an output folder and incrementally sends New Relic formatted log information to the New Relic logging endpoint. log4net 2.0.8 or higher configuration Log4net uses appender and layout to store and format log messages. NewRelicAppender enriches log messages with contextual information from the New Relic .NET agent if it is attached to your application. The appender passes enriched log messages to downstream appenders to handle specific use cases for log messages. For more information about logging with log4net, see the Apache log4net Getting started documentation. To configure logs in context with the log4net extension: Using the Visual Studio NuGet Package Manager, locate and install the NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Log4Net package. In your log4net configuration file, update your logging configuration to use the NewRelicAppender as the first level appender, and reference your existing appenders as its children. Also replace the layout of the appender that writes log messages to an output destination with the NewRelicLayout. The following log4net configuration example enriches log events with New Relic linking metadata. In addition to the existing log files, it outputs new log files in a specific JSON format at C:\\logs\\log4netExample.log.json for consumption by the log forwarder: <log4net> <root> <level value=\"ALL\" /> <appender-ref ref=\"NewRelicAppender\" /> </root> <appender name=\"NewRelicAppender\" type=\"NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Log4Net.NewRelicAppender, NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Log4Net\" > <threshold value=\"ALL\"/> <appender-ref ref=\"FileAppender\" /> </appender> <appender name=\"FileAppender\" type=\"log4net.Appender.FileAppender\"> <file value=\"C:\\logs\\log4netExample.log.json\" /> <param name=\"AppendToFile\" value=\"true\" /> <layout type=\"NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Log4Net.NewRelicLayout, NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Log4Net\"> </layout> </appender> </log4net> Copy After you configure the log4net extension and update your logging file, you can configure your extension to send data to New Relic. Here is an example configuration using the Fluentd plugin for New Relic Logs: <!--NewRelicLoggingExample.conf--> <source> @type tail path C:\\logs\\log4netExample.log.json pos_file C:\\logs\\log4netExample.log.json.pos tag logfile.* <parse> @type json </parse> </source> <match **> @type newrelic license_key <YOUR NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY> base_uri https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 </match> Copy Configure NLog extension You can use our NLog 4.5 or higher extension to link to your log data with related data across the rest of the New Relic platform. Nlog workflow diagram The New Relic NLog extension provides a NewRelicJsonLayout that formats a log event in the way required by the New Relic logging endpoint. Next, it adds contextual information from the .NET agent when attached to your application. Then, a target can be configured to write logging data to an output folder. The log forwarder can monitor this folder and incrementally send log information to New Relic. The following diagram illustrates the flow of log messages through NLog, highlighting specific components of the New Relic NLog extension. New Relic JSON Layout: The NewRelicJsonLayout adds contextual information from the .NET agent (using the API) to the log events generated by the application, and outputs log messages in the JSON format expected by New Relic. This contextual information, known as linking metadata, is used by New Relic to link log messages to the transactions and spans where they were created. Since the NewRelicAppender is ForwardingAppender type, it needs to be the first appender in the chain. It also requires another appender that can write to an actual output destination as its child in order to work. File Target: A FileTarget defines a file on disk where log messages are written. Adding the NewRelicJsonLayout to that target allows the output to be formatted correctly for forwarding to New Relic. Log Forwarder: The log forwarder is configured to send the log data from the FileTarget output to New Relic. The example below uses the New Relic Fluentd log forwarder, however there are many other log forwarders that can be used. For more information about logging with NLog, see the nlog-project.org documentation. Nlog 4.5 or higher configuration Use our NLog 4.5 or higher extension to link to your log data with related data across the rest of the New Relic platform. Using the Visual Studio NuGet Package Manager, locate and install the NewRelic.LogEnrichers.NLog package. In your application code, update your logging configuration to add the NewRelicJsonLayout and decide if you want to collect MappedDiagnosticsContext (MDC) or the MappedDiagnosticsLogicalContext (MDLC) data. The following configuration examples result in new JSON files that are written to disk. Some of these configuration options may be useful for managing the amount of disk space used and/or the performance of the target. archiveAboveSize maxArchiveFiles bufferSize enableArchiveFileCompression autoFlush concurrentWrites Although the NLog AsyncWrapper Target is not required, it may help improve performance by performing formatting and output of log files on a different thread. Don't collect MDC or the MDLC data (default): The following code example enriches log events with New Relic linking metadata, but not with MDC or the MDLC data. In addition to the existing log files, it outputs new log files in a specific JSON format at C:\\logs\\NLogExample.log.json for consumption by the log forwarder: var loggerConfig = new LoggingConfiguration(); var newRelicFileTarget = new FileTarget(\"NewRelicFileTarget\"); newRelicFileTarget.Layout = new NewRelicJsonLayout(); newRelicFileTarget.FileName = \"C:\\logs\\NLogExample.json\"; loggerConfig.AddTarget(newRelicFileTarget); loggerConfig.AddRuleForAllLevels(\"NewRelicFileTarget\"); LogManager.Configuration = loggerConfig; var logger = LogManager.GetLogger(\"Example\"); Copy Collect MDC or the MDLC data: If your application uses the MDC or the MDLC, you can configure the NewRelicJsonLayout to include items in those collections. The following code example adds the additional configuration to enable collecting MDC and MDLC data. As in the previous example, it outputs new log files in a specific JSON format at C:\\logs\\NLogExample.log.json for consumption by the log forwarder: var loggerConfig = new LoggingConfiguration(); var newRelicFileTarget = new FileTarget(\"NewRelicFileTarget\"); var newRelicLayout = new NewRelicJsonLayout { IncludeMdc = `true,` IncludeMdlc = `true` }; newRelicFileTarget.Layout = newRelicLayout; newRelicFileTarget.FileName = \"C:\\logs\\NLogExample.json\"; loggerConfig.AddTarget(newRelicFileTarget); loggerConfig.AddRuleForAllLevels(\"NewRelicFileTarget\"); LogManager.Configuration = loggerConfig; var logger = LogManager.GetLogger(\"Example\"); Copy Once you have configured the NLog extension and updated your logging file, you can configure your extension to send data to New Relic. Here is an example configuration using the Fluentd plugin to forward logs to New Relic: <!--NewRelicLoggingExample.conf--> <source> @type tail path C:\\logs\\NLogExample.log.json pos_file C:\\logs\\NLogExample.log.json.pos tag logfile.* <parse> @type json </parse> </source> <match **> @type newrelic license_key <YOUR NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY> base_uri https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 </match> Copy Nlog file-based configuration You can also configure the New Relic NLog extension with file-based configuration providers. The folowing example code creates a logger based on settings contained in an App.config file. Instantiating Logger using .config file var logger = LogManager.GetLogger(\"NewRelicLog\"); logger.Info(\"Hello, New Relic!\"); Copy Sample App.config file <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\" ?> <configuration> <configSections> <section name=\"nlog\" type=\"NLog.Config.ConfigSectionHandler, NLog\"/> </configSections> <startup> <supportedRuntime version=\"v4.0\" sku=\".NETFramework,Version=v4.5\" /> </startup> <nlog xmlns=\"http://www.nlog-project.org/schemas/NLog.xsd\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"> <extensions> <add assembly=\"NewRelic.LogEnrichers.NLog\" /> </extensions> <targets> <target name=\"NewRelicLogFile\" xsi:type=\"File\" fileName=\"C:/path/to/NewRelicLog.json\"> <layout xsi:type=\"newrelic-jsonlayout\"> </layout> </target> </targets> <rules> <logger name=\"NewRelicLog\" minlevel=\"Info\" writeTo=\"newRelicLogFile\" /> </rules> </nlog> </configuration> Copy Configure Serilog 2.5 or higher extension You can use our Serilog extension to link to your log data with related data across the rest of the New Relic platform. This requires: Serilog 2.5 or higher Serilog File Sinks v4.0 or higher Serilog workflow diagram Serilog is a structured logging framework that records log messages from your application and creates a LogEvent to store the message data. Using Enrichers, you can add additional information to the log events. Sinks and Formatters allow you to format and output those log events for downstream consumption and viewing. The following diagram illustrates the flow of log messages through Serilog, highlighting specific components of the New Relic Serilog extension. Many log forwarders are available. This example uses Fluentd. New Relic Enricher: The NewRelicEnricher adds contextual information from the .NET agent (using the API) to the log events generated by the application. This contextual information, called linking metadata, is used by New Relic to link log messages to the transactions and spans where they were created. New Relic Formatter: The NewRelicFormattertranslates enriched log events into the JSON format expected by New Relic. A sink instructs Serilog to output the JSON to a file in the location that the log forwarder expects. New Relic Log Forwarder: The NewRelicFormatter translates enriched log events into the JSON format expected by New Relic. A sink instructs Serilog to output the JSON to a file in the location that the log forwarder expects. For more information about Serilog log events, see the Serilog documentation on GitHub. Serilog 2.5 or higher configuration To configure logs in context with the Serilog extension: Use the Visual Studio NuGet Package Manager to locate and install the NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Serilog package. In your application code, update your logging configuration to add the NewRelicEnricher and NewRelicFormatter. The following code example enriches log events with New Relic linking metadata. In addition to the existing log files, it outputs new log files in a specific JSON format at C:\\logs\\SerilogExample.log.json for consumption by the log forwarder: var loggerConfig = new LoggerConfiguration() loggerConfig .Enrich.WithThreadName() .Enrich.WithThreadId() .Enrich.WithNewRelicLogsInContext() .WriteTo.File( path: @\"C:\\logs\\ExistingLoggingOutput.txt\") .WriteTo.File( formatter: new NewRelicFormatter(), path: @\"C:\\logs\\SerilogExample.log.json\"); var log = loggerConfig.CreateLogger(); Copy This configuration results in new JSON files that are written to disk. Some of these configuration options may be useful for managing the amount of disk space used and/or the performance of the sink. restrictedToMinimumLevel buffered rollingInterval rollOnFileSizeLimit retainedFileCountLimit Although not required, using the Serilog Asynchronous Sink Wrapper may help improve the performance by performing formatting and output of log files on a different thread. Once you have configured the Serilog extension and updated your logging file, you can configure your extension to send data to New Relic. Here is an example configuration using the Fluentd plugin to forward logs to New Relic: <!--NewRelicLoggingExample.conf--> <source> @type tail path C:\\logs\\SerilogExample.log.json pos_file C:\\logs\\SerilogExample.log.json.pos tag logfile.* <parse> @type json </parse> </source> <match **> @type newrelic license_key <YOUR NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY> base_uri https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 </match> Copy Serilog file-based configuration You can also configure the New Relic Serilog extension with file-based configuration providers.The following additional NuGet Packages are required: Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration/) Serilog.Settings.Configuration The following example code creates a logger based on settings contained in an appSettings.json file. Instantiating logger using appsettings.json var builder = new ConfigurationBuilder() .AddJsonFile(\"appsettings.json\"); var configuration = builder.Build(); var logger = new LoggerConfiguration() .ReadFrom.Configuration(configuration) .CreateLogger(); Copy Sample appsettings.json file { \"Serilog\": { \"Using\": [ \"Serilog.Sinks.Console\", \"Serilog.Sinks.File\", \"NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Serilog\" ], \"MinimumLevel\": \"Debug\", \"Enrich\": [ \"WithNewRelicLogsInContext\" ], \"WriteTo\": [ { \"Name\": \"File\", \"Args\": { \"path\": \"C:\\\\Logs\\\\SerilogExample.log.json\", \"formatter\": \"NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Serilog.NewRelicFormatter, NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Serilog\" } } ], \"Properties\": { \"Application\": \"NewRelic Logging Serilog Example\" } } } Copy The following example code creates a logger based on settings contained in a web.config file. The Serilog.Settings.AppSettings NuGet Package is required. Instantiating logger using .config file var logger = new LoggerConfiguration() .ReadFrom.AppSettings() .CreateLogger(); Copy Sample web.config file <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?> <configuration> <appSettings> <add key=\"serilog:using:NewRelic\" value=\"NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Serilog\" /> <add key=\"serilog:using:File\" value=\"Serilog.Sinks.File\" /> <!--Add other enrichers here--> <add key=\"serilog:enrich:WithNewRelicLogsInContext\" /> <add key=\"serilog:write-to:File.path\" value=\"C:\\logs\\SerilogExample.log.json\" /> <add key=\"serilog:write-to:File.formatter\" value=\"NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Serilog.NewRelicFormatter, NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Serilog\" /> </appSettings> Copy View logs in the UI To verify that you have configured the log appender correctly, run your application, then check your logs data in New Relic One using the query operator has:span.id has:trace.id. If everything is configured correctly and your data is being forwarded to New Relic with the enriched metadata, your logs should now be emitted as JSON and contain trace.id and span.id fields. If you don't see log data in the UI, follow the troubleshooting procedures. What's next?

      "body": "Logs in context for the Java agent connects your logs and APM data in New Relic. Bringing all of this data together in a single tool helps you quickly get to the root cause of an issue and find the log lines that you need to identify and resolve a problem. Set up your Java app To enable logs in context for APM apps monitored by Java: Make sure you have already set up logging in New Relic. This includes configuring a supported log forwarder that collects your application logs and extends the metadata that is forwarded to New Relic. Install or update to the latest Java agent version. Use Java agent version 5.6.0 or higher for logs in context. Enable the JVM argument -javaagent, and enable distributed tracing. Configure logs in context for Java to enrich your log data, using any of the following extensions as applicable. If you use Spring or Spring Boot and aren't sure which extension you need, see our Spring documentation. Dropwizard 1.3 or higher We offer a Dropwizard extension for logs in context with the Java agent. To get started, review the code and an example application on GitHub. To configure logs in context for your Java app with the DropWizard extension: Make sure you have the Dropwizard 1.3 or higher package installed and working on your application. Use the original Dropwizard appenders and logging factory installed and working on the application. Make sure you have the New Relic Java agent version 5.6.0 or higher installed on your application, and that you have enabled the JVM argument -javaagent. Update your project's dependencies to include the Dropwizard 1.3 extension as applicable: Gradle: Add the following to your build.gradle file: dependencies { compile(\"com.newrelic.logging:dropwizard:2.0\") } Copy Maven: Add the following to your pom.xml file: <dependencies> <dependency> <groupId>com.newrelic.logging</groupId> <artifactId>dropwizard</artifactId> <version>2.0</version> </dependency> </dependencies> Copy Update your Dropwizard .yaml configuration file with a newrelic-json layout, replacing the currently used type: console or type: file with either type: newrelic-console or type: newrelic-file as appropriate. For example: logging: appenders: - type: newrelic-console # Add the two lines below if you don't have a layout specified on the appender. # If you have a layout, remove all parameters to the layout and set the type. layout: type: newrelic-json Copy The New Relic Dropwizard extension also supports a log-format layout type that uses the standard Dropwizard logging. For testing purposes, you can change the type of the layout with a one-line change: logging: appenders: - type: newrelic-file # This format will be ignored by the newrelic-json layout, but used by the log-format layout. logFormat: \"%date{ISO8601} %c %-5p: %m trace.id=%mdc{trace.id} span.id=%mdc{span.id}%n\" layout: # type: newrelic-json type: log-format Copy java.util.logging We offer a java.util.logging extension for logs in context with the Java agent. To get started, review the code and an example application on GitHub. To configure logs in context for your Java app with with the java.util.logging extension: Make sure you have the java.util.logging package installed and working on the application. Make sure you have the New Relic Java agent version 5.6.0 or higher installed on your application, and that you have enabled the JVM argument -javaagent. Update your project's dependencies to include the java.util.logging extension as applicable. If you can't edit these files, you can instead add the jars directly to the application classpath. Gradle: Add the following to your build.gradle file: dependencies { compile(\"com.newrelic.logging:jul:2.0\") } Copy Maven: Add the following to your pom.xml file: <dependencies> <dependency> <groupId>com.newrelic.logging</groupId> <artifactId>jul</artifactId> <version>2.0</version> </dependency> </dependencies> Copy Check if your logging file's handlers property is set to something other than NewRelicMemoryHandler. Look for a line listing the root logger's handlers, like this: handlers = java.util.logging.FileHandler Copy Update your logging properties file to set the root logger's handler to NewRelicMemoryHandler so it intercepts messages destined for another handler: handlers = com.newrelic.logging.jul.NewRelicMemoryHandler Copy Configure the NewRelicMemoryHandler by setting the target to the handler that was previously assigned to the root logger, so it captures data New Relic needs on the thread the log message is coming from: com.newrelic.logging.jul.NewRelicMemoryHandler.target = java.util.logging.FileHandler Copy Use a NewRelicFormatter for the final handler. Update your logging properties file to set the formatter property like the following example. Make sure the handler where you set the formatter is the target handler from the previous step (java.util.logging.FileHandler in this example). java.util.logging.FileHandler.formatter = com.newrelic.logging.jul. NewRelicFormatter Copy The New Relic log format is JSON with telemetry metadata we use to correlate transactions and logs together. Currently we do not support any customization of that format. Once complete, JSON is logged instead of text. The JSON should be formatted as single objects, one per line, and should contain fields like log.level and thread.name. The trace.id, which is required for logs in context, should only have a value for log messages that occur within a transaction. java.util.logging classpath additions The most direct way to get the logs-in-context extensions is to add these dependencies to Maven's pom.xml or Gradle's build.gradle. This allows the packaging tools to pick up the correct dependencies. If you can't edit these files, you can instead add the jars directly to the application classpath for your logging framework's configuration. Before you modify the classpath: Enable the JVM argument -javaagent on your app's Java agent. Verify which logging framework the application is using. Make sure you are able to change your logging framework's configuration. Add the following three jars to the classpath if they aren't already present. Generally, we recommend taking the latest versions published on Maven Central. Group ID com.newrelic.logging and Artifact ID: Select the artifact named after your application's logging framework in Maven. Group ID com.fasterxml.jackson.core and Artifact ID: Use jackson-core. Group ID com.newrelic.agent.java and Artifact ID: Use newrelic-api. Log4j 1.x We offer a Log4j 1.x extension extension for logs in context with the Java agent. To get started, review the code and an example application on GitHub. To configure logs in context for your Java app with with the Log4j 1.x extension, you must configure the Log4j extension in code or via XML. Properties files are not supported because AsyncAppender instances can only be automatically configured via XML. Make sure you have the Log4j 1.x package installed and working on the application. Make sure you have the New Relic Java agent version 5.6.0 or higher installed on your application, and that you have enabled the JVM argument -javaagent. Update your project's dependencies to include the Log4j 1.x extension as applicable. Gradle: Add the following to your build.gradle file: dependencies { compile(\"com.newrelic.logging:log4j1:2.0\") } Copy Maven: Add the following to your pom.xml file: <dependencies> <dependency> <groupId>com.newrelic.logging</groupId> <artifactId>log4j1</artifactId> <version>2.0</version> </dependency> </dependencies> Copy In your logging configuration XML file, update your <appender> element with a NewRelicLayout, adding <layout class=\"com.newrelic.logging.log4j1.NewRelicLayout\"/>: <appender name=\" TypicalFile \" class=\"org.apache.log4j.FileAppender\"> <param name=\"file\" value=\"logs/log4j1-app.log\"/> <param name=\"append\" value=\"false\"/> <layout class=\" com.newrelic.logging.log4j1.NewRelicLayout \"/> <!-- only this line needs to be added --> </appender> Copy Use NewRelicAsyncAppender to wrap any appenders that will target New Relic's log forwarder. For example: <appender name=\" NewRelicFile \" class=\"com.newrelic.logging.log4j1.NewRelicAsyncAppender\"> <appender-ref ref=\" TypicalFile \" /> </appender> Copy Use the async appender on the root logger. For example: <root> <appender-ref ref=\" NewRelicFile \" /> </root> Copy Example configuration file for the Log4j 1.x extension: <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\" ?> <!DOCTYPE log4j:configuration SYSTEM \"log4j.dtd\"> <log4j:configuration debug=\"false\"> <appender name=\"TypicalFile\" class=\"org.apache.log4j.FileAppender\"> <param name=\"file\" value=\"logs/log4j1-app.log\"/> <param name=\"append\" value=\"false\"/> <!-- layout has been replaced --> <layout class=\"com.newrelic.logging.log4j1.NewRelicLayout\"/> </appender> <!-- this appender was added --> <appender name=\"NewRelicFile\" class=\"com.newrelic.logging.log4j1.NewRelicAsyncAppender\"> <appender-ref ref=\"TypicalFile\" /> </appender> <appender name=\"TypicalConsole\" class=\"org.apache.log4j.ConsoleAppender\"> <layout class=\"org.apache.log4j.PatternLayout\"> <param name=\"ConversionPattern\" value=\"%-5p %c{1} - %m%n\"/> </layout> </appender> <root> ​ <!-- the new appender was used here -->​​ <appender-ref ref=\"NewRelicFile\" /> <appender-ref ref=\"TypicalConsole\" /> </root> </log4j:configuration> Copy Log4j 2.x We offer a Log4j 2.x extension for logs in context with the Java agent. To get started, review the code and an example application on GitHub. To configure logs in context for your Java app with with the Log4j 2.x extension: Make sure you have the Log4j 2.x or Logs4j 2 binding package installed and working on your application. Make sure you have the New Relic Java agent version 5.6.0 or higher installed on your application, and that you have enabled the JVM argument -javaagent. Update your project's dependencies to include the Log4j 2.x extension as applicable: Gradle: Add the highlighted section to your build.gradle file: dependencies { compile(\"com.newrelic.logging:log4j2:2.0\") } Copy Maven: Add the highlighted section to your pom.xml file: <dependencies> <dependency> <groupId>com.newrelic.logging</groupId> <artifactId>log4j2</artifactId> <version>2.0</version> </dependency> </dependencies> Copy In your logging configuration XML file, update your <configuration> element by adding the highlighted section: <Configuration xmlns=\"http://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.0/config\" packages=\"com.newrelic.logging.log4j2\" > Copy If you're using a properties file, add packages=com.newrelic.logging.log4j2. Add <NewRelicLayout/> to use a NewRelicLayout element within one of the appenders. For example: <File name=\"MyFile\" fileName=\"logs/app-log-file.log\"> <NewRelicLayout/> </File> Copy If you're using a properties file, only change the layout.type: appender.console.type = Console appender.console.name = STDOUT appender.console.layout.type = NewRelicLayout Copy If you only modified an existing appender, skip this step. If you added a new appender, add <AppenderRef/> within <Root> to use this appender. Use the ref attribute to refer to appender name you created in the previous step. For example: <Root level=\"info\"> <AppenderRef ref=\"MyFile\"/> </Root> Copy If you're using a properties file and added a new appender, add: rootLogger.level = info rootLogger.appenderRef.stdout.ref = STDOUT ​​​​​ Copy Logback version 1.2.0 or higher We offer a Logback extension for logs in context with the Java agent. To get started, review the code and an example application on GitHub. To configure logs in context for your Java app with Logback: Make sure you have Logback version 1.2.0 or higher and the New Relic Java agent version 5.6.0 or higher installed and working on your application. Make sure you have the New Relic Java agent version 5.6.0 or higher installed on your application, and that you have enabled the JVM argument -javaagent. Update your project's dependencies to include the Logback extension as applicable: Gradle: Add the highlighted section to your build.gradle file: dependencies { compile(\"com.newrelic.logging:logback:2.0\") } Copy Maven: Add the highlighted section to your pom.xml file: <dependencies> <dependency> <groupId>com.newrelic.logging</groupId> <artifactId>logback</artifactId> <version>2.0</version> </dependency> </dependencies> Copy Update your logging configuration xml to replace any existing <encoder> element. If you're logging to the console (stdout/stderr), look for ConsoleAppender and replace: <appender name=\"STDOUT\" class=\"ch.qos.logback.core.ConsoleAppender\"> <encoder class=\"com.newrelic.logging.logback.NewRelicEncoder\"/> </appender> Copy If you're logging to a file, look for FileAppender and replace <encoder>: <appender name=\"LOG_FILE\" class=\"ch.qos.logback.core.FileAppender\"> <file>logs/app-log-file.log</file> <encoder class=\"com.newrelic.logging.logback.NewRelicEncoder\"/> </appender> Copy Update your logging configuration xml with the NewRelicAsyncAppender. To ensure that NewRelicAsyncAppender wraps any appenders that will target New Relic's log forwarder, add the following section. Change \"LOG_FILE\" to the name of the appender you updated in the previous step. <appender name=\"ASYNC\" class=\"com.newrelic.logging.logback.NewRelicAsyncAppender\"> <appender-ref ref=\"LOG_FILE\" /> </appender> Copy Make sure NewRelicAsyncAppender is the first appender used in your logger. Replace your root logger’s appenders with the ASYNC appender created in the previous step. Then list any other appenders after the NewRelicAsyncAppender in the <root> list. <root> <appender-ref ref=\"ASYNC\" /> </root> Copy Here are examples of an updated logging .xml file for the Logback extension. You can also see a working example in GitHub. Single console appender example Example configuration file after adding in the logging extension information: <configuration> <appender name=\"STDOUT\" class=\"ch.qos.logback.core.ConsoleAppender\"> <!-- changed the encoder --> <encoder class=\"com.newrelic.logging.logback.NewRelicEncoder\"/> </appender> <!-- added the ASYNC appender --> <appender name=\"ASYNC\" class=\"com.newrelic.logging.logback.NewRelicAsyncAppender\"> <appender-ref ref=\"STDOUT\" /> </appender> <root level=\"debug\"> <!-- changed the root logger --> <appender-ref ref=\"ASYNC\" /> </root> </configuration> Copy Two console appenders example This example sends New Relic logging to a file, but still sends standard logging to the console: <configuration> <appender name=\"FILE\" class=\"ch.qos.logback.core.FileAppender\"> <file>myApp.log</file> <!-- encoder changed --> <encoder class=\"com.newrelic.logging.logback.NewRelicEncoder\"/> </appender> <!-- this appender does normal console logging --> <appender name=\"STDOUT\" class=\"ch.qos.logback.core.ConsoleAppender\"> <encoder> <pattern>%msg%n</pattern> </encoder> </appender> <!-- The required New Relic ASYNC appender wraps the FILE appender --> <appender name=\"ASYNC\" class=\"com.newrelic.logging.logback.NewRelicAsyncAppender\"> <appender-ref ref=\"FILE\" /> </appender> <root level=\"debug\"> <!-- ASYNC is one of the main appenders --> <appender-ref ref=\"ASYNC\" /> <!-- Send every message to normal console logging, as well. --> <appender-ref ref=\"STDOUT\" /> </root> </configuration> Copy Spring and Springboot We offer extensions for current versions of Spring and Spring Boot. If you already know the logging library, you can skip directly to that documentation: java.util.logging log4j 1 log4j 2 logback The extensions support default configurations only on Spring Boot 2.0 and higher. With Spring Boot: Here are tips to determine which logging library you have: If you have spring-boot-starter-log4j2 in your dependencies, you're using log4j 2.x. Refer to the Spring Boot log4j 2.x documentation for basic configuration, and the New Relic log4j 2 extension for customizing your configuration. If you're using Spring Boot but not the starter-log4j2, you're using logback by default. Refer to Spring Boot logback documentation for basic configuration, and the New Relic logback extension for customizing your configuration. With Spring (but not Spring Boot): Spring 5 or higher: Spring implements a bridge to other logging libraries that will automatically find them. However, those individual libraries must be configured and explicitly included in your project dependencies. To identify your logging dependency, consult your Gradle, Maven, or other build tool's dependency tree. Then follow the procedures to configure logs in context for your Java app with that extension. Spring 4 or lower: Spring version 4 and lower uses Apache Commons Logging for its bridge. Refer to the Spring documentation for information on configuring its bridge. View logs in UI To verify that you have configured the log appender correctly, run your application, then check your logs data in New Relic One using the query operator has:span.id has:trace.id. If everything is configured correctly and your data is being forwarded to New Relic with the enriched metadata, your logs should now be emitted as JSON and contain trace.id and span.id fields. If you don't see log data in the UI, follow the troubleshooting procedures. What's next?

Bringing all of this data together in a single tool helps you quickly get to the root cause of an issue and find the log lines that you need to identify and resolve a problem. Set up your Ruby app To enable logs in context for APM apps monitored by Ruby: Make sure you have already set up logging in New Relic. This includes configuring a supported log forwarder that collects your application logs and extends the metadata that is forwarded to New Relic. Install or update to the latest Ruby agent version, and enable distributed tracing. Use Ruby agent version 6.7.0 or higher for logs in context. For Rails applications, use a supported Rails version. Configure logs in context for Ruby. Standard Ruby on Rails configuration Rails logging is controlled by two components: A logger you can customize by setting config.logger A log formatter you can customize by setting config.log_formatter) In most cases, you should configure logs in context by setting config.log_formatter to the DecoratingFormatter in your Rails application. For more information about Rails configuration, see the rubyonrails.org documentation. In your application's config, require newrelic_rpm, then add the following line: module ________ class Application < Rails::Application ... config.log_formatter = ::NewRelic::Agent::Logging::DecoratingFormatter.new end end Copy This configuration uses the New Relic formatter for log messages, but the remaining configuration is provided by the other Rails settings. Incompatible gems New Relic's decorating logger is known to be incompatible with the following gems: logging semantic logger rails_stdout_logger rails_12factor Rails advanced configuration If setting the log_formatter option doesn't meet your needs, replace the entire Rails logger with an instance of the New Relic logger. Provide the parameters to the logger's constructor, like this: module ________ class Application < Rails::Application ... config.logger = ::NewRelic::Agent::Logging::DecoratingLogger.new( \"log/application.log\", #etc... ) end end Copy Ruby configuration without Rails For non-Rails applications, use the DecoratingLogger in place of the Ruby standard ::Logger, like this: logger = ::NewRelic::Agent::Logging::DecoratingLogger.new( 'log/application.log', #etc... ) ... logger.info(...) Copy The DecoratingLogger is a drop-in replacement for the Ruby standard ::Logger. Their constructors accept the same parameters. Lograge configuration To configure this extension with the lograge gem, no additional configuration is required. Other logging extensions To use our logging extension with a different logging implementation or with your own custom logger, use the DecoratingFormatter. For example: module ________ class Application < Rails::Application ... config.logger = ::YourCustomLoggerImplementation.new( $stdout, formatter: ::NewRelic::Agent::Logging::DecoratingFormatter.new ) end end Copy To verify that you have configured the log appender correctly, run your application, then check your logs data in New Relic One using the query operator has:span.id has:trace.id. If everything is configured correctly and your data is being forwarded to New Relic with the enriched metadata, your logs should now be emitted as JSON and contain trace.id and span.id fields. If you have configured your logging in /config/application.rb or in /config/environments/development.rb, run your application locally and check its logging output. You should see some output like this: {\"entity.name\":\"your_app_name\",\"entity.type\":\"SERVICE\",\"hostname\":\"79bcbf8d\",\"trace.id\":\"79bcbf8d\",\"span.id\":\"00fc7d46\",\"timestamp\":1567701375543,\"message\":\"example log message one\",\"log.level\":\"DEBUG\"} {\"entity.name\":\"your_app_name\",\"entity.type\":\"SERVICE\",\"hostname\":\"79bcbf8d\",\"trace.id\":\"79bcbf8d\",\"span.id\":\"6754870b\",\"timestamp\":1567702843604,\"message\":\"example log message two\",\"log.level\":\"DEBUG\"} Copy Troubleshooting If you don't see log data in the UI, follow the troubleshooting procedures. Also, if you see JSON logs in your application's output, but your query does not return logs, check your log forwarder. If the logs from your application are not formatted in JSON with fields like trace.id and span.id, there may be a problem with your log forwarding extension. In this situation: Check that the application is using a supported logging framework. Check that your logging configuration has been applied to all the environments where you want to forward and enrich the log data being sent to New Relic. Check that another logger is not configured later in your application's configuration. Logs in context for Ruby does not support tagged logging. If you are initializing your logger with a log_tags argument, your custom tags may not appear on the final version of your logs. What's next? After you set up APM logs in context, make the most of your logging data: Explore the logging data across your platform with our Logs UI. See your logs in context of your app's performance in the APM UI. Troubleshoot errors with distributed tracing, stack traces, application logs, and more. Get deeper visibility into both your application and your platform performance data by forwarding your logs with our infrastructure monitoring agent. Review your infrastructure logs in the UI. Set up alerts. Query your data and create dashboards.",

Bringing all of this data together in a single tool helps you quickly get to the root cause of an issue and find the log lines that you need to identify and resolve a problem. Set up your .NET app To enable logs in context for APM apps monitored by .NET: Make sure you have already set up logging in New Relic. This includes configuring a supported log forwarder that collects your application logs and extends the metadata that is forwarded to New Relic. Install or update to the latest .NET agent version, and enable distributed tracing. Use .NET agent version 8.21 or higher and the New Relic .NET agent API version 8.21 or higher for logs in context. Install or update to Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5 or higher or .NET Core 2.0 or higher. Install and configure any of the following logging extensions to enrich your log data. Configure log4net extension You can use the Apache log4net version 2.0.8 or higher extension to link your log data with related data across the rest of the New Relic platform. log4net workflow diagram The following diagram illustrates the flow of log messages through Apache log4net, highlighting specific components of the New Relic log4net extension. Many log forwarders are available. This example uses Fluentd. Appender: The NewRelicAppender adds contextual information from the .NET agent (using the API) to the log events generated by the application. This contextual information, known as linking metadata, is used by New Relic to link log messages to the transactions and spans from which they were created. This appender will pass the enriched log events to downstream appenders for further processing. Since the NewRelicAppender is ForwardingAppender type, it needs to be the first appender in the chain. It also requires another appender that can write to an actual output destination as its child in order to work. Layout: The NewRelicLayout formats the enriched log events into the JSON format expected by New Relic. The appender, which this layout is assigned to, instructs log4net to output the JSON to a file in the location that the log forwarder expects. Log Forwarder: The log forwarder monitors an output folder and incrementally sends New Relic formatted log information to the New Relic logging endpoint. log4net 2.0.8 or higher configuration Log4net uses appender and layout to store and format log messages. NewRelicAppender enriches log messages with contextual information from the New Relic .NET agent if it is attached to your application. The appender passes enriched log messages to downstream appenders to handle specific use cases for log messages. For more information about logging with log4net, see the Apache log4net Getting started documentation. To configure logs in context with the log4net extension: Using the Visual Studio NuGet Package Manager, locate and install the NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Log4Net package. In your log4net configuration file, update your logging configuration to use the NewRelicAppender as the first level appender, and reference your existing appenders as its children. Also replace the layout of the appender that writes log messages to an output destination with the NewRelicLayout. The following log4net configuration example enriches log events with New Relic linking metadata. In addition to the existing log files, it outputs new log files in a specific JSON format at C:\\logs\\log4netExample.log.json for consumption by the log forwarder: <log4net> <root> <level value=\"ALL\" /> <appender-ref ref=\"NewRelicAppender\" /> </root> <appender name=\"NewRelicAppender\" type=\"NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Log4Net.NewRelicAppender, NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Log4Net\" > <threshold value=\"ALL\"/> <appender-ref ref=\"FileAppender\" /> </appender> <appender name=\"FileAppender\" type=\"log4net.Appender.FileAppender\"> <file value=\"C:\\logs\\log4netExample.log.json\" /> <param name=\"AppendToFile\" value=\"true\" /> <layout type=\"NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Log4Net.NewRelicLayout, NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Log4Net\"> </layout> </appender> </log4net> Copy After you configure the log4net extension and update your logging file, you can configure your extension to send data to New Relic. Here is an example configuration using the Fluentd plugin for New Relic Logs: <!--NewRelicLoggingExample.conf--> <source> @type tail path C:\\logs\\log4netExample.log.json pos_file C:\\logs\\log4netExample.log.json.pos tag logfile.* <parse> @type json </parse> </source> <match **> @type newrelic license_key <YOUR NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY> base_uri https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 </match> Copy Configure NLog extension You can use our NLog 4.5 or higher extension to link to your log data with related data across the rest of the New Relic platform. Nlog workflow diagram The New Relic NLog extension provides a NewRelicJsonLayout that formats a log event in the way required by the New Relic logging endpoint. Next, it adds contextual information from the .NET agent when attached to your application. Then, a target can be configured to write logging data to an output folder. The log forwarder can monitor this folder and incrementally send log information to New Relic. The following diagram illustrates the flow of log messages through NLog, highlighting specific components of the New Relic NLog extension. New Relic JSON Layout: The NewRelicJsonLayout adds contextual information from the .NET agent (using the API) to the log events generated by the application, and outputs log messages in the JSON format expected by New Relic. This contextual information, known as linking metadata, is used by New Relic to link log messages to the transactions and spans where they were created. Since the NewRelicAppender is ForwardingAppender type, it needs to be the first appender in the chain. It also requires another appender that can write to an actual output destination as its child in order to work. File Target: A FileTarget defines a file on disk where log messages are written. Adding the NewRelicJsonLayout to that target allows the output to be formatted correctly for forwarding to New Relic. Log Forwarder: The log forwarder is configured to send the log data from the FileTarget output to New Relic. The example below uses the New Relic Fluentd log forwarder, however there are many other log forwarders that can be used. For more information about logging with NLog, see the nlog-project.org documentation. Nlog 4.5 or higher configuration Use our NLog 4.5 or higher extension to link to your log data with related data across the rest of the New Relic platform. Using the Visual Studio NuGet Package Manager, locate and install the NewRelic.LogEnrichers.NLog package. In your application code, update your logging configuration to add the NewRelicJsonLayout and decide if you want to collect MappedDiagnosticsContext (MDC) or the MappedDiagnosticsLogicalContext (MDLC) data. The following configuration examples result in new JSON files that are written to disk. Some of these configuration options may be useful for managing the amount of disk space used and/or the performance of the target. archiveAboveSize maxArchiveFiles bufferSize enableArchiveFileCompression autoFlush concurrentWrites Although the NLog AsyncWrapper Target is not required, it may help improve performance by performing formatting and output of log files on a different thread. Don't collect MDC or the MDLC data (default): The following code example enriches log events with New Relic linking metadata, but not with MDC or the MDLC data. In addition to the existing log files, it outputs new log files in a specific JSON format at C:\\logs\\NLogExample.log.json for consumption by the log forwarder: var loggerConfig = new LoggingConfiguration(); var newRelicFileTarget = new FileTarget(\"NewRelicFileTarget\"); newRelicFileTarget.Layout = new NewRelicJsonLayout(); newRelicFileTarget.FileName = \"C:\\logs\\NLogExample.json\"; loggerConfig.AddTarget(newRelicFileTarget); loggerConfig.AddRuleForAllLevels(\"NewRelicFileTarget\"); LogManager.Configuration = loggerConfig; var logger = LogManager.GetLogger(\"Example\"); Copy Collect MDC or the MDLC data: If your application uses the MDC or the MDLC, you can configure the NewRelicJsonLayout to include items in those collections. The following code example adds the additional configuration to enable collecting MDC and MDLC data. As in the previous example, it outputs new log files in a specific JSON format at C:\\logs\\NLogExample.log.json for consumption by the log forwarder: var loggerConfig = new LoggingConfiguration(); var newRelicFileTarget = new FileTarget(\"NewRelicFileTarget\"); var newRelicLayout = new NewRelicJsonLayout { IncludeMdc = `true,` IncludeMdlc = `true` }; newRelicFileTarget.Layout = newRelicLayout; newRelicFileTarget.FileName = \"C:\\logs\\NLogExample.json\"; loggerConfig.AddTarget(newRelicFileTarget); loggerConfig.AddRuleForAllLevels(\"NewRelicFileTarget\"); LogManager.Configuration = loggerConfig; var logger = LogManager.GetLogger(\"Example\"); Copy Once you have configured the NLog extension and updated your logging file, you can configure your extension to send data to New Relic. Here is an example configuration using the Fluentd plugin to forward logs to New Relic: <!--NewRelicLoggingExample.conf--> <source> @type tail path C:\\logs\\NLogExample.log.json pos_file C:\\logs\\NLogExample.log.json.pos tag logfile.* <parse> @type json </parse> </source> <match **> @type newrelic license_key <YOUR NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY> base_uri https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 </match> Copy Nlog file-based configuration You can also configure the New Relic NLog extension with file-based configuration providers. The folowing example code creates a logger based on settings contained in an App.config file. Instantiating Logger using .config file var logger = LogManager.GetLogger(\"NewRelicLog\"); logger.Info(\"Hello, New Relic!\"); Copy Sample App.config file <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\" ?> <configuration> <configSections> <section name=\"nlog\" type=\"NLog.Config.ConfigSectionHandler, NLog\"/> </configSections> <startup> <supportedRuntime version=\"v4.0\" sku=\".NETFramework,Version=v4.5\" /> </startup> <nlog xmlns=\"http://www.nlog-project.org/schemas/NLog.xsd\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"> <extensions> <add assembly=\"NewRelic.LogEnrichers.NLog\" /> </extensions> <targets> <target name=\"NewRelicLogFile\" xsi:type=\"File\" fileName=\"C:/path/to/NewRelicLog.json\"> <layout xsi:type=\"newrelic-jsonlayout\"> </layout> </target> </targets> <rules> <logger name=\"NewRelicLog\" minlevel=\"Info\" writeTo=\"newRelicLogFile\" /> </rules> </nlog> </configuration> Copy Configure Serilog 2.5 or higher extension You can use our Serilog extension to link to your log data with related data across the rest of the New Relic platform. This requires: Serilog 2.5 or higher Serilog File Sinks v4.0 or higher Serilog workflow diagram Serilog is a structured logging framework that records log messages from your application and creates a LogEvent to store the message data. Using Enrichers, you can add additional information to the log events. Sinks and Formatters allow you to format and output those log events for downstream consumption and viewing. The following diagram illustrates the flow of log messages through Serilog, highlighting specific components of the New Relic Serilog extension. Many log forwarders are available. This example uses Fluentd. New Relic Enricher: The NewRelicEnricher adds contextual information from the .NET agent (using the API) to the log events generated by the application. This contextual information, called linking metadata, is used by New Relic to link log messages to the transactions and spans where they were created. New Relic Formatter: The NewRelicFormattertranslates enriched log events into the JSON format expected by New Relic. A sink instructs Serilog to output the JSON to a file in the location that the log forwarder expects. New Relic Log Forwarder: The NewRelicFormatter translates enriched log events into the JSON format expected by New Relic. A sink instructs Serilog to output the JSON to a file in the location that the log forwarder expects. For more information about Serilog log events, see the Serilog documentation on GitHub. Serilog 2.5 or higher configuration To configure logs in context with the Serilog extension: Use the Visual Studio NuGet Package Manager to locate and install the NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Serilog package. In your application code, update your logging configuration to add the NewRelicEnricher and NewRelicFormatter. The following code example enriches log events with New Relic linking metadata. In addition to the existing log files, it outputs new log files in a specific JSON format at C:\\logs\\SerilogExample.log.json for consumption by the log forwarder: var loggerConfig = new LoggerConfiguration() loggerConfig .Enrich.WithThreadName() .Enrich.WithThreadId() .Enrich.WithNewRelicLogsInContext() .WriteTo.File( path: @\"C:\\logs\\ExistingLoggingOutput.txt\") .WriteTo.File( formatter: new NewRelicFormatter(), path: @\"C:\\logs\\SerilogExample.log.json\"); var log = loggerConfig.CreateLogger(); Copy This configuration results in new JSON files that are written to disk. Some of these configuration options may be useful for managing the amount of disk space used and/or the performance of the sink. restrictedToMinimumLevel buffered rollingInterval rollOnFileSizeLimit retainedFileCountLimit Although not required, using the Serilog Asynchronous Sink Wrapper may help improve the performance by performing formatting and output of log files on a different thread. Once you have configured the Serilog extension and updated your logging file, you can configure your extension to send data to New Relic. Here is an example configuration using the Fluentd plugin to forward logs to New Relic: <!--NewRelicLoggingExample.conf--> <source> @type tail path C:\\logs\\SerilogExample.log.json pos_file C:\\logs\\SerilogExample.log.json.pos tag logfile.* <parse> @type json </parse> </source> <match **> @type newrelic license_key <YOUR NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY> base_uri https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 </match> Copy Serilog file-based configuration You can also configure the New Relic Serilog extension with file-based configuration providers.The following additional NuGet Packages are required: Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration/) Serilog.Settings.Configuration The following example code creates a logger based on settings contained in an appSettings.json file. Instantiating logger using appsettings.json var builder = new ConfigurationBuilder() .AddJsonFile(\"appsettings.json\"); var configuration = builder.Build(); var logger = new LoggerConfiguration() .ReadFrom.Configuration(configuration) .CreateLogger(); Copy Sample appsettings.json file { \"Serilog\": { \"Using\": [ \"Serilog.Sinks.Console\", \"Serilog.Sinks.File\", \"NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Serilog\" ], \"MinimumLevel\": \"Debug\", \"Enrich\": [ \"WithNewRelicLogsInContext\" ], \"WriteTo\": [ { \"Name\": \"File\", \"Args\": { \"path\": \"C:\\\\Logs\\\\SerilogExample.log.json\", \"formatter\": \"NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Serilog.NewRelicFormatter, NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Serilog\" } } ], \"Properties\": { \"Application\": \"NewRelic Logging Serilog Example\" } } } Copy The following example code creates a logger based on settings contained in a web.config file. The Serilog.Settings.AppSettings NuGet Package is required. Instantiating logger using .config file var logger = new LoggerConfiguration() .ReadFrom.AppSettings() .CreateLogger(); Copy Sample web.config file <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?> <configuration> <appSettings> <add key=\"serilog:using:NewRelic\" value=\"NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Serilog\" /> <add key=\"serilog:using:File\" value=\"Serilog.Sinks.File\" /> <!--Add other enrichers here--> <add key=\"serilog:enrich:WithNewRelicLogsInContext\" /> <add key=\"serilog:write-to:File.path\" value=\"C:\\logs\\SerilogExample.log.json\" /> <add key=\"serilog:write-to:File.formatter\" value=\"NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Serilog.NewRelicFormatter, NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Serilog\" /> </appSettings> Copy View logs in the UI To verify that you have configured the log appender correctly, run your application, then check your logs data in New Relic One using the query operator has:span.id has:trace.id. If everything is configured correctly and your data is being forwarded to New Relic with the enriched metadata, your logs should now be emitted as JSON and contain trace.id and span.id fields. If you don't see log data in the UI, follow the troubleshooting procedures. What's next?

      "body": "Logs in context for the Java agent connects your logs and APM data in New Relic. Bringing all of this data together in a single tool helps you quickly get to the root cause of an issue and find the log lines that you need to identify and resolve a problem. Set up your Java app To enable logs in context for APM apps monitored by Java: Make sure you have already set up logging in New Relic. This includes configuring a supported log forwarder that collects your application logs and extends the metadata that is forwarded to New Relic. Install or update to the latest Java agent version. Use Java agent version 5.6.0 or higher for logs in context. Enable the JVM argument -javaagent, and enable distributed tracing. Configure logs in context for Java to enrich your log data, using any of the following extensions as applicable. If you use Spring or Spring Boot and aren't sure which extension you need, see our Spring documentation. Dropwizard 1.3 or higher We offer a Dropwizard extension for logs in context with the Java agent. To get started, review the code and an example application on GitHub. To configure logs in context for your Java app with the DropWizard extension: Make sure you have the Dropwizard 1.3 or higher package installed and working on your application. Use the original Dropwizard appenders and logging factory installed and working on the application. Make sure you have the New Relic Java agent version 5.6.0 or higher installed on your application, and that you have enabled the JVM argument -javaagent. Update your project's dependencies to include the Dropwizard 1.3 extension as applicable: Gradle: Add the following to your build.gradle file: dependencies { compile(\"com.newrelic.logging:dropwizard:2.0\") } Copy Maven: Add the following to your pom.xml file: <dependencies> <dependency> <groupId>com.newrelic.logging</groupId> <artifactId>dropwizard</artifactId> <version>2.0</version> </dependency> </dependencies> Copy Update your Dropwizard .yaml configuration file with a newrelic-json layout, replacing the currently used type: console or type: file with either type: newrelic-console or type: newrelic-file as appropriate. For example: logging: appenders: - type: newrelic-console # Add the two lines below if you don't have a layout specified on the appender. # If you have a layout, remove all parameters to the layout and set the type. layout: type: newrelic-json Copy The New Relic Dropwizard extension also supports a log-format layout type that uses the standard Dropwizard logging. For testing purposes, you can change the type of the layout with a one-line change: logging: appenders: - type: newrelic-file # This format will be ignored by the newrelic-json layout, but used by the log-format layout. logFormat: \"%date{ISO8601} %c %-5p: %m trace.id=%mdc{trace.id} span.id=%mdc{span.id}%n\" layout: # type: newrelic-json type: log-format Copy java.util.logging We offer a java.util.logging extension for logs in context with the Java agent. To get started, review the code and an example application on GitHub. To configure logs in context for your Java app with with the java.util.logging extension: Make sure you have the java.util.logging package installed and working on the application. Make sure you have the New Relic Java agent version 5.6.0 or higher installed on your application, and that you have enabled the JVM argument -javaagent. Update your project's dependencies to include the java.util.logging extension as applicable. If you can't edit these files, you can instead add the jars directly to the application classpath. Gradle: Add the following to your build.gradle file: dependencies { compile(\"com.newrelic.logging:jul:2.0\") } Copy Maven: Add the following to your pom.xml file: <dependencies> <dependency> <groupId>com.newrelic.logging</groupId> <artifactId>jul</artifactId> <version>2.0</version> </dependency> </dependencies> Copy Check if your logging file's handlers property is set to something other than NewRelicMemoryHandler. Look for a line listing the root logger's handlers, like this: handlers = java.util.logging.FileHandler Copy Update your logging properties file to set the root logger's handler to NewRelicMemoryHandler so it intercepts messages destined for another handler: handlers = com.newrelic.logging.jul.NewRelicMemoryHandler Copy Configure the NewRelicMemoryHandler by setting the target to the handler that was previously assigned to the root logger, so it captures data New Relic needs on the thread the log message is coming from: com.newrelic.logging.jul.NewRelicMemoryHandler.target = java.util.logging.FileHandler Copy Use a NewRelicFormatter for the final handler. Update your logging properties file to set the formatter property like the following example. Make sure the handler where you set the formatter is the target handler from the previous step (java.util.logging.FileHandler in this example). java.util.logging.FileHandler.formatter = com.newrelic.logging.jul. NewRelicFormatter Copy The New Relic log format is JSON with telemetry metadata we use to correlate transactions and logs together. Currently we do not support any customization of that format. Once complete, JSON is logged instead of text. The JSON should be formatted as single objects, one per line, and should contain fields like log.level and thread.name. The trace.id, which is required for logs in context, should only have a value for log messages that occur within a transaction. java.util.logging classpath additions The most direct way to get the logs-in-context extensions is to add these dependencies to Maven's pom.xml or Gradle's build.gradle. This allows the packaging tools to pick up the correct dependencies. If you can't edit these files, you can instead add the jars directly to the application classpath for your logging framework's configuration. Before you modify the classpath: Enable the JVM argument -javaagent on your app's Java agent. Verify which logging framework the application is using. Make sure you are able to change your logging framework's configuration. Add the following three jars to the classpath if they aren't already present. Generally, we recommend taking the latest versions published on Maven Central. Group ID com.newrelic.logging and Artifact ID: Select the artifact named after your application's logging framework in Maven. Group ID com.fasterxml.jackson.core and Artifact ID: Use jackson-core. Group ID com.newrelic.agent.java and Artifact ID: Use newrelic-api. Log4j 1.x We offer a Log4j 1.x extension extension for logs in context with the Java agent. To get started, review the code and an example application on GitHub. To configure logs in context for your Java app with with the Log4j 1.x extension, you must configure the Log4j extension in code or via XML. Properties files are not supported because AsyncAppender instances can only be automatically configured via XML. Make sure you have the Log4j 1.x package installed and working on the application. Make sure you have the New Relic Java agent version 5.6.0 or higher installed on your application, and that you have enabled the JVM argument -javaagent. Update your project's dependencies to include the Log4j 1.x extension as applicable. Gradle: Add the following to your build.gradle file: dependencies { compile(\"com.newrelic.logging:log4j1:2.0\") } Copy Maven: Add the following to your pom.xml file: <dependencies> <dependency> <groupId>com.newrelic.logging</groupId> <artifactId>log4j1</artifactId> <version>2.0</version> </dependency> </dependencies> Copy In your logging configuration XML file, update your <appender> element with a NewRelicLayout, adding <layout class=\"com.newrelic.logging.log4j1.NewRelicLayout\"/>: <appender name=\" TypicalFile \" class=\"org.apache.log4j.FileAppender\"> <param name=\"file\" value=\"logs/log4j1-app.log\"/> <param name=\"append\" value=\"false\"/> <layout class=\" com.newrelic.logging.log4j1.NewRelicLayout \"/> <!-- only this line needs to be added --> </appender> Copy Use NewRelicAsyncAppender to wrap any appenders that will target New Relic's log forwarder. For example: <appender name=\" NewRelicFile \" class=\"com.newrelic.logging.log4j1.NewRelicAsyncAppender\"> <appender-ref ref=\" TypicalFile \" /> </appender> Copy Use the async appender on the root logger. For example: <root> <appender-ref ref=\" NewRelicFile \" /> </root> Copy Example configuration file for the Log4j 1.x extension: <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\" ?> <!DOCTYPE log4j:configuration SYSTEM \"log4j.dtd\"> <log4j:configuration debug=\"false\"> <appender name=\"TypicalFile\" class=\"org.apache.log4j.FileAppender\"> <param name=\"file\" value=\"logs/log4j1-app.log\"/> <param name=\"append\" value=\"false\"/> <!-- layout has been replaced --> <layout class=\"com.newrelic.logging.log4j1.NewRelicLayout\"/> </appender> <!-- this appender was added --> <appender name=\"NewRelicFile\" class=\"com.newrelic.logging.log4j1.NewRelicAsyncAppender\"> <appender-ref ref=\"TypicalFile\" /> </appender> <appender name=\"TypicalConsole\" class=\"org.apache.log4j.ConsoleAppender\"> <layout class=\"org.apache.log4j.PatternLayout\"> <param name=\"ConversionPattern\" value=\"%-5p %c{1} - %m%n\"/> </layout> </appender> <root> ​ <!-- the new appender was used here -->​​ <appender-ref ref=\"NewRelicFile\" /> <appender-ref ref=\"TypicalConsole\" /> </root> </log4j:configuration> Copy Log4j 2.x We offer a Log4j 2.x extension for logs in context with the Java agent. To get started, review the code and an example application on GitHub. To configure logs in context for your Java app with with the Log4j 2.x extension: Make sure you have the Log4j 2.x or Logs4j 2 binding package installed and working on your application. Make sure you have the New Relic Java agent version 5.6.0 or higher installed on your application, and that you have enabled the JVM argument -javaagent. Update your project's dependencies to include the Log4j 2.x extension as applicable: Gradle: Add the highlighted section to your build.gradle file: dependencies { compile(\"com.newrelic.logging:log4j2:2.0\") } Copy Maven: Add the highlighted section to your pom.xml file: <dependencies> <dependency> <groupId>com.newrelic.logging</groupId> <artifactId>log4j2</artifactId> <version>2.0</version> </dependency> </dependencies> Copy In your logging configuration XML file, update your <configuration> element by adding the highlighted section: <Configuration xmlns=\"http://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.0/config\" packages=\"com.newrelic.logging.log4j2\" > Copy If you're using a properties file, add packages=com.newrelic.logging.log4j2. Add <NewRelicLayout/> to use a NewRelicLayout element within one of the appenders. For example: <File name=\"MyFile\" fileName=\"logs/app-log-file.log\"> <NewRelicLayout/> </File> Copy If you're using a properties file, only change the layout.type: appender.console.type = Console appender.console.name = STDOUT appender.console.layout.type = NewRelicLayout Copy If you only modified an existing appender, skip this step. If you added a new appender, add <AppenderRef/> within <Root> to use this appender. Use the ref attribute to refer to appender name you created in the previous step. For example: <Root level=\"info\"> <AppenderRef ref=\"MyFile\"/> </Root> Copy If you're using a properties file and added a new appender, add: rootLogger.level = info rootLogger.appenderRef.stdout.ref = STDOUT ​​​​​ Copy Logback version 1.2.0 or higher We offer a Logback extension for logs in context with the Java agent. To get started, review the code and an example application on GitHub. To configure logs in context for your Java app with Logback: Make sure you have Logback version 1.2.0 or higher and the New Relic Java agent version 5.6.0 or higher installed and working on your application. Make sure you have the New Relic Java agent version 5.6.0 or higher installed on your application, and that you have enabled the JVM argument -javaagent. Update your project's dependencies to include the Logback extension as applicable: Gradle: Add the highlighted section to your build.gradle file: dependencies { compile(\"com.newrelic.logging:logback:2.0\") } Copy Maven: Add the highlighted section to your pom.xml file: <dependencies> <dependency> <groupId>com.newrelic.logging</groupId> <artifactId>logback</artifactId> <version>2.0</version> </dependency> </dependencies> Copy Update your logging configuration xml to replace any existing <encoder> element. If you're logging to the console (stdout/stderr), look for ConsoleAppender and replace: <appender name=\"STDOUT\" class=\"ch.qos.logback.core.ConsoleAppender\"> <encoder class=\"com.newrelic.logging.logback.NewRelicEncoder\"/> </appender> Copy If you're logging to a file, look for FileAppender and replace <encoder>: <appender name=\"LOG_FILE\" class=\"ch.qos.logback.core.FileAppender\"> <file>logs/app-log-file.log</file> <encoder class=\"com.newrelic.logging.logback.NewRelicEncoder\"/> </appender> Copy Update your logging configuration xml with the NewRelicAsyncAppender. To ensure that NewRelicAsyncAppender wraps any appenders that will target New Relic's log forwarder, add the following section. Change \"LOG_FILE\" to the name of the appender you updated in the previous step. <appender name=\"ASYNC\" class=\"com.newrelic.logging.logback.NewRelicAsyncAppender\"> <appender-ref ref=\"LOG_FILE\" /> </appender> Copy Make sure NewRelicAsyncAppender is the first appender used in your logger. Replace your root logger’s appenders with the ASYNC appender created in the previous step. Then list any other appenders after the NewRelicAsyncAppender in the <root> list. <root> <appender-ref ref=\"ASYNC\" /> </root> Copy Here are examples of an updated logging .xml file for the Logback extension. You can also see a working example in GitHub. Single console appender example Example configuration file after adding in the logging extension information: <configuration> <appender name=\"STDOUT\" class=\"ch.qos.logback.core.ConsoleAppender\"> <!-- changed the encoder --> <encoder class=\"com.newrelic.logging.logback.NewRelicEncoder\"/> </appender> <!-- added the ASYNC appender --> <appender name=\"ASYNC\" class=\"com.newrelic.logging.logback.NewRelicAsyncAppender\"> <appender-ref ref=\"STDOUT\" /> </appender> <root level=\"debug\"> <!-- changed the root logger --> <appender-ref ref=\"ASYNC\" /> </root> </configuration> Copy Two console appenders example This example sends New Relic logging to a file, but still sends standard logging to the console: <configuration> <appender name=\"FILE\" class=\"ch.qos.logback.core.FileAppender\"> <file>myApp.log</file> <!-- encoder changed --> <encoder class=\"com.newrelic.logging.logback.NewRelicEncoder\"/> </appender> <!-- this appender does normal console logging --> <appender name=\"STDOUT\" class=\"ch.qos.logback.core.ConsoleAppender\"> <encoder> <pattern>%msg%n</pattern> </encoder> </appender> <!-- The required New Relic ASYNC appender wraps the FILE appender --> <appender name=\"ASYNC\" class=\"com.newrelic.logging.logback.NewRelicAsyncAppender\"> <appender-ref ref=\"FILE\" /> </appender> <root level=\"debug\"> <!-- ASYNC is one of the main appenders --> <appender-ref ref=\"ASYNC\" /> <!-- Send every message to normal console logging, as well. --> <appender-ref ref=\"STDOUT\" /> </root> </configuration> Copy Spring and Springboot We offer extensions for current versions of Spring and Spring Boot. If you already know the logging library, you can skip directly to that documentation: java.util.logging log4j 1 log4j 2 logback The extensions support default configurations only on Spring Boot 2.0 and higher. With Spring Boot: Here are tips to determine which logging library you have: If you have spring-boot-starter-log4j2 in your dependencies, you're using log4j 2.x. Refer to the Spring Boot log4j 2.x documentation for basic configuration, and the New Relic log4j 2 extension for customizing your configuration. If you're using Spring Boot but not the starter-log4j2, you're using logback by default. Refer to Spring Boot logback documentation for basic configuration, and the New Relic logback extension for customizing your configuration. With Spring (but not Spring Boot): Spring 5 or higher: Spring implements a bridge to other logging libraries that will automatically find them. However, those individual libraries must be configured and explicitly included in your project dependencies. To identify your logging dependency, consult your Gradle, Maven, or other build tool's dependency tree. Then follow the procedures to configure logs in context for your Java app with that extension. Spring 4 or lower: Spring version 4 and lower uses Apache Commons Logging for its bridge. Refer to the Spring documentation for information on configuring its bridge. View logs in UI To verify that you have configured the log appender correctly, run your application, then check your logs data in New Relic One using the query operator has:span.id has:trace.id. If everything is configured correctly and your data is being forwarded to New Relic with the enriched metadata, your logs should now be emitted as JSON and contain trace.id and span.id fields. If you don't see log data in the UI, follow the troubleshooting procedures. What's next? After you set up APM logs in context, make the most of your logging data: Explore the logging data across your platform with our Logs UI. See your logs in context of your app's performance in the APM UI. Troubleshoot errors with distributed tracing, stack traces, application logs, and more. Get deeper visibility into both your application and your platform performance data by forwarding your logs with our infrastructure monitoring agent. Review your infrastructure logs in the UI.

Bringing all of this data together in a single tool helps you quickly get to the root cause of an issue and find the log lines that you need to identify and resolve a problem. Set up your .NET app To enable logs in context for APM apps monitored by .NET: Make sure you have already set up logging in New Relic. This includes configuring a supported log forwarder that collects your application logs and extends the metadata that is forwarded to New Relic. Install or update to the latest .NET agent version, and enable distributed tracing. Use .NET agent version 8.21 or higher and the New Relic .NET agent API version 8.21 or higher for logs in context. Install or update to Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5 or higher or .NET Core 2.0 or higher. Install and configure any of the following logging extensions to enrich your log data. Configure log4net extension You can use the Apache log4net version 2.0.8 or higher extension to link your log data with related data across the rest of the New Relic platform. log4net workflow diagram The following diagram illustrates the flow of log messages through Apache log4net, highlighting specific components of the New Relic log4net extension. Many log forwarders are available. This example uses Fluentd. Appender: The NewRelicAppender adds contextual information from the .NET agent (using the API) to the log events generated by the application. This contextual information, known as linking metadata, is used by New Relic to link log messages to the transactions and spans from which they were created. This appender will pass the enriched log events to downstream appenders for further processing. Since the NewRelicAppender is ForwardingAppender type, it needs to be the first appender in the chain. It also requires another appender that can write to an actual output destination as its child in order to work. Layout: The NewRelicLayout formats the enriched log events into the JSON format expected by New Relic. The appender, which this layout is assigned to, instructs log4net to output the JSON to a file in the location that the log forwarder expects. Log Forwarder: The log forwarder monitors an output folder and incrementally sends New Relic formatted log information to the New Relic logging endpoint. log4net 2.0.8 or higher configuration Log4net uses appender and layout to store and format log messages. NewRelicAppender enriches log messages with contextual information from the New Relic .NET agent if it is attached to your application. The appender passes enriched log messages to downstream appenders to handle specific use cases for log messages. For more information about logging with log4net, see the Apache log4net Getting started documentation. To configure logs in context with the log4net extension: Using the Visual Studio NuGet Package Manager, locate and install the NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Log4Net package. In your log4net configuration file, update your logging configuration to use the NewRelicAppender as the first level appender, and reference your existing appenders as its children. Also replace the layout of the appender that writes log messages to an output destination with the NewRelicLayout. The following log4net configuration example enriches log events with New Relic linking metadata. In addition to the existing log files, it outputs new log files in a specific JSON format at C:\\logs\\log4netExample.log.json for consumption by the log forwarder: <log4net> <root> <level value=\"ALL\" /> <appender-ref ref=\"NewRelicAppender\" /> </root> <appender name=\"NewRelicAppender\" type=\"NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Log4Net.NewRelicAppender, NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Log4Net\" > <threshold value=\"ALL\"/> <appender-ref ref=\"FileAppender\" /> </appender> <appender name=\"FileAppender\" type=\"log4net.Appender.FileAppender\"> <file value=\"C:\\logs\\log4netExample.log.json\" /> <param name=\"AppendToFile\" value=\"true\" /> <layout type=\"NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Log4Net.NewRelicLayout, NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Log4Net\"> </layout> </appender> </log4net> Copy After you configure the log4net extension and update your logging file, you can configure your extension to send data to New Relic. Here is an example configuration using the Fluentd plugin for New Relic Logs: <!--NewRelicLoggingExample.conf--> <source> @type tail path C:\\logs\\log4netExample.log.json pos_file C:\\logs\\log4netExample.log.json.pos tag logfile.* <parse> @type json </parse> </source> <match **> @type newrelic license_key <YOUR NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY> base_uri https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 </match> Copy Configure NLog extension You can use our NLog 4.5 or higher extension to link to your log data with related data across the rest of the New Relic platform. Nlog workflow diagram The New Relic NLog extension provides a NewRelicJsonLayout that formats a log event in the way required by the New Relic logging endpoint. Next, it adds contextual information from the .NET agent when attached to your application. Then, a target can be configured to write logging data to an output folder. The log forwarder can monitor this folder and incrementally send log information to New Relic. The following diagram illustrates the flow of log messages through NLog, highlighting specific components of the New Relic NLog extension. New Relic JSON Layout: The NewRelicJsonLayout adds contextual information from the .NET agent (using the API) to the log events generated by the application, and outputs log messages in the JSON format expected by New Relic. This contextual information, known as linking metadata, is used by New Relic to link log messages to the transactions and spans where they were created. Since the NewRelicAppender is ForwardingAppender type, it needs to be the first appender in the chain. It also requires another appender that can write to an actual output destination as its child in order to work. File Target: A FileTarget defines a file on disk where log messages are written. Adding the NewRelicJsonLayout to that target allows the output to be formatted correctly for forwarding to New Relic. Log Forwarder: The log forwarder is configured to send the log data from the FileTarget output to New Relic. The example below uses the New Relic Fluentd log forwarder, however there are many other log forwarders that can be used. For more information about logging with NLog, see the nlog-project.org documentation. Nlog 4.5 or higher configuration Use our NLog 4.5 or higher extension to link to your log data with related data across the rest of the New Relic platform. Using the Visual Studio NuGet Package Manager, locate and install the NewRelic.LogEnrichers.NLog package. In your application code, update your logging configuration to add the NewRelicJsonLayout and decide if you want to collect MappedDiagnosticsContext (MDC) or the MappedDiagnosticsLogicalContext (MDLC) data. The following configuration examples result in new JSON files that are written to disk. Some of these configuration options may be useful for managing the amount of disk space used and/or the performance of the target. archiveAboveSize maxArchiveFiles bufferSize enableArchiveFileCompression autoFlush concurrentWrites Although the NLog AsyncWrapper Target is not required, it may help improve performance by performing formatting and output of log files on a different thread. Don't collect MDC or the MDLC data (default): The following code example enriches log events with New Relic linking metadata, but not with MDC or the MDLC data. In addition to the existing log files, it outputs new log files in a specific JSON format at C:\\logs\\NLogExample.log.json for consumption by the log forwarder: var loggerConfig = new LoggingConfiguration(); var newRelicFileTarget = new FileTarget(\"NewRelicFileTarget\"); newRelicFileTarget.Layout = new NewRelicJsonLayout(); newRelicFileTarget.FileName = \"C:\\logs\\NLogExample.json\"; loggerConfig.AddTarget(newRelicFileTarget); loggerConfig.AddRuleForAllLevels(\"NewRelicFileTarget\"); LogManager.Configuration = loggerConfig; var logger = LogManager.GetLogger(\"Example\"); Copy Collect MDC or the MDLC data: If your application uses the MDC or the MDLC, you can configure the NewRelicJsonLayout to include items in those collections. The following code example adds the additional configuration to enable collecting MDC and MDLC data. As in the previous example, it outputs new log files in a specific JSON format at C:\\logs\\NLogExample.log.json for consumption by the log forwarder: var loggerConfig = new LoggingConfiguration(); var newRelicFileTarget = new FileTarget(\"NewRelicFileTarget\"); var newRelicLayout = new NewRelicJsonLayout { IncludeMdc = `true,` IncludeMdlc = `true` }; newRelicFileTarget.Layout = newRelicLayout; newRelicFileTarget.FileName = \"C:\\logs\\NLogExample.json\"; loggerConfig.AddTarget(newRelicFileTarget); loggerConfig.AddRuleForAllLevels(\"NewRelicFileTarget\"); LogManager.Configuration = loggerConfig; var logger = LogManager.GetLogger(\"Example\"); Copy Once you have configured the NLog extension and updated your logging file, you can configure your extension to send data to New Relic. Here is an example configuration using the Fluentd plugin to forward logs to New Relic: <!--NewRelicLoggingExample.conf--> <source> @type tail path C:\\logs\\NLogExample.log.json pos_file C:\\logs\\NLogExample.log.json.pos tag logfile.* <parse> @type json </parse> </source> <match **> @type newrelic license_key <YOUR NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY> base_uri https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 </match> Copy Nlog file-based configuration You can also configure the New Relic NLog extension with file-based configuration providers. The folowing example code creates a logger based on settings contained in an App.config file. Instantiating Logger using .config file var logger = LogManager.GetLogger(\"NewRelicLog\"); logger.Info(\"Hello, New Relic!\"); Copy Sample App.config file <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\" ?> <configuration> <configSections> <section name=\"nlog\" type=\"NLog.Config.ConfigSectionHandler, NLog\"/> </configSections> <startup> <supportedRuntime version=\"v4.0\" sku=\".NETFramework,Version=v4.5\" /> </startup> <nlog xmlns=\"http://www.nlog-project.org/schemas/NLog.xsd\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"> <extensions> <add assembly=\"NewRelic.LogEnrichers.NLog\" /> </extensions> <targets> <target name=\"NewRelicLogFile\" xsi:type=\"File\" fileName=\"C:/path/to/NewRelicLog.json\"> <layout xsi:type=\"newrelic-jsonlayout\"> </layout> </target> </targets> <rules> <logger name=\"NewRelicLog\" minlevel=\"Info\" writeTo=\"newRelicLogFile\" /> </rules> </nlog> </configuration> Copy Configure Serilog 2.5 or higher extension You can use our Serilog extension to link to your log data with related data across the rest of the New Relic platform. This requires: Serilog 2.5 or higher Serilog File Sinks v4.0 or higher Serilog workflow diagram Serilog is a structured logging framework that records log messages from your application and creates a LogEvent to store the message data. Using Enrichers, you can add additional information to the log events. Sinks and Formatters allow you to format and output those log events for downstream consumption and viewing. The following diagram illustrates the flow of log messages through Serilog, highlighting specific components of the New Relic Serilog extension. Many log forwarders are available. This example uses Fluentd. New Relic Enricher: The NewRelicEnricher adds contextual information from the .NET agent (using the API) to the log events generated by the application. This contextual information, called linking metadata, is used by New Relic to link log messages to the transactions and spans where they were created. New Relic Formatter: The NewRelicFormattertranslates enriched log events into the JSON format expected by New Relic. A sink instructs Serilog to output the JSON to a file in the location that the log forwarder expects. New Relic Log Forwarder: The NewRelicFormatter translates enriched log events into the JSON format expected by New Relic. A sink instructs Serilog to output the JSON to a file in the location that the log forwarder expects. For more information about Serilog log events, see the Serilog documentation on GitHub. Serilog 2.5 or higher configuration To configure logs in context with the Serilog extension: Use the Visual Studio NuGet Package Manager to locate and install the NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Serilog package. In your application code, update your logging configuration to add the NewRelicEnricher and NewRelicFormatter. The following code example enriches log events with New Relic linking metadata. In addition to the existing log files, it outputs new log files in a specific JSON format at C:\\logs\\SerilogExample.log.json for consumption by the log forwarder: var loggerConfig = new LoggerConfiguration() loggerConfig .Enrich.WithThreadName() .Enrich.WithThreadId() .Enrich.WithNewRelicLogsInContext() .WriteTo.File( path: @\"C:\\logs\\ExistingLoggingOutput.txt\") .WriteTo.File( formatter: new NewRelicFormatter(), path: @\"C:\\logs\\SerilogExample.log.json\"); var log = loggerConfig.CreateLogger(); Copy This configuration results in new JSON files that are written to disk. Some of these configuration options may be useful for managing the amount of disk space used and/or the performance of the sink. restrictedToMinimumLevel buffered rollingInterval rollOnFileSizeLimit retainedFileCountLimit Although not required, using the Serilog Asynchronous Sink Wrapper may help improve the performance by performing formatting and output of log files on a different thread. Once you have configured the Serilog extension and updated your logging file, you can configure your extension to send data to New Relic. Here is an example configuration using the Fluentd plugin to forward logs to New Relic: <!--NewRelicLoggingExample.conf--> <source> @type tail path C:\\logs\\SerilogExample.log.json pos_file C:\\logs\\SerilogExample.log.json.pos tag logfile.* <parse> @type json </parse> </source> <match **> @type newrelic license_key <YOUR NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY> base_uri https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 </match> Copy Serilog file-based configuration You can also configure the New Relic Serilog extension with file-based configuration providers.The following additional NuGet Packages are required: Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration/) Serilog.Settings.Configuration The following example code creates a logger based on settings contained in an appSettings.json file. Instantiating logger using appsettings.json var builder = new ConfigurationBuilder() .AddJsonFile(\"appsettings.json\"); var configuration = builder.Build(); var logger = new LoggerConfiguration() .ReadFrom.Configuration(configuration) .CreateLogger(); Copy Sample appsettings.json file { \"Serilog\": { \"Using\": [ \"Serilog.Sinks.Console\", \"Serilog.Sinks.File\", \"NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Serilog\" ], \"MinimumLevel\": \"Debug\", \"Enrich\": [ \"WithNewRelicLogsInContext\" ], \"WriteTo\": [ { \"Name\": \"File\", \"Args\": { \"path\": \"C:\\\\Logs\\\\SerilogExample.log.json\", \"formatter\": \"NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Serilog.NewRelicFormatter, NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Serilog\" } } ], \"Properties\": { \"Application\": \"NewRelic Logging Serilog Example\" } } } Copy The following example code creates a logger based on settings contained in a web.config file. The Serilog.Settings.AppSettings NuGet Package is required. Instantiating logger using .config file var logger = new LoggerConfiguration() .ReadFrom.AppSettings() .CreateLogger(); Copy Sample web.config file <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?> <configuration> <appSettings> <add key=\"serilog:using:NewRelic\" value=\"NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Serilog\" /> <add key=\"serilog:using:File\" value=\"Serilog.Sinks.File\" /> <!--Add other enrichers here--> <add key=\"serilog:enrich:WithNewRelicLogsInContext\" /> <add key=\"serilog:write-to:File.path\" value=\"C:\\logs\\SerilogExample.log.json\" /> <add key=\"serilog:write-to:File.formatter\" value=\"NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Serilog.NewRelicFormatter, NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Serilog\" /> </appSettings> Copy View logs in the UI To verify that you have configured the log appender correctly, run your application, then check your logs data in New Relic One using the query operator has:span.id has:trace.id. If everything is configured correctly and your data is being forwarded to New Relic with the enriched metadata, your logs should now be emitted as JSON and contain trace.id and span.id fields. If you don't see log data in the UI, follow the troubleshooting procedures. What's next?

      "body": "When you need to correlate log data with other telemetry data, enable logs in context in New Relic. Logs in context adds metadata that links your logs with related APM data, like errors or distributed traces, or your platform performance data from infrastructure monitoring in New Relic One. See the root cause of issues across your platform By bringing all of your application and infrastructure data together in a single solution, you can get to the root cause of issues faster. Logs in context help you quickly see meaningful patterns and trends. The following diagram shows the lifecycle of a log message, from enrichment with agent metadata (contextual logging), to formatting and forwarding the log data to New Relic: This diagram illustrates the flow of log messages through New Relic. Don't spend extra time trying to narrow down all your logs from different parts of your platform. Instead, enable logs in context to see the exact log lines you need to identify and resolve a problem. Basic process to enable logs in context The process to enable logs in context is basically the same, regardless of which APM agent you use to monitor your application: Make sure you have already set up logging in New Relic. This includes configuring a supported log forwarder that collects your application logs and extends the metadata that is forwarded to New Relic. Update to a supported APM agent version for your app, and enable distributed tracing. Configure logs in context for your APM agent or for your infrastructure monitoring agent. View your logs within the context of your apps or infrastructure in New Relic One. The main differences in this procedure are which log appenders you can use to extend and enrich your log data, and how to configure the log appender you select for your APM agent. For detailed information, see the logs-in-context procedures for: C SDK Go Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby Infrastructure monitoring agent API and other options If our logging solutions don't meet your needs, you can use other options to send your log data to New Relic: Logging extensions via agent API calls HTTP endpoint via our Log API Syslog protocols via TCP endpoint (useful for CDNs, hardware devices, or managed services) What's next?

      "body": "Logs in context for the Java agent connects your logs and APM data in New Relic. Bringing all of this data together in a single tool helps you quickly get to the root cause of an issue and find the log lines that you need to identify and resolve a problem. Set up your Java app To enable logs in context for APM apps monitored by Java: Make sure you have already set up logging in New Relic. This includes configuring a supported log forwarder that collects your application logs and extends the metadata that is forwarded to New Relic. Install or update to the latest Java agent version. Use Java agent version 5.6.0 or higher for logs in context. Enable the JVM argument -javaagent, and enable distributed tracing. Configure logs in context for Java to enrich your log data, using any of the following extensions as applicable. If you use Spring or Spring Boot and aren't sure which extension you need, see our Spring documentation. Dropwizard 1.3 or higher We offer a Dropwizard extension for logs in context with the Java agent. To get started, review the code and an example application on GitHub. To configure logs in context for your Java app with the DropWizard extension: Make sure you have the Dropwizard 1.3 or higher package installed and working on your application. Use the original Dropwizard appenders and logging factory installed and working on the application. Make sure you have the New Relic Java agent version 5.6.0 or higher installed on your application, and that you have enabled the JVM argument -javaagent. Update your project's dependencies to include the Dropwizard 1.3 extension as applicable: Gradle: Add the following to your build.gradle file: dependencies { compile(\"com.newrelic.logging:dropwizard:2.0\") } Copy Maven: Add the following to your pom.xml file: <dependencies> <dependency> <groupId>com.newrelic.logging</groupId> <artifactId>dropwizard</artifactId> <version>2.0</version> </dependency> </dependencies> Copy Update your Dropwizard .yaml configuration file with a newrelic-json layout, replacing the currently used type: console or type: file with either type: newrelic-console or type: newrelic-file as appropriate. For example: logging: appenders: - type: newrelic-console # Add the two lines below if you don't have a layout specified on the appender. # If you have a layout, remove all parameters to the layout and set the type. layout: type: newrelic-json Copy The New Relic Dropwizard extension also supports a log-format layout type that uses the standard Dropwizard logging. For testing purposes, you can change the type of the layout with a one-line change: logging: appenders: - type: newrelic-file # This format will be ignored by the newrelic-json layout, but used by the log-format layout. logFormat: \"%date{ISO8601} %c %-5p: %m trace.id=%mdc{trace.id} span.id=%mdc{span.id}%n\" layout: # type: newrelic-json type: log-format Copy java.util.logging We offer a java.util.logging extension for logs in context with the Java agent. To get started, review the code and an example application on GitHub. To configure logs in context for your Java app with with the java.util.logging extension: Make sure you have the java.util.logging package installed and working on the application. Make sure you have the New Relic Java agent version 5.6.0 or higher installed on your application, and that you have enabled the JVM argument -javaagent. Update your project's dependencies to include the java.util.logging extension as applicable. If you can't edit these files, you can instead add the jars directly to the application classpath. Gradle: Add the following to your build.gradle file: dependencies { compile(\"com.newrelic.logging:jul:2.0\") } Copy Maven: Add the following to your pom.xml file: <dependencies> <dependency> <groupId>com.newrelic.logging</groupId> <artifactId>jul</artifactId> <version>2.0</version> </dependency> </dependencies> Copy Check if your logging file's handlers property is set to something other than NewRelicMemoryHandler. Look for a line listing the root logger's handlers, like this: handlers = java.util.logging.FileHandler Copy Update your logging properties file to set the root logger's handler to NewRelicMemoryHandler so it intercepts messages destined for another handler: handlers = com.newrelic.logging.jul.NewRelicMemoryHandler Copy Configure the NewRelicMemoryHandler by setting the target to the handler that was previously assigned to the root logger, so it captures data New Relic needs on the thread the log message is coming from: com.newrelic.logging.jul.NewRelicMemoryHandler.target = java.util.logging.FileHandler Copy Use a NewRelicFormatter for the final handler. Update your logging properties file to set the formatter property like the following example. Make sure the handler where you set the formatter is the target handler from the previous step (java.util.logging.FileHandler in this example). java.util.logging.FileHandler.formatter = com.newrelic.logging.jul. NewRelicFormatter Copy The New Relic log format is JSON with telemetry metadata we use to correlate transactions and logs together. Currently we do not support any customization of that format. Once complete, JSON is logged instead of text. The JSON should be formatted as single objects, one per line, and should contain fields like log.level and thread.name. The trace.id, which is required for logs in context, should only have a value for log messages that occur within a transaction. java.util.logging classpath additions The most direct way to get the logs-in-context extensions is to add these dependencies to Maven's pom.xml or Gradle's build.gradle. This allows the packaging tools to pick up the correct dependencies. If you can't edit these files, you can instead add the jars directly to the application classpath for your logging framework's configuration. Before you modify the classpath: Enable the JVM argument -javaagent on your app's Java agent. Verify which logging framework the application is using. Make sure you are able to change your logging framework's configuration. Add the following three jars to the classpath if they aren't already present. Generally, we recommend taking the latest versions published on Maven Central. Group ID com.newrelic.logging and Artifact ID: Select the artifact named after your application's logging framework in Maven. Group ID com.fasterxml.jackson.core and Artifact ID: Use jackson-core. Group ID com.newrelic.agent.java and Artifact ID: Use newrelic-api. Log4j 1.x We offer a Log4j 1.x extension extension for logs in context with the Java agent. To get started, review the code and an example application on GitHub. To configure logs in context for your Java app with with the Log4j 1.x extension, you must configure the Log4j extension in code or via XML. Properties files are not supported because AsyncAppender instances can only be automatically configured via XML. Make sure you have the Log4j 1.x package installed and working on the application. Make sure you have the New Relic Java agent version 5.6.0 or higher installed on your application, and that you have enabled the JVM argument -javaagent. Update your project's dependencies to include the Log4j 1.x extension as applicable. Gradle: Add the following to your build.gradle file: dependencies { compile(\"com.newrelic.logging:log4j1:2.0\") } Copy Maven: Add the following to your pom.xml file: <dependencies> <dependency> <groupId>com.newrelic.logging</groupId> <artifactId>log4j1</artifactId> <version>2.0</version> </dependency> </dependencies> Copy In your logging configuration XML file, update your <appender> element with a NewRelicLayout, adding <layout class=\"com.newrelic.logging.log4j1.NewRelicLayout\"/>: <appender name=\" TypicalFile \" class=\"org.apache.log4j.FileAppender\"> <param name=\"file\" value=\"logs/log4j1-app.log\"/> <param name=\"append\" value=\"false\"/> <layout class=\" com.newrelic.logging.log4j1.NewRelicLayout \"/> <!-- only this line needs to be added --> </appender> Copy Use NewRelicAsyncAppender to wrap any appenders that will target New Relic's log forwarder. For example: <appender name=\" NewRelicFile \" class=\"com.newrelic.logging.log4j1.NewRelicAsyncAppender\"> <appender-ref ref=\" TypicalFile \" /> </appender> Copy Use the async appender on the root logger. For example: <root> <appender-ref ref=\" NewRelicFile \" /> </root> Copy Example configuration file for the Log4j 1.x extension: <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\" ?> <!DOCTYPE log4j:configuration SYSTEM \"log4j.dtd\"> <log4j:configuration debug=\"false\"> <appender name=\"TypicalFile\" class=\"org.apache.log4j.FileAppender\"> <param name=\"file\" value=\"logs/log4j1-app.log\"/> <param name=\"append\" value=\"false\"/> <!-- layout has been replaced --> <layout class=\"com.newrelic.logging.log4j1.NewRelicLayout\"/> </appender> <!-- this appender was added --> <appender name=\"NewRelicFile\" class=\"com.newrelic.logging.log4j1.NewRelicAsyncAppender\"> <appender-ref ref=\"TypicalFile\" /> </appender> <appender name=\"TypicalConsole\" class=\"org.apache.log4j.ConsoleAppender\"> <layout class=\"org.apache.log4j.PatternLayout\"> <param name=\"ConversionPattern\" value=\"%-5p %c{1} - %m%n\"/> </layout> </appender> <root> ​ <!-- the new appender was used here -->​​ <appender-ref ref=\"NewRelicFile\" /> <appender-ref ref=\"TypicalConsole\" /> </root> </log4j:configuration> Copy Log4j 2.x We offer a Log4j 2.x extension for logs in context with the Java agent. To get started, review the code and an example application on GitHub. To configure logs in context for your Java app with with the Log4j 2.x extension: Make sure you have the Log4j 2.x or Logs4j 2 binding package installed and working on your application. Make sure you have the New Relic Java agent version 5.6.0 or higher installed on your application, and that you have enabled the JVM argument -javaagent. Update your project's dependencies to include the Log4j 2.x extension as applicable: Gradle: Add the highlighted section to your build.gradle file: dependencies { compile(\"com.newrelic.logging:log4j2:2.0\") } Copy Maven: Add the highlighted section to your pom.xml file: <dependencies> <dependency> <groupId>com.newrelic.logging</groupId> <artifactId>log4j2</artifactId> <version>2.0</version> </dependency> </dependencies> Copy In your logging configuration XML file, update your <configuration> element by adding the highlighted section: <Configuration xmlns=\"http://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.0/config\" packages=\"com.newrelic.logging.log4j2\" > Copy If you're using a properties file, add packages=com.newrelic.logging.log4j2. Add <NewRelicLayout/> to use a NewRelicLayout element within one of the appenders. For example: <File name=\"MyFile\" fileName=\"logs/app-log-file.log\"> <NewRelicLayout/> </File> Copy If you're using a properties file, only change the layout.type: appender.console.type = Console appender.console.name = STDOUT appender.console.layout.type = NewRelicLayout Copy If you only modified an existing appender, skip this step. If you added a new appender, add <AppenderRef/> within <Root> to use this appender. Use the ref attribute to refer to appender name you created in the previous step. For example: <Root level=\"info\"> <AppenderRef ref=\"MyFile\"/> </Root> Copy If you're using a properties file and added a new appender, add: rootLogger.level = info rootLogger.appenderRef.stdout.ref = STDOUT ​​​​​ Copy Logback version 1.2.0 or higher We offer a Logback extension for logs in context with the Java agent. To get started, review the code and an example application on GitHub. To configure logs in context for your Java app with Logback: Make sure you have Logback version 1.2.0 or higher and the New Relic Java agent version 5.6.0 or higher installed and working on your application. Make sure you have the New Relic Java agent version 5.6.0 or higher installed on your application, and that you have enabled the JVM argument -javaagent. Update your project's dependencies to include the Logback extension as applicable: Gradle: Add the highlighted section to your build.gradle file: dependencies { compile(\"com.newrelic.logging:logback:2.0\") } Copy Maven: Add the highlighted section to your pom.xml file: <dependencies> <dependency> <groupId>com.newrelic.logging</groupId> <artifactId>logback</artifactId> <version>2.0</version> </dependency> </dependencies> Copy Update your logging configuration xml to replace any existing <encoder> element. If you're logging to the console (stdout/stderr), look for ConsoleAppender and replace: <appender name=\"STDOUT\" class=\"ch.qos.logback.core.ConsoleAppender\"> <encoder class=\"com.newrelic.logging.logback.NewRelicEncoder\"/> </appender> Copy If you're logging to a file, look for FileAppender and replace <encoder>: <appender name=\"LOG_FILE\" class=\"ch.qos.logback.core.FileAppender\"> <file>logs/app-log-file.log</file> <encoder class=\"com.newrelic.logging.logback.NewRelicEncoder\"/> </appender> Copy Update your logging configuration xml with the NewRelicAsyncAppender. To ensure that NewRelicAsyncAppender wraps any appenders that will target New Relic's log forwarder, add the following section. Change \"LOG_FILE\" to the name of the appender you updated in the previous step. <appender name=\"ASYNC\" class=\"com.newrelic.logging.logback.NewRelicAsyncAppender\"> <appender-ref ref=\"LOG_FILE\" /> </appender> Copy Make sure NewRelicAsyncAppender is the first appender used in your logger. Replace your root logger’s appenders with the ASYNC appender created in the previous step. Then list any other appenders after the NewRelicAsyncAppender in the <root> list. <root> <appender-ref ref=\"ASYNC\" /> </root> Copy Here are examples of an updated logging .xml file for the Logback extension. You can also see a working example in GitHub. Single console appender example Example configuration file after adding in the logging extension information: <configuration> <appender name=\"STDOUT\" class=\"ch.qos.logback.core.ConsoleAppender\"> <!-- changed the encoder --> <encoder class=\"com.newrelic.logging.logback.NewRelicEncoder\"/> </appender> <!-- added the ASYNC appender --> <appender name=\"ASYNC\" class=\"com.newrelic.logging.logback.NewRelicAsyncAppender\"> <appender-ref ref=\"STDOUT\" /> </appender> <root level=\"debug\"> <!-- changed the root logger --> <appender-ref ref=\"ASYNC\" /> </root> </configuration> Copy Two console appenders example This example sends New Relic logging to a file, but still sends standard logging to the console: <configuration> <appender name=\"FILE\" class=\"ch.qos.logback.core.FileAppender\"> <file>myApp.log</file> <!-- encoder changed --> <encoder class=\"com.newrelic.logging.logback.NewRelicEncoder\"/> </appender> <!-- this appender does normal console logging --> <appender name=\"STDOUT\" class=\"ch.qos.logback.core.ConsoleAppender\"> <encoder> <pattern>%msg%n</pattern> </encoder> </appender> <!-- The required New Relic ASYNC appender wraps the FILE appender --> <appender name=\"ASYNC\" class=\"com.newrelic.logging.logback.NewRelicAsyncAppender\"> <appender-ref ref=\"FILE\" /> </appender> <root level=\"debug\"> <!-- ASYNC is one of the main appenders --> <appender-ref ref=\"ASYNC\" /> <!-- Send every message to normal console logging, as well. --> <appender-ref ref=\"STDOUT\" /> </root> </configuration> Copy Spring and Springboot We offer extensions for current versions of Spring and Spring Boot. If you already know the logging library, you can skip directly to that documentation: java.util.logging log4j 1 log4j 2 logback The extensions support default configurations only on Spring Boot 2.0 and higher. With Spring Boot: Here are tips to determine which logging library you have: If you have spring-boot-starter-log4j2 in your dependencies, you're using log4j 2.x. Refer to the Spring Boot log4j 2.x documentation for basic configuration, and the New Relic log4j 2 extension for customizing your configuration. If you're using Spring Boot but not the starter-log4j2, you're using logback by default. Refer to Spring Boot logback documentation for basic configuration, and the New Relic logback extension for customizing your configuration. With Spring (but not Spring Boot): Spring 5 or higher: Spring implements a bridge to other logging libraries that will automatically find them. However, those individual libraries must be configured and explicitly included in your project dependencies. To identify your logging dependency, consult your Gradle, Maven, or other build tool's dependency tree. Then follow the procedures to configure logs in context for your Java app with that extension. Spring 4 or lower: Spring version 4 and lower uses Apache Commons Logging for its bridge. Refer to the Spring documentation for information on configuring its bridge. View logs in UI To verify that you have configured the log appender correctly, run your application, then check your logs data in New Relic One using the query operator has:span.id has:trace.id. If everything is configured correctly and your data is being forwarded to New Relic with the enriched metadata, your logs should now be emitted as JSON and contain trace.id and span.id fields. If you don't see log data in the UI, follow the troubleshooting procedures. What's next? After you set up APM logs in context, make the most of your logging data: Explore the logging data across your platform with our Logs UI. See your logs in context of your app's performance in the APM UI. Troubleshoot errors with distributed tracing, stack traces, application logs, and more. Get deeper visibility into both your application and your platform performance data by forwarding your logs with our infrastructure monitoring agent. Review your infrastructure logs in the UI. Set up alerts. Query your data and create dashboards.",

      "body": "When you need to correlate log data with other telemetry data, enable logs in context in New Relic. Logs in context adds metadata that links your logs with related APM data, like errors or distributed traces, or your platform performance data from infrastructure monitoring in New Relic One. See the root cause of issues across your platform By bringing all of your application and infrastructure data together in a single solution, you can get to the root cause of issues faster. Logs in context help you quickly see meaningful patterns and trends. The following diagram shows the lifecycle of a log message, from enrichment with agent metadata (contextual logging), to formatting and forwarding the log data to New Relic: This diagram illustrates the flow of log messages through New Relic. Don't spend extra time trying to narrow down all your logs from different parts of your platform. Instead, enable logs in context to see the exact log lines you need to identify and resolve a problem. Basic process to enable logs in context The process to enable logs in context is basically the same, regardless of which APM agent you use to monitor your application: Make sure you have already set up logging in New Relic. This includes configuring a supported log forwarder that collects your application logs and extends the metadata that is forwarded to New Relic. Update to a supported APM agent version for your app, and enable distributed tracing. Configure logs in context for your APM agent or for your infrastructure monitoring agent. View your logs within the context of your apps or infrastructure in New Relic One. The main differences in this procedure are which log appenders you can use to extend and enrich your log data, and how to configure the log appender you select for your APM agent. For detailed information, see the logs-in-context procedures for: C SDK Go Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby Infrastructure monitoring agent API and other options If our logging solutions don't meet your needs, you can use other options to send your log data to New Relic: Logging extensions via agent API calls HTTP endpoint via our Log API Syslog protocols via TCP endpoint (useful for CDNs, hardware devices, or managed services) What's next?

To configure your Fluentd plugin: In your fluent.conf file, or td-agent.conf if using the td-agent, add the following block of data, replacing the placeholder text with your New Relic license key: #Tail one or more log files <source> @type tail <parse> @type none </parse> path /path/to/file tag example.service </source> #Add hostname and service_name to all events with \"example.service\" tag <filter example.service> @type record_transformer <record> service_name ${tag} hostname \"#{Socket.gethostname}\" </record> </filter> #Forward all events to New Relic <match **> @type newrelic license_key YOUR_LICENSE_KEY </match> Copy Restart the Fluentd service to ensure your changes are applied. Configure the Fluentd Plugin for EU accounts By default the Fluentd plugin forwards logs to New Relic's US endpoint: https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1. If your account is in New Relic's EU datacenter then you'll need to manually set the base_uri property to the EU endpoint. For example: #Tail one or more log files <source> @type tail <parse> @type none </parse> path /path/to/file tag example.service </source> #Add hostname and service_name to all events with \"example.service\" tag <filter example.service> @type record_transformer <record> service_name ${tag} hostname \"#{Socket.gethostname}\" </record> </filter> #Forward all events to New Relic EU Endpoint <match **> @type newrelic license_key YOUR_LICENSE_KEY base_uri https://log-api.eu.newrelic.com/log/v1 </match> Copy Test the Fluentd plugin To test if your Fluentd plugin is receiving input from a log file: Run the following command to append a test log message to your log file: echo \"test message\" >> /PATH/TO/YOUR/LOG/FILE Copy Search New Relic Logs UI for test message. View log data If everything is configured correctly and your data is being collected, you should see data logs in both of these places: New Relic Logs UI New Relic tools for running NRQL queries. For example, you can execute a query like this: SELECT * FROM Log Copy Tune-up log Fluentd buffer By default, the plugin sends logs to New Relic One every 5 seconds. If you want to change this timing, add a <buffer> block to the configuration by following this example: [...] # Forward all events to New Relic EU Endpoint <match **> @type newrelic license_key YOUR_LICENSE_KEY <buffer time> timekey 60s </buffer> </match> Copy To read more about all the available configurations for buffers, check out the fluentd documentation about Buffer configurations. What's next? Now that you've enabled Logs, here are some potential next steps: Explore your data using the Logs UI. Configure your agent to see contextual log data, such as distributed tracing, stack traces, application logs, and more. Query your data and create custom dashboards or alerts. If no data appears after you enable New Relic Logs, follow the troubleshooting procedures.",

      "body": "Logs in context for the .NET agent connects your logs and APM data in New Relic. Bringing all of this data together in a single tool helps you quickly get to the root cause of an issue and find the log lines that you need to identify and resolve a problem. Set up your .NET app To enable logs in context for APM apps monitored by .NET: Make sure you have already set up logging in New Relic. This includes configuring a supported log forwarder that collects your application logs and extends the metadata that is forwarded to New Relic. Install or update to the latest .NET agent version, and enable distributed tracing. Use .NET agent version 8.21 or higher and the New Relic .NET agent API version 8.21 or higher for logs in context. Install or update to Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5 or higher or .NET Core 2.0 or higher. Install and configure any of the following logging extensions to enrich your log data. Configure log4net extension You can use the Apache log4net version 2.0.8 or higher extension to link your log data with related data across the rest of the New Relic platform. log4net workflow diagram The following diagram illustrates the flow of log messages through Apache log4net, highlighting specific components of the New Relic log4net extension. Many log forwarders are available. This example uses Fluentd. Appender: The NewRelicAppender adds contextual information from the .NET agent (using the API) to the log events generated by the application. This contextual information, known as linking metadata, is used by New Relic to link log messages to the transactions and spans from which they were created. This appender will pass the enriched log events to downstream appenders for further processing. Since the NewRelicAppender is ForwardingAppender type, it needs to be the first appender in the chain. It also requires another appender that can write to an actual output destination as its child in order to work. Layout: The NewRelicLayout formats the enriched log events into the JSON format expected by New Relic. The appender, which this layout is assigned to, instructs log4net to output the JSON to a file in the location that the log forwarder expects. Log Forwarder: The log forwarder monitors an output folder and incrementally sends New Relic formatted log information to the New Relic logging endpoint. log4net 2.0.8 or higher configuration Log4net uses appender and layout to store and format log messages. NewRelicAppender enriches log messages with contextual information from the New Relic .NET agent if it is attached to your application. The appender passes enriched log messages to downstream appenders to handle specific use cases for log messages. For more information about logging with log4net, see the Apache log4net Getting started documentation. To configure logs in context with the log4net extension: Using the Visual Studio NuGet Package Manager, locate and install the NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Log4Net package. In your log4net configuration file, update your logging configuration to use the NewRelicAppender as the first level appender, and reference your existing appenders as its children. Also replace the layout of the appender that writes log messages to an output destination with the NewRelicLayout. The following log4net configuration example enriches log events with New Relic linking metadata. In addition to the existing log files, it outputs new log files in a specific JSON format at C:\\logs\\log4netExample.log.json for consumption by the log forwarder: <log4net> <root> <level value=\"ALL\" /> <appender-ref ref=\"NewRelicAppender\" /> </root> <appender name=\"NewRelicAppender\" type=\"NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Log4Net.NewRelicAppender, NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Log4Net\" > <threshold value=\"ALL\"/> <appender-ref ref=\"FileAppender\" /> </appender> <appender name=\"FileAppender\" type=\"log4net.Appender.FileAppender\"> <file value=\"C:\\logs\\log4netExample.log.json\" /> <param name=\"AppendToFile\" value=\"true\" /> <layout type=\"NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Log4Net.NewRelicLayout, NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Log4Net\"> </layout> </appender> </log4net> Copy After you configure the log4net extension and update your logging file, you can configure your extension to send data to New Relic. Here is an example configuration using the Fluentd plugin for New Relic Logs: <!--NewRelicLoggingExample.conf--> <source> @type tail path C:\\logs\\log4netExample.log.json pos_file C:\\logs\\log4netExample.log.json.pos tag logfile.* <parse> @type json </parse> </source> <match **> @type newrelic license_key <YOUR NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY> base_uri https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 </match> Copy Configure NLog extension You can use our NLog 4.5 or higher extension to link to your log data with related data across the rest of the New Relic platform. Nlog workflow diagram The New Relic NLog extension provides a NewRelicJsonLayout that formats a log event in the way required by the New Relic logging endpoint. Next, it adds contextual information from the .NET agent when attached to your application. Then, a target can be configured to write logging data to an output folder. The log forwarder can monitor this folder and incrementally send log information to New Relic. The following diagram illustrates the flow of log messages through NLog, highlighting specific components of the New Relic NLog extension. New Relic JSON Layout: The NewRelicJsonLayout adds contextual information from the .NET agent (using the API) to the log events generated by the application, and outputs log messages in the JSON format expected by New Relic. This contextual information, known as linking metadata, is used by New Relic to link log messages to the transactions and spans where they were created. Since the NewRelicAppender is ForwardingAppender type, it needs to be the first appender in the chain. It also requires another appender that can write to an actual output destination as its child in order to work. File Target: A FileTarget defines a file on disk where log messages are written. Adding the NewRelicJsonLayout to that target allows the output to be formatted correctly for forwarding to New Relic. Log Forwarder: The log forwarder is configured to send the log data from the FileTarget output to New Relic. The example below uses the New Relic Fluentd log forwarder, however there are many other log forwarders that can be used. For more information about logging with NLog, see the nlog-project.org documentation. Nlog 4.5 or higher configuration Use our NLog 4.5 or higher extension to link to your log data with related data across the rest of the New Relic platform. Using the Visual Studio NuGet Package Manager, locate and install the NewRelic.LogEnrichers.NLog package. In your application code, update your logging configuration to add the NewRelicJsonLayout and decide if you want to collect MappedDiagnosticsContext (MDC) or the MappedDiagnosticsLogicalContext (MDLC) data. The following configuration examples result in new JSON files that are written to disk. Some of these configuration options may be useful for managing the amount of disk space used and/or the performance of the target. archiveAboveSize maxArchiveFiles bufferSize enableArchiveFileCompression autoFlush concurrentWrites Although the NLog AsyncWrapper Target is not required, it may help improve performance by performing formatting and output of log files on a different thread. Don't collect MDC or the MDLC data (default): The following code example enriches log events with New Relic linking metadata, but not with MDC or the MDLC data. In addition to the existing log files, it outputs new log files in a specific JSON format at C:\\logs\\NLogExample.log.json for consumption by the log forwarder: var loggerConfig = new LoggingConfiguration(); var newRelicFileTarget = new FileTarget(\"NewRelicFileTarget\"); newRelicFileTarget.Layout = new NewRelicJsonLayout(); newRelicFileTarget.FileName = \"C:\\logs\\NLogExample.json\"; loggerConfig.AddTarget(newRelicFileTarget); loggerConfig.AddRuleForAllLevels(\"NewRelicFileTarget\"); LogManager.Configuration = loggerConfig; var logger = LogManager.GetLogger(\"Example\"); Copy Collect MDC or the MDLC data: If your application uses the MDC or the MDLC, you can configure the NewRelicJsonLayout to include items in those collections. The following code example adds the additional configuration to enable collecting MDC and MDLC data. As in the previous example, it outputs new log files in a specific JSON format at C:\\logs\\NLogExample.log.json for consumption by the log forwarder: var loggerConfig = new LoggingConfiguration(); var newRelicFileTarget = new FileTarget(\"NewRelicFileTarget\"); var newRelicLayout = new NewRelicJsonLayout { IncludeMdc = `true,` IncludeMdlc = `true` }; newRelicFileTarget.Layout = newRelicLayout; newRelicFileTarget.FileName = \"C:\\logs\\NLogExample.json\"; loggerConfig.AddTarget(newRelicFileTarget); loggerConfig.AddRuleForAllLevels(\"NewRelicFileTarget\"); LogManager.Configuration = loggerConfig; var logger = LogManager.GetLogger(\"Example\"); Copy Once you have configured the NLog extension and updated your logging file, you can configure your extension to send data to New Relic. Here is an example configuration using the Fluentd plugin to forward logs to New Relic: <!--NewRelicLoggingExample.conf--> <source> @type tail path C:\\logs\\NLogExample.log.json pos_file C:\\logs\\NLogExample.log.json.pos tag logfile.* <parse> @type json </parse> </source> <match **> @type newrelic license_key <YOUR NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY> base_uri https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 </match> Copy Nlog file-based configuration You can also configure the New Relic NLog extension with file-based configuration providers. The folowing example code creates a logger based on settings contained in an App.config file. Instantiating Logger using .config file var logger = LogManager.GetLogger(\"NewRelicLog\"); logger.Info(\"Hello, New Relic!\"); Copy Sample App.config file <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\" ?> <configuration> <configSections> <section name=\"nlog\" type=\"NLog.Config.ConfigSectionHandler, NLog\"/> </configSections> <startup> <supportedRuntime version=\"v4.0\" sku=\".NETFramework,Version=v4.5\" /> </startup> <nlog xmlns=\"http://www.nlog-project.org/schemas/NLog.xsd\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"> <extensions> <add assembly=\"NewRelic.LogEnrichers.NLog\" /> </extensions> <targets> <target name=\"NewRelicLogFile\" xsi:type=\"File\" fileName=\"C:/path/to/NewRelicLog.json\"> <layout xsi:type=\"newrelic-jsonlayout\"> </layout> </target> </targets> <rules> <logger name=\"NewRelicLog\" minlevel=\"Info\" writeTo=\"newRelicLogFile\" /> </rules> </nlog> </configuration> Copy Configure Serilog 2.5 or higher extension You can use our Serilog extension to link to your log data with related data across the rest of the New Relic platform. This requires: Serilog 2.5 or higher Serilog File Sinks v4.0 or higher Serilog workflow diagram Serilog is a structured logging framework that records log messages from your application and creates a LogEvent to store the message data. Using Enrichers, you can add additional information to the log events. Sinks and Formatters allow you to format and output those log events for downstream consumption and viewing. The following diagram illustrates the flow of log messages through Serilog, highlighting specific components of the New Relic Serilog extension. Many log forwarders are available. This example uses Fluentd. New Relic Enricher: The NewRelicEnricher adds contextual information from the .NET agent (using the API) to the log events generated by the application. This contextual information, called linking metadata, is used by New Relic to link log messages to the transactions and spans where they were created. New Relic Formatter: The NewRelicFormattertranslates enriched log events into the JSON format expected by New Relic. A sink instructs Serilog to output the JSON to a file in the location that the log forwarder expects. New Relic Log Forwarder: The NewRelicFormatter translates enriched log events into the JSON format expected by New Relic. A sink instructs Serilog to output the JSON to a file in the location that the log forwarder expects. For more information about Serilog log events, see the Serilog documentation on GitHub. Serilog 2.5 or higher configuration To configure logs in context with the Serilog extension: Use the Visual Studio NuGet Package Manager to locate and install the NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Serilog package. In your application code, update your logging configuration to add the NewRelicEnricher and NewRelicFormatter. The following code example enriches log events with New Relic linking metadata. In addition to the existing log files, it outputs new log files in a specific JSON format at C:\\logs\\SerilogExample.log.json for consumption by the log forwarder: var loggerConfig = new LoggerConfiguration() loggerConfig .Enrich.WithThreadName() .Enrich.WithThreadId() .Enrich.WithNewRelicLogsInContext() .WriteTo.File( path: @\"C:\\logs\\ExistingLoggingOutput.txt\") .WriteTo.File( formatter: new NewRelicFormatter(), path: @\"C:\\logs\\SerilogExample.log.json\"); var log = loggerConfig.CreateLogger(); Copy This configuration results in new JSON files that are written to disk. Some of these configuration options may be useful for managing the amount of disk space used and/or the performance of the sink. restrictedToMinimumLevel buffered rollingInterval rollOnFileSizeLimit retainedFileCountLimit Although not required, using the Serilog Asynchronous Sink Wrapper may help improve the performance by performing formatting and output of log files on a different thread. Once you have configured the Serilog extension and updated your logging file, you can configure your extension to send data to New Relic. Here is an example configuration using the Fluentd plugin to forward logs to New Relic: <!--NewRelicLoggingExample.conf--> <source> @type tail path C:\\logs\\SerilogExample.log.json pos_file C:\\logs\\SerilogExample.log.json.pos tag logfile.* <parse> @type json </parse> </source> <match **> @type newrelic license_key <YOUR NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY> base_uri https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 </match> Copy Serilog file-based configuration You can also configure the New Relic Serilog extension with file-based configuration providers.The following additional NuGet Packages are required: Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration/) Serilog.Settings.Configuration The following example code creates a logger based on settings contained in an appSettings.json file. Instantiating logger using appsettings.json var builder = new ConfigurationBuilder() .AddJsonFile(\"appsettings.json\"); var configuration = builder.Build(); var logger = new LoggerConfiguration() .ReadFrom.Configuration(configuration) .CreateLogger(); Copy Sample appsettings.json file { \"Serilog\": { \"Using\": [ \"Serilog.Sinks.Console\", \"Serilog.Sinks.File\", \"NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Serilog\" ], \"MinimumLevel\": \"Debug\", \"Enrich\": [ \"WithNewRelicLogsInContext\" ], \"WriteTo\": [ { \"Name\": \"File\", \"Args\": { \"path\": \"C:\\\\Logs\\\\SerilogExample.log.json\", \"formatter\": \"NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Serilog.NewRelicFormatter, NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Serilog\" } } ], \"Properties\": { \"Application\": \"NewRelic Logging Serilog Example\" } } } Copy The following example code creates a logger based on settings contained in a web.config file. The Serilog.Settings.AppSettings NuGet Package is required. Instantiating logger using .config file var logger = new LoggerConfiguration() .ReadFrom.AppSettings() .CreateLogger(); Copy Sample web.config file <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?> <configuration> <appSettings> <add key=\"serilog:using:NewRelic\" value=\"NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Serilog\" /> <add key=\"serilog:using:File\" value=\"Serilog.Sinks.File\" /> <!--Add other enrichers here--> <add key=\"serilog:enrich:WithNewRelicLogsInContext\" /> <add key=\"serilog:write-to:File.path\" value=\"C:\\logs\\SerilogExample.log.json\" /> <add key=\"serilog:write-to:File.formatter\" value=\"NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Serilog.NewRelicFormatter, NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Serilog\" /> </appSettings> Copy View logs in the UI To verify that you have configured the log appender correctly, run your application, then check your logs data in New Relic One using the query operator has:span.id has:trace.id. If everything is configured correctly and your data is being forwarded to New Relic with the enriched metadata, your logs should now be emitted as JSON and contain trace.id and span.id fields. If you don't see log data in the UI, follow the troubleshooting procedures. What's next? After you set up APM logs in context, make the most of your logging data: Explore the logging data across your platform with our Logs UI. See your logs in context of your app's performance in the APM UI. Troubleshoot errors with distributed tracing, stack traces, application logs, and more. Get deeper visibility into both your application and your platform performance data by forwarding your logs with our infrastructure monitoring agent. Review your infrastructure logs in the UI.

Use Java agent version 5.6.0 or higher for logs in context. Enable the JVM argument -javaagent, and enable distributed tracing. Configure logs in context for Java to enrich your log data, using any of the following extensions as applicable. If you use Spring or Spring Boot and aren't sure which extension you need, see our Spring documentation. Dropwizard 1.3 or higher We offer a Dropwizard extension for logs in context with the Java agent. To get started, review the code and an example application on GitHub. To configure logs in context for your Java app with the DropWizard extension: Make sure you have the Dropwizard 1.3 or higher package installed and working on your application. Use the original Dropwizard appenders and logging factory installed and working on the application. Make sure you have the New Relic Java agent version 5.6.0 or higher installed on your application, and that you have enabled the JVM argument -javaagent. Update your project's dependencies to include the Dropwizard 1.3 extension as applicable: Gradle: Add the following to your build.gradle file: dependencies { compile(\"com.newrelic.logging:dropwizard:2.0\") } Copy Maven: Add the following to your pom.xml file: <dependencies> <dependency> <groupId>com.newrelic.logging</groupId> <artifactId>dropwizard</artifactId> <version>2.0</version> </dependency> </dependencies> Copy Update your Dropwizard .yaml configuration file with a newrelic-json layout, replacing the currently used type: console or type: file with either type: newrelic-console or type: newrelic-file as appropriate. For example: logging: appenders: - type: newrelic-console # Add the two lines below if you don't have a layout specified on the appender. # If you have a layout, remove all parameters to the layout and set the type. layout: type: newrelic-json Copy The New Relic Dropwizard extension also supports a log-format layout type that uses the standard Dropwizard logging. For testing purposes, you can change the type of the layout with a one-line change: logging: appenders: - type: newrelic-file # This format will be ignored by the newrelic-json layout, but used by the log-format layout. logFormat: \"%date{ISO8601} %c %-5p: %m trace.id=%mdc{trace.id} span.id=%mdc{span.id}%n\" layout: # type: newrelic-json type: log-format Copy java.util.logging We offer a java.util.logging extension for logs in context with the Java agent. To get started, review the code and an example application on GitHub. To configure logs in context for your Java app with with the java.util.logging extension: Make sure you have the java.util.logging package installed and working on the application. Make sure you have the New Relic Java agent version 5.6.0 or higher installed on your application, and that you have enabled the JVM argument -javaagent. Update your project's dependencies to include the java.util.logging extension as applicable. If you can't edit these files, you can instead add the jars directly to the application classpath. Gradle: Add the following to your build.gradle file: dependencies { compile(\"com.newrelic.logging:jul:2.0\") } Copy Maven: Add the following to your pom.xml file: <dependencies> <dependency> <groupId>com.newrelic.logging</groupId> <artifactId>jul</artifactId> <version>2.0</version> </dependency> </dependencies> Copy Check if your logging file's handlers property is set to something other than NewRelicMemoryHandler. Look for a line listing the root logger's handlers, like this: handlers = java.util.logging.FileHandler Copy Update your logging properties file to set the root logger's handler to NewRelicMemoryHandler so it intercepts messages destined for another handler: handlers = com.newrelic.logging.jul.NewRelicMemoryHandler Copy Configure the NewRelicMemoryHandler by setting the target to the handler that was previously assigned to the root logger, so it captures data New Relic needs on the thread the log message is coming from: com.newrelic.logging.jul.NewRelicMemoryHandler.target = java.util.logging.FileHandler Copy Use a NewRelicFormatter for the final handler. Update your logging properties file to set the formatter property like the following example. Make sure the handler where you set the formatter is the target handler from the previous step (java.util.logging.FileHandler in this example). java.util.logging.FileHandler.formatter = com.newrelic.logging.jul. NewRelicFormatter Copy The New Relic log format is JSON with telemetry metadata we use to correlate transactions and logs together. Currently we do not support any customization of that format. Once complete, JSON is logged instead of text. The JSON should be formatted as single objects, one per line, and should contain fields like log.level and thread.name. The trace.id, which is required for logs in context, should only have a value for log messages that occur within a transaction. java.util.logging classpath additions The most direct way to get the logs-in-context extensions is to add these dependencies to Maven's pom.xml or Gradle's build.gradle. This allows the packaging tools to pick up the correct dependencies. If you can't edit these files, you can instead add the jars directly to the application classpath for your logging framework's configuration. Before you modify the classpath: Enable the JVM argument -javaagent on your app's Java agent. Verify which logging framework the application is using. Make sure you are able to change your logging framework's configuration. Add the following three jars to the classpath if they aren't already present. Generally, we recommend taking the latest versions published on Maven Central. Group ID com.newrelic.logging and Artifact ID: Select the artifact named after your application's logging framework in Maven. Group ID com.fasterxml.jackson.core and Artifact ID: Use jackson-core. Group ID com.newrelic.agent.java and Artifact ID: Use newrelic-api. Log4j 1.x We offer a Log4j 1.x extension extension for logs in context with the Java agent. To get started, review the code and an example application on GitHub. To configure logs in context for your Java app with with the Log4j 1.x extension, you must configure the Log4j extension in code or via XML. Properties files are not supported because AsyncAppender instances can only be automatically configured via XML. Make sure you have the Log4j 1.x package installed and working on the application. Make sure you have the New Relic Java agent version 5.6.0 or higher installed on your application, and that you have enabled the JVM argument -javaagent. Update your project's dependencies to include the Log4j 1.x extension as applicable. Gradle: Add the following to your build.gradle file: dependencies { compile(\"com.newrelic.logging:log4j1:2.0\") } Copy Maven: Add the following to your pom.xml file: <dependencies> <dependency> <groupId>com.newrelic.logging</groupId> <artifactId>log4j1</artifactId> <version>2.0</version> </dependency> </dependencies> Copy In your logging configuration XML file, update your <appender> element with a NewRelicLayout, adding <layout class=\"com.newrelic.logging.log4j1.NewRelicLayout\"/>: <appender name=\" TypicalFile \" class=\"org.apache.log4j.FileAppender\"> <param name=\"file\" value=\"logs/log4j1-app.log\"/> <param name=\"append\" value=\"false\"/> <layout class=\" com.newrelic.logging.log4j1.NewRelicLayout \"/> <!-- only this line needs to be added --> </appender> Copy Use NewRelicAsyncAppender to wrap any appenders that will target New Relic's log forwarder. For example: <appender name=\" NewRelicFile \" class=\"com.newrelic.logging.log4j1.NewRelicAsyncAppender\"> <appender-ref ref=\" TypicalFile \" /> </appender> Copy Use the async appender on the root logger. For example: <root> <appender-ref ref=\" NewRelicFile \" /> </root> Copy Example configuration file for the Log4j 1.x extension: <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\" ?> <!DOCTYPE log4j:configuration SYSTEM \"log4j.dtd\"> <log4j:configuration debug=\"false\"> <appender name=\"TypicalFile\" class=\"org.apache.log4j.FileAppender\"> <param name=\"file\" value=\"logs/log4j1-app.log\"/> <param name=\"append\" value=\"false\"/> <!-- layout has been replaced --> <layout class=\"com.newrelic.logging.log4j1.NewRelicLayout\"/> </appender> <!-- this appender was added --> <appender name=\"NewRelicFile\" class=\"com.newrelic.logging.log4j1.NewRelicAsyncAppender\"> <appender-ref ref=\"TypicalFile\" /> </appender> <appender name=\"TypicalConsole\" class=\"org.apache.log4j.ConsoleAppender\"> <layout class=\"org.apache.log4j.PatternLayout\"> <param name=\"ConversionPattern\" value=\"%-5p %c{1} - %m%n\"/> </layout> </appender> <root> ​ <!-- the new appender was used here -->​​ <appender-ref ref=\"NewRelicFile\" /> <appender-ref ref=\"TypicalConsole\" /> </root> </log4j:configuration> Copy Log4j 2.x We offer a Log4j 2.x extension for logs in context with the Java agent. To get started, review the code and an example application on GitHub. To configure logs in context for your Java app with with the Log4j 2.x extension: Make sure you have the Log4j 2.x or Logs4j 2 binding package installed and working on your application. Make sure you have the New Relic Java agent version 5.6.0 or higher installed on your application, and that you have enabled the JVM argument -javaagent. Update your project's dependencies to include the Log4j 2.x extension as applicable: Gradle: Add the highlighted section to your build.gradle file: dependencies { compile(\"com.newrelic.logging:log4j2:2.0\") } Copy Maven: Add the highlighted section to your pom.xml file: <dependencies> <dependency> <groupId>com.newrelic.logging</groupId> <artifactId>log4j2</artifactId> <version>2.0</version> </dependency> </dependencies> Copy In your logging configuration XML file, update your <configuration> element by adding the highlighted section: <Configuration xmlns=\"http://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.0/config\" packages=\"com.newrelic.logging.log4j2\" > Copy If you're using a properties file, add packages=com.newrelic.logging.log4j2. Add <NewRelicLayout/> to use a NewRelicLayout element within one of the appenders. For example: <File name=\"MyFile\" fileName=\"logs/app-log-file.log\"> <NewRelicLayout/> </File> Copy If you're using a properties file, only change the layout.type: appender.console.type = Console appender.console.name = STDOUT appender.console.layout.type = NewRelicLayout Copy If you only modified an existing appender, skip this step. If you added a new appender, add <AppenderRef/> within <Root> to use this appender. Use the ref attribute to refer to appender name you created in the previous step. For example: <Root level=\"info\"> <AppenderRef ref=\"MyFile\"/> </Root> Copy If you're using a properties file and added a new appender, add: rootLogger.level = info rootLogger.appenderRef.stdout.ref = STDOUT ​​​​​ Copy Logback version 1.2.0 or higher We offer a Logback extension for logs in context with the Java agent. To get started, review the code and an example application on GitHub. To configure logs in context for your Java app with Logback: Make sure you have Logback version 1.2.0 or higher and the New Relic Java agent version 5.6.0 or higher installed and working on your application. Make sure you have the New Relic Java agent version 5.6.0 or higher installed on your application, and that you have enabled the JVM argument -javaagent. Update your project's dependencies to include the Logback extension as applicable: Gradle: Add the highlighted section to your build.gradle file: dependencies { compile(\"com.newrelic.logging:logback:2.0\") } Copy Maven: Add the highlighted section to your pom.xml file: <dependencies> <dependency> <groupId>com.newrelic.logging</groupId> <artifactId>logback</artifactId> <version>2.0</version> </dependency> </dependencies> Copy Update your logging configuration xml to replace any existing <encoder> element. If you're logging to the console (stdout/stderr), look for ConsoleAppender and replace: <appender name=\"STDOUT\" class=\"ch.qos.logback.core.ConsoleAppender\"> <encoder class=\"com.newrelic.logging.logback.NewRelicEncoder\"/> </appender> Copy If you're logging to a file, look for FileAppender and replace <encoder>: <appender name=\"LOG_FILE\" class=\"ch.qos.logback.core.FileAppender\"> <file>logs/app-log-file.log</file> <encoder class=\"com.newrelic.logging.logback.NewRelicEncoder\"/> </appender> Copy Update your logging configuration xml with the NewRelicAsyncAppender. To ensure that NewRelicAsyncAppender wraps any appenders that will target New Relic's log forwarder, add the following section. Change \"LOG_FILE\" to the name of the appender you updated in the previous step. <appender name=\"ASYNC\" class=\"com.newrelic.logging.logback.NewRelicAsyncAppender\"> <appender-ref ref=\"LOG_FILE\" /> </appender> Copy Make sure NewRelicAsyncAppender is the first appender used in your logger. Replace your root logger’s appenders with the ASYNC appender created in the previous step. Then list any other appenders after the NewRelicAsyncAppender in the <root> list. <root> <appender-ref ref=\"ASYNC\" /> </root> Copy Here are examples of an updated logging .xml file for the Logback extension. You can also see a working example in GitHub. Single console appender example Example configuration file after adding in the logging extension information: <configuration> <appender name=\"STDOUT\" class=\"ch.qos.logback.core.ConsoleAppender\"> <!-- changed the encoder --> <encoder class=\"com.newrelic.logging.logback.NewRelicEncoder\"/> </appender> <!-- added the ASYNC appender --> <appender name=\"ASYNC\" class=\"com.newrelic.logging.logback.NewRelicAsyncAppender\"> <appender-ref ref=\"STDOUT\" /> </appender> <root level=\"debug\"> <!-- changed the root logger --> <appender-ref ref=\"ASYNC\" /> </root> </configuration> Copy Two console appenders example This example sends New Relic logging to a file, but still sends standard logging to the console: <configuration> <appender name=\"FILE\" class=\"ch.qos.logback.core.FileAppender\"> <file>myApp.log</file> <!-- encoder changed --> <encoder class=\"com.newrelic.logging.logback.NewRelicEncoder\"/> </appender> <!-- this appender does normal console logging --> <appender name=\"STDOUT\" class=\"ch.qos.logback.core.ConsoleAppender\"> <encoder> <pattern>%msg%n</pattern> </encoder> </appender> <!-- The required New Relic ASYNC appender wraps the FILE appender --> <appender name=\"ASYNC\" class=\"com.newrelic.logging.logback.NewRelicAsyncAppender\"> <appender-ref ref=\"FILE\" /> </appender> <root level=\"debug\"> <!-- ASYNC is one of the main appenders --> <appender-ref ref=\"ASYNC\" /> <!-- Send every message to normal console logging, as well. --> <appender-ref ref=\"STDOUT\" /> </root> </configuration> Copy Spring and Springboot We offer extensions for current versions of Spring and Spring Boot. If you already know the logging library, you can skip directly to that documentation: java.util.logging log4j 1 log4j 2 logback The extensions support default configurations only on Spring Boot 2.0 and higher. With Spring Boot: Here are tips to determine which logging library you have: If you have spring-boot-starter-log4j2 in your dependencies, you're using log4j 2.x. Refer to the Spring Boot log4j 2.x documentation for basic configuration, and the New Relic log4j 2 extension for customizing your configuration. If you're using Spring Boot but not the starter-log4j2, you're using logback by default. Refer to Spring Boot logback documentation for basic configuration, and the New Relic logback extension for customizing your configuration. With Spring (but not Spring Boot): Spring 5 or higher: Spring implements a bridge to other logging libraries that will automatically find them. However, those individual libraries must be configured and explicitly included in your project dependencies. To identify your logging dependency, consult your Gradle, Maven, or other build tool's dependency tree. Then follow the procedures to configure logs in context for your Java app with that extension. Spring 4 or lower: Spring version 4 and lower uses Apache Commons Logging for its bridge. Refer to the Spring documentation for information on configuring its bridge. View logs in UI To verify that you have configured the log appender correctly, run your application, then check your logs data in New Relic One using the query operator has:span.id has:trace.id. If everything is configured correctly and your data is being forwarded to New Relic with the enriched metadata, your logs should now be emitted as JSON and contain trace.id and span.id fields. If you don't see log data in the UI, follow the troubleshooting procedures. What's next? After you set up APM logs in context, make the most of your logging data: Explore the logging data across your platform with our Logs UI. See your logs in context of your app's performance in the APM UI. Troubleshoot errors with distributed tracing, stack traces, application logs, and more. Get deeper visibility into both your application and your platform performance data by forwarding your logs with our infrastructure monitoring agent. Review your infrastructure logs in the UI. Set up alerts. Query your data and create dashboards.",

But in other situations where you don't have log forwarders (such as CDNs, hardware devices, or managed services), you can use syslog protocols via a TCP endpoint. You can forward your logs to New Relic using syslog clients such as rsyslog and syslog-ng. Compatibility and requirements To forward logs to New Relic using a syslog client, you need: A valid New Relic license key for the account you want to send logs to Some minor changes to the syslog client's configuration, as explained in this document Important Currently, our syslog endpoint only supports accounts in our US data center. Configure rsyslog To forward logs to New Relic with rsyslog: Install packages required to allow rsyslog to send logs using TLS encryption: sudo yum install rsyslog-gnutls ca-certificates Copy Optional: Configure rsyslog to tail log files and forward their contents to New Relic.

      "body": "If our logging solutions don't meet your needs, you can use our Log API to send log data directly to New Relic's Log management via an HTTP endpoint. Want to try out our Log API? Create a New Relic account for free! No credit card required. Compatibility and requirements Requirements include: A New Relic license key For payload details, see limits and restricted characters. HTTP setup To send log data to your New Relic account: Get your New Relic license key. Generate the JSON message using the required headers and body fields. Ensure you're providing an Api-Key or License-Key via headers or query parameters Submit the JSON message to the HTTP endpoint in a POST request. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your account for data. HTTP headers When creating your HTTP headers, use these guidelines: Header Supported values Content-Type Required application/json json application/gzip gzip Api-Key Required A New Relic license key. You can also send this via query parameter. You can also use an Insights insert key but the license key is preferred. Gzipped JSON formatting is accepted. If sending compressed JSON, please include the Content-Type: application/json and Content-Encoding: gzip headers. HTTP query parameters The license key can also be passed as a query string parameter. This can be useful when sending logs from cloud-based sources that don't allow custom HTTP request headers. Query parameter Value Api-Key Your license key. Use this key whenever you send a header. You can also use an Insights insert key but the license key is preferred. JSON body You can send your JSON message using either a simplified or detailed set of attributes: Simplified JSON body message When using the simplified format to create your JSON message, send a single JSON object with the following: Field Value type Format Required Notes \"timestamp\" Integer Either milliseconds or seconds since epoch No If the field is not specific as millisecond or seconds since epoch, the message will be timestamped using the ingest time \"message\" String any string No This is the main log message field that is searched by default \"logtype\" String any string No Primary field for identifying logs and matching parsing rules other_fields (must not contain white space) String any string No These will become attributes of the log message Note: Log management does not support white space in attribute names Detailed JSON body message When using the detailed format to create your body, it must be a JSON array containing one or more JSON objects, each of which with the following format: Field Value type Format Required Notes \"common\" Object See common. No Any attributes that are common to all log messages \"logs\" Array See logs. Yes Array with the log entries Limits and restricted characters Caution Avoid calling our API from within the code of a customer-facing application. This can cause performance issues or block your application if response time is slow. If you need to do it this way, call our API asynchronously to avoid these performance issues. Restrictions on logs sent to the Log API: Payload total size: 1MB(10^6 bytes) maximum per POST. We highly recommend using compression. The payload must be encoded as UTF-8. Number of attributes per event: 255 maximum Length of attribute name: 255 characters Length of attribute value: 4096 maximum character length Some specific attributes have additional restrictions: accountId: This is a reserved attribute name. If it is included, it will be dropped during ingest. entity.guid, entity.name, and entity.type: These attributes are used internally to identify entities. Any values submitted with these keys in the attributes section of a metric data point may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. For more information please refer to Entity synthesis. appId: Value must be an integer. If it is not an integer, the attribute name and value will be dropped during ingest. eventType: Can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, _ underscores, and : colons. timestamp: Must be a Unix epoch timestamp. You can define timestamps either in seconds or in milliseconds. Important Payloads with timestamps older than 48 hours may be dropped. Rate limits on logs sent to the Log API: Maximum rate for HTTP requests sent to the Log API: 300,000 requests per minute Maximum rate of uncompressed Log JSON bytes sent to the Log API: 10 GB per minute Rate limit violations Exceeding rate limits affects how the Log API behaves. Follow these instructions if this happens. HTTP requests per minute When the maximum request rate limit is exceeded for an account, the New Relic Log API returns a 429 response for the remainder of the minute. This response includes a Retry-After header indicating how long to wait in seconds before resubmitting or sending new data. To resolve this issue, either reduce the number of data points you are sending, or request a rate limit change. Subsequent subscription changes do not impact modified rate limits. If an account change impacts your rate limit, you must notify us to adjust your rate limit. To request rate limit changes, contact your New Relic account representative, or visit our Support portal. JSON bytes per minute When the maximum Log JSON byte limit is exceeded for an account, the New Relic Log API returns a 429 response for the remainder of the minute. This response includes a Retry-After header indicating how long to wait in seconds before resubmitting or sending new data. To resolve this issue, try to reduce the amount of log data you are sending, or spread it out over a larger period of time. To request rate limit changes, contact your New Relic account representative, or visit our Support portal. Log payload format We accept any valid JSON payload. The payload must encoded as UTF-8. Important Log management does not support white space in attribute names. For example, {\"Sample Attribute\": \"Value\"} would cause errors. JSON message attributes Common block attributes This is a block containing attributes that will be common to all log entries in logs: Field Value type Format Required Notes \"timestamp\" Integer Milliseconds or seconds since epoch No Message timestamp default to ingest time \"attributes\" Object JSON No This sub-object contains all other attributes of the message Logs block attributes This is an array containing log entries with the following format: Field Value type Format Required Notes \"timestamp\" Integer Milliseconds or seconds since epoch No Message timestamp default to ingest time \"attributes\" Object JSON No This sub-object contains all other attributes of the message \"message\" String (any string) Yes This is the main log message field that is searched by default \"log\" String (any string) No We will rewrite this string as the field message on ingest \"LOG\" String (any string) No We will rewrite this string as the field message on ingest \"MESSAGE\" String (any string) No We will rewrite this string as the field message on ingest JSON message attribute parsing This will attempt to parse any message attribute as JSON. If the message attribute is JSON, it will be parsed and the resultant JSON attributes will be added to the event. If the message attribute is not JSON, it is left as is. For example, the event: { \"timestamp\": 1562767499238, \"message\": \"{\\\"service-name\\\": \\\"login-service\\\", \\\"user\\\": {\\\"id\\\": 123, \\\"name\\\": \\\"alice\\\"}}\" } Copy Will be treated as: { \"timestamp\": 1562767499238, \"message\": \"{\\\"service-name\\\": \\\"my-service\\\", \\\"user\\\": {\\\"id\\\": 123, \\\"name\\\": \\\"alice\\\"}}\", \"service-name\": \"my-service\", \"user\": { \"id\": 123, \"name\": \"alice\" } } Copy Important Log management does not support white space in attribute names. For example, {\"Sample Attribute\": \"Value\"} would cause errors. Log JSON example Attributes may be scalar JSON types like string and number, but may also be compound (or nested) objects. Compound attributes will have their leaf attributes stored with flattened names. For instance, a compound user attribute in a log entry's attributes: \"attributes\": { \"action\": \"login\", \"user\": { \"id\": 123, \"name\": \"alice\" } } Copy will result in the following attributes being stored with the log event: Attribute Value \"action\" \"login\" \"user.id\" 123 \"user.name\" \"alice\" Log POST example Log POST message example: POST /log/v1 HTTP/1.1 Host: log-api.newrelic.com Content-Type: application/json X-License-Key: <YOUR_LICENSE_KEY> Accept: */* Content-Length: 319 [{ \"common\": { \"attributes\": { \"logtype\": \"accesslogs\", \"service\": \"login-service\", \"hostname\": \"login.example.com\" } }, \"logs\": [{ \"timestamp\": <TIMESTAMP_IN_UNIX_EPOCH>, \"message\": \"User 'xyz' logged in\" },{ \"timestamp\": <TIMESTAMP_IN_UNIX_EPOCH>, \"message\": \"User 'xyz' logged out\", \"attributes\": { \"auditId\": 123 } }] }] Copy The above POST message would result in the following log messages being stored in Log management: Example of stored common block attributes: Attribute Value \"logtype\" \"accesslogs\" \"service\" \"login-service\" \"hostname\" \"login.example.com\" Example of stored logs block attributes example: Attribute Value \"timestamp\" 1550086450124 \"message\" \"User 'xyz' logged out\" \"auditId\" 123 HTTP endpoint Once configured, your JSON data can be sent to the following endpoint in a POST request: United States (US) endpoint: https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 Copy European Union (EU) endpoint: https://log-api.eu.newrelic.com/log/v1 Copy Here's an example of a JSON POST request: POST /log/v1 HTTP/1.1 Host: log-api.newrelic.com Content-Type: application/json X-License-Key: <YOUR_LICENSE_KEY> Accept: */* Content-Length: 133 { \"timestamp\": <TIMESTAMP_IN_UNIX_EPOCH>, \"message\": \"User 'xyz' logged in\", \"logtype\": \"accesslogs\", \"service\": \"login-service\", \"hostname\": \"login.example.com\" } Copy Find log data For where to find data sent via the Log API (including from integrations that use that API), see Find log data. What's next? Now that you've enabled Log management, here are some potential next steps: Explore your data using the Logs UI. Configure your agent to see contextual log data, such as distributed tracing, stack traces, application logs, and more. Query your data and create custom dashboards, charts, or alerts.

To ensure data privacy and to limit the types of information New Relic receives, no customer data is captured except what you supply in API calls or log forwarder configuration. All data for the logs service is then reported to New Relic over HTTPS. This document describes additional security considerations for your logging data. For more information about New Relic's security measures: See our security and privacy documentation. Visit the New Relic security website. Read this blog post that explains how you can use our log management tools to gain visibility into some of the most severe threats to modern digital businesses. Automatic obfuscation The log management service automatically masks number patterns that appear to be for items such as credit cards or Social Security numbers. All integers, including spaces and hyphens that may be used as delimiters, are replaced with a string of Xes. Numbers that appear to be a credit card (thirteen to sixteen digits) are obfuscated as XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX. For example: Numbers with hyphens, such as 4111-1111-1111-1111 Numbers with spaces, such as 4111 1111 1111 1111 Numbers with thirteen (Visa), fourteen (Diner's Club), fifteen (American Express, JCB), or sixteen digits (Visa, Mastercard, Discover, JCB), such as 4111111111111111 Nine-digit numbers with hyphens that appear to be Social Security numbers, such as 123-45-6789, are obfuscated as XXXXXXXXX. Nine-digit numbers with spaces, such as 123 45 6789, or hyphens in a different pattern, such as 12-345-67-89, are not automatically obfuscated. If you need to opt out of automatic obfuscation, get support at support.newrelic.com. Customize your security settings The data you send to New Relic, including any additional filtering, is controlled by the configuration of the log forwarder you use, such as FluentD. Because you control what customer data is logged, be sure to follow your organization's security guidelines to mask, obfuscate, or prevent sending any sensitive data.",

      "body": "As applications move towards the cloud, microservices architecture is becoming more dispersed, making the ability to monitor logs essential. New Relic offers a fast, scalable log management platform so you can connect your logs with the rest of your telemetry and infrastructure data in a single place. Our log management solution provides deeper visibility into application and infrastructure performance data (events and errors) to reduce mean-time-to-resolve (MTTR) and quickly troubleshoot production incidents. It does this by providing super-fast searching capabilities, alerts, and co-location of application, infrastructure, and log data, while visualizing everything from a single place. Find problems faster, reduce context switching Log management provides a way to connect your log data with the rest of your application and infrastructure data, allowing you to get to the root cause of problems quickly, without losing context switching between tools. Log management features include: Instantly search through your logs. Visualize your log data directly from the Logs UI. Use logging data to create custom charts, dashboards, and alerts. Troubleshoot performance issues without switching between tools. Bring in your logging data You can bring your log data into New Relic using a compatible log forwarding plugin, or with OpenTelemetry. Forward your logs using our Infrastructure agent or our Kubernetes plugin. Use our plugins for well-known log forwarders, like Fluentd, Fluent Bit, and Logstash. Stream or ship your logs from Amazon using AWS Lambda or Kinesis. Send your logs data using the Logs API. Once log management is enabled, you can also connect your logs with your APM agent, Kubernetes clusters, or distributed tracing to get additional contextual logging data with our logs in context extensions. View your logging data in New Relic You can explore your logging data in the UI or by API: Logs UI at one.newrelic.com Logs UI for EU region data center if applicable: one.eu.newrelic.com You can also query the Log data type. For example, use NRQL to run: SELECT * FROM Log Copy For more information about query options in New Relic, see Query your data.",

      "body": "We offer a wide range of solutions to get your log data into New Relic. But in other situations where you don't have log forwarders (such as CDNs, hardware devices, or managed services), you can use syslog protocols via a TCP endpoint. You can forward your logs to New Relic using syslog clients such as rsyslog and syslog-ng. Compatibility and requirements To forward logs to New Relic using a syslog client, you need: A valid New Relic license key for the account you want to send logs to Some minor changes to the syslog client's configuration, as explained in this document Important Currently, our syslog endpoint only supports accounts in our US data center. Configure rsyslog To forward logs to New Relic with rsyslog: Install packages required to allow rsyslog to send logs using TLS encryption: sudo yum install rsyslog-gnutls ca-certificates Copy Optional: Configure rsyslog to tail log files and forward their contents to New Relic. Add the following to the /etc/rsyslog.conf file in order to enable its text file input module: module(load=\"imfile\" PollingInterval=\"10\" statefile.directory=\"/var/spool/rsyslog\" ) Copy In the /etc/rsyslog.d/ directory, create a text file named newrelic.conf. Explicitly include the newly created newrelic.conf to the /etc/rsyslog.d/ file: include(file=\"/etc/rsyslog.conf.d/newrelic.conf\") Copy Add the following to newrelic.conf, replacing YOUR_LICENSE_KEY with your New Relic license key: ## Specify each of the files to be tailed in case step 1 is done input(type=\"imfile\" ruleset=\"infiles\" Tag=\"<YOUR_FILE_TAG>\" File=\"<PATH_TO_FILE>\" StateFile=\"<UNIQUE_STATEFILE_NAME >\") ## Template expected by the New Relic Syslog endpoint template(name=\"newrelic-rfc5424\" type=\"string\" string=\"<YOUR_LICENSE_KEY> <%pri%>%protocol-version% %timestamp:::date-rfc3339% %hostname% %app-name% %procid% %msgid% %structured-data% %msg%\\n\" ) ## Configure TLS and log forwarding global(DefaultNetstreamDriver=\"gtls\" DefaultNetstreamDriverCAFile=\"/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt\" ) action(type=\"omfwd\" Target=\"newrelic.syslog.nr-data.net\" Port=\"6514\" Protocol=\"tcp\" Template=\"newrelic-rfc5424\" ResendLastMSGOnReconnect=\"on\" StreamDriver=\"gtls\" StreamDriverAuthMode=\"x509/name\" StreamDriverPermittedPeers=\"*.syslog.nr-data.net\" StreamDriverMode=\"1\" ) Copy Restart the rsyslog service by running: sudo systemctl restart rsyslog Copy Check your New Relic account for logs. Legacy config file for rsyslog 7 or earlier If you are using rsyslog version 7 or below, the configuration files need to be adapted to the obsolete legacy format. This format is only kept for retro compatibility purposes. We strongly recommend to avoid using it, as stated in the rsyslog documentation. Install packages required to allow rsyslog to send logs using TLS encryption: sudo yum install rsyslog-gnutls ca-certificates Copy Optional: Configure rsyslog to tail log files and forward their contents to New Relic. Add the following to the /etc/rsyslog.conf file in order to enable its text file input module: $ModLoad imfile $InputFilePollInterval 10 $PrivDropToGroup adm $WorkDirectory /var/spool/rsyslog Copy In the /etc/rsyslog.d/ directory, create a text file named newrelic.conf.

Define the sources to be monitored by adding: source s_src { internal(); }; Copy Optional: Configure syslog-ng to tail files by adding the following to the Sources configuration block: source s_files { file(\"<PATH_TO_FILE>\"); }; Copy Define the New Relic syslog format and add your New Relic license key: template NRFormat { template(\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY <${PRI}>1 ${ISODATE} ${HOST:--} ${PROGRAM:--} ${PID:--} ${MSGID:--} ${SDATA:--} $MSG\\n\"); template_escape(no); }; Copy Add the New Relic Syslog endpoint: destination d_newrelic { network(\"newrelic.syslog.nr-data.net\" port(6514) transport(\"tls\") tls(peer-verify(no)) template(NRFormat) ); }; Copy Add the following output to the log path configuration block: log { source(s_src); source(s_files); ## in case step 4 is implemented. destination(d_newrelic); }; Copy Restart syslog-ng by running: sudo service syslog-ng restart Copy Check your New Relic account for logs.

      "body": "If our logging solutions don't meet your needs, you can use our Log API to send log data directly to New Relic's Log management via an HTTP endpoint. Want to try out our Log API? Create a New Relic account for free! No credit card required. Compatibility and requirements Requirements include: A New Relic license key For payload details, see limits and restricted characters. HTTP setup To send log data to your New Relic account: Get your New Relic license key. Generate the JSON message using the required headers and body fields. Ensure you're providing an Api-Key or License-Key via headers or query parameters Submit the JSON message to the HTTP endpoint in a POST request. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your account for data. HTTP headers When creating your HTTP headers, use these guidelines: Header Supported values Content-Type Required application/json json application/gzip gzip Api-Key Required A New Relic license key. You can also send this via query parameter. You can also use an Insights insert key but the license key is preferred. Gzipped JSON formatting is accepted. If sending compressed JSON, please include the Content-Type: application/json and Content-Encoding: gzip headers. HTTP query parameters The license key can also be passed as a query string parameter. This can be useful when sending logs from cloud-based sources that don't allow custom HTTP request headers. Query parameter Value Api-Key Your license key. Use this key whenever you send a header. You can also use an Insights insert key but the license key is preferred. JSON body You can send your JSON message using either a simplified or detailed set of attributes: Simplified JSON body message When using the simplified format to create your JSON message, send a single JSON object with the following: Field Value type Format Required Notes \"timestamp\" Integer Either milliseconds or seconds since epoch No If the field is not specific as millisecond or seconds since epoch, the message will be timestamped using the ingest time \"message\" String any string No This is the main log message field that is searched by default \"logtype\" String any string No Primary field for identifying logs and matching parsing rules other_fields (must not contain white space) String any string No These will become attributes of the log message Note: Log management does not support white space in attribute names Detailed JSON body message When using the detailed format to create your body, it must be a JSON array containing one or more JSON objects, each of which with the following format: Field Value type Format Required Notes \"common\" Object See common. No Any attributes that are common to all log messages \"logs\" Array See logs. Yes Array with the log entries Limits and restricted characters Caution Avoid calling our API from within the code of a customer-facing application. This can cause performance issues or block your application if response time is slow. If you need to do it this way, call our API asynchronously to avoid these performance issues. Restrictions on logs sent to the Log API: Payload total size: 1MB(10^6 bytes) maximum per POST. We highly recommend using compression. The payload must be encoded as UTF-8. Number of attributes per event: 255 maximum Length of attribute name: 255 characters Length of attribute value: 4096 maximum character length Some specific attributes have additional restrictions: accountId: This is a reserved attribute name. If it is included, it will be dropped during ingest. entity.guid, entity.name, and entity.type: These attributes are used internally to identify entities. Any values submitted with these keys in the attributes section of a metric data point may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. For more information please refer to Entity synthesis. appId: Value must be an integer. If it is not an integer, the attribute name and value will be dropped during ingest. eventType: Can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, _ underscores, and : colons. timestamp: Must be a Unix epoch timestamp. You can define timestamps either in seconds or in milliseconds. Important Payloads with timestamps older than 48 hours may be dropped. Rate limits on logs sent to the Log API: Maximum rate for HTTP requests sent to the Log API: 300,000 requests per minute Maximum rate of uncompressed Log JSON bytes sent to the Log API: 10 GB per minute Rate limit violations Exceeding rate limits affects how the Log API behaves. Follow these instructions if this happens. HTTP requests per minute When the maximum request rate limit is exceeded for an account, the New Relic Log API returns a 429 response for the remainder of the minute. This response includes a Retry-After header indicating how long to wait in seconds before resubmitting or sending new data. To resolve this issue, either reduce the number of data points you are sending, or request a rate limit change. Subsequent subscription changes do not impact modified rate limits. If an account change impacts your rate limit, you must notify us to adjust your rate limit. To request rate limit changes, contact your New Relic account representative, or visit our Support portal. JSON bytes per minute When the maximum Log JSON byte limit is exceeded for an account, the New Relic Log API returns a 429 response for the remainder of the minute. This response includes a Retry-After header indicating how long to wait in seconds before resubmitting or sending new data. To resolve this issue, try to reduce the amount of log data you are sending, or spread it out over a larger period of time. To request rate limit changes, contact your New Relic account representative, or visit our Support portal. Log payload format We accept any valid JSON payload. The payload must encoded as UTF-8. Important Log management does not support white space in attribute names. For example, {\"Sample Attribute\": \"Value\"} would cause errors. JSON message attributes Common block attributes This is a block containing attributes that will be common to all log entries in logs: Field Value type Format Required Notes \"timestamp\" Integer Milliseconds or seconds since epoch No Message timestamp default to ingest time \"attributes\" Object JSON No This sub-object contains all other attributes of the message Logs block attributes This is an array containing log entries with the following format: Field Value type Format Required Notes \"timestamp\" Integer Milliseconds or seconds since epoch No Message timestamp default to ingest time \"attributes\" Object JSON No This sub-object contains all other attributes of the message \"message\" String (any string) Yes This is the main log message field that is searched by default \"log\" String (any string) No We will rewrite this string as the field message on ingest \"LOG\" String (any string) No We will rewrite this string as the field message on ingest \"MESSAGE\" String (any string) No We will rewrite this string as the field message on ingest JSON message attribute parsing This will attempt to parse any message attribute as JSON. If the message attribute is JSON, it will be parsed and the resultant JSON attributes will be added to the event. If the message attribute is not JSON, it is left as is. For example, the event: { \"timestamp\": 1562767499238, \"message\": \"{\\\"service-name\\\": \\\"login-service\\\", \\\"user\\\": {\\\"id\\\": 123, \\\"name\\\": \\\"alice\\\"}}\" } Copy Will be treated as: { \"timestamp\": 1562767499238, \"message\": \"{\\\"service-name\\\": \\\"my-service\\\", \\\"user\\\": {\\\"id\\\": 123, \\\"name\\\": \\\"alice\\\"}}\", \"service-name\": \"my-service\", \"user\": { \"id\": 123, \"name\": \"alice\" } } Copy Important Log management does not support white space in attribute names. For example, {\"Sample Attribute\": \"Value\"} would cause errors. Log JSON example Attributes may be scalar JSON types like string and number, but may also be compound (or nested) objects. Compound attributes will have their leaf attributes stored with flattened names. For instance, a compound user attribute in a log entry's attributes: \"attributes\": { \"action\": \"login\", \"user\": { \"id\": 123, \"name\": \"alice\" } } Copy will result in the following attributes being stored with the log event: Attribute Value \"action\" \"login\" \"user.id\" 123 \"user.name\" \"alice\" Log POST example Log POST message example: POST /log/v1 HTTP/1.1 Host: log-api.newrelic.com Content-Type: application/json X-License-Key: <YOUR_LICENSE_KEY> Accept: */* Content-Length: 319 [{ \"common\": { \"attributes\": { \"logtype\": \"accesslogs\", \"service\": \"login-service\", \"hostname\": \"login.example.com\" } }, \"logs\": [{ \"timestamp\": <TIMESTAMP_IN_UNIX_EPOCH>, \"message\": \"User 'xyz' logged in\" },{ \"timestamp\": <TIMESTAMP_IN_UNIX_EPOCH>, \"message\": \"User 'xyz' logged out\", \"attributes\": { \"auditId\": 123 } }] }] Copy The above POST message would result in the following log messages being stored in Log management: Example of stored common block attributes: Attribute Value \"logtype\" \"accesslogs\" \"service\" \"login-service\" \"hostname\" \"login.example.com\" Example of stored logs block attributes example: Attribute Value \"timestamp\" 1550086450124 \"message\" \"User 'xyz' logged out\" \"auditId\" 123 HTTP endpoint Once configured, your JSON data can be sent to the following endpoint in a POST request: United States (US) endpoint: https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 Copy European Union (EU) endpoint: https://log-api.eu.newrelic.com/log/v1 Copy Here's an example of a JSON POST request: POST /log/v1 HTTP/1.1 Host: log-api.newrelic.com Content-Type: application/json X-License-Key: <YOUR_LICENSE_KEY> Accept: */* Content-Length: 133 { \"timestamp\": <TIMESTAMP_IN_UNIX_EPOCH>, \"message\": \"User 'xyz' logged in\", \"logtype\": \"accesslogs\", \"service\": \"login-service\", \"hostname\": \"login.example.com\" } Copy Find log data For where to find data sent via the Log API (including from integrations that use that API), see Find log data.

Important Log management does not support white space in attribute names. For example, {\"Sample Attribute\": \"Value\"} would cause errors. JSON message attributes Common block attributes This is a block containing attributes that will be common to all log entries in logs: Field Value type Format Required Notes \"timestamp\" Integer Milliseconds or seconds since epoch No Message timestamp default to ingest time \"attributes\" Object JSON No This sub-object contains all other attributes of the message Logs block attributes This is an array containing log entries with the following format: Field Value type Format Required Notes \"timestamp\" Integer Milliseconds or seconds since epoch No Message timestamp default to ingest time \"attributes\" Object JSON No This sub-object contains all other attributes of the message \"message\" String (any string) Yes This is the main log message field that is searched by default \"log\" String (any string) No We will rewrite this string as the field message on ingest \"LOG\" String (any string) No We will rewrite this string as the field message on ingest \"MESSAGE\" String (any string) No We will rewrite this string as the field message on ingest JSON message attribute parsing This will attempt to parse any message attribute as JSON. If the message attribute is JSON, it will be parsed and the resultant JSON attributes will be added to the event. If the message attribute is not JSON, it is left as is. For example, the event: { \"timestamp\": 1562767499238, \"message\": \"{\\\"service-name\\\": \\\"login-service\\\", \\\"user\\\": {\\\"id\\\": 123, \\\"name\\\": \\\"alice\\\"}}\" } Copy Will be treated as: { \"timestamp\": 1562767499238, \"message\": \"{\\\"service-name\\\": \\\"my-service\\\", \\\"user\\\": {\\\"id\\\": 123, \\\"name\\\": \\\"alice\\\"}}\", \"service-name\": \"my-service\", \"user\": { \"id\": 123, \"name\": \"alice\" } } Copy Important Log management does not support white space in attribute names. For example, {\"Sample Attribute\": \"Value\"} would cause errors. Log JSON example Attributes may be scalar JSON types like string and number, but may also be compound (or nested) objects. Compound attributes will have their leaf attributes stored with flattened names. For instance, a compound user attribute in a log entry's attributes: \"attributes\": { \"action\": \"login\", \"user\": { \"id\": 123, \"name\": \"alice\" } } Copy will result in the following attributes being stored with the log event: Attribute Value \"action\" \"login\" \"user.id\" 123 \"user.name\" \"alice\" Log POST example Log POST message example: POST /log/v1 HTTP/1.1 Host: log-api.newrelic.com Content-Type: application/json X-License-Key: <YOUR_LICENSE_KEY> Accept: */* Content-Length: 319 [{ \"common\": { \"attributes\": { \"logtype\": \"accesslogs\", \"service\": \"login-service\", \"hostname\": \"login.example.com\" } }, \"logs\": [{ \"timestamp\": <TIMESTAMP_IN_UNIX_EPOCH>, \"message\": \"User 'xyz' logged in\" },{ \"timestamp\": <TIMESTAMP_IN_UNIX_EPOCH>, \"message\": \"User 'xyz' logged out\", \"attributes\": { \"auditId\": 123 } }] }] Copy The above POST message would result in the following log messages being stored in Log management: Example of stored common block attributes: Attribute Value \"logtype\" \"accesslogs\" \"service\" \"login-service\" \"hostname\" \"login.example.com\" Example of stored logs block attributes example: Attribute Value \"timestamp\" 1550086450124 \"message\" \"User 'xyz' logged out\" \"auditId\" 123 HTTP endpoint Once configured, your JSON data can be sent to the following endpoint in a POST request: United States (US) endpoint: https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 Copy European Union (EU) endpoint: https://log-api.eu.newrelic.com/log/v1 Copy Here's an example of a JSON POST request: POST /log/v1 HTTP/1.1 Host: log-api.newrelic.com Content-Type: application/json X-License-Key: <YOUR_LICENSE_KEY> Accept: */* Content-Length: 133 { \"timestamp\": <TIMESTAMP_IN_UNIX_EPOCH>, \"message\": \"User 'xyz' logged in\", \"logtype\": \"accesslogs\", \"service\": \"login-service\", \"hostname\": \"login.example.com\" } Copy Find log data For where to find data sent via the Log API (including from integrations that use that API), see Find log data.

Create a New Relic account for free! No credit card required. Compatibility and requirements Requirements include: A New Relic license key For payload details, see limits and restricted characters. HTTP setup To send log data to your New Relic account: Get your New Relic license key. Generate the JSON message using the required headers and body fields. Ensure you're providing an Api-Key or License-Key via headers or query parameters Submit the JSON message to the HTTP endpoint in a POST request. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your account for data. HTTP headers When creating your HTTP headers, use these guidelines: Header Supported values Content-Type Required application/json json application/gzip gzip Api-Key Required A New Relic license key. You can also send this via query parameter. You can also use an Insights insert key but the license key is preferred. Gzipped JSON formatting is accepted. If sending compressed JSON, please include the Content-Type: application/json and Content-Encoding: gzip headers. HTTP query parameters The license key can also be passed as a query string parameter. This can be useful when sending logs from cloud-based sources that don't allow custom HTTP request headers. Query parameter Value Api-Key Your license key. Use this key whenever you send a header. You can also use an Insights insert key but the license key is preferred. JSON body You can send your JSON message using either a simplified or detailed set of attributes: Simplified JSON body message When using the simplified format to create your JSON message, send a single JSON object with the following: Field Value type Format Required Notes \"timestamp\" Integer Either milliseconds or seconds since epoch No If the field is not specific as millisecond or seconds since epoch, the message will be timestamped using the ingest time \"message\" String any string No This is the main log message field that is searched by default \"logtype\" String any string No Primary field for identifying logs and matching parsing rules other_fields (must not contain white space) String any string No These will become attributes of the log message Note: Log management does not support white space in attribute names Detailed JSON body message When using the detailed format to create your body, it must be a JSON array containing one or more JSON objects, each of which with the following format: Field Value type Format Required Notes \"common\" Object See common. No Any attributes that are common to all log messages \"logs\" Array See logs. Yes Array with the log entries Limits and restricted characters Caution Avoid calling our API from within the code of a customer-facing application. This can cause performance issues or block your application if response time is slow. If you need to do it this way, call our API asynchronously to avoid these performance issues. Restrictions on logs sent to the Log API: Payload total size: 1MB(10^6 bytes) maximum per POST. We highly recommend using compression. The payload must be encoded as UTF-8. Number of attributes per event: 255 maximum Length of attribute name: 255 characters Length of attribute value: 4096 maximum character length Some specific attributes have additional restrictions: accountId: This is a reserved attribute name. If it is included, it will be dropped during ingest. entity.guid, entity.name, and entity.type: These attributes are used internally to identify entities. Any values submitted with these keys in the attributes section of a metric data point may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. For more information please refer to Entity synthesis. appId: Value must be an integer. If it is not an integer, the attribute name and value will be dropped during ingest. eventType: Can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, _ underscores, and : colons. timestamp: Must be a Unix epoch timestamp. You can define timestamps either in seconds or in milliseconds. Important Payloads with timestamps older than 48 hours may be dropped. Rate limits on logs sent to the Log API: Maximum rate for HTTP requests sent to the Log API: 300,000 requests per minute Maximum rate of uncompressed Log JSON bytes sent to the Log API: 10 GB per minute Rate limit violations Exceeding rate limits affects how the Log API behaves. Follow these instructions if this happens. HTTP requests per minute When the maximum request rate limit is exceeded for an account, the New Relic Log API returns a 429 response for the remainder of the minute. This response includes a Retry-After header indicating how long to wait in seconds before resubmitting or sending new data. To resolve this issue, either reduce the number of data points you are sending, or request a rate limit change. Subsequent subscription changes do not impact modified rate limits. If an account change impacts your rate limit, you must notify us to adjust your rate limit. To request rate limit changes, contact your New Relic account representative, or visit our Support portal. JSON bytes per minute When the maximum Log JSON byte limit is exceeded for an account, the New Relic Log API returns a 429 response for the remainder of the minute.

Create a New Relic account for free! No credit card required. Compatibility and requirements Requirements include: A New Relic license key For payload details, see limits and restricted characters. HTTP setup To send log data to your New Relic account: Get your New Relic license key. Generate the JSON message using the required headers and body fields. Ensure you're providing an Api-Key or License-Key via headers or query parameters Submit the JSON message to the HTTP endpoint in a POST request. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your account for data. HTTP headers When creating your HTTP headers, use these guidelines: Header Supported values Content-Type Required application/json json application/gzip gzip Api-Key Required A New Relic license key. You can also send this via query parameter. You can also use an Insights insert key but the license key is preferred. Gzipped JSON formatting is accepted. If sending compressed JSON, please include the Content-Type: application/json and Content-Encoding: gzip headers. HTTP query parameters The license key can also be passed as a query string parameter. This can be useful when sending logs from cloud-based sources that don't allow custom HTTP request headers. Query parameter Value Api-Key Your license key. Use this key whenever you send a header. You can also use an Insights insert key but the license key is preferred. JSON body You can send your JSON message using either a simplified or detailed set of attributes: Simplified JSON body message When using the simplified format to create your JSON message, send a single JSON object with the following: Field Value type Format Required Notes \"timestamp\" Integer Either milliseconds or seconds since epoch No If the field is not specific as millisecond or seconds since epoch, the message will be timestamped using the ingest time \"message\" String any string No This is the main log message field that is searched by default \"logtype\" String any string No Primary field for identifying logs and matching parsing rules other_fields (must not contain white space) String any string No These will become attributes of the log message Note: Log management does not support white space in attribute names Detailed JSON body message When using the detailed format to create your body, it must be a JSON array containing one or more JSON objects, each of which with the following format: Field Value type Format Required Notes \"common\" Object See common. No Any attributes that are common to all log messages \"logs\" Array See logs. Yes Array with the log entries Limits and restricted characters Caution Avoid calling our API from within the code of a customer-facing application. This can cause performance issues or block your application if response time is slow. If you need to do it this way, call our API asynchronously to avoid these performance issues. Restrictions on logs sent to the Log API: Payload total size: 1MB(10^6 bytes) maximum per POST. We highly recommend using compression. The payload must be encoded as UTF-8. Number of attributes per event: 255 maximum Length of attribute name: 255 characters Length of attribute value: 4096 maximum character length Some specific attributes have additional restrictions: accountId: This is a reserved attribute name. If it is included, it will be dropped during ingest. entity.guid, entity.name, and entity.type: These attributes are used internally to identify entities. Any values submitted with these keys in the attributes section of a metric data point may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. For more information please refer to Entity synthesis. appId: Value must be an integer. If it is not an integer, the attribute name and value will be dropped during ingest. eventType: Can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, _ underscores, and : colons. timestamp: Must be a Unix epoch timestamp. You can define timestamps either in seconds or in milliseconds. Important Payloads with timestamps older than 48 hours may be dropped. Rate limits on logs sent to the Log API: Maximum rate for HTTP requests sent to the Log API: 300,000 requests per minute Maximum rate of uncompressed Log JSON bytes sent to the Log API: 10 GB per minute Rate limit violations Exceeding rate limits affects how the Log API behaves. Follow these instructions if this happens. HTTP requests per minute When the maximum request rate limit is exceeded for an account, the New Relic Log API returns a 429 response for the remainder of the minute. This response includes a Retry-After header indicating how long to wait in seconds before resubmitting or sending new data. To resolve this issue, either reduce the number of data points you are sending, or request a rate limit change. Subsequent subscription changes do not impact modified rate limits. If an account change impacts your rate limit, you must notify us to adjust your rate limit. To request rate limit changes, contact your New Relic account representative, or visit our Support portal. JSON bytes per minute When the maximum Log JSON byte limit is exceeded for an account, the New Relic Log API returns a 429 response for the remainder of the minute. This response includes a Retry-After header indicating how long to wait in seconds before resubmitting or sending new data. To resolve this issue, try to reduce the amount of log data you are sending, or spread it out over a larger period of time. To request rate limit changes, contact your New Relic account representative, or visit our Support portal. Log payload format We accept any valid JSON payload. The payload must encoded as UTF-8. Important Log management does not support white space in attribute names. For example, {\"Sample Attribute\": \"Value\"} would cause errors. JSON message attributes Common block attributes This is a block containing attributes that will be common to all log entries in logs: Field Value type Format Required Notes \"timestamp\" Integer Milliseconds or seconds since epoch No Message timestamp default to ingest time \"attributes\" Object JSON No This sub-object contains all other attributes of the message Logs block attributes This is an array containing log entries with the following format: Field Value type Format Required Notes \"timestamp\" Integer Milliseconds or seconds since epoch No Message timestamp default to ingest time \"attributes\" Object JSON No This sub-object contains all other attributes of the message \"message\" String (any string) Yes This is the main log message field that is searched by default \"log\" String (any string) No We will rewrite this string as the field message on ingest \"LOG\" String (any string) No We will rewrite this string as the field message on ingest \"MESSAGE\" String (any string) No We will rewrite this string as the field message on ingest JSON message attribute parsing This will attempt to parse any message attribute as JSON. If the message attribute is JSON, it will be parsed and the resultant JSON attributes will be added to the event. If the message attribute is not JSON, it is left as is. For example, the event: { \"timestamp\": 1562767499238, \"message\": \"{\\\"service-name\\\": \\\"login-service\\\", \\\"user\\\": {\\\"id\\\": 123, \\\"name\\\": \\\"alice\\\"}}\" } Copy Will be treated as: { \"timestamp\": 1562767499238, \"message\": \"{\\\"service-name\\\": \\\"my-service\\\", \\\"user\\\": {\\\"id\\\": 123, \\\"name\\\": \\\"alice\\\"}}\", \"service-name\": \"my-service\", \"user\": { \"id\": 123, \"name\": \"alice\" } } Copy Important Log management does not support white space in attribute names. For example, {\"Sample Attribute\": \"Value\"} would cause errors. Log JSON example Attributes may be scalar JSON types like string and number, but may also be compound (or nested) objects. Compound attributes will have their leaf attributes stored with flattened names. For instance, a compound user attribute in a log entry's attributes: \"attributes\": { \"action\": \"login\", \"user\": { \"id\": 123, \"name\": \"alice\" } } Copy will result in the following attributes being stored with the log event: Attribute Value \"action\" \"login\" \"user.id\" 123 \"user.name\" \"alice\" Log POST example Log POST message example: POST /log/v1 HTTP/1.1 Host: log-api.newrelic.com Content-Type: application/json X-License-Key: <YOUR_LICENSE_KEY> Accept: */* Content-Length: 319 [{ \"common\": { \"attributes\": { \"logtype\": \"accesslogs\", \"service\": \"login-service\", \"hostname\": \"login.example.com\" } }, \"logs\": [{ \"timestamp\": <TIMESTAMP_IN_UNIX_EPOCH>, \"message\": \"User 'xyz' logged in\" },{ \"timestamp\": <TIMESTAMP_IN_UNIX_EPOCH>, \"message\": \"User 'xyz' logged out\", \"attributes\": { \"auditId\": 123 } }] }] Copy The above POST message would result in the following log messages being stored in Log management: Example of stored common block attributes: Attribute Value \"logtype\" \"accesslogs\" \"service\" \"login-service\" \"hostname\" \"login.example.com\" Example of stored logs block attributes example: Attribute Value \"timestamp\" 1550086450124 \"message\" \"User 'xyz' logged out\" \"auditId\" 123 HTTP endpoint Once configured, your JSON data can be sent to the following endpoint in a POST request: United States (US) endpoint: https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 Copy European Union (EU) endpoint: https://log-api.eu.newrelic.com/log/v1 Copy Here's an example of a JSON POST request: POST /log/v1 HTTP/1.1 Host: log-api.newrelic.com Content-Type: application/json X-License-Key: <YOUR_LICENSE_KEY> Accept: */* Content-Length: 133 { \"timestamp\": <TIMESTAMP_IN_UNIX_EPOCH>, \"message\": \"User 'xyz' logged in\", \"logtype\": \"accesslogs\", \"service\": \"login-service\", \"hostname\": \"login.example.com\" } Copy Find log data For where to find data sent via the Log API (including from integrations that use that API), see Find log data.

      "body": "Problem When JSON content is sent in the message field, it's not automatically parsed and is not being stored as attributes (key-value pairs). Instead, the content remains in the message. It also may be truncated if the message exceeds the character limit. Solution Reasons this may be happening: If the content is not a valid JSON, it won't be parsed. Instead it will be stored as a string and truncated if it exceeds the character limit. The content is a valid JSON but \"stringified\" with escape characters. If that's the case, it will first be evaluated as a string, meaning that it will be truncated to 4096 characters before being evaluated as JSON. The result of the truncation will be invalid JSON, and the data will be stored as a string. To solve this problem: send messages containing JSON that haven't been converted to a string. This content will be parsed even if the total length exceeds the character limit. If the JSON contains arrays, they'll be flattened and stored as unparsed strings.",

      "body": "Logs in context for the Python agent connects your logs and APM data in New Relic. Bringing all of this data together in a single tool helps you quickly get to the root cause of an issue and find the log lines that you need to identify and resolve a problem. Set up your Python app To enable logs in context for APM apps monitored by Python: Make sure you have already set up logging in New Relic. This includes configuring a supported log forwarder that collects your application logs and extends the metadata that is forwarded to New Relic. Install or update to the latest Python agent version, and enable distributed tracing. Use Python agent version 5.4.0 or higher for logs in context. Configure logs in context for your log handler. Python StreamHandler example Enabling logs in Python is as simple as instantiating a log formatter and adding it to your log handler. This example uses a StreamHandler which by default writes logs to sys.stderr, but any handler can be used. For more information about configuring log handlers, see the Python.org documentation. # Import the logging module and the New Relic log formatter import logging from newrelic.agent import NewRelicContextFormatter # Instantiate a new log handler handler = logging.StreamHandler() # Instantiate the log formatter and add it to the log handler formatter = NewRelicContextFormatter() handler.setFormatter(formatter) # Get the root logger and add the handler to it root_logger = logging.getLogger() root_logger.addHandler(handler) Copy To verify that you have configured the log appender correctly, run your application, then check your logs data in New Relic One using the query operator has:span.id has:trace.id. If everything is configured correctly and your data is being forwarded to New Relic with the enriched metadata, your logs should now be emitted as JSON and contain trace.id and span.id fields. If you don't see log data in the UI, follow the troubleshooting procedures. What's next? After you set up APM logs in context, make the most of your logging data: Explore the logging data across your platform with our Logs UI. See your logs in context of your app's performance in the APM UI. Troubleshoot errors with distributed tracing, stack traces, application logs, and more. Get deeper visibility into both your application and your platform performance data by forwarding your logs with our infrastructure monitoring agent. Review your infrastructure logs in the UI.

JSON message attributes Common block attributes This is a block containing attributes that will be common to all log entries in logs: Field Value type Format Required Notes \"timestamp\" Integer Milliseconds or seconds since epoch No Message timestamp default to ingest time \"attributes\" Object JSON No This sub-object contains all other attributes of the message Logs block attributes This is an array containing log entries with the following format: Field Value type Format Required Notes \"timestamp\" Integer Milliseconds or seconds since epoch No Message timestamp default to ingest time \"attributes\" Object JSON No This sub-object contains all other attributes of the message \"message\" String (any string) Yes This is the main log message field that is searched by default \"log\" String (any string) No We will rewrite this string as the field message on ingest \"LOG\" String (any string) No We will rewrite this string as the field message on ingest \"MESSAGE\" String (any string) No We will rewrite this string as the field message on ingest JSON message attribute parsing This will attempt to parse any message attribute as JSON. If the message attribute is JSON, it will be parsed and the resultant JSON attributes will be added to the event. If the message attribute is not JSON, it is left as is. For example, the event: { \"timestamp\": 1562767499238, \"message\": \"{\\\"service-name\\\": \\\"login-service\\\", \\\"user\\\": {\\\"id\\\": 123, \\\"name\\\": \\\"alice\\\"}}\" } Copy Will be treated as: { \"timestamp\": 1562767499238, \"message\": \"{\\\"service-name\\\": \\\"my-service\\\", \\\"user\\\": {\\\"id\\\": 123, \\\"name\\\": \\\"alice\\\"}}\", \"service-name\": \"my-service\", \"user\": { \"id\": 123, \"name\": \"alice\" } } Copy Important Log management does not support white space in attribute names. For example, {\"Sample Attribute\": \"Value\"} would cause errors. Log JSON example Attributes may be scalar JSON types like string and number, but may also be compound (or nested) objects. Compound attributes will have their leaf attributes stored with flattened names. For instance, a compound user attribute in a log entry's attributes: \"attributes\": { \"action\": \"login\", \"user\": { \"id\": 123, \"name\": \"alice\" } } Copy will result in the following attributes being stored with the log event: Attribute Value \"action\" \"login\" \"user.id\" 123 \"user.name\" \"alice\" Log POST example Log POST message example: POST /log/v1 HTTP/1.1 Host: log-api.newrelic.com Content-Type: application/json X-License-Key: <YOUR_LICENSE_KEY> Accept: */* Content-Length: 319 [{ \"common\": { \"attributes\": { \"logtype\": \"accesslogs\", \"service\": \"login-service\", \"hostname\": \"login.example.com\" } }, \"logs\": [{ \"timestamp\": <TIMESTAMP_IN_UNIX_EPOCH>, \"message\": \"User 'xyz' logged in\" },{ \"timestamp\": <TIMESTAMP_IN_UNIX_EPOCH>, \"message\": \"User 'xyz' logged out\", \"attributes\": { \"auditId\": 123 } }] }] Copy The above POST message would result in the following log messages being stored in Log management: Example of stored common block attributes: Attribute Value \"logtype\" \"accesslogs\" \"service\" \"login-service\" \"hostname\" \"login.example.com\" Example of stored logs block attributes example: Attribute Value \"timestamp\" 1550086450124 \"message\" \"User 'xyz' logged out\" \"auditId\" 123 HTTP endpoint Once configured, your JSON data can be sent to the following endpoint in a POST request: United States (US) endpoint: https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 Copy European Union (EU) endpoint: https://log-api.eu.newrelic.com/log/v1 Copy Here's an example of a JSON POST request: POST /log/v1 HTTP/1.1 Host: log-api.newrelic.com Content-Type: application/json X-License-Key: <YOUR_LICENSE_KEY> Accept: */* Content-Length: 133 { \"timestamp\": <TIMESTAMP_IN_UNIX_EPOCH>, \"message\": \"User 'xyz' logged in\", \"logtype\": \"accesslogs\", \"service\": \"login-service\", \"hostname\": \"login.example.com\" } Copy Find log data For where to find data sent via the Log API (including from integrations that use that API), see Find log data.

Instead, the content remains in the message. It also may be truncated if the message exceeds the character limit. Solution Reasons this may be happening: If the content is not a valid JSON, it won't be parsed. Instead it will be stored as a string and truncated if it exceeds the character limit. The content is a valid JSON but \"stringified\" with escape characters. If that's the case, it will first be evaluated as a string, meaning that it will be truncated to 4096 characters before being evaluated as JSON. The result of the truncation will be invalid JSON, and the data will be stored as a string. To solve this problem: send messages containing JSON that haven't been converted to a string. This content will be parsed even if the total length exceeds the character limit. If the JSON contains arrays, they'll be flattened and stored as unparsed strings.",

      "body": "After log event data has been shipped to New Relic, it can either be stored in our NRDB database or dropped (discarded). We can drop both log events and event attributes via drop filter rules. You can manage drop filter rules using our Logs UI, as explained in this document. You can also use NerdGraph. Savings, security, speed Drop filter rules help you accomplish several important goals: Lower costs by storing only logs relevant to your account. Protect privacy and security by removing personal identifiable information (PII). Reduce noise by removing irrelevant events and attributes. Caution Use caution when deciding to drop data. The data you drop is not recoverable. Before using this feature, review the responsibilities and considerations for dropping data. How drop filter rules work A drop filter rule matches data based on a query. When triggered, the drop filter rule removes the matching data from the ingestion pipeline before it is written to NRDB. This creates an explicit demarcation between the logs being forwarded from your domain and the data that New Relic collects. Since the data removed by the drop filter rule doesn't reach our backend, it cannot be queried: the data is gone and cannot be restored. During the ingestion process, customer log data can be parsed, transformed, or dropped before being stored in New Relic's database. Cautions when dropping data When creating drop rules, you are responsible for ensuring that the rules accurately identify and discard the data that meets the conditions that you have established. You are also responsible for monitoring the rule, as well as the data you disclose to New Relic. New Relic cannot guarantee that this functionality will completely resolve data disclosure concerns you may have. New Relic doesn't review or monitor how effective the rules you develop are. Creating rules about sensitive data can leak information about what kinds of data you maintain, including the format of your data or systems (for example, through referencing email addresses or specific credit card numbers). Any user with the relevant role-based access control permissions can view and edit all information in the rules you create. Create drop filter rules To create and edit drop filters, you must have admin permissions in New Relic, or you must be a member of a role with create and edit permissions for Insights > NRQL Drop Rules. Once a drop filter rule is active, it's applied to all log events ingested from that point onwards. Rules are not applied retroactively. Logs collected before creating a rule are not filtered by that rule. Filter or query the set of logs that contain the data you want to drop. Then, from Manage Data on the left nav of the Logs UI, click Create drop filter. To create a new drop filter rule, you can use new or existing log queries. Go to one.newrelic.com > Logs. Filter or query to the specific set of logs that contain the data to be dropped. Once the query is active, from Manage Data on the left nav of the Logs UI, click Create drop filter. Recommendation: Change the drop rule's default name to a meaningful name. Choose to either drop the entire log event that matches the query or just a specific subset of attributes in the matching events. Review the log partitions where this drop rule applies. Save the drop filter rule. Types of drop filter rules The drop filters UI prompts you to select whether to drop logs based on the query or on specific attributes. Drop log events The default type of drop filter rule is to drop logs. This option drops the entire log events that match the filter or query. When creating a rule, try to provide a specific query that only matches log data that should be dropped. Our drop filters process won't let you create drop filter rules without values in the matching query. This prevents badly formed rules from dropping all log data. Drop attributes You can specify attributes to be dropped in a log event that matches your query. At least one or more attributes must be selected. Any attribute which is selected will be dropped; all remaining attributes will be kept and stored in NRDB. Tip We recommend this method for removing fields that could contain personal identifiable information (PII) or other sensitive attributes without losing valuable monitoring data. View or delete drop filter rules To view or delete a drop filter rule: Go to one.newrelic.com > Logs. From Manage Data on the left nav of the Logs UI, click Drop filters. Click the delete icon next to the drop filter rule you want to remove. Once deleted, rules no longer filter ingested log events.",

      "body": "Use the Logs UI at one.newrelic.com or our EU region data center (if available) at one.eu.newrelic.com/ to: Spot interesting or significant patterns in your logs. Examine more context around a particular log line. Explore and manipulate your logging data with filters and parsing rules. Query and share the data with charts, add to dashboards, etc. Organize your account's log data, and optimize query performance with data partitions. Set up alert conditions for problems you want to prevent. To stay up to date with new capabilities and improvements, subscribe to our RSS feed for Logs release notes. Explore your log data Use the left nav in the Logs UI as an easy workflow through all logs, patterns, live-tail logging, and queries. Get more details about specific logs and their attributes from the center nav. To explore your logging data, follow this basic workflow. If you have not customized your New Relic One navigation bar, go to one.newrelic.com, click Browse data and select Logs. Look for patterns: To spot suspicious spikes or drops in log messages, click the log patterns icon on the left nav. To look at logs for a specific time period, click that point (or click and drag an area) on the chart, or use the time picker. Narrow your focus: To narrow the focus of your initial search results or quickly find outliers, expand any attributes in the log details to view the ten most common values within the results. For example, if a host listed under the hostname attribute is generating significantly more error messages than the others, select that value to apply it to your search. To make your log messages easier to query and understand, use our built-in parsing rules, or create your own parsing rules for attributes that match a particular value. To manage the amount of log data collected and to store fewer logs, create drop filter rules that avoid collecting data you don't need. Examine log details: Select a log message to view its details as a table of attributes or as JSON. To see which attributes are included in a log message, click the log line. Add or remove attributes as needed to help your query focus on the details you need. To help troubleshoot problems related to a specific value in the log details, click the Show surrounding logs icon for the attribute's details. To control which attributes appear in the results, click any highlighted value in the log's log_summary column. Search: By default, the Logs UI shows all your logs, but you can also search with keywords or phrases to find the results you want; for example, process failed. OR From the search field, use the type-ahead dropdowns to select an attribute, operator, and value; for example: service_name equals my service Copy For more information, see the Logs query syntax documentation. Tip To organize data within an account and to optimize query performance, create data partition rules. Get related logs: For example: To immediately see how your system responds to deployments or other app changes, enable live-tail logging. To view all the logs for a specific value, review the attributes list in the selected log's Log details. To help identify an issue's root cause before it occurred or its impact after an event, click the Show surrounding logs icon. Share your findings: Use any of the core New Relic One functions (specific account, time range, data explorer, query builder, etc.) to share the data with charts, add to dashboards, etc. For more information, see the examples in this document. Save your views You can save your logs query, table configuration, time range, and attribute grouping in a saved view, so that you can quickly return to it later. To save a log analytics view after you've configured the view: Click the Saved Views tab in the Logs UI left nav. Click Save current view. Give your saved view the name you want for it to be listed in the Saved Views tab. Select which aspects from the current view you want to save. Select the permission level: Private, Public (Read-only), and Public (Read and write). Public means that any user with access to the account is able to see the saved view. Click Save view. Examples Here are a few examples of how you can use the Logs UI to get detailed information. To use some of these examples, you must be able to see logs in context. Create an alert from log data You can create alert conditions directly in the Logs UI: Go to one.newrelic.com > Logs. Search for results that you want to alert on; for example, service_name:\"your service\" \"fatal error\". In the search bar, click the plus icon, then select Create an alert from this. Complete the Create alert condition that slides out, then review the NRQL query that will power the alert condition. After you save the Logs alert condition, you can view it in the Alerts UI, where you can make additional changes as needed. Add log volume chart to a dashboard You can add log charts to a dashboard directly from the Logs UI. Go to one.newrelic.com > Logs. Search for results you want to plot; for example, service_name:\"checkout service\" \"process failed\". OR Select a saved view. Click the dashboard icon, then fill out the details to add to an existing or new dashboard. You can also create charts with the data explorer or the query builder in New Relic One. Troubleshoot an error (logs in context) To troubleshoot errors this way, you must be able to see logs in context. Then, to have a better understanding of what was happening on the host at the time an error occurred in your app: Go to APM > (select an app) > Events > Error analytics and select an error trace. From the error trace Details, click See logs. From the Logs UI, browse the related log details. To identify the host generating the error, click Show surrounding logs. Troubleshoot latency (logs in context) To troubleshoot latency this way, you must be able to see logs in context. Then, to have a better understanding of how your systems were operating when performance noticeably slowed: Go to one.newrelic.com > Distributed tracing. Select a particularly slow trace. From the trace Details, click See logs for this trace. Browse related logs in the Logs UI. Links to logs in New Relic Depending on your New Relic subscription, you can access your logs from several places in the New Relic UI. For some of these options, you must be able to see logs in context. To view logs... Do this... Directly from the Logs UI Go to one.newrelic.com > Logs.

To drill down into additional details, click any highlighted attribute. Each log's summary in the Logs UI provides query options to add, exclude, replace, and more. Query structure Using the Logs UI, you can search through your log data by entering either simple keywords, such as new and relic, or phrases such as new relic agent, directly into the search field. You can also combine keywords or phrases with operators to form more complex queries. Tip Log queries in New Relic are based on the Lucene query language, and any Lucene function listed in this document is supported. (If a Lucene function is not listed, we do not support it.) For some helpful examples, check out this Lucene tutorial. General query rules: Log query rules Comments Case sensitive The query syntax is case sensitive for attributes values. Attribute names are always case sensitive. Exception: Wildcard searches are case insensitive for attribute values. Special characters When a term contains special characters, double-quote the term and escape the special characters using a backslash (\\). This includes special characters such as +, -, &, |, !, (, ), {, }, [, ], ^, \", ~, *, ?, :, /, or \\. Example: To query for \"POST /log/v1 HTTP/1.1\" 202, escape the quotes like this: \"\\\"POST /log/v1 HTTP/1.1\\\" 202\" Wildcard searches You can run wildcard searches using an asterisk (*) to replace zero or more characters. Example: new*relic Search with text To return more specific query results, use text searches to join together keywords or phrases. Text operators The Logs query syntax accepts the following text operators: Condition Text operator example Matching (keyword) Search for log results containing keywords entered separately: \"new\" \"relic\" Exact matching (phrase) Search for log results containing the specific phrase entered: \"new relic agent\" Either / Or Search for log results containing either or both of the keywords entered: new OR relic And Search for log results containing both of the keywords entered: new AND relic * Wildcard (zero or more) Search for log results containing both of the keywords entered, with zero or more characters between them: new*relic Negation (keyword) Search for log results that do not contain the specific keyword entered: -new Negation (phrase) Search for log results that do not contain the specific phrase entered. -\"new relic\" Search with attributes Use attribute searches to narrow the query results to a specific attribute or field. General operators The following operators can be used by all types of attributes: Condition General operator example Equal : Search for log results where the attribute equals the keyword specified. Example: The field hostname equals chi: hostname:chi Does not equal - : Search for log results where the attribute does not equal the keyword specified. Example: The field hostname does not equal chi. -hostname:chi Contains * Search for log results where the attribute contains the specified keyword. Example: The field hostname contains chi. hostname:*chi* Does not contain - * Search for log results where the attribute does not contain the specified keyword. Example: The field hostname does not contain chi. -hostname:*chi* Starts with * Search for log results where the attribute starts with the specified keyword specified. Example: The field hostname starts with chi. hostname:chi* Ends with * Search for log results where the attribute ends with the specified keyword specified.

      "body": "After log event data has been shipped to New Relic, it can either be stored in our NRDB database or dropped (discarded). We can drop both log events and event attributes via drop filter rules. You can manage drop filter rules using our Logs UI, as explained in this document. You can also use NerdGraph. Savings, security, speed Drop filter rules help you accomplish several important goals: Lower costs by storing only logs relevant to your account. Protect privacy and security by removing personal identifiable information (PII). Reduce noise by removing irrelevant events and attributes. Caution Use caution when deciding to drop data. The data you drop is not recoverable. Before using this feature, review the responsibilities and considerations for dropping data. How drop filter rules work A drop filter rule matches data based on a query. When triggered, the drop filter rule removes the matching data from the ingestion pipeline before it is written to NRDB. This creates an explicit demarcation between the logs being forwarded from your domain and the data that New Relic collects. Since the data removed by the drop filter rule doesn't reach our backend, it cannot be queried: the data is gone and cannot be restored. During the ingestion process, customer log data can be parsed, transformed, or dropped before being stored in New Relic's database. Cautions when dropping data When creating drop rules, you are responsible for ensuring that the rules accurately identify and discard the data that meets the conditions that you have established. You are also responsible for monitoring the rule, as well as the data you disclose to New Relic. New Relic cannot guarantee that this functionality will completely resolve data disclosure concerns you may have. New Relic doesn't review or monitor how effective the rules you develop are. Creating rules about sensitive data can leak information about what kinds of data you maintain, including the format of your data or systems (for example, through referencing email addresses or specific credit card numbers). Any user with the relevant role-based access control permissions can view and edit all information in the rules you create. Create drop filter rules To create and edit drop filters, you must have admin permissions in New Relic, or you must be a member of a role with create and edit permissions for Insights > NRQL Drop Rules. Once a drop filter rule is active, it's applied to all log events ingested from that point onwards. Rules are not applied retroactively. Logs collected before creating a rule are not filtered by that rule. Filter or query the set of logs that contain the data you want to drop. Then, from Manage Data on the left nav of the Logs UI, click Create drop filter. To create a new drop filter rule, you can use new or existing log queries. Go to one.newrelic.com > Logs. Filter or query to the specific set of logs that contain the data to be dropped. Once the query is active, from Manage Data on the left nav of the Logs UI, click Create drop filter. Recommendation: Change the drop rule's default name to a meaningful name. Choose to either drop the entire log event that matches the query or just a specific subset of attributes in the matching events. Review the log partitions where this drop rule applies. Save the drop filter rule. Types of drop filter rules The drop filters UI prompts you to select whether to drop logs based on the query or on specific attributes. Drop log events The default type of drop filter rule is to drop logs. This option drops the entire log events that match the filter or query. When creating a rule, try to provide a specific query that only matches log data that should be dropped. Our drop filters process won't let you create drop filter rules without values in the matching query. This prevents badly formed rules from dropping all log data. Drop attributes You can specify attributes to be dropped in a log event that matches your query. At least one or more attributes must be selected. Any attribute which is selected will be dropped; all remaining attributes will be kept and stored in NRDB. Tip We recommend this method for removing fields that could contain personal identifiable information (PII) or other sensitive attributes without losing valuable monitoring data. View or delete drop filter rules To view or delete a drop filter rule: Go to one.newrelic.com > Logs. From Manage Data on the left nav of the Logs UI, click Drop filters. Click the delete icon next to the drop filter rule you want to remove. Once deleted, rules no longer filter ingested log events.",

      "body": "Use the Logs UI at one.newrelic.com or our EU region data center (if available) at one.eu.newrelic.com/ to: Spot interesting or significant patterns in your logs. Examine more context around a particular log line. Explore and manipulate your logging data with filters and parsing rules. Query and share the data with charts, add to dashboards, etc. Organize your account's log data, and optimize query performance with data partitions. Set up alert conditions for problems you want to prevent. To stay up to date with new capabilities and improvements, subscribe to our RSS feed for Logs release notes. Explore your log data Use the left nav in the Logs UI as an easy workflow through all logs, patterns, live-tail logging, and queries. Get more details about specific logs and their attributes from the center nav. To explore your logging data, follow this basic workflow. If you have not customized your New Relic One navigation bar, go to one.newrelic.com, click Browse data and select Logs. Look for patterns: To spot suspicious spikes or drops in log messages, click the log patterns icon on the left nav. To look at logs for a specific time period, click that point (or click and drag an area) on the chart, or use the time picker. Narrow your focus: To narrow the focus of your initial search results or quickly find outliers, expand any attributes in the log details to view the ten most common values within the results. For example, if a host listed under the hostname attribute is generating significantly more error messages than the others, select that value to apply it to your search. To make your log messages easier to query and understand, use our built-in parsing rules, or create your own parsing rules for attributes that match a particular value. To manage the amount of log data collected and to store fewer logs, create drop filter rules that avoid collecting data you don't need. Examine log details: Select a log message to view its details as a table of attributes or as JSON. To see which attributes are included in a log message, click the log line. Add or remove attributes as needed to help your query focus on the details you need. To help troubleshoot problems related to a specific value in the log details, click the Show surrounding logs icon for the attribute's details. To control which attributes appear in the results, click any highlighted value in the log's log_summary column. Search: By default, the Logs UI shows all your logs, but you can also search with keywords or phrases to find the results you want; for example, process failed. OR From the search field, use the type-ahead dropdowns to select an attribute, operator, and value; for example: service_name equals my service Copy For more information, see the Logs query syntax documentation. Tip To organize data within an account and to optimize query performance, create data partition rules. Get related logs: For example: To immediately see how your system responds to deployments or other app changes, enable live-tail logging. To view all the logs for a specific value, review the attributes list in the selected log's Log details. To help identify an issue's root cause before it occurred or its impact after an event, click the Show surrounding logs icon. Share your findings: Use any of the core New Relic One functions (specific account, time range, data explorer, query builder, etc.) to share the data with charts, add to dashboards, etc. For more information, see the examples in this document. Save your views You can save your logs query, table configuration, time range, and attribute grouping in a saved view, so that you can quickly return to it later. To save a log analytics view after you've configured the view: Click the Saved Views tab in the Logs UI left nav. Click Save current view. Give your saved view the name you want for it to be listed in the Saved Views tab. Select which aspects from the current view you want to save. Select the permission level: Private, Public (Read-only), and Public (Read and write). Public means that any user with access to the account is able to see the saved view. Click Save view. Examples Here are a few examples of how you can use the Logs UI to get detailed information. To use some of these examples, you must be able to see logs in context. Create an alert from log data You can create alert conditions directly in the Logs UI: Go to one.newrelic.com > Logs. Search for results that you want to alert on; for example, service_name:\"your service\" \"fatal error\". In the search bar, click the plus icon, then select Create an alert from this. Complete the Create alert condition that slides out, then review the NRQL query that will power the alert condition. After you save the Logs alert condition, you can view it in the Alerts UI, where you can make additional changes as needed. Add log volume chart to a dashboard You can add log charts to a dashboard directly from the Logs UI. Go to one.newrelic.com > Logs. Search for results you want to plot; for example, service_name:\"checkout service\" \"process failed\". OR Select a saved view. Click the dashboard icon, then fill out the details to add to an existing or new dashboard. You can also create charts with the data explorer or the query builder in New Relic One. Troubleshoot an error (logs in context) To troubleshoot errors this way, you must be able to see logs in context. Then, to have a better understanding of what was happening on the host at the time an error occurred in your app: Go to APM > (select an app) > Events > Error analytics and select an error trace. From the error trace Details, click See logs. From the Logs UI, browse the related log details. To identify the host generating the error, click Show surrounding logs. Troubleshoot latency (logs in context) To troubleshoot latency this way, you must be able to see logs in context. Then, to have a better understanding of how your systems were operating when performance noticeably slowed: Go to one.newrelic.com > Distributed tracing. Select a particularly slow trace. From the trace Details, click See logs for this trace. Browse related logs in the Logs UI. Links to logs in New Relic Depending on your New Relic subscription, you can access your logs from several places in the New Relic UI. For some of these options, you must be able to see logs in context. To view logs... Do this... Directly from the Logs UI Go to one.newrelic.com > Logs. EU region data center (if available): Go to one.eu.newrelic.com/ > Logs. From distributed tracing Go to one.newrelic.com > Distributed tracing > (select a trace > Logs (if available).

To drill down into additional details, click any highlighted attribute. Each log's summary in the Logs UI provides query options to add, exclude, replace, and more. Query structure Using the Logs UI, you can search through your log data by entering either simple keywords, such as new and relic, or phrases such as new relic agent, directly into the search field. You can also combine keywords or phrases with operators to form more complex queries. Tip Log queries in New Relic are based on the Lucene query language, and any Lucene function listed in this document is supported. (If a Lucene function is not listed, we do not support it.) For some helpful examples, check out this Lucene tutorial. General query rules: Log query rules Comments Case sensitive The query syntax is case sensitive for attributes values. Attribute names are always case sensitive. Exception: Wildcard searches are case insensitive for attribute values. Special characters When a term contains special characters, double-quote the term and escape the special characters using a backslash (\\). This includes special characters such as +, -, &, |, !, (, ), {, }, [, ], ^, \", ~, *, ?, :, /, or \\. Example: To query for \"POST /log/v1 HTTP/1.1\" 202, escape the quotes like this: \"\\\"POST /log/v1 HTTP/1.1\\\" 202\" Wildcard searches You can run wildcard searches using an asterisk (*) to replace zero or more characters. Example: new*relic Search with text To return more specific query results, use text searches to join together keywords or phrases. Text operators The Logs query syntax accepts the following text operators: Condition Text operator example Matching (keyword) Search for log results containing keywords entered separately: \"new\" \"relic\" Exact matching (phrase) Search for log results containing the specific phrase entered: \"new relic agent\" Either / Or Search for log results containing either or both of the keywords entered: new OR relic And Search for log results containing both of the keywords entered: new AND relic * Wildcard (zero or more) Search for log results containing both of the keywords entered, with zero or more characters between them: new*relic Negation (keyword) Search for log results that do not contain the specific keyword entered: -new Negation (phrase) Search for log results that do not contain the specific phrase entered. -\"new relic\" Search with attributes Use attribute searches to narrow the query results to a specific attribute or field. General operators The following operators can be used by all types of attributes: Condition General operator example Equal : Search for log results where the attribute equals the keyword specified. Example: The field hostname equals chi: hostname:chi Does not equal - : Search for log results where the attribute does not equal the keyword specified. Example: The field hostname does not equal chi. -hostname:chi Contains * Search for log results where the attribute contains the specified keyword. Example: The field hostname contains chi. hostname:*chi* Does not contain - * Search for log results where the attribute does not contain the specified keyword. Example: The field hostname does not contain chi. -hostname:*chi* Starts with * Search for log results where the attribute starts with the specified keyword specified. Example: The field hostname starts with chi. hostname:chi* Ends with * Search for log results where the attribute ends with the specified keyword specified. Example: The field hostname ends with chi. hostname:*chi Has Search for log results that have the specified field. Example: Has the field user_name. has:user_name Missing Search for log results that are missing the specified field. Example: Missing the field user_name. missing:user_name Numeric operators The following operators can only be used by numeric attributes: Condition Numeric operator example Greater than Search for log results attribute matches that are greater than the given parameter. Example: The field http_response_time_ms is greater than 500. http_response_time_ms:>500 Greater than or equal to Search for log results with attribute matches that are greater than or equal to the given parameter.

OR From the search field, use the type-ahead dropdowns to select an attribute, operator, and value; for example: service_name equals my service Copy For more information, see the Logs query syntax documentation. Tip To organize data within an account and to optimize query performance, create data partition rules. Get related logs: For example: To immediately see how your system responds to deployments or other app changes, enable live-tail logging. To view all the logs for a specific value, review the attributes list in the selected log's Log details. To help identify an issue's root cause before it occurred or its impact after an event, click the Show surrounding logs icon. Share your findings: Use any of the core New Relic One functions (specific account, time range, data explorer, query builder, etc.) to share the data with charts, add to dashboards, etc. For more information, see the examples in this document. Save your views You can save your logs query, table configuration, time range, and attribute grouping in a saved view, so that you can quickly return to it later. To save a log analytics view after you've configured the view: Click the Saved Views tab in the Logs UI left nav. Click Save current view. Give your saved view the name you want for it to be listed in the Saved Views tab. Select which aspects from the current view you want to save. Select the permission level: Private, Public (Read-only), and Public (Read and write). Public means that any user with access to the account is able to see the saved view. Click Save view. Examples Here are a few examples of how you can use the Logs UI to get detailed information. To use some of these examples, you must be able to see logs in context. Create an alert from log data You can create alert conditions directly in the Logs UI: Go to one.newrelic.com > Logs. Search for results that you want to alert on; for example, service_name:\"your service\" \"fatal error\". In the search bar, click the plus icon, then select Create an alert from this. Complete the Create alert condition that slides out, then review the NRQL query that will power the alert condition. After you save the Logs alert condition, you can view it in the Alerts UI, where you can make additional changes as needed. Add log volume chart to a dashboard You can add log charts to a dashboard directly from the Logs UI. Go to one.newrelic.com > Logs. Search for results you want to plot; for example, service_name:\"checkout service\" \"process failed\". OR Select a saved view. Click the dashboard icon, then fill out the details to add to an existing or new dashboard. You can also create charts with the data explorer or the query builder in New Relic One. Troubleshoot an error (logs in context) To troubleshoot errors this way, you must be able to see logs in context. Then, to have a better understanding of what was happening on the host at the time an error occurred in your app: Go to APM > (select an app) > Events > Error analytics and select an error trace. From the error trace Details, click See logs. From the Logs UI, browse the related log details. To identify the host generating the error, click Show surrounding logs. Troubleshoot latency (logs in context) To troubleshoot latency this way, you must be able to see logs in context. Then, to have a better understanding of how your systems were operating when performance noticeably slowed: Go to one.newrelic.com > Distributed tracing. Select a particularly slow trace. From the trace Details, click See logs for this trace. Browse related logs in the Logs UI. Links to logs in New Relic Depending on your New Relic subscription, you can access your logs from several places in the New Relic UI. For some of these options, you must be able to see logs in context. To view logs... Do this... Directly from the Logs UI Go to one.newrelic.com > Logs. EU region data center (if available): Go to one.eu.newrelic.com/ > Logs. From distributed tracing Go to one.newrelic.com > Distributed tracing > (select a trace > Logs (if available). From a host in your infrastructure Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Hosts > (select a host) > Events explorer > Logs (if available).

To drill down into additional details, click any highlighted attribute. Each log's summary in the Logs UI provides query options to add, exclude, replace, and more. Query structure Using the Logs UI, you can search through your log data by entering either simple keywords, such as new and relic, or phrases such as new relic agent, directly into the search field. You can also combine keywords or phrases with operators to form more complex queries. Tip Log queries in New Relic are based on the Lucene query language, and any Lucene function listed in this document is supported. (If a Lucene function is not listed, we do not support it.) For some helpful examples, check out this Lucene tutorial. General query rules: Log query rules Comments Case sensitive The query syntax is case sensitive for attributes values. Attribute names are always case sensitive. Exception: Wildcard searches are case insensitive for attribute values. Special characters When a term contains special characters, double-quote the term and escape the special characters using a backslash (\\). This includes special characters such as +, -, &, |, !, (, ), {, }, [, ], ^, \", ~, *, ?, :, /, or \\. Example: To query for \"POST /log/v1 HTTP/1.1\" 202, escape the quotes like this: \"\\\"POST /log/v1 HTTP/1.1\\\" 202\" Wildcard searches You can run wildcard searches using an asterisk (*) to replace zero or more characters. Example: new*relic Search with text To return more specific query results, use text searches to join together keywords or phrases. Text operators The Logs query syntax accepts the following text operators: Condition Text operator example Matching (keyword) Search for log results containing keywords entered separately: \"new\" \"relic\" Exact matching (phrase) Search for log results containing the specific phrase entered: \"new relic agent\" Either / Or Search for log results containing either or both of the keywords entered: new OR relic And Search for log results containing both of the keywords entered: new AND relic * Wildcard (zero or more) Search for log results containing both of the keywords entered, with zero or more characters between them: new*relic Negation (keyword) Search for log results that do not contain the specific keyword entered: -new Negation (phrase) Search for log results that do not contain the specific phrase entered. -\"new relic\" Search with attributes Use attribute searches to narrow the query results to a specific attribute or field. General operators The following operators can be used by all types of attributes: Condition General operator example Equal : Search for log results where the attribute equals the keyword specified. Example: The field hostname equals chi: hostname:chi Does not equal - : Search for log results where the attribute does not equal the keyword specified. Example: The field hostname does not equal chi. -hostname:chi Contains * Search for log results where the attribute contains the specified keyword. Example: The field hostname contains chi. hostname:*chi* Does not contain - * Search for log results where the attribute does not contain the specified keyword. Example: The field hostname does not contain chi. -hostname:*chi* Starts with * Search for log results where the attribute starts with the specified keyword specified. Example: The field hostname starts with chi. hostname:chi* Ends with * Search for log results where the attribute ends with the specified keyword specified. Example: The field hostname ends with chi. hostname:*chi Has Search for log results that have the specified field. Example: Has the field user_name. has:user_name Missing Search for log results that are missing the specified field. Example: Missing the field user_name. missing:user_name Numeric operators The following operators can only be used by numeric attributes: Condition Numeric operator example Greater than Search for log results attribute matches that are greater than the given parameter. Example: The field http_response_time_ms is greater than 500. http_response_time_ms:>500 Greater than or equal to Search for log results with attribute matches that are greater than or equal to the given parameter.

      "body": "Parsing is the process of splitting unstructured log data into attribute/value pairs. You can use these attributes to facet or filter logs in useful ways. This in turn helps you build better charts and alerts. From the left nav in the Logs UI, select Parsing, then create your own custom parsing rule with an attribute, value, and Grok pattern. New Relic parses log data according to rules. Learn how logs parsing works, how to use built-in rules, and how to create custom rules. Example A good example is a default NGINX access log containing unstructured text. It is useful for searching but not much else. Here's an example of a typical line: 127.180.71.3 - - [10/May/1997:08:05:32 +0000] \"GET /downloads/product_1 HTTP/1.1\" 304 0 \"-\" \"Debian APT-HTTP/1.3 (0.8.16~exp12ubuntu10.21)\" Copy In an unparsed format, you would need to do a full text search to answer most questions. After parsing, the log is organized into attributes, like response code and request URL: { \"remote_addr\":\"93.180.71.3\", \"time\":\"1586514731\", \"method\":\"GET\", \"path\":\"/downloads/product_1\", \"version\":\"HTTP/1.1\", \"response\":\"304\", \"bytesSent\": 0, \"user_agent\": \"Debian APT-HTTP/1.3 (0.8.16~exp12ubuntu10.21)\" } Copy Parsing makes it easier to create custom queries that facet on those values. This helps you understand the distribution of response codes per request URL and quickly find problematic pages. How log parsing works Here's an overview of how New Relic implements parsing of logs: Log parsing How it works What All parsing takes place against the message field; no other fields can be parsed. Each parsing rule has a matching criteria. We recommend using the logtype attribute name for matching parsing rules to logs. When Parsing will only be applied once to each log message. If multiple parsing rules match the log, only the first that succeeds will be applied. Parsing takes place during log ingestion, before data is written to NRDB. Once data has been written to storage, it can no longer be parsed. How Rules can be written in Grok, regex, or a mixture of the two. Grok is a collection of patterns that abstract away complicated regular expressions. If the content of the message field is JSON, it will be parsed automatically. New Relic's log ingestion pipeline can parse data by matching a log event to a rule that describes how the log should be parsed. There are two ways log events can be parsed: Use a built-in rule. Define a custom rule. Rules are a combination of matching logic and parsing logic. Matching is done by defining a query match on an attribute of the logs. Rules are not applied retroactively. Logs collected before a rule is created are not parsed by that rule. The simplest way to organize your logs and how they are parsed is to include the logtype field in your log event. This tells New Relic what built-in ruleset to apply to the logs. Important Once a parsing rule is active, data parsed by the rule is permanently changed. This cannot be reverted. Limits Parsing is computationally expensive, which introduces risk. Parsing is done for custom rules defined in an account and for matching patterns to a log. A large number of patterns or poorly defined custom rules will consume a huge amount of memory and CPU resources while also taking a very long time to complete. In order to prevent problems, we apply two parsing limits: per-message-per-rule and per-account. Limit Description Per-message-per-rule The per-message-per-rule limit prevents the time spent parsing any single message from being greater than 100 ms. If that limit is reached, the system will cease attempting to parse the log message with that rule. The ingestion pipeline will attempt to run any other applicable on that message, and the message will still be passed through the ingestion pipeline and stored in NRDB. The log message will be in its original, unparsed format. Per-account The per-account limit exists to prevent accounts from using more than their fair share of resources. The limit considers the total time spent processing all log messages for an account per-minute. The limit is not a fixed value; it scales up or down proportionally to the volume of data stored daily by the account and the environment size that is subsequently allocated to support that customer. Tip To easily check if your rate limits have been reached, go to your system Limits page in the New Relic UI. Built-in parsing rulesets Common log formats have well-established parsing rules already created for them. To get the benefit of built-in parsing rules, add the logtype attribute when forwarding logs. Set the value to something listed in the following table, and the rules for that type of log will be applied automatically. List of built-in rulesets The following logtype attribute values map to a standard parsing rulesets. See Built-in parsing rules to learn what fields are parsed for each rules. logtype Example matching query alb AWS Application Load Balancer logtype:alb apache Apache Access logtype:apache cloudfront-web CloudFront Web logtype:cloudfront-web elb Amazon Elastic Load Balancer logtype:elb iis_w3c IIS server logs - W3C format logtype:iis_w3c monit Monit logs logtype:monit mysql-error MySQL Error logtype:mysql-error nginx NGINX access logs logtype:nginx nginx-error NGINX error logs logtype:nginx-error route-53 Amazon Route 53 logs logtype:route-53 syslog-rfc5424 Syslog logtype:syslog-rfc5424 Add the logtype attribute When aggregating logs, it's important to provide metadata that makes it easy to organize, search, and parse those logs. One simple way of doing this is to add the attribute logtype to the log messages when they are shipped. Built-in parsing rules are applied by default to certain logtype values. Here are some examples of how to add logtype to logs sent by some of our supported shipping methods. New Relic infrastructure agent example Add logtype as an attribute. You must set the logtype for each named source. logs: - name: file-simple file: /path/to/file attributes: logtype: fileRaw - name: nginx-example file: /var/log/nginx.log attributes: logtype: nginx Copy Fluentd example Add a filter block to the .conf file, which uses a record_transformer to add a new field. In this example we use a logtype of nginx to trigger the build-in NGINX parsing rule. Check out other Fluentd examples. <filter containers> @type record_transformer enable_ruby true <record> #Add logtype to trigger a built-in parsing rule for nginx access logs logtype nginx #Set timestamp from the value contained in the field \"time\" timestamp record[\"time\"] #Add hostname and tag fields to all records hostname \"#{Socket.gethostname}\" tag ${tag} </record> </filter> Copy Fluent Bit example Add a filter block to the .conf file that uses a record_modifier to add a new field. In this example we use a logtype of nginx to trigger the build-in NGINX parsing rule. Check out other Fluent Bit examples. [FILTER] Name record_modifier Match * Record logtype nginx Record hostname ${HOSTNAME} Record service_name Sample-App-Name Copy Logstash example Add a filter block to the Logstash configuration which uses an add_field mutate filter to add a new field. In this example we use a logtype of nginx to trigger the build-in NGINX parsing rule. Check out other Logstash examples. filter { mutate { add_field => { \"logtype\" => \"nginx\" \"service_name\" => \"myservicename\" \"hostname\" => \"%{host}\" } } } Copy Logs API example You can add attributes to the JSON request sent to New Relic. In this example we add a logtype attribute of value nginx to trigger the built-in NGINX parsing rule. Learn more about using the Logs API. POST /log/v1 HTTP/1.1 Host: log-api.newrelic.com Content-Type: application/json X-License-Key: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY Accept: */* Content-Length: 133 { \"timestamp\": TIMESTAMP_IN_UNIX_EPOCH, \"message\": \"User 'xyz' logged in\", \"logtype\": \"accesslogs\", \"service\": \"login-service\", \"hostname\": \"login.example.com\" } Copy Create custom parsing rules Many logs are formatted or structured in a unique way. In order to parse them, custom logic must be built and applied. From the left nav in the Logs UI, select Parsing, then create your own custom parsing rule with an attribute, value, and Grok pattern. To create and manage your own, custom parsing rules: Go to one.newrelic.com > Logs. From Manage Data on the left nav of the Logs UI, click Parsing, then click Create parsing rule. Enter the parsing rule's name. Choose an attribute and value to match on. Write your Grok pattern and test the rule. To learn about Grok and custom parsing rules, read our blog post about how to parse logs with Grok patterns. Enable and save the custom parsing rule.

      "body": "After log event data has been shipped to New Relic, it can either be stored in our NRDB database or dropped (discarded). We can drop both log events and event attributes via drop filter rules. You can manage drop filter rules using our Logs UI, as explained in this document. You can also use NerdGraph. Savings, security, speed Drop filter rules help you accomplish several important goals: Lower costs by storing only logs relevant to your account. Protect privacy and security by removing personal identifiable information (PII). Reduce noise by removing irrelevant events and attributes. Caution Use caution when deciding to drop data. The data you drop is not recoverable. Before using this feature, review the responsibilities and considerations for dropping data. How drop filter rules work A drop filter rule matches data based on a query. When triggered, the drop filter rule removes the matching data from the ingestion pipeline before it is written to NRDB. This creates an explicit demarcation between the logs being forwarded from your domain and the data that New Relic collects. Since the data removed by the drop filter rule doesn't reach our backend, it cannot be queried: the data is gone and cannot be restored. During the ingestion process, customer log data can be parsed, transformed, or dropped before being stored in New Relic's database. Cautions when dropping data When creating drop rules, you are responsible for ensuring that the rules accurately identify and discard the data that meets the conditions that you have established. You are also responsible for monitoring the rule, as well as the data you disclose to New Relic. New Relic cannot guarantee that this functionality will completely resolve data disclosure concerns you may have. New Relic doesn't review or monitor how effective the rules you develop are. Creating rules about sensitive data can leak information about what kinds of data you maintain, including the format of your data or systems (for example, through referencing email addresses or specific credit card numbers). Any user with the relevant role-based access control permissions can view and edit all information in the rules you create. Create drop filter rules To create and edit drop filters, you must have admin permissions in New Relic, or you must be a member of a role with create and edit permissions for Insights > NRQL Drop Rules. Once a drop filter rule is active, it's applied to all log events ingested from that point onwards. Rules are not applied retroactively. Logs collected before creating a rule are not filtered by that rule. Filter or query the set of logs that contain the data you want to drop. Then, from Manage Data on the left nav of the Logs UI, click Create drop filter. To create a new drop filter rule, you can use new or existing log queries. Go to one.newrelic.com > Logs. Filter or query to the specific set of logs that contain the data to be dropped. Once the query is active, from Manage Data on the left nav of the Logs UI, click Create drop filter. Recommendation: Change the drop rule's default name to a meaningful name. Choose to either drop the entire log event that matches the query or just a specific subset of attributes in the matching events. Review the log partitions where this drop rule applies. Save the drop filter rule. Types of drop filter rules The drop filters UI prompts you to select whether to drop logs based on the query or on specific attributes. Drop log events The default type of drop filter rule is to drop logs. This option drops the entire log events that match the filter or query. When creating a rule, try to provide a specific query that only matches log data that should be dropped. Our drop filters process won't let you create drop filter rules without values in the matching query. This prevents badly formed rules from dropping all log data. Drop attributes You can specify attributes to be dropped in a log event that matches your query. At least one or more attributes must be selected. Any attribute which is selected will be dropped; all remaining attributes will be kept and stored in NRDB. Tip We recommend this method for removing fields that could contain personal identifiable information (PII) or other sensitive attributes without losing valuable monitoring data. View or delete drop filter rules To view or delete a drop filter rule: Go to one.newrelic.com > Logs. From Manage Data on the left nav of the Logs UI, click Drop filters. Click the delete icon next to the drop filter rule you want to remove. Once deleted, rules no longer filter ingested log events.",

Examine more context around a particular log line. Explore and manipulate your logging data with filters and parsing rules. Query and share the data with charts, add to dashboards, etc. Organize your account's log data, and optimize query performance with data partitions. Set up alert conditions for problems you want to prevent. To stay up to date with new capabilities and improvements, subscribe to our RSS feed for Logs release notes. Explore your log data Use the left nav in the Logs UI as an easy workflow through all logs, patterns, live-tail logging, and queries. Get more details about specific logs and their attributes from the center nav. To explore your logging data, follow this basic workflow. If you have not customized your New Relic One navigation bar, go to one.newrelic.com, click Browse data and select Logs. Look for patterns: To spot suspicious spikes or drops in log messages, click the log patterns icon on the left nav. To look at logs for a specific time period, click that point (or click and drag an area) on the chart, or use the time picker. Narrow your focus: To narrow the focus of your initial search results or quickly find outliers, expand any attributes in the log details to view the ten most common values within the results. For example, if a host listed under the hostname attribute is generating significantly more error messages than the others, select that value to apply it to your search. To make your log messages easier to query and understand, use our built-in parsing rules, or create your own parsing rules for attributes that match a particular value. To manage the amount of log data collected and to store fewer logs, create drop filter rules that avoid collecting data you don't need. Examine log details: Select a log message to view its details as a table of attributes or as JSON. To see which attributes are included in a log message, click the log line. Add or remove attributes as needed to help your query focus on the details you need. To help troubleshoot problems related to a specific value in the log details, click the Show surrounding logs icon for the attribute's details. To control which attributes appear in the results, click any highlighted value in the log's log_summary column. Search: By default, the Logs UI shows all your logs, but you can also search with keywords or phrases to find the results you want; for example, process failed. OR From the search field, use the type-ahead dropdowns to select an attribute, operator, and value; for example: service_name equals my service Copy For more information, see the Logs query syntax documentation. Tip To organize data within an account and to optimize query performance, create data partition rules. Get related logs: For example: To immediately see how your system responds to deployments or other app changes, enable live-tail logging. To view all the logs for a specific value, review the attributes list in the selected log's Log details. To help identify an issue's root cause before it occurred or its impact after an event, click the Show surrounding logs icon. Share your findings: Use any of the core New Relic One functions (specific account, time range, data explorer, query builder, etc.) to share the data with charts, add to dashboards, etc. For more information, see the examples in this document. Save your views You can save your logs query, table configuration, time range, and attribute grouping in a saved view, so that you can quickly return to it later. To save a log analytics view after you've configured the view: Click the Saved Views tab in the Logs UI left nav. Click Save current view. Give your saved view the name you want for it to be listed in the Saved Views tab. Select which aspects from the current view you want to save. Select the permission level: Private, Public (Read-only), and Public (Read and write). Public means that any user with access to the account is able to see the saved view. Click Save view. Examples Here are a few examples of how you can use the Logs UI to get detailed information. To use some of these examples, you must be able to see logs in context. Create an alert from log data You can create alert conditions directly in the Logs UI: Go to one.newrelic.com > Logs. Search for results that you want to alert on; for example, service_name:\"your service\" \"fatal error\". In the search bar, click the plus icon, then select Create an alert from this. Complete the Create alert condition that slides out, then review the NRQL query that will power the alert condition. After you save the Logs alert condition, you can view it in the Alerts UI, where you can make additional changes as needed. Add log volume chart to a dashboard You can add log charts to a dashboard directly from the Logs UI. Go to one.newrelic.com > Logs. Search for results you want to plot; for example, service_name:\"checkout service\" \"process failed\". OR Select a saved view. Click the dashboard icon, then fill out the details to add to an existing or new dashboard. You can also create charts with the data explorer or the query builder in New Relic One. Troubleshoot an error (logs in context) To troubleshoot errors this way, you must be able to see logs in context. Then, to have a better understanding of what was happening on the host at the time an error occurred in your app: Go to APM > (select an app) > Events > Error analytics and select an error trace. From the error trace Details, click See logs. From the Logs UI, browse the related log details. To identify the host generating the error, click Show surrounding logs. Troubleshoot latency (logs in context) To troubleshoot latency this way, you must be able to see logs in context. Then, to have a better understanding of how your systems were operating when performance noticeably slowed: Go to one.newrelic.com > Distributed tracing. Select a particularly slow trace. From the trace Details, click See logs for this trace. Browse related logs in the Logs UI. Links to logs in New Relic Depending on your New Relic subscription, you can access your logs from several places in the New Relic UI. For some of these options, you must be able to see logs in context. To view logs... Do this... Directly from the Logs UI Go to one.newrelic.com > Logs.

To drill down into additional details, click any highlighted attribute. Each log's summary in the Logs UI provides query options to add, exclude, replace, and more. Query structure Using the Logs UI, you can search through your log data by entering either simple keywords, such as new and relic, or phrases such as new relic agent, directly into the search field. You can also combine keywords or phrases with operators to form more complex queries. Tip Log queries in New Relic are based on the Lucene query language, and any Lucene function listed in this document is supported. (If a Lucene function is not listed, we do not support it.) For some helpful examples, check out this Lucene tutorial. General query rules: Log query rules Comments Case sensitive The query syntax is case sensitive for attributes values. Attribute names are always case sensitive. Exception: Wildcard searches are case insensitive for attribute values. Special characters When a term contains special characters, double-quote the term and escape the special characters using a backslash (\\). This includes special characters such as +, -, &, |, !, (, ), {, }, [, ], ^, \", ~, *, ?, :, /, or \\. Example: To query for \"POST /log/v1 HTTP/1.1\" 202, escape the quotes like this: \"\\\"POST /log/v1 HTTP/1.1\\\" 202\" Wildcard searches You can run wildcard searches using an asterisk (*) to replace zero or more characters. Example: new*relic Search with text To return more specific query results, use text searches to join together keywords or phrases. Text operators The Logs query syntax accepts the following text operators: Condition Text operator example Matching (keyword) Search for log results containing keywords entered separately: \"new\" \"relic\" Exact matching (phrase) Search for log results containing the specific phrase entered: \"new relic agent\" Either / Or Search for log results containing either or both of the keywords entered: new OR relic And Search for log results containing both of the keywords entered: new AND relic * Wildcard (zero or more) Search for log results containing both of the keywords entered, with zero or more characters between them: new*relic Negation (keyword) Search for log results that do not contain the specific keyword entered: -new Negation (phrase) Search for log results that do not contain the specific phrase entered. -\"new relic\" Search with attributes Use attribute searches to narrow the query results to a specific attribute or field. General operators The following operators can be used by all types of attributes: Condition General operator example Equal : Search for log results where the attribute equals the keyword specified. Example: The field hostname equals chi: hostname:chi Does not equal - : Search for log results where the attribute does not equal the keyword specified. Example: The field hostname does not equal chi. -hostname:chi Contains * Search for log results where the attribute contains the specified keyword. Example: The field hostname contains chi. hostname:*chi* Does not contain - * Search for log results where the attribute does not contain the specified keyword. Example: The field hostname does not contain chi. -hostname:*chi* Starts with * Search for log results where the attribute starts with the specified keyword specified. Example: The field hostname starts with chi. hostname:chi* Ends with * Search for log results where the attribute ends with the specified keyword specified. Example: The field hostname ends with chi. hostname:*chi Has Search for log results that have the specified field. Example: Has the field user_name. has:user_name Missing Search for log results that are missing the specified field. Example: Missing the field user_name. missing:user_name Numeric operators The following operators can only be used by numeric attributes: Condition Numeric operator example Greater than Search for log results attribute matches that are greater than the given parameter. Example: The field http_response_time_ms is greater than 500. http_response_time_ms:>500 Greater than or equal to Search for log results with attribute matches that are greater than or equal to the given parameter.

      "body": "After log event data has been shipped to New Relic, it can either be stored in our NRDB database or dropped (discarded). We can drop both log events and event attributes via drop filter rules. You can manage drop filter rules using our Logs UI, as explained in this document. You can also use NerdGraph. Savings, security, speed Drop filter rules help you accomplish several important goals: Lower costs by storing only logs relevant to your account. Protect privacy and security by removing personal identifiable information (PII). Reduce noise by removing irrelevant events and attributes. Caution Use caution when deciding to drop data. The data you drop is not recoverable. Before using this feature, review the responsibilities and considerations for dropping data. How drop filter rules work A drop filter rule matches data based on a query. When triggered, the drop filter rule removes the matching data from the ingestion pipeline before it is written to NRDB. This creates an explicit demarcation between the logs being forwarded from your domain and the data that New Relic collects. Since the data removed by the drop filter rule doesn't reach our backend, it cannot be queried: the data is gone and cannot be restored. During the ingestion process, customer log data can be parsed, transformed, or dropped before being stored in New Relic's database. Cautions when dropping data When creating drop rules, you are responsible for ensuring that the rules accurately identify and discard the data that meets the conditions that you have established. You are also responsible for monitoring the rule, as well as the data you disclose to New Relic. New Relic cannot guarantee that this functionality will completely resolve data disclosure concerns you may have. New Relic doesn't review or monitor how effective the rules you develop are. Creating rules about sensitive data can leak information about what kinds of data you maintain, including the format of your data or systems (for example, through referencing email addresses or specific credit card numbers). Any user with the relevant role-based access control permissions can view and edit all information in the rules you create. Create drop filter rules To create and edit drop filters, you must have admin permissions in New Relic, or you must be a member of a role with create and edit permissions for Insights > NRQL Drop Rules. Once a drop filter rule is active, it's applied to all log events ingested from that point onwards. Rules are not applied retroactively. Logs collected before creating a rule are not filtered by that rule. Filter or query the set of logs that contain the data you want to drop. Then, from Manage Data on the left nav of the Logs UI, click Create drop filter. To create a new drop filter rule, you can use new or existing log queries. Go to one.newrelic.com > Logs. Filter or query to the specific set of logs that contain the data to be dropped. Once the query is active, from Manage Data on the left nav of the Logs UI, click Create drop filter. Recommendation: Change the drop rule's default name to a meaningful name. Choose to either drop the entire log event that matches the query or just a specific subset of attributes in the matching events. Review the log partitions where this drop rule applies. Save the drop filter rule. Types of drop filter rules The drop filters UI prompts you to select whether to drop logs based on the query or on specific attributes. Drop log events The default type of drop filter rule is to drop logs. This option drops the entire log events that match the filter or query. When creating a rule, try to provide a specific query that only matches log data that should be dropped. Our drop filters process won't let you create drop filter rules without values in the matching query. This prevents badly formed rules from dropping all log data. Drop attributes You can specify attributes to be dropped in a log event that matches your query. At least one or more attributes must be selected. Any attribute which is selected will be dropped; all remaining attributes will be kept and stored in NRDB. Tip We recommend this method for removing fields that could contain personal identifiable information (PII) or other sensitive attributes without losing valuable monitoring data. View or delete drop filter rules To view or delete a drop filter rule: Go to one.newrelic.com > Logs. From Manage Data on the left nav of the Logs UI, click Drop filters. Click the delete icon next to the drop filter rule you want to remove. Once deleted, rules no longer filter ingested log events.",

Complete the Create alert condition that slides out, then review the NRQL query that will power the alert condition. After you save the Logs alert condition, you can view it in the Alerts UI, where you can make additional changes as needed. Add log volume chart to a dashboard You can add log charts to a dashboard directly from the Logs UI. Go to one.newrelic.com > Logs. Search for results you want to plot; for example, service_name:\"checkout service\" \"process failed\". OR Select a saved view. Click the dashboard icon, then fill out the details to add to an existing or new dashboard. You can also create charts with the data explorer or the query builder in New Relic One. Troubleshoot an error (logs in context) To troubleshoot errors this way, you must be able to see logs in context. Then, to have a better understanding of what was happening on the host at the time an error occurred in your app: Go to APM > (select an app) > Events > Error analytics and select an error trace. From the error trace Details, click See logs. From the Logs UI, browse the related log details. To identify the host generating the error, click Show surrounding logs. Troubleshoot latency (logs in context) To troubleshoot latency this way, you must be able to see logs in context.

To drill down into additional details, click any highlighted attribute. Each log's summary in the Logs UI provides query options to add, exclude, replace, and more. Query structure Using the Logs UI, you can search through your log data by entering either simple keywords, such as new and relic, or phrases such as new relic agent, directly into the search field. You can also combine keywords or phrases with operators to form more complex queries. Tip Log queries in New Relic are based on the Lucene query language, and any Lucene function listed in this document is supported. (If a Lucene function is not listed, we do not support it.) For some helpful examples, check out this Lucene tutorial. General query rules: Log query rules Comments Case sensitive The query syntax is case sensitive for attributes values. Attribute names are always case sensitive. Exception: Wildcard searches are case insensitive for attribute values. Special characters When a term contains special characters, double-quote the term and escape the special characters using a backslash (\\). This includes special characters such as +, -, &, |, !, (, ), {, }, [, ], ^, \", ~, *, ?, :, /, or \\. Example: To query for \"POST /log/v1 HTTP/1.1\" 202, escape the quotes like this: \"\\\"POST /log/v1 HTTP/1.1\\\" 202\" Wildcard searches You can run wildcard searches using an asterisk (*) to replace zero or more characters. Example: new*relic Search with text To return more specific query results, use text searches to join together keywords or phrases. Text operators The Logs query syntax accepts the following text operators: Condition Text operator example Matching (keyword) Search for log results containing keywords entered separately: \"new\" \"relic\" Exact matching (phrase) Search for log results containing the specific phrase entered: \"new relic agent\" Either / Or Search for log results containing either or both of the keywords entered: new OR relic And Search for log results containing both of the keywords entered: new AND relic * Wildcard (zero or more) Search for log results containing both of the keywords entered, with zero or more characters between them: new*relic Negation (keyword) Search for log results that do not contain the specific keyword entered: -new Negation (phrase) Search for log results that do not contain the specific phrase entered. -\"new relic\" Search with attributes Use attribute searches to narrow the query results to a specific attribute or field. General operators The following operators can be used by all types of attributes: Condition General operator example Equal : Search for log results where the attribute equals the keyword specified. Example: The field hostname equals chi: hostname:chi Does not equal - : Search for log results where the attribute does not equal the keyword specified. Example: The field hostname does not equal chi. -hostname:chi Contains * Search for log results where the attribute contains the specified keyword. Example: The field hostname contains chi. hostname:*chi* Does not contain - * Search for log results where the attribute does not contain the specified keyword. Example: The field hostname does not contain chi. -hostname:*chi* Starts with * Search for log results where the attribute starts with the specified keyword specified. Example: The field hostname starts with chi. hostname:chi* Ends with * Search for log results where the attribute ends with the specified keyword specified. Example: The field hostname ends with chi. hostname:*chi Has Search for log results that have the specified field. Example: Has the field user_name. has:user_name Missing Search for log results that are missing the specified field. Example: Missing the field user_name. missing:user_name Numeric operators The following operators can only be used by numeric attributes: Condition Numeric operator example Greater than Search for log results attribute matches that are greater than the given parameter. Example: The field http_response_time_ms is greater than 500. http_response_time_ms:>500 Greater than or equal to Search for log results with attribute matches that are greater than or equal to the given parameter.

      "body": "After log event data has been shipped to New Relic, it can either be stored in our NRDB database or dropped (discarded). We can drop both log events and event attributes via drop filter rules. You can manage drop filter rules using our Logs UI, as explained in this document. You can also use NerdGraph. Savings, security, speed Drop filter rules help you accomplish several important goals: Lower costs by storing only logs relevant to your account. Protect privacy and security by removing personal identifiable information (PII). Reduce noise by removing irrelevant events and attributes. Caution Use caution when deciding to drop data. The data you drop is not recoverable. Before using this feature, review the responsibilities and considerations for dropping data. How drop filter rules work A drop filter rule matches data based on a query. When triggered, the drop filter rule removes the matching data from the ingestion pipeline before it is written to NRDB. This creates an explicit demarcation between the logs being forwarded from your domain and the data that New Relic collects. Since the data removed by the drop filter rule doesn't reach our backend, it cannot be queried: the data is gone and cannot be restored. During the ingestion process, customer log data can be parsed, transformed, or dropped before being stored in New Relic's database. Cautions when dropping data When creating drop rules, you are responsible for ensuring that the rules accurately identify and discard the data that meets the conditions that you have established. You are also responsible for monitoring the rule, as well as the data you disclose to New Relic. New Relic cannot guarantee that this functionality will completely resolve data disclosure concerns you may have. New Relic doesn't review or monitor how effective the rules you develop are. Creating rules about sensitive data can leak information about what kinds of data you maintain, including the format of your data or systems (for example, through referencing email addresses or specific credit card numbers). Any user with the relevant role-based access control permissions can view and edit all information in the rules you create. Create drop filter rules To create and edit drop filters, you must have admin permissions in New Relic, or you must be a member of a role with create and edit permissions for Insights > NRQL Drop Rules. Once a drop filter rule is active, it's applied to all log events ingested from that point onwards. Rules are not applied retroactively. Logs collected before creating a rule are not filtered by that rule. Filter or query the set of logs that contain the data you want to drop. Then, from Manage Data on the left nav of the Logs UI, click Create drop filter. To create a new drop filter rule, you can use new or existing log queries. Go to one.newrelic.com > Logs. Filter or query to the specific set of logs that contain the data to be dropped. Once the query is active, from Manage Data on the left nav of the Logs UI, click Create drop filter. Recommendation: Change the drop rule's default name to a meaningful name. Choose to either drop the entire log event that matches the query or just a specific subset of attributes in the matching events. Review the log partitions where this drop rule applies. Save the drop filter rule. Types of drop filter rules The drop filters UI prompts you to select whether to drop logs based on the query or on specific attributes. Drop log events The default type of drop filter rule is to drop logs. This option drops the entire log events that match the filter or query. When creating a rule, try to provide a specific query that only matches log data that should be dropped. Our drop filters process won't let you create drop filter rules without values in the matching query. This prevents badly formed rules from dropping all log data. Drop attributes You can specify attributes to be dropped in a log event that matches your query. At least one or more attributes must be selected. Any attribute which is selected will be dropped; all remaining attributes will be kept and stored in NRDB. Tip We recommend this method for removing fields that could contain personal identifiable information (PII) or other sensitive attributes without losing valuable monitoring data. View or delete drop filter rules To view or delete a drop filter rule: Go to one.newrelic.com > Logs. From Manage Data on the left nav of the Logs UI, click Drop filters. Click the delete icon next to the drop filter rule you want to remove. Once deleted, rules no longer filter ingested log events.",

Examine more context around a particular log line. Explore and manipulate your logging data with filters and parsing rules. Query and share the data with charts, add to dashboards, etc. Organize your account's log data, and optimize query performance with data partitions. Set up alert conditions for problems you want to prevent. To stay up to date with new capabilities and improvements, subscribe to our RSS feed for Logs release notes. Explore your log data Use the left nav in the Logs UI as an easy workflow through all logs, patterns, live-tail logging, and queries. Get more details about specific logs and their attributes from the center nav. To explore your logging data, follow this basic workflow. If you have not customized your New Relic One navigation bar, go to one.newrelic.com, click Browse data and select Logs. Look for patterns: To spot suspicious spikes or drops in log messages, click the log patterns icon on the left nav. To look at logs for a specific time period, click that point (or click and drag an area) on the chart, or use the time picker. Narrow your focus: To narrow the focus of your initial search results or quickly find outliers, expand any attributes in the log details to view the ten most common values within the results. For example, if a host listed under the hostname attribute is generating significantly more error messages than the others, select that value to apply it to your search. To make your log messages easier to query and understand, use our built-in parsing rules, or create your own parsing rules for attributes that match a particular value. To manage the amount of log data collected and to store fewer logs, create drop filter rules that avoid collecting data you don't need. Examine log details: Select a log message to view its details as a table of attributes or as JSON. To see which attributes are included in a log message, click the log line. Add or remove attributes as needed to help your query focus on the details you need. To help troubleshoot problems related to a specific value in the log details, click the Show surrounding logs icon for the attribute's details. To control which attributes appear in the results, click any highlighted value in the log's log_summary column. Search: By default, the Logs UI shows all your logs, but you can also search with keywords or phrases to find the results you want; for example, process failed. OR From the search field, use the type-ahead dropdowns to select an attribute, operator, and value; for example: service_name equals my service Copy For more information, see the Logs query syntax documentation. Tip To organize data within an account and to optimize query performance, create data partition rules. Get related logs: For example: To immediately see how your system responds to deployments or other app changes, enable live-tail logging. To view all the logs for a specific value, review the attributes list in the selected log's Log details. To help identify an issue's root cause before it occurred or its impact after an event, click the Show surrounding logs icon. Share your findings: Use any of the core New Relic One functions (specific account, time range, data explorer, query builder, etc.) to share the data with charts, add to dashboards, etc. For more information, see the examples in this document. Save your views You can save your logs query, table configuration, time range, and attribute grouping in a saved view, so that you can quickly return to it later. To save a log analytics view after you've configured the view: Click the Saved Views tab in the Logs UI left nav. Click Save current view. Give your saved view the name you want for it to be listed in the Saved Views tab. Select which aspects from the current view you want to save. Select the permission level: Private, Public (Read-only), and Public (Read and write). Public means that any user with access to the account is able to see the saved view. Click Save view.

This in turn helps you build better charts and alerts. From the left nav in the Logs UI, select Parsing, then create your own custom parsing rule with an attribute, value, and Grok pattern. New Relic parses log data according to rules. Learn how logs parsing works, how to use built-in rules, and how to create custom rules. Example A good example is a default NGINX access log containing unstructured text. It is useful for searching but not much else. Here's an example of a typical line: 127.180.71.3 - - [10/May/1997:08:05:32 +0000] \"GET /downloads/product_1 HTTP/1.1\" 304 0 \"-\" \"Debian APT-HTTP/1.3 (0.8.16~exp12ubuntu10.21)\" Copy In an unparsed format, you would need to do a full text search to answer most questions. After parsing, the log is organized into attributes, like response code and request URL: { \"remote_addr\":\"93.180.71.3\", \"time\":\"1586514731\", \"method\":\"GET\", \"path\":\"/downloads/product_1\", \"version\":\"HTTP/1.1\", \"response\":\"304\", \"bytesSent\": 0, \"user_agent\": \"Debian APT-HTTP/1.3 (0.8.16~exp12ubuntu10.21)\" } Copy Parsing makes it easier to create custom queries that facet on those values. This helps you understand the distribution of response codes per request URL and quickly find problematic pages. How log parsing works Here's an overview of how New Relic implements parsing of logs: Log parsing How it works What All parsing takes place against the message field; no other fields can be parsed. Each parsing rule has a matching criteria. We recommend using the logtype attribute name for matching parsing rules to logs. When Parsing will only be applied once to each log message. If multiple parsing rules match the log, only the first that succeeds will be applied. Parsing takes place during log ingestion, before data is written to NRDB. Once data has been written to storage, it can no longer be parsed. How Rules can be written in Grok, regex, or a mixture of the two. Grok is a collection of patterns that abstract away complicated regular expressions. If the content of the message field is JSON, it will be parsed automatically. New Relic's log ingestion pipeline can parse data by matching a log event to a rule that describes how the log should be parsed. There are two ways log events can be parsed: Use a built-in rule. Define a custom rule. Rules are a combination of matching logic and parsing logic. Matching is done by defining a query match on an attribute of the logs. Rules are not applied retroactively. Logs collected before a rule is created are not parsed by that rule. The simplest way to organize your logs and how they are parsed is to include the logtype field in your log event. This tells New Relic what built-in ruleset to apply to the logs. Important Once a parsing rule is active, data parsed by the rule is permanently changed. This cannot be reverted. Limits Parsing is computationally expensive, which introduces risk. Parsing is done for custom rules defined in an account and for matching patterns to a log. A large number of patterns or poorly defined custom rules will consume a huge amount of memory and CPU resources while also taking a very long time to complete. In order to prevent problems, we apply two parsing limits: per-message-per-rule and per-account. Limit Description Per-message-per-rule The per-message-per-rule limit prevents the time spent parsing any single message from being greater than 100 ms. If that limit is reached, the system will cease attempting to parse the log message with that rule. The ingestion pipeline will attempt to run any other applicable on that message, and the message will still be passed through the ingestion pipeline and stored in NRDB. The log message will be in its original, unparsed format. Per-account The per-account limit exists to prevent accounts from using more than their fair share of resources. The limit considers the total time spent processing all log messages for an account per-minute. The limit is not a fixed value; it scales up or down proportionally to the volume of data stored daily by the account and the environment size that is subsequently allocated to support that customer. Tip To easily check if your rate limits have been reached, go to your system Limits page in the New Relic UI. Built-in parsing rulesets Common log formats have well-established parsing rules already created for them. To get the benefit of built-in parsing rules, add the logtype attribute when forwarding logs. Set the value to something listed in the following table, and the rules for that type of log will be applied automatically. List of built-in rulesets The following logtype attribute values map to a standard parsing rulesets. See Built-in parsing rules to learn what fields are parsed for each rules. logtype Example matching query alb AWS Application Load Balancer logtype:alb apache Apache Access logtype:apache cloudfront-web CloudFront Web logtype:cloudfront-web elb Amazon Elastic Load Balancer logtype:elb iis_w3c IIS server logs - W3C format logtype:iis_w3c monit Monit logs logtype:monit mysql-error MySQL Error logtype:mysql-error nginx NGINX access logs logtype:nginx nginx-error NGINX error logs logtype:nginx-error route-53 Amazon Route 53 logs logtype:route-53 syslog-rfc5424 Syslog logtype:syslog-rfc5424 Add the logtype attribute When aggregating logs, it's important to provide metadata that makes it easy to organize, search, and parse those logs. One simple way of doing this is to add the attribute logtype to the log messages when they are shipped. Built-in parsing rules are applied by default to certain logtype values. Here are some examples of how to add logtype to logs sent by some of our supported shipping methods. New Relic infrastructure agent example Add logtype as an attribute. You must set the logtype for each named source. logs: - name: file-simple file: /path/to/file attributes: logtype: fileRaw - name: nginx-example file: /var/log/nginx.log attributes: logtype: nginx Copy Fluentd example Add a filter block to the .conf file, which uses a record_transformer to add a new field. In this example we use a logtype of nginx to trigger the build-in NGINX parsing rule. Check out other Fluentd examples. <filter containers> @type record_transformer enable_ruby true <record> #Add logtype to trigger a built-in parsing rule for nginx access logs logtype nginx #Set timestamp from the value contained in the field \"time\" timestamp record[\"time\"] #Add hostname and tag fields to all records hostname \"#{Socket.gethostname}\" tag ${tag} </record> </filter> Copy Fluent Bit example Add a filter block to the .conf file that uses a record_modifier to add a new field. In this example we use a logtype of nginx to trigger the build-in NGINX parsing rule. Check out other Fluent Bit examples. [FILTER] Name record_modifier Match * Record logtype nginx Record hostname ${HOSTNAME} Record service_name Sample-App-Name Copy Logstash example Add a filter block to the Logstash configuration which uses an add_field mutate filter to add a new field. In this example we use a logtype of nginx to trigger the build-in NGINX parsing rule. Check out other Logstash examples. filter { mutate { add_field => { \"logtype\" => \"nginx\" \"service_name\" => \"myservicename\" \"hostname\" => \"%{host}\" } } } Copy Logs API example You can add attributes to the JSON request sent to New Relic. In this example we add a logtype attribute of value nginx to trigger the built-in NGINX parsing rule. Learn more about using the Logs API. POST /log/v1 HTTP/1.1 Host: log-api.newrelic.com Content-Type: application/json X-License-Key: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY Accept: */* Content-Length: 133 { \"timestamp\": TIMESTAMP_IN_UNIX_EPOCH, \"message\": \"User 'xyz' logged in\", \"logtype\": \"accesslogs\", \"service\": \"login-service\", \"hostname\": \"login.example.com\" } Copy Create custom parsing rules Many logs are formatted or structured in a unique way. In order to parse them, custom logic must be built and applied. From the left nav in the Logs UI, select Parsing, then create your own custom parsing rule with an attribute, value, and Grok pattern. To create and manage your own, custom parsing rules: Go to one.newrelic.com > Logs. From Manage Data on the left nav of the Logs UI, click Parsing, then click Create parsing rule. Enter the parsing rule's name. Choose an attribute and value to match on. Write your Grok pattern and test the rule. To learn about Grok and custom parsing rules, read our blog post about how to parse logs with Grok patterns. Enable and save the custom parsing rule.

      "body": "After log event data has been shipped to New Relic, it can either be stored in our NRDB database or dropped (discarded). We can drop both log events and event attributes via drop filter rules. You can manage drop filter rules using our Logs UI, as explained in this document. You can also use NerdGraph. Savings, security, speed Drop filter rules help you accomplish several important goals: Lower costs by storing only logs relevant to your account. Protect privacy and security by removing personal identifiable information (PII). Reduce noise by removing irrelevant events and attributes. Caution Use caution when deciding to drop data. The data you drop is not recoverable. Before using this feature, review the responsibilities and considerations for dropping data. How drop filter rules work A drop filter rule matches data based on a query. When triggered, the drop filter rule removes the matching data from the ingestion pipeline before it is written to NRDB. This creates an explicit demarcation between the logs being forwarded from your domain and the data that New Relic collects. Since the data removed by the drop filter rule doesn't reach our backend, it cannot be queried: the data is gone and cannot be restored. During the ingestion process, customer log data can be parsed, transformed, or dropped before being stored in New Relic's database. Cautions when dropping data When creating drop rules, you are responsible for ensuring that the rules accurately identify and discard the data that meets the conditions that you have established. You are also responsible for monitoring the rule, as well as the data you disclose to New Relic. New Relic cannot guarantee that this functionality will completely resolve data disclosure concerns you may have. New Relic doesn't review or monitor how effective the rules you develop are. Creating rules about sensitive data can leak information about what kinds of data you maintain, including the format of your data or systems (for example, through referencing email addresses or specific credit card numbers). Any user with the relevant role-based access control permissions can view and edit all information in the rules you create. Create drop filter rules To create and edit drop filters, you must have admin permissions in New Relic, or you must be a member of a role with create and edit permissions for Insights > NRQL Drop Rules. Once a drop filter rule is active, it's applied to all log events ingested from that point onwards. Rules are not applied retroactively. Logs collected before creating a rule are not filtered by that rule. Filter or query the set of logs that contain the data you want to drop. Then, from Manage Data on the left nav of the Logs UI, click Create drop filter. To create a new drop filter rule, you can use new or existing log queries. Go to one.newrelic.com > Logs. Filter or query to the specific set of logs that contain the data to be dropped. Once the query is active, from Manage Data on the left nav of the Logs UI, click Create drop filter. Recommendation: Change the drop rule's default name to a meaningful name. Choose to either drop the entire log event that matches the query or just a specific subset of attributes in the matching events. Review the log partitions where this drop rule applies. Save the drop filter rule. Types of drop filter rules The drop filters UI prompts you to select whether to drop logs based on the query or on specific attributes. Drop log events The default type of drop filter rule is to drop logs. This option drops the entire log events that match the filter or query. When creating a rule, try to provide a specific query that only matches log data that should be dropped. Our drop filters process won't let you create drop filter rules without values in the matching query. This prevents badly formed rules from dropping all log data. Drop attributes You can specify attributes to be dropped in a log event that matches your query. At least one or more attributes must be selected. Any attribute which is selected will be dropped; all remaining attributes will be kept and stored in NRDB. Tip We recommend this method for removing fields that could contain personal identifiable information (PII) or other sensitive attributes without losing valuable monitoring data. View or delete drop filter rules To view or delete a drop filter rule: Go to one.newrelic.com > Logs. From Manage Data on the left nav of the Logs UI, click Drop filters. Click the delete icon next to the drop filter rule you want to remove. Once deleted, rules no longer filter ingested log events.",

To drill down into additional details, click any highlighted attribute. Each log's summary in the Logs UI provides query options to add, exclude, replace, and more. Query structure Using the Logs UI, you can search through your log data by entering either simple keywords, such as new and relic, or phrases such as new relic agent, directly into the search field. You can also combine keywords or phrases with operators to form more complex queries. Tip Log queries in New Relic are based on the Lucene query language, and any Lucene function listed in this document is supported. (If a Lucene function is not listed, we do not support it.) For some helpful examples, check out this Lucene tutorial. General query rules: Log query rules Comments Case sensitive The query syntax is case sensitive for attributes values. Attribute names are always case sensitive. Exception: Wildcard searches are case insensitive for attribute values. Special characters When a term contains special characters, double-quote the term and escape the special characters using a backslash (\\). This includes special characters such as +, -, &, |, !, (, ), {, }, [, ], ^, \", ~, *, ?, :, /, or \\. Example: To query for \"POST /log/v1 HTTP/1.1\" 202, escape the quotes like this: \"\\\"POST /log/v1 HTTP/1.1\\\" 202\" Wildcard searches You can run wildcard searches using an asterisk (*) to replace zero or more characters. Example: new*relic Search with text To return more specific query results, use text searches to join together keywords or phrases. Text operators The Logs query syntax accepts the following text operators: Condition Text operator example Matching (keyword) Search for log results containing keywords entered separately: \"new\" \"relic\" Exact matching (phrase) Search for log results containing the specific phrase entered: \"new relic agent\" Either / Or Search for log results containing either or both of the keywords entered: new OR relic And Search for log results containing both of the keywords entered: new AND relic * Wildcard (zero or more) Search for log results containing both of the keywords entered, with zero or more characters between them: new*relic Negation (keyword) Search for log results that do not contain the specific keyword entered: -new Negation (phrase) Search for log results that do not contain the specific phrase entered. -\"new relic\" Search with attributes Use attribute searches to narrow the query results to a specific attribute or field. General operators The following operators can be used by all types of attributes: Condition General operator example Equal : Search for log results where the attribute equals the keyword specified. Example: The field hostname equals chi: hostname:chi Does not equal - : Search for log results where the attribute does not equal the keyword specified. Example: The field hostname does not equal chi. -hostname:chi Contains * Search for log results where the attribute contains the specified keyword. Example: The field hostname contains chi. hostname:*chi* Does not contain - * Search for log results where the attribute does not contain the specified keyword. Example: The field hostname does not contain chi. -hostname:*chi* Starts with * Search for log results where the attribute starts with the specified keyword specified. Example: The field hostname starts with chi. hostname:chi* Ends with * Search for log results where the attribute ends with the specified keyword specified. Example: The field hostname ends with chi. hostname:*chi Has Search for log results that have the specified field. Example: Has the field user_name. has:user_name Missing Search for log results that are missing the specified field. Example: Missing the field user_name. missing:user_name Numeric operators The following operators can only be used by numeric attributes: Condition Numeric operator example Greater than Search for log results attribute matches that are greater than the given parameter. Example: The field http_response_time_ms is greater than 500. http_response_time_ms:>500 Greater than or equal to Search for log results with attribute matches that are greater than or equal to the given parameter.

This helps you understand the distribution of response codes per request URL and quickly find problematic pages. How log parsing works Here's an overview of how New Relic implements parsing of logs: Log parsing How it works What All parsing takes place against the message field; no other fields can be parsed. Each parsing rule has a matching criteria. We recommend using the logtype attribute name for matching parsing rules to logs. When Parsing will only be applied once to each log message. If multiple parsing rules match the log, only the first that succeeds will be applied. Parsing takes place during log ingestion, before data is written to NRDB. Once data has been written to storage, it can no longer be parsed. How Rules can be written in Grok, regex, or a mixture of the two. Grok is a collection of patterns that abstract away complicated regular expressions. If the content of the message field is JSON, it will be parsed automatically. New Relic's log ingestion pipeline can parse data by matching a log event to a rule that describes how the log should be parsed. There are two ways log events can be parsed: Use a built-in rule. Define a custom rule. Rules are a combination of matching logic and parsing logic. Matching is done by defining a query match on an attribute of the logs. Rules are not applied retroactively. Logs collected before a rule is created are not parsed by that rule. The simplest way to organize your logs and how they are parsed is to include the logtype field in your log event. This tells New Relic what built-in ruleset to apply to the logs. Important Once a parsing rule is active, data parsed by the rule is permanently changed. This cannot be reverted. Limits Parsing is computationally expensive, which introduces risk. Parsing is done for custom rules defined in an account and for matching patterns to a log. A large number of patterns or poorly defined custom rules will consume a huge amount of memory and CPU resources while also taking a very long time to complete. In order to prevent problems, we apply two parsing limits: per-message-per-rule and per-account. Limit Description Per-message-per-rule The per-message-per-rule limit prevents the time spent parsing any single message from being greater than 100 ms. If that limit is reached, the system will cease attempting to parse the log message with that rule. The ingestion pipeline will attempt to run any other applicable on that message, and the message will still be passed through the ingestion pipeline and stored in NRDB. The log message will be in its original, unparsed format. Per-account The per-account limit exists to prevent accounts from using more than their fair share of resources. The limit considers the total time spent processing all log messages for an account per-minute. The limit is not a fixed value; it scales up or down proportionally to the volume of data stored daily by the account and the environment size that is subsequently allocated to support that customer. Tip To easily check if your rate limits have been reached, go to your system Limits page in the New Relic UI. Built-in parsing rulesets Common log formats have well-established parsing rules already created for them. To get the benefit of built-in parsing rules, add the logtype attribute when forwarding logs. Set the value to something listed in the following table, and the rules for that type of log will be applied automatically. List of built-in rulesets The following logtype attribute values map to a standard parsing rulesets. See Built-in parsing rules to learn what fields are parsed for each rules. logtype Example matching query alb AWS Application Load Balancer logtype:alb apache Apache Access logtype:apache cloudfront-web CloudFront Web logtype:cloudfront-web elb Amazon Elastic Load Balancer logtype:elb iis_w3c IIS server logs - W3C format logtype:iis_w3c monit Monit logs logtype:monit mysql-error MySQL Error logtype:mysql-error nginx NGINX access logs logtype:nginx nginx-error NGINX error logs logtype:nginx-error route-53 Amazon Route 53 logs logtype:route-53 syslog-rfc5424 Syslog logtype:syslog-rfc5424 Add the logtype attribute When aggregating logs, it's important to provide metadata that makes it easy to organize, search, and parse those logs. One simple way of doing this is to add the attribute logtype to the log messages when they are shipped. Built-in parsing rules are applied by default to certain logtype values. Here are some examples of how to add logtype to logs sent by some of our supported shipping methods. New Relic infrastructure agent example Add logtype as an attribute. You must set the logtype for each named source. logs: - name: file-simple file: /path/to/file attributes: logtype: fileRaw - name: nginx-example file: /var/log/nginx.log attributes: logtype: nginx Copy Fluentd example Add a filter block to the .conf file, which uses a record_transformer to add a new field. In this example we use a logtype of nginx to trigger the build-in NGINX parsing rule. Check out other Fluentd examples. <filter containers> @type record_transformer enable_ruby true <record> #Add logtype to trigger a built-in parsing rule for nginx access logs logtype nginx #Set timestamp from the value contained in the field \"time\" timestamp record[\"time\"] #Add hostname and tag fields to all records hostname \"#{Socket.gethostname}\" tag ${tag} </record> </filter> Copy Fluent Bit example Add a filter block to the .conf file that uses a record_modifier to add a new field. In this example we use a logtype of nginx to trigger the build-in NGINX parsing rule. Check out other Fluent Bit examples. [FILTER] Name record_modifier Match * Record logtype nginx Record hostname ${HOSTNAME} Record service_name Sample-App-Name Copy Logstash example Add a filter block to the Logstash configuration which uses an add_field mutate filter to add a new field. In this example we use a logtype of nginx to trigger the build-in NGINX parsing rule. Check out other Logstash examples. filter { mutate { add_field => { \"logtype\" => \"nginx\" \"service_name\" => \"myservicename\" \"hostname\" => \"%{host}\" } } } Copy Logs API example You can add attributes to the JSON request sent to New Relic. In this example we add a logtype attribute of value nginx to trigger the built-in NGINX parsing rule. Learn more about using the Logs API.

Create a New Relic account for free! No credit card required. Compatibility and requirements Requirements include: A New Relic license key For payload details, see limits and restricted characters. HTTP setup To send log data to your New Relic account: Get your New Relic license key. Generate the JSON message using the required headers and body fields. Ensure you're providing an Api-Key or License-Key via headers or query parameters Submit the JSON message to the HTTP endpoint in a POST request. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your account for data. HTTP headers When creating your HTTP headers, use these guidelines: Header Supported values Content-Type Required application/json json application/gzip gzip Api-Key Required A New Relic license key. You can also send this via query parameter. You can also use an Insights insert key but the license key is preferred. Gzipped JSON formatting is accepted. If sending compressed JSON, please include the Content-Type: application/json and Content-Encoding: gzip headers. HTTP query parameters The license key can also be passed as a query string parameter. This can be useful when sending logs from cloud-based sources that don't allow custom HTTP request headers. Query parameter Value Api-Key Your license key. Use this key whenever you send a header. You can also use an Insights insert key but the license key is preferred. JSON body You can send your JSON message using either a simplified or detailed set of attributes: Simplified JSON body message When using the simplified format to create your JSON message, send a single JSON object with the following: Field Value type Format Required Notes \"timestamp\" Integer Either milliseconds or seconds since epoch No If the field is not specific as millisecond or seconds since epoch, the message will be timestamped using the ingest time \"message\" String any string No This is the main log message field that is searched by default \"logtype\" String any string No Primary field for identifying logs and matching parsing rules other_fields (must not contain white space) String any string No These will become attributes of the log message Note: Log management does not support white space in attribute names Detailed JSON body message When using the detailed format to create your body, it must be a JSON array containing one or more JSON objects, each of which with the following format: Field Value type Format Required Notes \"common\" Object See common. No Any attributes that are common to all log messages \"logs\" Array See logs. Yes Array with the log entries Limits and restricted characters Caution Avoid calling our API from within the code of a customer-facing application. This can cause performance issues or block your application if response time is slow. If you need to do it this way, call our API asynchronously to avoid these performance issues. Restrictions on logs sent to the Log API: Payload total size: 1MB(10^6 bytes) maximum per POST. We highly recommend using compression. The payload must be encoded as UTF-8. Number of attributes per event: 255 maximum Length of attribute name: 255 characters Length of attribute value: 4096 maximum character length Some specific attributes have additional restrictions: accountId: This is a reserved attribute name. If it is included, it will be dropped during ingest. entity.guid, entity.name, and entity.type: These attributes are used internally to identify entities. Any values submitted with these keys in the attributes section of a metric data point may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. For more information please refer to Entity synthesis. appId: Value must be an integer. If it is not an integer, the attribute name and value will be dropped during ingest. eventType: Can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, _ underscores, and : colons. timestamp: Must be a Unix epoch timestamp. You can define timestamps either in seconds or in milliseconds. Important Payloads with timestamps older than 48 hours may be dropped. Rate limits on logs sent to the Log API: Maximum rate for HTTP requests sent to the Log API: 300,000 requests per minute Maximum rate of uncompressed Log JSON bytes sent to the Log API: 10 GB per minute Rate limit violations Exceeding rate limits affects how the Log API behaves. Follow these instructions if this happens. HTTP requests per minute When the maximum request rate limit is exceeded for an account, the New Relic Log API returns a 429 response for the remainder of the minute. This response includes a Retry-After header indicating how long to wait in seconds before resubmitting or sending new data. To resolve this issue, either reduce the number of data points you are sending, or request a rate limit change. Subsequent subscription changes do not impact modified rate limits. If an account change impacts your rate limit, you must notify us to adjust your rate limit. To request rate limit changes, contact your New Relic account representative, or visit our Support portal. JSON bytes per minute When the maximum Log JSON byte limit is exceeded for an account, the New Relic Log API returns a 429 response for the remainder of the minute. This response includes a Retry-After header indicating how long to wait in seconds before resubmitting or sending new data. To resolve this issue, try to reduce the amount of log data you are sending, or spread it out over a larger period of time. To request rate limit changes, contact your New Relic account representative, or visit our Support portal. Log payload format We accept any valid JSON payload. The payload must encoded as UTF-8. Important Log management does not support white space in attribute names. For example, {\"Sample Attribute\": \"Value\"} would cause errors. JSON message attributes Common block attributes This is a block containing attributes that will be common to all log entries in logs: Field Value type Format Required Notes \"timestamp\" Integer Milliseconds or seconds since epoch No Message timestamp default to ingest time \"attributes\" Object JSON No This sub-object contains all other attributes of the message Logs block attributes This is an array containing log entries with the following format: Field Value type Format Required Notes \"timestamp\" Integer Milliseconds or seconds since epoch No Message timestamp default to ingest time \"attributes\" Object JSON No This sub-object contains all other attributes of the message \"message\" String (any string) Yes This is the main log message field that is searched by default \"log\" String (any string) No We will rewrite this string as the field message on ingest \"LOG\" String (any string) No We will rewrite this string as the field message on ingest \"MESSAGE\" String (any string) No We will rewrite this string as the field message on ingest JSON message attribute parsing This will attempt to parse any message attribute as JSON. If the message attribute is JSON, it will be parsed and the resultant JSON attributes will be added to the event. If the message attribute is not JSON, it is left as is. For example, the event: { \"timestamp\": 1562767499238, \"message\": \"{\\\"service-name\\\": \\\"login-service\\\", \\\"user\\\": {\\\"id\\\": 123, \\\"name\\\": \\\"alice\\\"}}\" } Copy Will be treated as: { \"timestamp\": 1562767499238, \"message\": \"{\\\"service-name\\\": \\\"my-service\\\", \\\"user\\\": {\\\"id\\\": 123, \\\"name\\\": \\\"alice\\\"}}\", \"service-name\": \"my-service\", \"user\": { \"id\": 123, \"name\": \"alice\" } } Copy Important Log management does not support white space in attribute names. For example, {\"Sample Attribute\": \"Value\"} would cause errors. Log JSON example Attributes may be scalar JSON types like string and number, but may also be compound (or nested) objects. Compound attributes will have their leaf attributes stored with flattened names. For instance, a compound user attribute in a log entry's attributes: \"attributes\": { \"action\": \"login\", \"user\": { \"id\": 123, \"name\": \"alice\" } } Copy will result in the following attributes being stored with the log event: Attribute Value \"action\" \"login\" \"user.id\" 123 \"user.name\" \"alice\" Log POST example Log POST message example: POST /log/v1 HTTP/1.1 Host: log-api.newrelic.com Content-Type: application/json X-License-Key: <YOUR_LICENSE_KEY> Accept: */* Content-Length: 319 [{ \"common\": { \"attributes\": { \"logtype\": \"accesslogs\", \"service\": \"login-service\", \"hostname\": \"login.example.com\" } }, \"logs\": [{ \"timestamp\": <TIMESTAMP_IN_UNIX_EPOCH>, \"message\": \"User 'xyz' logged in\" },{ \"timestamp\": <TIMESTAMP_IN_UNIX_EPOCH>, \"message\": \"User 'xyz' logged out\", \"attributes\": { \"auditId\": 123 } }] }] Copy The above POST message would result in the following log messages being stored in Log management: Example of stored common block attributes: Attribute Value \"logtype\" \"accesslogs\" \"service\" \"login-service\" \"hostname\" \"login.example.com\" Example of stored logs block attributes example: Attribute Value \"timestamp\" 1550086450124 \"message\" \"User 'xyz' logged out\" \"auditId\" 123 HTTP endpoint Once configured, your JSON data can be sent to the following endpoint in a POST request: United States (US) endpoint: https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 Copy European Union (EU) endpoint: https://log-api.eu.newrelic.com/log/v1 Copy Here's an example of a JSON POST request: POST /log/v1 HTTP/1.1 Host: log-api.newrelic.com Content-Type: application/json X-License-Key: <YOUR_LICENSE_KEY> Accept: */* Content-Length: 133 { \"timestamp\": <TIMESTAMP_IN_UNIX_EPOCH>, \"message\": \"User 'xyz' logged in\", \"logtype\": \"accesslogs\", \"service\": \"login-service\", \"hostname\": \"login.example.com\" } Copy Find log data For where to find data sent via the Log API (including from integrations that use that API), see Find log data.

      "body": "This document provides information on FedRAMP-compliant endpoints in New Relic. For more information about our security accreditation for the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP), see our data encryption documentation. Customer FedRAMP obligations New Relic customers must meet all of the following requirements for New Relic’s FedRAMP environment: New Relic-approved customers: New Relic’s FedRAMP-Moderate authorized environment is only available to New Relic-approved customers. For more information, contact your New Relic account representative. Order form: Customer’s order form with New Relic must include customer’s eligibility for FedRAMP. Subscription level: Customer must have a current and valid subscription to New Relic Full-Stack Observability Enterprise or New Relic-approved subscription. Authorized New Relic endpoints: Customer must send its data only to New Relic’s FedRAMP-designated endpoints. Authorized services and features: Customer must use only FedRAMP audited and authorized New Relic services and features (see below). Overview of data sources There are multiple ways to get data into New Relic. This doc has two sections: Agent settings: for our APM agents, infrastructure agent, browser agent, and mobile agent. Data-ingest APIs: for our Metric API, Event API, Trace API, and Log API, and the integrations that use those APIs. Agents New Relic has several agents for reporting data, like our APM agents, infrastructure agents, mobile agents, and browser agent. Setting these agents to send FedRAMP-compliant data involves setting a configuration setting to use the relevant FedRAMP endpoint. APM agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance, all APM agent configurations must report to gov-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. Depending on the agent, you can either use code-based configuration or an environment variable. Here are details on enabling this: Language Code or environment variable C SDK In code: strcpy(_newrelic_app_config_t->redirect_collector, \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"); Copy Environment variable: none Go In code: app, err = newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"App Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(os.Getenv(\"NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY\")), func(cfg *newrelic.Config) { cfg.Host = \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" }, ) Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Java In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Or set a system property of: newrelic.config.host Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST .NET In your XML config next to the license key: <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" host=\"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"/> Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Node.js In newrelic.js: host: 'gov-collector.newrelic.com' Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST PHP In newrelic.ini: newrelic.daemon.collector_host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: none Python In newrelic.ini: [newrelic] host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Ruby In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Elixir (open source agent) In config.exs: config :new_relic_agent, host: \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST For more on configuring APM agents, see APM configuration. Mobile monitoring agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using our mobile monitoring agents, all agent configurations must report to gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. You must use code-based configuration. Environment variables are not available. Framework-specific configurations: Agent Code or environment variable Android In code: NewRelic.withApplicationToken({APP_TOKEN}) .usingCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\") .usingCrashCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\") .start(this.getApplication()); Copy Environment variable: none iOS In code: [NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:@\"{APP_TOKEN}\" andCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\" andCrashCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\"]; Copy Environment variable: none Infrastructure monitoring If you have infrastructure agent version 1.15.0 or higher, simply enable the FedRAMP configuration option. This enables FedRAMP compliancy for data reported by the infrastructure agent, and for any on-host integrations that work with the infrastructure agent to report data. Important The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration is not currently FedRAMP compliant. If you have an older agent version, use the following values to edit your YAML configuration: Infrastructure agent versions below 1.15.0 If you have an infrastructure agent version below 1.15.0, you must change three of the endpoints used for reporting. To set these endpoints, you can change your YAML configuration or use environment variables. YAML config field Endpoint URL collector_url https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy identity_url https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy command_channel_url https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy To edit environment variables, use these values: Environment variable Endpoint URL NRIA_COLLECTOR_URL https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_IDENTITY_URL https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_COMMAND_CHANNEL_URL https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy Browser agent To configure the browser agent to use a FedRAMP-compliant endpoint, you must use the copy-paste method method (other browser agent install methods are not supported) and edit the browser code’s script element tag so that the domain is gov-bam.nr-data.net for both beacon and errorBeacon, like this: window.NREUM||(NREUM={});NREUM.info={\"beacon\":\"gov-bam.nr-data.net\",\"errorBeacon\":\"gov-bam.nr-data.net\"... Copy Note: You only need to modify the beacon and errorBeacon properties in the NREUM.info object. These values will override the default values found in the NR loader script. Data-ingest APIs Below are details about the FedRAMP endpoint for our ingest APIs: Metric API, the Event API, the Log API, and the Trace API. Metric API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the Metric API, instead of sending metric data to the default Metric API endpoint of https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1, it must be sent to https://gov-metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1. The Metric API can be used directly but it's mainly used by various New Relic tools. Below are instructions showing where to edit the configuration for setting the FedRAMP endpoint. Telemetry integrations Here are instructions for our open source telemetry integrations that report metric data: Dropwizard: use the overrideUri configuration. Kamon: use the metric-ingest-url configuration. See Override endpoints. Micrometer: override the public String uri() method on your NewRelicRegistryConfig to return the new endpoint. See an example. Prometheus: Prometheus OpenMetrics: if you are using our nri-prometheus helm chart, you can change the endpoint in your values.yml file, like in this example. If you're using the nri-bundle chart, you need to nest this value under the nri-prometheus key to propagate it to the sub-chart. Remote write integration: not available. Telemetry SDKs Here are instructions for our Telemetry SDKs that report metric data: Go: use the MetricsURLOverride configuration. Java: in the MetricBatchSender section, configure the endpoint. See an example. .NET: use the MetricUrlOverride configuration. Node.js: edit the METRIC_HOST = 'metric-api.newrelic.com' configuration. Python: edit the HOST = \"metric-api.newrelic.com\" configuration. Event API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for the Event API, all traffic reporting to insights-collector.newrelic.com must instead report to gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com. The Event API endpoint is configurable for the following Telemetry SDKs. The Telemetry SDKs are used by our open-source telemetry integrations. Language Solution Java Telemetry SDK In code: SenderConfiguration configuration = SenderConfiguration .builder( \"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\", EventBatchSender.EVENTS_PATH) .build(); EventBatchSender eventBatchSender = EventBatchSender.create(configuration); Copy Python Telemetry SDK In code: event_client = EventClient(host=\"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\") Copy For more information, see our Telemetry API documentation in GitHub. Log API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Log API, the solution for almost all our logging tools is to replace the https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 endpoint with https://gov-log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1. Here are details for various tools: Log forwarders Here are details on changing the endpoint for our log forwarders: AWS Firelens: Add the endpoint property to the options field of the logConfiguration, similar to to the EU account endpoint change shown in these Firelens endpoint configuration instructions. Fluentbit: Use our Fluentbit endpoint configuration. Fluentd: Use our Fluentd endpoint instructions. Infrastructure agent: See FedRAMP for infrastructure. Kubernetes: Our Kubernetes integration logs are based on fluentbit’s output plugin. Use these endpoint instructions. Logstash: Use our Logstash endpoint configuration. Syslog: For configuring syslog clients, see TCP endpoint configuration. S3: Not available. Vector: Not available. To use the Log API directly, you'd edit the Log API endpoint configuration. Trace API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Trace API (including telemetry integrations that use this API), replace the https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1 endpoint with https://gov-trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1. Notes about FedRAMP compliance for other trace data: Trace data is reported by some of our agents, like our APM agents, browser agent, and mobile agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for that data, you would enable FedRAMP for the applicable agent. Currently Infinite Tracing is not FedRAMP compliant.",

App server SLA metric name:value (and formula) Requests millions HttpDispatcher : call_count (scaled appropriately) Resp. time ms HttpDispatcher : average_response_time (multiplied by 1000) Apdex Apdex : score % Satisfied Apdex : s divided by Apdex : count % Tolerating Apdex : t divided by Apdex : count % Frustrated Apdex : f divided by Apdex : count Tips for collecting metrics Here are some tips for planning which metrics to collect. SLA tips Comments Requirements When using the cURL command examples, be sure to replace the placeholder text with your account ID, an API key, and the application ID. Time ranges You are not limited to standard day, week, or month time ranges. For example, you can extract metric data for a \"holiday weekend\" from 12/23 to 12/26 or \"the 20 minutes after our site had problems\" or whatever other period interests you. UTC XML time format You must specify the time in UTC XML format, so be sure to adjust for your time zone compared to UTC. For example, New Relic starts at 16:00:00 on the day before the selected data, since New Relic headquarters are in UTC-8. Summary reports When requesting metrics to use with summary reports, include the query string parameter summarize=true (v2) or summary=1 (v1) as shown in the examples. Scaled statistics Your report has some statistics that are scaled in the SLA reports in New Relic's user interface. New Relic changes the scale of page views in your report to show small numbers. Depending on your traffic, typically it might be displayed in thousands, millions, or billions. Recommendation: To avoid a string of zeroes, divide this number appropriately for your own purposes. End user statistics End user statistics will reflect only the calls in which the agent gathered browser data. For example, end user stats may not appear in situations such as: Browser types Clients (they might have disabled the JavaScript agent, or blocked traffic to New Relic sites for JavaScript code's location Transactions not in one of those categories, in case the page load did not complete for any reason This is why there are fewer (sometimes many fewer) page views in the End User (browser) data section than in the App server data section. Examples The following sections contain code examples to acquire the data for values described above for the Daily (24hr) SLA statistics in the default GMT/UTC time zone. Adjust the from= and to= for your time range as desired. There are syntactical differences between New Relic's REST API v2 and v1. The examples show how to use each. REST API v2 commands Browser load time and page view count (v2) To obtain the browser (EndUser/RUM) load time and page view count for v2, from the command line, type: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/metrics/data.xml\"\\ -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" -i \\ -d 'names[]=EndUser&values[]=call_count&values[]=average_response_time&from=2014-06-09T00:00:00+00:00&to=2014-06-09T23:00:00+00:00&summarize=true' Copy In Ruby: require 'rubygems' require 'curb' response = Curl::Easy.http_get(\"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/metrics/data.xml?names[]=EndUser&values[]=call_count&values[]=average_response_time&from=2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00&to=2012-01-08T00:00:00+00:00&summarize=true\") do |curl| curl.headers[\"api-key\"] = \"$API_KEY\" curl.header_in_body=true end puts response.body_str Copy App response time and request count (v2) To obtain the Application response time and request count for v2, from the command line, type: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/metrics/data.xml\" \\ -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" -i \\ -d 'names[]=HttpDispatcher&values[]=average_response_time&values[]=call_count&from=2014-06-09T00:00:00+00:00&to=2014-06-09T23:00:00+00:00&summarize=true' Copy In Ruby: require 'rubygems' require 'curb' response = Curl::Easy.http_get(\"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/metrics/data.xml?names[]=HttpDispatcher&values[]=average_response_time&values[]=call_count&from=2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00&to=2012-01-08T00:00:00+00:00&summarize=true\") do |curl| curl.headers[\"api-key\"] = \"$API_KEY\" curl.header_in_body=true end puts response.body_str Copy Apdex SLA data (v2) To obtain the Apdex related data for v2, from the command line, type: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/metrics/data.xml\" \\ -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" -i \\ -d 'names[]=Apdex&names[]=EndUser/Apdex&from=2014-06-09T00:00:00+00:00&to=2014-06-09T23:00:00+00:00&summarize=true' Copy In Ruby: require 'rubygems' require 'curb' response = Curl::Easy.http_get(\"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/metrics/data.xml?names[]=EndUser/Apdex&from=2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00&to=2012-01-08T00:00:00+00:00&summarize=true\") do |curl| curl.headers[\"api-key\"] = \"$API_KEY\" curl.header_in_body=true end puts response.body_str Copy REST API v1 commands (deprecated) REST API v1 is deprecated.

      "body": "Handled exceptions help you identify significant factors contributing to poor mobile application experience, and use filterable data to find a resolution more quickly. You can also use the handled exceptions API to customize the data you send, and use NRQL to query and share the data. Handled exceptions workflow To get the most out of the Handled exceptions UI, use this basic workflow: Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Exceptions > Handled exceptions. Use any of New Relic's standard page functions to drill down into detailed information; for example, zoom into any area of a chart. Look for obvious or general trends in the Users affected and Sessions affected percentage charts. Adjust the types of exceptions shown by using groups and filters. Optional: Query or share the chart data. Look for similar patterns where exceptions appear in stack traces with the Top 5 exception locations table. To view stack trace thread details for each occurrence of the exception, select a record from the Top 5 exceptions location table. one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Exceptions > Handled exceptions: As you explore the wealth of data in the charts and table, use groups and filters to discover patterns that help you determine the root cause of mobile app exceptions. Exception percentage charts Start with the Users affected and Sessions affected percentage charts to see at a glance whether there are any unexpected spikes, dips, or patterns with exceptions in general. (If the Users affected chart is empty, there were no user sessions during the selected time period.) For example: Are there any spikes near a recent version release? Is there a time period when the percentage of users has been affected significantly by the exception? Are there uneventful periods? To examine data in greater detail: Below any chart, select Expand chart. Exception percentage charts example one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Exceptions > Handled exceptions: The percentage charts help you quickly see any unexpected spikes, dips, or patterns with exceptions in general. Groups and filters Use the groups and filters to examine attributes for crashes, devices, locations, or other custom attributes in more detail. You can select a group, then filter to specific data. For example: Group the list by exception location (default), cause, app build or version, devices, connections, or other custom attributes. This lets you discover patterns in your exceptions to determine the root cause. Use the time picker to adjust the currently selected time period. Filter by a specific Version or by one or more attribute Filter, such as appVersion, exceptionLocationMethod, lastInteraction, or any of the longer list of standard and custom attributes. The currently selected filters appear at the top of the UI page. You can close them, add other filters, or select other groups and filters. Groups and filters example one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Exceptions > Handled exceptions: Group the data by attributes that matter to the most to you, then select one or more filters to help pinpoint specific causes behind the exceptions. Top five exception locations Use the Top 5 exception locations table to find or sort patterns in the type of exception you selected from the groups and filters. This includes: Recurring locations in the stack trace Mobile app version Number of occurrences Number of users affected during the selected time period For example, you can group by Exception Message, filter to timeout message, then select individual timeout locations from the table to review the stack trace thread and details about each occurrence. To filter or group by other attributes, use the table's search window, or select any of the available filters. For example, filter by type of occurrence, device, a specific location, or any custom attributes. To look for other historical patterns, change the selected time period. Top five exception locations example one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Exceptions > Handled exceptions: This example shows the Expand chart button and links to the query builder, where you can query, create dashboards, and share the handled exceptions data. Query builder links Handled exceptions charts use default attributes for mobile events (including MobileHandledException), along with any custom attributes you have added to this event type. When you mouse over the charts, direct links appear below them. These links to the query builder allow you to analyze your mobile app data even deeper. View query link: View the NRQL query used to calculate the chart data. View in query builder link: View the chart, and share it with others. Exception locations table The Exception locations table supplements the charts. It lists where the top five handled exceptions appear in their stack trace thread, and links them to relevant details. Each row helps you find answers to questions such as: How many of this exception occurred within the selected time period? Does a specific app version have a higher (or lower) number of users affected? Which exception has the fewest number of occurrences? You can change the sort order or filter options to focus on just the types of exceptions that matter the most to you and your teams. To view additional thread details for each occurrence of the exception, select a record from the Top 5 exceptions location table. Exception locations table example one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Exceptions > Handled exceptions: To continue to the handled exception's Occurrences page, select any row on the table.",

      "body": "Exceptions can contribute to invalid application states, resulting not only in application crashes but also in negative user reviews. This may lead to users deleting your app, which in turn may affect your organization's profitability. With the Handled exceptions UI, mobile development managers and their developer teams can identify significant factors affecting poor mobile app experience, and use filterable data to find a resolution more quickly. Features Handling exceptions as they occur can help improve your mobile app users' experience, but it's not enough to catch exceptions. You also need to know how to prevent them. For example: How many different types of handled exceptions are occurring? A high occurrence rate may necessitate changes to the back-end systems. Why does the user's app usage result in a try/catch? What is the context for the exceptions? When can a test environment's responses to handled exceptions indicate additional, more serious problems? What would have caused a crash if the exception had not been caught in production? What else (in the code or back-end API) is still affecting the users' experience? By using handled exceptions, you can identify and resolve these kinds of issues more quickly. one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Exceptions > Handled exceptions: As you explore the wealth of data in the charts and table, use groups and filters to discover patterns that help you determine the root cause of mobile app exceptions. Handled exception features Comments Slice and dice your exception data. You can view exception data via API as well as the UI: Use the recordHandledException() method within a try{...} catch(){...} block to help understand how often your application is throwing exceptions, and under what conditions. Use groups and filters to analyze trends leading to the exception. For example, you can group by OS Build, then filter a specific appVersion. Understand a particular user's experience. Examine the percentage charts to see overall trends with users and sessions at a glance. Then, use custom attributes to focus on exceptions related to paid accounts than free accounts. Pinpoint when most exceptions occur. For example, group on Last Interaction to get an overall view of problems. To drill down further, use filters, such as: To examine exceptions caused by network problems, filter by carrier and then select wifi. To examine exceptions caused by app releases, filter by appVersion. Align issues with common characteristics. For example: Use groups and filters to determine whether handled exception trends appear in networks (ASN, carrier, location, etc.) or in devices (device model, manufacturer, operating system build, version, etc.). Explore recurring patterns in stack traces with the top five exception locations table. Query data and share your findings. Explore the event trail before and after a crash. With mobile monitoring you get a more complete picture of events before and after crashes occur, so you can analyze and resolve problems from multiple angles: Use the handled exception's Occurrences page for expected exceptions. Use the Crash analysis UI and event trail for unanticipated exceptions. Requirements Tip Access to this feature depends on your subscription level and mobile data retention. Additional requirements include: Android: Android agent version 5.15.0 or higher iOS: iOS agent version 5.15.0 or higher Handled exceptions API and event type Mobile monitoring automatically includes default attributes that you can use to explore your handled exceptions data in the query builder and get specific details: Use the recordHandledExceptions() method for the Android or iOS SDK API.

      "body": "Exceptions can contribute to invalid application states, resulting not only in application crashes but also in negative user reviews. This may lead to users deleting your app, which in turn may affect your organization's profitability. With the Handled exceptions UI, mobile development managers and their developer teams can identify significant factors affecting poor mobile app experience, and use filterable data to find a resolution more quickly. Features Handling exceptions as they occur can help improve your mobile app users' experience, but it's not enough to catch exceptions. You also need to know how to prevent them. For example: How many different types of handled exceptions are occurring? A high occurrence rate may necessitate changes to the back-end systems. Why does the user's app usage result in a try/catch? What is the context for the exceptions? When can a test environment's responses to handled exceptions indicate additional, more serious problems? What would have caused a crash if the exception had not been caught in production? What else (in the code or back-end API) is still affecting the users' experience? By using handled exceptions, you can identify and resolve these kinds of issues more quickly. one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Exceptions > Handled exceptions: As you explore the wealth of data in the charts and table, use groups and filters to discover patterns that help you determine the root cause of mobile app exceptions. Handled exception features Comments Slice and dice your exception data. You can view exception data via API as well as the UI: Use the recordHandledException() method within a try{...} catch(){...} block to help understand how often your application is throwing exceptions, and under what conditions. Use groups and filters to analyze trends leading to the exception. For example, you can group by OS Build, then filter a specific appVersion. Understand a particular user's experience. Examine the percentage charts to see overall trends with users and sessions at a glance. Then, use custom attributes to focus on exceptions related to paid accounts than free accounts. Pinpoint when most exceptions occur. For example, group on Last Interaction to get an overall view of problems. To drill down further, use filters, such as: To examine exceptions caused by network problems, filter by carrier and then select wifi. To examine exceptions caused by app releases, filter by appVersion. Align issues with common characteristics. For example: Use groups and filters to determine whether handled exception trends appear in networks (ASN, carrier, location, etc.) or in devices (device model, manufacturer, operating system build, version, etc.). Explore recurring patterns in stack traces with the top five exception locations table. Query data and share your findings. Explore the event trail before and after a crash. With mobile monitoring you get a more complete picture of events before and after crashes occur, so you can analyze and resolve problems from multiple angles: Use the handled exception's Occurrences page for expected exceptions. Use the Crash analysis UI and event trail for unanticipated exceptions. Requirements Tip Access to this feature depends on your subscription level and mobile data retention. Additional requirements include: Android: Android agent version 5.15.0 or higher iOS: iOS agent version 5.15.0 or higher Handled exceptions API and event type Mobile monitoring automatically includes default attributes that you can use to explore your handled exceptions data in the query builder and get specific details: Use the recordHandledExceptions() method for the Android or iOS SDK API. Query the MobileHandledException event type. For more information, see the NRQL examples for mobile monitoring. You can also create your own custom attributes and events. Then, select attributes in the Handled exceptions page, and query or share them.",

You can also use the handled exceptions API to customize the data you send, and use NRQL to query and share the data. Handled exceptions workflow To get the most out of the Handled exceptions UI, use this basic workflow: Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Exceptions > Handled exceptions. Use any of New Relic's standard page functions to drill down into detailed information; for example, zoom into any area of a chart. Look for obvious or general trends in the Users affected and Sessions affected percentage charts. Adjust the types of exceptions shown by using groups and filters. Optional: Query or share the chart data. Look for similar patterns where exceptions appear in stack traces with the Top 5 exception locations table. To view stack trace thread details for each occurrence of the exception, select a record from the Top 5 exceptions location table. one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Exceptions > Handled exceptions: As you explore the wealth of data in the charts and table, use groups and filters to discover patterns that help you determine the root cause of mobile app exceptions. Exception percentage charts Start with the Users affected and Sessions affected percentage charts to see at a glance whether there are any unexpected spikes, dips, or patterns with exceptions in general. (If the Users affected chart is empty, there were no user sessions during the selected time period.) For example: Are there any spikes near a recent version release? Is there a time period when the percentage of users has been affected significantly by the exception? Are there uneventful periods? To examine data in greater detail: Below any chart, select Expand chart. Exception percentage charts example one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Exceptions > Handled exceptions: The percentage charts help you quickly see any unexpected spikes, dips, or patterns with exceptions in general. Groups and filters Use the groups and filters to examine attributes for crashes, devices, locations, or other custom attributes in more detail. You can select a group, then filter to specific data. For example: Group the list by exception location (default), cause, app build or version, devices, connections, or other custom attributes. This lets you discover patterns in your exceptions to determine the root cause. Use the time picker to adjust the currently selected time period. Filter by a specific Version or by one or more attribute Filter, such as appVersion, exceptionLocationMethod, lastInteraction, or any of the longer list of standard and custom attributes. The currently selected filters appear at the top of the UI page. You can close them, add other filters, or select other groups and filters. Groups and filters example one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Exceptions > Handled exceptions: Group the data by attributes that matter to the most to you, then select one or more filters to help pinpoint specific causes behind the exceptions. Top five exception locations Use the Top 5 exception locations table to find or sort patterns in the type of exception you selected from the groups and filters. This includes: Recurring locations in the stack trace Mobile app version Number of occurrences Number of users affected during the selected time period For example, you can group by Exception Message, filter to timeout message, then select individual timeout locations from the table to review the stack trace thread and details about each occurrence. To filter or group by other attributes, use the table's search window, or select any of the available filters. For example, filter by type of occurrence, device, a specific location, or any custom attributes. To look for other historical patterns, change the selected time period. Top five exception locations example one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Exceptions > Handled exceptions: This example shows the Expand chart button and links to the query builder, where you can query, create dashboards, and share the handled exceptions data. Query builder links Handled exceptions charts use default attributes for mobile events (including MobileHandledException), along with any custom attributes you have added to this event type. When you mouse over the charts, direct links appear below them. These links to the query builder allow you to analyze your mobile app data even deeper. View query link: View the NRQL query used to calculate the chart data. View in query builder link: View the chart, and share it with others. Exception locations table The Exception locations table supplements the charts. It lists where the top five handled exceptions appear in their stack trace thread, and links them to relevant details. Each row helps you find answers to questions such as: How many of this exception occurred within the selected time period? Does a specific app version have a higher (or lower) number of users affected? Which exception has the fewest number of occurrences? You can change the sort order or filter options to focus on just the types of exceptions that matter the most to you and your teams. To view additional thread details for each occurrence of the exception, select a record from the Top 5 exceptions location table.

You can view version trend data in the mobile monitoring UI. You can also enable email notifications. Requirements If you see this message in the Version trends UI: \"No adoption data is available for this version because it is running an older agent,\" this indicates the mobile app wasn't using the New Relic mobile agent version that collects install/upgrade count data.

Optional: To configure email settings, see Email reports. View version trend details Each version includes several metrics to analyze performance, user adoption, and key technical indicators. Performance across releases An important feature is comparison of app performance across releases, based on data collected when each version was at its peak of popularity. You can select four different views of data for when each version was in production, including: Launch day (default) Launch week Launch month All available data for the version This quickly helps you see whether the adoption and performance characteristics of an app's version are better or worse than others. Summary mobile app information for each release includes: Versions: Versions of your app release, sorted by date of highest popularity Sessions: Count of mobile app sessions showing usage of each release Critical user adoption metrics You can compare different versions to see how successfully they have been adopted by users. Total users: Count of unique users (devices) active Upgrades: Count of unique users (devices) active that were upgrades from a previous app version New installs: Count of unique users (devices) active who performed a new install of this app Upgrades and new installs combine to reveal adoption in the form of total unique installs. Key technical indicators Key technical performance indicators include stability, network health, other app or server problems, and memory usage: To track stability, the UI shows the Crash rate as the percentage of all app sessions that crashed. To understand whether networking problems are originating from the app, network, or server, the UI shows the percentage of server responses that returned an HTTP error code (HTTP errors) and the percentage of network calls that failed to receive a response (Network failure). To identify other problems from the app or server, the UI shows the average number of network requests made per app session (Requests per session) and the average server Response time as seen from the app’s perspective. To compare improvements or problems with Memory usage, the first four versions include metrics indicating better (green) or worse (red) performance than the previous version's. Interpret version trend data (examples) Here are some examples of how to interpret some of the data that appears. Example Comments Improvements A new release with faster response time than previous releases may indicate that development efforts were successful. Problems A new release with a spike in crashes, as compared to the previous releases, may indicate that a change introduced in the library or framework is not handling the new scenario or code path properly. User adoption A new release with low numbers of upgrades or new installs may indicate slow adoption of the newest version. This in turn may help justify a new or changed focus in marketing the new release. Release maintenance An older release with continued higher numbers of total users also may indicate slow adoption of the newest version. This in turn may result in unanticipated costs for continued support, or delays in deprecating the old version and its back-end APIs. Query version trend data When querying with NRQL, we provide two attributes to help analyze version trend information: To track when a session includes a new install or a new upgrade, use install. This attribute records true for new installations. To track the last version of the mobile app when an upgrade is detected, use upgradeFrom. To use these attributes, make sure your version of our Android agent or iOS agent supports them.",

      "body": "Mobile monitoring provides a Version trends report with metrics to compare usage, adoption, and performance across the most recent versions of your mobile app. This helps mobile app development managers and their teams to compare up to five production versions from a single page and to analyze the impact of improvements, fixes, and degradations for each. You can view version trend data in the mobile monitoring UI. You can also enable email notifications. Requirements If you see this message in the Version trends UI: \"No adoption data is available for this version because it is running an older agent,\" this indicates the mobile app wasn't using the New Relic mobile agent version that collects install/upgrade count data. To collect version trend information for your mobile app, make sure your agent version is: New Relic mobile agent for Android version 5.3.3 or higher New Relic mobile agent for iOS version 5.3.4 or higher View version trend data in UI To view the Version trends report: Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > App > Version trends. Select the Launch time period to compare versions by day (default), week, or month, or view all available data. Review the version trend details to analyze performance, user adoption, and key technical indicators. For additional suggestions about how to interpret the data, review the examples. Optional: To configure email settings, see Email reports. View version trend details Each version includes several metrics to analyze performance, user adoption, and key technical indicators. Performance across releases An important feature is comparison of app performance across releases, based on data collected when each version was at its peak of popularity. You can select four different views of data for when each version was in production, including: Launch day (default) Launch week Launch month All available data for the version This quickly helps you see whether the adoption and performance characteristics of an app's version are better or worse than others. Summary mobile app information for each release includes: Versions: Versions of your app release, sorted by date of highest popularity Sessions: Count of mobile app sessions showing usage of each release Critical user adoption metrics You can compare different versions to see how successfully they have been adopted by users. Total users: Count of unique users (devices) active Upgrades: Count of unique users (devices) active that were upgrades from a previous app version New installs: Count of unique users (devices) active who performed a new install of this app Upgrades and new installs combine to reveal adoption in the form of total unique installs. Key technical indicators Key technical performance indicators include stability, network health, other app or server problems, and memory usage: To track stability, the UI shows the Crash rate as the percentage of all app sessions that crashed. To understand whether networking problems are originating from the app, network, or server, the UI shows the percentage of server responses that returned an HTTP error code (HTTP errors) and the percentage of network calls that failed to receive a response (Network failure). To identify other problems from the app or server, the UI shows the average number of network requests made per app session (Requests per session) and the average server Response time as seen from the app’s perspective. To compare improvements or problems with Memory usage, the first four versions include metrics indicating better (green) or worse (red) performance than the previous version's. Interpret version trend data (examples) Here are some examples of how to interpret some of the data that appears. Example Comments Improvements A new release with faster response time than previous releases may indicate that development efforts were successful. Problems A new release with a spike in crashes, as compared to the previous releases, may indicate that a change introduced in the library or framework is not handling the new scenario or code path properly. User adoption A new release with low numbers of upgrades or new installs may indicate slow adoption of the newest version. This in turn may help justify a new or changed focus in marketing the new release. Release maintenance An older release with continued higher numbers of total users also may indicate slow adoption of the newest version. This in turn may result in unanticipated costs for continued support, or delays in deprecating the old version and its back-end APIs. Query version trend data When querying with NRQL, we provide two attributes to help analyze version trend information: To track when a session includes a new install or a new upgrade, use install. This attribute records true for new installations. To track the last version of the mobile app when an upgrade is detected, use upgradeFrom. To use these attributes, make sure your version of our Android agent or iOS agent supports them.",

You can view version trend data in the mobile monitoring UI. You can also enable email notifications. Requirements If you see this message in the Version trends UI: \"No adoption data is available for this version because it is running an older agent,\" this indicates the mobile app wasn't using the New Relic mobile agent version that collects install/upgrade count data. To collect version trend information for your mobile app, make sure your agent version is: New Relic mobile agent for Android version 5.3.3 or higher New Relic mobile agent for iOS version 5.3.4 or higher View version trend data in UI To view the Version trends report: Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > App > Version trends. Select the Launch time period to compare versions by day (default), week, or month, or view all available data. Review the version trend details to analyze performance, user adoption, and key technical indicators. For additional suggestions about how to interpret the data, review the examples. Optional: To configure email settings, see Email reports. View version trend details Each version includes several metrics to analyze performance, user adoption, and key technical indicators. Performance across releases An important feature is comparison of app performance across releases, based on data collected when each version was at its peak of popularity. You can select four different views of data for when each version was in production, including: Launch day (default) Launch week Launch month All available data for the version This quickly helps you see whether the adoption and performance characteristics of an app's version are better or worse than others. Summary mobile app information for each release includes: Versions: Versions of your app release, sorted by date of highest popularity Sessions: Count of mobile app sessions showing usage of each release Critical user adoption metrics You can compare different versions to see how successfully they have been adopted by users. Total users: Count of unique users (devices) active Upgrades: Count of unique users (devices) active that were upgrades from a previous app version New installs: Count of unique users (devices) active who performed a new install of this app Upgrades and new installs combine to reveal adoption in the form of total unique installs. Key technical indicators Key technical performance indicators include stability, network health, other app or server problems, and memory usage: To track stability, the UI shows the Crash rate as the percentage of all app sessions that crashed. To understand whether networking problems are originating from the app, network, or server, the UI shows the percentage of server responses that returned an HTTP error code (HTTP errors) and the percentage of network calls that failed to receive a response (Network failure). To identify other problems from the app or server, the UI shows the average number of network requests made per app session (Requests per session) and the average server Response time as seen from the app’s perspective. To compare improvements or problems with Memory usage, the first four versions include metrics indicating better (green) or worse (red) performance than the previous version's. Interpret version trend data (examples) Here are some examples of how to interpret some of the data that appears. Example Comments Improvements A new release with faster response time than previous releases may indicate that development efforts were successful. Problems A new release with a spike in crashes, as compared to the previous releases, may indicate that a change introduced in the library or framework is not handling the new scenario or code path properly. User adoption A new release with low numbers of upgrades or new installs may indicate slow adoption of the newest version. This in turn may help justify a new or changed focus in marketing the new release. Release maintenance An older release with continued higher numbers of total users also may indicate slow adoption of the newest version. This in turn may result in unanticipated costs for continued support, or delays in deprecating the old version and its back-end APIs. Query version trend data When querying with NRQL, we provide two attributes to help analyze version trend information: To track when a session includes a new install or a new upgrade, use install. This attribute records true for new installations. To track the last version of the mobile app when an upgrade is detected, use upgradeFrom. To use these attributes, make sure your version of our Android agent or iOS agent supports them.",

You can view version trend data in the mobile monitoring UI. You can also enable email notifications.

Optional: To configure email settings, see Email reports. View version trend details Each version includes several metrics to analyze performance, user adoption, and key technical indicators. Performance across releases An important feature is comparison of app performance across releases, based on data collected when each version was at its peak of popularity. You can select four different views of data for when each version was in production, including: Launch day (default) Launch week Launch month All available data for the version This quickly helps you see whether the adoption and performance characteristics of an app's version are better or worse than others. Summary mobile app information for each release includes: Versions: Versions of your app release, sorted by date of highest popularity Sessions: Count of mobile app sessions showing usage of each release Critical user adoption metrics You can compare different versions to see how successfully they have been adopted by users. Total users: Count of unique users (devices) active Upgrades: Count of unique users (devices) active that were upgrades from a previous app version New installs: Count of unique users (devices) active who performed a new install of this app Upgrades and new installs combine to reveal adoption in the form of total unique installs. Key technical indicators Key technical performance indicators include stability, network health, other app or server problems, and memory usage: To track stability, the UI shows the Crash rate as the percentage of all app sessions that crashed. To understand whether networking problems are originating from the app, network, or server, the UI shows the percentage of server responses that returned an HTTP error code (HTTP errors) and the percentage of network calls that failed to receive a response (Network failure). To identify other problems from the app or server, the UI shows the average number of network requests made per app session (Requests per session) and the average server Response time as seen from the app’s perspective. To compare improvements or problems with Memory usage, the first four versions include metrics indicating better (green) or worse (red) performance than the previous version's. Interpret version trend data (examples) Here are some examples of how to interpret some of the data that appears. Example Comments Improvements A new release with faster response time than previous releases may indicate that development efforts were successful. Problems A new release with a spike in crashes, as compared to the previous releases, may indicate that a change introduced in the library or framework is not handling the new scenario or code path properly. User adoption A new release with low numbers of upgrades or new installs may indicate slow adoption of the newest version. This in turn may help justify a new or changed focus in marketing the new release. Release maintenance An older release with continued higher numbers of total users also may indicate slow adoption of the newest version. This in turn may result in unanticipated costs for continued support, or delays in deprecating the old version and its back-end APIs. Query version trend data When querying with NRQL, we provide two attributes to help analyze version trend information: To track when a session includes a new install or a new upgrade, use install. This attribute records true for new installations. To track the last version of the mobile app when an upgrade is detected, use upgradeFrom. To use these attributes, make sure your version of our Android agent or iOS agent supports them.",

This document describes the Enterprise-level HTTP requests page. Non-Enterprise accounts will see the legacy HTTP requests page. Find and use HTTP requests page To view mobile monitoring's HTTP requests page: Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Network > HTTP requests. Use our standard page functions to look for trends in the HTTP analysis charts. Target specific request and response attributes by grouping, sorting, and filtering the data. Understand HTTP request data Here are some places to find the most important HTTP request information: Response time chart The response time chart shows how your app's network calls are performing across percentiles. Use it to compare the average response time to the 1st, 50th, and 99th percentile. Percentiles let you filter out outliers that may be making your average response time higher than expected. HTTP errors and network failures chart This chart shows the unsuccessful network calls your app is experiencing. Select the chart title to go to the HTTP errors page for more detail on the errors and failures. Total requests Sort by Total requests to identify which network requests are being used most frequently. The reason this can be helpful is because your slowest network calls may be only infrequently used, while more frequently used requests might be more worthy of optimization even if they are not the slowest. For a description of the non-Enterprise HTTP requests UI page, see Legacy HTTP requests. Group, sort, and filter HTTP requests If you want to... Do this... Group and sort HTTP requests in different ways Make selections from the Group by and Sort by dropdowns. By default, the HTTP requests page is grouped by request domain and sorted by average response time. Filter for specific HTTP requests Select an HTTP request from the Errors and failures list and/or select multiple filters from the Filter dropdown. See or remove applied filters The filters you select are displayed next to the filter dropdown. To clear filters, select the X icon on the filter you want to clear.

Find and use HTTP requests page To view mobile monitoring's HTTP requests page: Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Network > HTTP requests. Use our standard page functions to look for trends in the HTTP analysis charts. Target specific request and response attributes by grouping, sorting, and filtering the data. Understand HTTP request data Here are some places to find the most important HTTP request information: Response time chart The response time chart shows how your app's network calls are performing across percentiles. Use it to compare the average response time to the 1st, 50th, and 99th percentile. Percentiles let you filter out outliers that may be making your average response time higher than expected. HTTP errors and network failures chart This chart shows the unsuccessful network calls your app is experiencing. Select the chart title to go to the HTTP errors page for more detail on the errors and failures. Total requests Sort by Total requests to identify which network requests are being used most frequently. The reason this can be helpful is because your slowest network calls may be only infrequently used, while more frequently used requests might be more worthy of optimization even if they are not the slowest.

QA engineer Make sure that a new version of your app does not cause a spike in errors compared to a previous version. DevOps engineer See a list of domains and URLs associated with HTTP errors and network failures, so you can focus on the ones that are causing errors and filter out status codes that are too noisy for your alerts. Mobile developer Find out if there are frontend or backend problems affecting your mobile app (even without an error alert going off) so that you can address them in a new version. Support engineer View the errors and session attributes (geography, connection type, device, app version) associated with an error so that you can help customers with their issues. Find and use the HTTP errors page There are two ways to get to the HTTP errors page: Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Network > Network errors. From a mobile app's Overview page in mobile monitoring, select the HTTP errors/network failures chart title link. From the HTTP errors page, investigate HTTP request and network failures: Use any standard page functions to look for trends in Errors and failures charts. Target specific types of errors and failures by grouping, sorting, and filtering the data. Find anomalies in your request errors with HTTP error profiles. Select an error or failure to view details for it. You can also define NRQL alerts that are focused on error types for your critical services or query your app data.

For each attribute, the error profile includes: A pie chart showing how the error's attribute is distributed for values that deviate the most A table comparing the error attribute's distribution to that of other errors This helps you take more of the guesswork out of resolving your mobile application's HTTP errors. You can more easily determine if you safely ignore the error, or if you should attempt to resolve the error with a new deployment, code change, customer communication or other actions. View more details about a specific error To view details about an error or failure, select the Request URL link to be directed to the Error summary page. From the Error summary page, you can view the version information, request attributes, and Response body, as well as get a breakdown of error types for the request URL. View and share error data with query builder To explore the data behind any of the charts or lists on the HTTP errors/requests page: Select for any chart. Select View query and then View in Insights. This will open the query builder. From the query builder, you can add the error data to a dashboard and share it via a permalink. To dig deeper into the error data, query your data for the following events and attributes: MobileRequestError events and attributes MobileRequest events and attributes View legacy HTTP errors UI page Accounts that do not have an Enterprise-level subscription see a different HTTP Errors UI page: The Errors page includes details about HTTP errors (403, 404, 422, 500, 502, etc.) and network failures for your hosts; for example: Secure connection failed Timed out Cannot find host Not connected to Internet Cannot connect to host View the Errors page To view HTTP errors or network failures for your mobile app: Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Network > Errors. To change the view to errors or failures, select the Sort by option. To hide low-usage hosts, select the Hide < 1% throughput option. To limit information to a specific version of your app, or to change the time period, select your choice from the Versions menu or the time picker below the menu bar. To view details for a specific host, HTTP status error, or network failure, select its name. Use any of our standard user interface functions to drill down into detailed information. Error trace details Mobile monitoring will capture the response details from HTTP requests that return a 400 or 500 level status code. In addition, error messages generated from Android apps will include a stack trace. To view details about an error trace on the Errors page, select its request URL link. From here you can: View the response body. Share the error details with others by email. File a ticket about it through a ticketing system integrated with New Relic. Delete or hide the error. The errors chart also appears on the selected mobile app's Overview page. If the chart shows errors, you can select its HTTP errors/network failures title or select anywhere on the Overview page's chart to go directly to this Errors page. View error data in query builder To dig deeper into your request data, use the query builder to query and chart the MobileRequest events and attributes. Unknown errors or URL errors The mobile agents maintain a list of exception types. In some cases, custom exceptions thrown by applications fall outside of this list. When this happens, Unknown may appear in the mobile Errors page.

      "body": "Important The mobile Maps UI is deprecated since December 22, 2020. Service maps are available in New Relic One's left navigation for each mobile entity, and they are a better way to visualize and customize representations of your architecture. For more information, see our Explorers Hub post. Maps help you find performance problems for a mobile app or its services. This gives you a clear picture of your app's relationships to other services and the influence of each service on the others. If one service fails, you can see at a glance which other services are affected. View a map of your mobile app services To view your mobile app and its related services as an architectural map, go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select a mobile app) > Monitor > Service map. For more information, see the service maps documentation. If you need to use the deprecated mobile Map page, follow these steps: Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Network > Map. To view HTTP request details for a service, select its name. To view details for an app monitored by APM that is related to the service, select the service's name below the associated hostname. To view throughput details as a chart, select the icon or the cpm bar below the service's name. To view detailed metrics for a service, mouse over the throughput chart. The Map page for mobile monitoring gives an architectural view of your mobile app and the services it uses,",

      "body": "Mobile monitoring's HTTP errors page helps you to better understand HTTP errors and network failures associated with your mobile app, to connect errors to services that are causing issues, and to share actionable data with your team: Team member View the data on the HTTP errors page to... Manager See a list of errors and failures so you can coordinate mobile app teams with backend teams and share the data they need to fix issues. QA engineer Make sure that a new version of your app does not cause a spike in errors compared to a previous version. DevOps engineer See a list of domains and URLs associated with HTTP errors and network failures, so you can focus on the ones that are causing errors and filter out status codes that are too noisy for your alerts. Mobile developer Find out if there are frontend or backend problems affecting your mobile app (even without an error alert going off) so that you can address them in a new version. Support engineer View the errors and session attributes (geography, connection type, device, app version) associated with an error so that you can help customers with their issues. Find and use the HTTP errors page There are two ways to get to the HTTP errors page: Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Network > Network errors. From a mobile app's Overview page in mobile monitoring, select the HTTP errors/network failures chart title link. From the HTTP errors page, investigate HTTP request and network failures: Use any standard page functions to look for trends in Errors and failures charts. Target specific types of errors and failures by grouping, sorting, and filtering the data. Find anomalies in your request errors with HTTP error profiles. Select an error or failure to view details for it. You can also define NRQL alerts that are focused on error types for your critical services or query your app data. Group, sort, and filter errors and failures If you want to do this... Do this... Change how the page groups and sorts errors and network failures Make selections from the Group by and Sort by dropdowns. By default, the Network errors page is grouped by request domain and sorted by errors and failures. Filter for specific errors and network failures Select an error or failure from the Errors and failures list and/or select multiple filters from the Filter dropdown. See which filters you applied or remove filters The filters you select display next to the filter dropdown. To clear filters, select the X next to the filter you want to clear. Change the time window Select a new time period from the Time picker dropdown. View information for one specific app version Select the version that you want to see charts and lists for in the Versions dropdown. HTTP error profiles Error profiles provide visual details about significant differences in the frequency of different values for HTTP error events. For each attribute, the error profile includes: A pie chart showing how the error's attribute is distributed for values that deviate the most A table comparing the error attribute's distribution to that of other errors This helps you take more of the guesswork out of resolving your mobile application's HTTP errors. You can more easily determine if you safely ignore the error, or if you should attempt to resolve the error with a new deployment, code change, customer communication or other actions. View more details about a specific error To view details about an error or failure, select the Request URL link to be directed to the Error summary page. From the Error summary page, you can view the version information, request attributes, and Response body, as well as get a breakdown of error types for the request URL. View and share error data with query builder To explore the data behind any of the charts or lists on the HTTP errors/requests page: Select for any chart. Select View query and then View in Insights. This will open the query builder. From the query builder, you can add the error data to a dashboard and share it via a permalink. To dig deeper into the error data, query your data for the following events and attributes: MobileRequestError events and attributes MobileRequest events and attributes View legacy HTTP errors UI page Accounts that do not have an Enterprise-level subscription see a different HTTP Errors UI page: The Errors page includes details about HTTP errors (403, 404, 422, 500, 502, etc.) and network failures for your hosts; for example: Secure connection failed Timed out Cannot find host Not connected to Internet Cannot connect to host View the Errors page To view HTTP errors or network failures for your mobile app: Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Network > Errors. To change the view to errors or failures, select the Sort by option. To hide low-usage hosts, select the Hide < 1% throughput option. To limit information to a specific version of your app, or to change the time period, select your choice from the Versions menu or the time picker below the menu bar. To view details for a specific host, HTTP status error, or network failure, select its name. Use any of our standard user interface functions to drill down into detailed information. Error trace details Mobile monitoring will capture the response details from HTTP requests that return a 400 or 500 level status code. In addition, error messages generated from Android apps will include a stack trace. To view details about an error trace on the Errors page, select its request URL link. From here you can: View the response body. Share the error details with others by email. File a ticket about it through a ticketing system integrated with New Relic. Delete or hide the error. The errors chart also appears on the selected mobile app's Overview page. If the chart shows errors, you can select its HTTP errors/network failures title or select anywhere on the Overview page's chart to go directly to this Errors page. View error data in query builder To dig deeper into your request data, use the query builder to query and chart the MobileRequest events and attributes. Unknown errors or URL errors The mobile agents maintain a list of exception types. In some cases, custom exceptions thrown by applications fall outside of this list. When this happens, Unknown may appear in the mobile Errors page. If you find Unknown in your list of errors and need assistance in researching which exception types are being missed, get support at support.newrelic.com.",
