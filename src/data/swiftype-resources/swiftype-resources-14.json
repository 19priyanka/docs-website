This document describes the Enterprise-level HTTP requests page. Non-Enterprise accounts will see the legacy HTTP requests page. Find and use HTTP requests page To view mobile monitoring's HTTP requests page: Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Network > HTTP requests. Use our standard page functions to look for trends in the HTTP analysis charts. Target specific request and response attributes by grouping, sorting, and filtering the data. Understand HTTP request data Here are some places to find the most important HTTP request information: Response time chart The response time chart shows how your app's network calls are performing across percentiles. Use it to compare the average response time to the 1st, 50th, and 99th percentile. Percentiles let you filter out outliers that may be making your average response time higher than expected. HTTP errors and network failures chart This chart shows the unsuccessful network calls your app is experiencing. Select the chart title to go to the HTTP errors page for more detail on the errors and failures. Total requests Sort by Total requests to identify which network requests are being used most frequently. The reason this can be helpful is because your slowest network calls may be only infrequently used, while more frequently used requests might be more worthy of optimization even if they are not the slowest. For a description of the non-Enterprise HTTP requests UI page, see Legacy HTTP requests. Group, sort, and filter HTTP requests If you want to... Do this... Group and sort HTTP requests in different ways Make selections from the Group by and Sort by dropdowns. By default, the HTTP requests page is grouped by request domain and sorted by average response time. Filter for specific HTTP requests Select an HTTP request from the Errors and failures list and/or select multiple filters from the Filter dropdown.

Manager See a list of errors and failures so you can coordinate mobile app teams with backend teams and share the data they need to fix issues. QA engineer Make sure that a new version of your app does not cause a spike in errors compared to a previous version. DevOps engineer See a list of domains and URLs associated with HTTP errors and network failures, so you can focus on the ones that are causing errors and filter out status codes that are too noisy for your alerts. Mobile developer Find out if there are frontend or backend problems affecting your mobile app (even without an error alert going off) so that you can address them in a new version. Support engineer View the errors and session attributes (geography, connection type, device, app version) associated with an error so that you can help customers with their issues. Find and use the HTTP errors page There are two ways to get to the HTTP errors page: Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Network > Network errors. From a mobile app's Overview page in mobile monitoring, select the HTTP errors/network failures chart title link. From the HTTP errors page, investigate HTTP request and network failures: Use any standard page functions to look for trends in Errors and failures charts. Target specific types of errors and failures by grouping, sorting, and filtering the data. Find anomalies in your request errors with HTTP error profiles. Select an error or failure to view details for it. You can also define NRQL alerts that are focused on error types for your critical services or query your app data. Group, sort, and filter errors and failures If you want to do this... Do this... Change how the page groups and sorts errors and network failures Make selections from the Group by and Sort by dropdowns. By default, the Network errors page is grouped by request domain and sorted by errors and failures.

Change the time window Select a new time period from the Time picker dropdown. View information for one specific app version Select the version that you want to see charts and lists for in the Versions dropdown. HTTP error profiles Error profiles provide visual details about significant differences in the frequency of different values for HTTP error events. For each attribute, the error profile includes: A pie chart showing how the error's attribute is distributed for values that deviate the most A table comparing the error attribute's distribution to that of other errors This helps you take more of the guesswork out of resolving your mobile application's HTTP errors. You can more easily determine if you safely ignore the error, or if you should attempt to resolve the error with a new deployment, code change, customer communication or other actions. View more details about a specific error To view details about an error or failure, select the Request URL link to be directed to the Error summary page. From the Error summary page, you can view the version information, request attributes, and Response body, as well as get a breakdown of error types for the request URL. View and share error data with query builder To explore the data behind any of the charts or lists on the HTTP errors/requests page: Select for any chart. Select View query and then View in Insights. This will open the query builder. From the query builder, you can add the error data to a dashboard and share it via a permalink. To dig deeper into the error data, query your data for the following events and attributes: MobileRequestError events and attributes MobileRequest events and attributes View legacy HTTP errors UI page Accounts that do not have an Enterprise-level subscription see a different HTTP Errors UI page: The Errors page includes details about HTTP errors (403, 404, 422, 500, 502, etc.) and network failures for your hosts; for example: Secure connection failed Timed out Cannot find host Not connected to Internet Cannot connect to host View the Errors page To view HTTP errors or network failures for your mobile app: Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Network > Errors. To change the view to errors or failures, select the Sort by option. To hide low-usage hosts, select the Hide < 1% throughput option. To limit information to a specific version of your app, or to change the time period, select your choice from the Versions menu or the time picker below the menu bar. To view details for a specific host, HTTP status error, or network failure, select its name. Use any of our standard user interface functions to drill down into detailed information. Error trace details Mobile monitoring will capture the response details from HTTP requests that return a 400 or 500 level status code. In addition, error messages generated from Android apps will include a stack trace. To view details about an error trace on the Errors page, select its request URL link. From here you can: View the response body. Share the error details with others by email. File a ticket about it through a ticketing system integrated with New Relic. Delete or hide the error. The errors chart also appears on the selected mobile app's Overview page. If the chart shows errors, you can select its HTTP errors/network failures title or select anywhere on the Overview page's chart to go directly to this Errors page. View error data in query builder To dig deeper into your request data, use the query builder to query and chart the MobileRequest events and attributes. Unknown errors or URL errors The mobile agents maintain a list of exception types. In some cases, custom exceptions thrown by applications fall outside of this list. When this happens, Unknown may appear in the mobile Errors page. If you find Unknown in your list of errors and need assistance in researching which exception types are being missed, get support at support.newrelic.com.",

This gives you a clear picture of your app's relationships to other services and the influence of each service on the others. If one service fails, you can see at a glance which other services are affected. View a map of your mobile app services To view your mobile app and its related services as an architectural map, go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select a mobile app) > Monitor > Service map.

Manager See a list of errors and failures so you can coordinate mobile app teams with backend teams and share the data they need to fix issues. QA engineer Make sure that a new version of your app does not cause a spike in errors compared to a previous version. DevOps engineer See a list of domains and URLs associated with HTTP errors and network failures, so you can focus on the ones that are causing errors and filter out status codes that are too noisy for your alerts. Mobile developer Find out if there are frontend or backend problems affecting your mobile app (even without an error alert going off) so that you can address them in a new version. Support engineer View the errors and session attributes (geography, connection type, device, app version) associated with an error so that you can help customers with their issues. Find and use the HTTP errors page There are two ways to get to the HTTP errors page: Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Network > Network errors. From a mobile app's Overview page in mobile monitoring, select the HTTP errors/network failures chart title link. From the HTTP errors page, investigate HTTP request and network failures: Use any standard page functions to look for trends in Errors and failures charts. Target specific types of errors and failures by grouping, sorting, and filtering the data. Find anomalies in your request errors with HTTP error profiles. Select an error or failure to view details for it. You can also define NRQL alerts that are focused on error types for your critical services or query your app data. Group, sort, and filter errors and failures If you want to do this... Do this... Change how the page groups and sorts errors and network failures Make selections from the Group by and Sort by dropdowns. By default, the Network errors page is grouped by request domain and sorted by errors and failures. Filter for specific errors and network failures Select an error or failure from the Errors and failures list and/or select multiple filters from the Filter dropdown. See which filters you applied or remove filters The filters you select display next to the filter dropdown. To clear filters, select the X next to the filter you want to clear. Change the time window Select a new time period from the Time picker dropdown. View information for one specific app version Select the version that you want to see charts and lists for in the Versions dropdown. HTTP error profiles Error profiles provide visual details about significant differences in the frequency of different values for HTTP error events. For each attribute, the error profile includes: A pie chart showing how the error's attribute is distributed for values that deviate the most A table comparing the error attribute's distribution to that of other errors This helps you take more of the guesswork out of resolving your mobile application's HTTP errors. You can more easily determine if you safely ignore the error, or if you should attempt to resolve the error with a new deployment, code change, customer communication or other actions. View more details about a specific error To view details about an error or failure, select the Request URL link to be directed to the Error summary page. From the Error summary page, you can view the version information, request attributes, and Response body, as well as get a breakdown of error types for the request URL. View and share error data with query builder To explore the data behind any of the charts or lists on the HTTP errors/requests page: Select for any chart. Select View query and then View in Insights. This will open the query builder. From the query builder, you can add the error data to a dashboard and share it via a permalink. To dig deeper into the error data, query your data for the following events and attributes: MobileRequestError events and attributes MobileRequest events and attributes View legacy HTTP errors UI page Accounts that do not have an Enterprise-level subscription see a different HTTP Errors UI page: The Errors page includes details about HTTP errors (403, 404, 422, 500, 502, etc.) and network failures for your hosts; for example: Secure connection failed Timed out Cannot find host Not connected to Internet Cannot connect to host View the Errors page To view HTTP errors or network failures for your mobile app: Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Network > Errors. To change the view to errors or failures, select the Sort by option. To hide low-usage hosts, select the Hide < 1% throughput option. To limit information to a specific version of your app, or to change the time period, select your choice from the Versions menu or the time picker below the menu bar. To view details for a specific host, HTTP status error, or network failure, select its name. Use any of our standard user interface functions to drill down into detailed information. Error trace details Mobile monitoring will capture the response details from HTTP requests that return a 400 or 500 level status code. In addition, error messages generated from Android apps will include a stack trace. To view details about an error trace on the Errors page, select its request URL link. From here you can: View the response body. Share the error details with others by email. File a ticket about it through a ticketing system integrated with New Relic. Delete or hide the error. The errors chart also appears on the selected mobile app's Overview page. If the chart shows errors, you can select its HTTP errors/network failures title or select anywhere on the Overview page's chart to go directly to this Errors page. View error data in query builder To dig deeper into your request data, use the query builder to query and chart the MobileRequest events and attributes. Unknown errors or URL errors The mobile agents maintain a list of exception types. In some cases, custom exceptions thrown by applications fall outside of this list. When this happens, Unknown may appear in the mobile Errors page. If you find Unknown in your list of errors and need assistance in researching which exception types are being missed, get support at support.newrelic.com.",

Use our standard page functions to look for trends in the HTTP analysis charts. Target specific request and response attributes by grouping, sorting, and filtering the data. Understand HTTP request data Here are some places to find the most important HTTP request information: Response time chart The response time chart shows how your app's network calls are performing across percentiles. Use it to compare the average response time to the 1st, 50th, and 99th percentile. Percentiles let you filter out outliers that may be making your average response time higher than expected.

You can more easily determine if you safely ignore the error, or if you should attempt to resolve the error with a new deployment, code change, customer communication or other actions. View more details about a specific error To view details about an error or failure, select the Request URL link to be directed to the Error summary page. From the Error summary page, you can view the version information, request attributes, and Response body, as well as get a breakdown of error types for the request URL. View and share error data with query builder To explore the data behind any of the charts or lists on the HTTP errors/requests page: Select for any chart. Select View query and then View in Insights. This will open the query builder. From the query builder, you can add the error data to a dashboard and share it via a permalink. To dig deeper into the error data, query your data for the following events and attributes: MobileRequestError events and attributes MobileRequest events and attributes View legacy HTTP errors UI page Accounts that do not have an Enterprise-level subscription see a different HTTP Errors UI page: The Errors page includes details about HTTP errors (403, 404, 422, 500, 502, etc.) and network failures for your hosts; for example: Secure connection failed Timed out Cannot find host Not connected to Internet Cannot connect to host View the Errors page To view HTTP errors or network failures for your mobile app: Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Network > Errors. To change the view to errors or failures, select the Sort by option. To hide low-usage hosts, select the Hide < 1% throughput option. To limit information to a specific version of your app, or to change the time period, select your choice from the Versions menu or the time picker below the menu bar. To view details for a specific host, HTTP status error, or network failure, select its name. Use any of our standard user interface functions to drill down into detailed information. Error trace details Mobile monitoring will capture the response details from HTTP requests that return a 400 or 500 level status code. In addition, error messages generated from Android apps will include a stack trace. To view details about an error trace on the Errors page, select its request URL link. From here you can: View the response body. Share the error details with others by email. File a ticket about it through a ticketing system integrated with New Relic. Delete or hide the error. The errors chart also appears on the selected mobile app's Overview page. If the chart shows errors, you can select its HTTP errors/network failures title or select anywhere on the Overview page's chart to go directly to this Errors page. View error data in query builder To dig deeper into your request data, use the query builder to query and chart the MobileRequest events and attributes. Unknown errors or URL errors The mobile agents maintain a list of exception types. In some cases, custom exceptions thrown by applications fall outside of this list. When this happens, Unknown may appear in the mobile Errors page. If you find Unknown in your list of errors and need assistance in researching which exception types are being missed, get support at support.newrelic.com.",

Install your iOS application As part of the installation process, New Relic automatically generates an application token. This is a 40-character hexadecimal string for authenticating each mobile app you monitor in New Relic. To install and configure your iOS application: Go to one.newrelic.com. If applicable: From the Mobile Apps list, select Add a new app. From the Get Started page, select iOS as the platform for mobile monitoring. Type a name for your mobile app, then select Continue. If your installation does not automatically include the prefix header, follow the steps to add the prefix header to your project. Continue with the steps to configure New Relic for mobile monitoring. Configure using Objective-C These procedures to configure your iOS app with CocoaPods and Objective-C also appear on the Get Started page in New Relic. In the Podfile for your project, add the following line: pod 'NewRelicAgent' Copy Close your project in Xcode, and update it by running this command from the Terminal in your project directory: pod install Copy Open your project in Xcode by running this command from the Terminal in your project directory: open App.xcworkspace Copy In your APP_NAME-Prefix.pch project file (generally found in the Supporting Files folder), include the New Relic header inside the #ifdef __OBJC__ #endif block: #import <NewRelic/NewRelic.h> Copy In your AppDelegate.m file, add this call as the first line of application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions, replacing APP_TOKEN with your application token: [NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:@\"APP_TOKEN\"]; Copy Important The agent must be on the first line of didFinishLaunchingWithOptions and run on the main thread to ensure proper instrumentation. Starting the call later, on a background thread, or asynchronously can cause unexpected or unstable behavior. Add a build script to your target's Build Phases. Ensure the new build script is the very last build script. Then paste the following, replacing APP_TOKEN with your application token: SCRIPT=`/usr/bin/find \"${SRCROOT}\" -name newrelic_postbuild.sh | head -n 1` /bin/sh \"${SCRIPT}\" \"APP_TOKEN\" Copy Clean and build your app, then run it in the simulator or other device. Configure using Swift These procedures to configure your iOS app with CocoaPods and Swift also appear on the Get Started page in New Relic.

Name the file Placeholder.m, then select Next. Select Create, and confirm Xcode's prompt to generate the bridging header. In your APP_NAME-Bridging-Header.h, add the New Relic header: #import \"NewRelic/NewRelic.h\" Copy In your AppDelegate.swift file, add this call as the first line of application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions, replacing APP_TOKEN with your application token: NewRelic.start(withApplicationToken:\"APP_TOKEN\") Copy Important To ensure proper instrumentation, you must call the agent on the first line of didFinishLaunchingWithOptions(), and run the agent on the main thread. Starting the call later, on a background thread, or asynchronously can cause unexpected or unstable behavior. Add a build script to your target's Build Phases. Ensure the new build script is the very last build script. Then paste the following, replacing APP_TOKEN with your application token: SCRIPT=`/usr/bin/find \"${SRCROOT}\" -name newrelic_postbuild.sh | head -n 1` /bin/sh \"${SCRIPT}\" \"APP_TOKEN\" Copy Clean and build your app, then run it in the simulator or other device. Change the logging level (optional) Six log levels are available for mobile apps monitoring: none error warning info verbose ALL To increase your logging level in the app, add this method call before calling NewRelic.start(withApplicationToken): [NRLogger setLogLevels:NRLogLevelALL]; Copy For Swift apps: NRLogger.setLogLevels(NRLogLevelALL.rawValue) Copy",

      "body": "To protect your mobile application's security and your users' data privacy, New Relic only records performance data, as described in this document. We do not collect any data used or stored by the monitored app. For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our security and data privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Data collection When you install New Relic, our mobile monitoring capabilities become part of your iOS or Android app. These capabilities live within your application's \"sandbox,\" so they cannot access anything other than performance data from your mobile app. We do not collect performance data about the device itself, such as battery level. Our mobile SDK agent collects and sends specific data to the New Relic collector, including: Mobile data collected Comments Devices Length of application session Wireless carrier's name The device's model name and manufacturer, and its operating system version Certain package, class, method, and thread names A unique instance identifier Requests and responses URLs of HTTP requests, along with HTTP status code, response time, and size of the request and response body Operating system error code for network failures (HTTP requests that fail to complete) The first 2KB of the response body when the HTTP request receives a 4xx or 5xx response status code Android only: A stack trace when the HTTP request receives a 4xx or 5xx response status code The agent sends all data using HTTPS encryption and validates the collector's SSL certificate. This prevents common data sniffing and server spoofing attacks. The agent also removes the query string, fragment identifier, username, and password from each URL before sending the data. Secure data endpoints Our mobile SDK agent sends harvested data to the collectors for processing. You can redirect those data posts to proxy or delegate servers for secure data handling. Android: You can use APIs to specify the URI authority of harvest and crash collector data endpoints. For more information, see the Android agent configuration and feature flags documentation. iOS: For more information, see the iOS agent configuration and feature flags documentation. Unique identifiers Our mobile SDK agent assigns a unique identifier to each installed app instance in order to track discrete installs, identify recurring sessions, and correlate performance over time. Mobile agent Identifiers Android Our Android agent generates a cryptographically strong UUID and stores it in the app's SharedPreferences. For more information, see our Android compatibility and requirements documentation. iOS The security measures used for iOS depend on the agent version. In versions 5.3.5 or higher, the iOS agent uses the IdentifierForVendor property to provide a unique device ID. In versions 5.3.4 or lower, the iOS agent used the SecureUDID open source library. SecureUDID is used by many third party libraries and is an accepted industry standard that does not violate Apple App store guidelines. SecureUDID does not use device hardware identifiers such as IMEI. Note that our mobile SDK does not collect IDFA (Identity For Advertisers). For more information, see our iOS compatibility and requirements documentation. No remote updates New Relic does not have the ability to update mobile agents remotely. Using the agent will not introduce any code into your mobile app without your knowledge. Data storage Our mobile SDK agent stores configuration information using your app's normal preferences or settings API on the mobile device. This configuration includes your: Application token Application version number Android or iOS SDK agent version number Settings such as the maximum number of HTTP requests to track per minute Performance data is buffered in memory. It is never written to the device's storage. Server-side data storage for mobile apps is handled in the same way as all other applications monitored by New Relic. For more information, see our security documentation about hosting and data storage. In general, we retain performance data according to the more generous time period of either your web or your mobile subscription. We also retain aggregate records of the number of active instances of your application. Instrumentation added to your code Our mobile SDK agent injects code into certain method calls within your application in order to collect performance data. This can have the effect of adding stack frames to your application's call graph where our code executes. This allows us to time and monitor the inputs and outputs of various APIs. This added code has been reviewed and tested for security-related flaws, and it incorporates best practices related to secure coding. Because our code runs within your application's process, it is subject to the same rights and restrictions as your own code. In addition, our iOS agent registers an NSURLProtocol handler to track NSURLConnection-based networking activity. This instrumentation is compatible with other custom NSURLProtocol handlers your application may register. The handler is registered within a single application process, so it is unable to monitor networking requests originating from other applications or the underlying operating system. User's IP address Our mobile SDK agent captures the user's IP address to enrich data for additional user information. The IP address is used as a lookup value that maps to additional details and allows our customers to diagnose performance issues. IP address lookup values include: App name Country code Region Postal code Latitude Longitude Area code For more information about events and attributes for mobile monitoring, see our data dictionary. New Relic does not retain the user's IP address after the attributes have been mapped. The IP address value is cached in memory for up to six hours before being discarded. If you have questions or concerns about this use of IP addresses with regards to your own regulatory obligations for notice and consent, please contact your privacy or legal teams.",

      "body": "New Relic's mobile monitoring capabilities help you gain deeper visibility into how to analyze your Android and iOS application performance and troubleshoot crashes. You can also examine HTTP and other network performance for unexpected lag, which will in turn help you collaborate more efficiently with your backend teams. How we use mobile monitoring At New Relic, we have our own mobile developers who create iOS and Android apps so our customers can use New Relic from their mobile devices. During a feature deploy, we encountered a small bug that caused an edge case crash with our Android app. This happened after we had created, tested, and deployed the new feature. Because we work at New Relic, we also use New Relic One to analyze and troubleshoot our mobile apps. To give you an idea of how to explore the power of mobile monitoring, here's an example of how our own mobile engineers used it to track this small bug. A workflow to identify and resolve mobile app crashes using New Relic. 1. Alert notification shows new version crashes The night after a new release, our on-call developer received an alert notification on his mobile phone. The Alerts page indicated that some customers were seeing crashes on the new version of our Android app. Moving to his desktop browser, he checked the Summary page. The overview showed an increase in crashes for the newest version. By filtering for the latest version and setting the time picker to the past 24 hours, he could proceed with crash analysis. An example of using the mobile Summary page to filter to an Android version with crashes. 2. Crash analysis pinpoints exception, location, and more By clicking the Crashes chart title on the mobile Summary page, the Crash analysis page opened with the same 24-hour time frame and filter to this Android version. Here our developer could see a significant number of crashes for the selected version. This reinforced his suspicion there was bad code somewhere in the recent deployment. The developer clicked the link for the crash type to examine the exception, location, and error message. He also examined the stack trace, interaction trail, and event trail to quickly understand where users were impacted. An example of using the Crash analysis page to track down the cause for crashes for a new release by examining the exception, location, and error message. From here the developer saw the error. The new feature had a specific line of bad code that was crashing the app for customers who only used New Relic to monitor one app rather than multiple apps. The team released a hot fix in less than an hour, and the crash rate quickly de-escalated to 0.2%. 3. Problem solved, focus on improving app performance The problem was solved, but the team continues to use New Relic to make sure the most important workflows are running correctly and quickly. We also share HTTP and other network performance trends with our backend API developer teams. Improve frontend and backend performance More than a tool for crash analysis, our mobile monitoring capabilities can help you identify opportunities to speed app performance. For example, you can: Create dashboards to query, visualize, and share performance data. Identify handled exceptions to streamline workflows. See trends with sessions, devices, geographical locations, operating systems, carriers, requests and responses, etc. with crash profiles and HTTP profiles. Set up alert notifications for execution time, errors, etc. Define custom attributes and events to obtain additional, specific details about the mobile data that matters the most to your organization. And more! In addition to crash analysis, do more to fine-tune mobile app performance. Great mobile apps increasingly rely on backend systems to power their functionality, such as requesting product information, authenticating users, or streaming media content. But some backend issues can lead to upstream mobile app crashes, freezes, and broken functionality that impacts end users, including: Changed or non-versioned API endpoints Bad payloads API timeouts Slow or deprecated API endpoints You can use the network pages in our mobile monitoring UI to identify problems that surface through HTTP requests, errors, and other network issues. You can also query your data. Then create dashboards and share this information with backend API developer teams and others in your organization to help improve the overall end user experience with your mobile app. You can also improve your customers' overall digital experience: Get rapid visibility into how your end users experience your mobile apps and web browsers. Analyze actual or simulated end-user behavior to hone in on metrics like load time, availability, and errors, while staying grounded in the backend services that enable these digital experiences.

Extend your instrumentation After you install the agent, extend the agent's instrumentation by using the mobile monitoring UI and following up on information in New Relic Insights. To access: In mobile monitoring: In NRQL and dashboards: Custom data Create and record custom events, interaction traces, and attributes to add details to your existing data and traces. Then, view the custom events that you created in NRQL or dashboards. Network requests Enable the MobileRequest event feature so you can perform a full network analysis. To further investigate network request error rates and response times, query MobileRequest and MobileRequestError events. Crash analysis Review detailed information using groups and filters to analyze trends that lead to crashes. To view more information about crashes, create NRQL queries to review Insights charts related to crash data. Android SDK API Use the Android SDK API for mobile monitoring to instrument parts of your code that are not instrumented by default. Then, view those custom events and attributes in New Relic Insights. Handled exceptions Report exceptions so you can identify factors creating a poor mobile app experience. To further improve performance, review MobileHandledException event records in New Relic Insights. Breadcrumbs Boost the level of detail in crash event trails by adding breadcrumbs. Then, query MobileBreadcrumbs events to see all breadcrumbs or just breadcrumbs related to crashes.",

      "body": "New Relic's mobile monitoring capabilities help you gain deeper visibility into how to analyze your Android and iOS application performance and troubleshoot crashes. You can also examine HTTP and other network performance for unexpected lag, which will in turn help you collaborate more efficiently with your backend teams. How we use mobile monitoring At New Relic, we have our own mobile developers who create iOS and Android apps so our customers can use New Relic from their mobile devices. During a feature deploy, we encountered a small bug that caused an edge case crash with our Android app. This happened after we had created, tested, and deployed the new feature. Because we work at New Relic, we also use New Relic One to analyze and troubleshoot our mobile apps. To give you an idea of how to explore the power of mobile monitoring, here's an example of how our own mobile engineers used it to track this small bug. A workflow to identify and resolve mobile app crashes using New Relic. 1. Alert notification shows new version crashes The night after a new release, our on-call developer received an alert notification on his mobile phone. The Alerts page indicated that some customers were seeing crashes on the new version of our Android app. Moving to his desktop browser, he checked the Summary page. The overview showed an increase in crashes for the newest version. By filtering for the latest version and setting the time picker to the past 24 hours, he could proceed with crash analysis. An example of using the mobile Summary page to filter to an Android version with crashes. 2. Crash analysis pinpoints exception, location, and more By clicking the Crashes chart title on the mobile Summary page, the Crash analysis page opened with the same 24-hour time frame and filter to this Android version. Here our developer could see a significant number of crashes for the selected version. This reinforced his suspicion there was bad code somewhere in the recent deployment. The developer clicked the link for the crash type to examine the exception, location, and error message. He also examined the stack trace, interaction trail, and event trail to quickly understand where users were impacted. An example of using the Crash analysis page to track down the cause for crashes for a new release by examining the exception, location, and error message. From here the developer saw the error. The new feature had a specific line of bad code that was crashing the app for customers who only used New Relic to monitor one app rather than multiple apps. The team released a hot fix in less than an hour, and the crash rate quickly de-escalated to 0.2%. 3. Problem solved, focus on improving app performance The problem was solved, but the team continues to use New Relic to make sure the most important workflows are running correctly and quickly. We also share HTTP and other network performance trends with our backend API developer teams. Improve frontend and backend performance More than a tool for crash analysis, our mobile monitoring capabilities can help you identify opportunities to speed app performance. For example, you can: Create dashboards to query, visualize, and share performance data. Identify handled exceptions to streamline workflows. See trends with sessions, devices, geographical locations, operating systems, carriers, requests and responses, etc. with crash profiles and HTTP profiles. Set up alert notifications for execution time, errors, etc. Define custom attributes and events to obtain additional, specific details about the mobile data that matters the most to your organization. And more! In addition to crash analysis, do more to fine-tune mobile app performance. Great mobile apps increasingly rely on backend systems to power their functionality, such as requesting product information, authenticating users, or streaming media content. But some backend issues can lead to upstream mobile app crashes, freezes, and broken functionality that impacts end users, including: Changed or non-versioned API endpoints Bad payloads API timeouts Slow or deprecated API endpoints You can use the network pages in our mobile monitoring UI to identify problems that surface through HTTP requests, errors, and other network issues. You can also query your data. Then create dashboards and share this information with backend API developer teams and others in your organization to help improve the overall end user experience with your mobile app. You can also improve your customers' overall digital experience: Get rapid visibility into how your end users experience your mobile apps and web browsers. Analyze actual or simulated end-user behavior to hone in on metrics like load time, availability, and errors, while staying grounded in the backend services that enable these digital experiences.

Before attempting to remove an app Before attempting to remove an app monitored by New Relic APM, browser monitoring, or mobile monitoring from the UI, keep in mind: You can downgrade your account to pay less or make it entirely free. The ability to remove an app from the UI may be dependent on permissions. If an agent is still sending data from an app, you cannot remove that app. Remove an application from New Relic Before you can remove an application monitored by New Relic APM, browser monitoring, or mobile monitoring, the app must first stop reporting data. Do this by disabling the agent (explained below) or by uninstalling the agent completely. APM applications Disable an APM agent using these instructions: C SDK: Do a quick recompile and deploy. For example, surround your instrumentation in #ifdef, and set the value of YOURNAMESPACE_NEWRELIC_ENABLED with your build system. Go: Set Enabled to false. Java: Set agent_enabled to false. .NET: Set Newrelic.AgentEnabled to false. Node.js: Set agent_enabled to false. PHP: Remove or disable both the newrelic.so and newrelic-daemon components. Set newrelic.enabled to false. Python: Set monitor_mode to false. Ruby: Set agent_enabled to false. Restart the application server and wait up to ten minutes. Verify the color-coded health status for the app has turned to gray and is no longer reporting data. To remove the APM application from the UI (and any associated apps in browser monitoring), you have a few options: Delete the app from the UI. Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app/service) > Settings > Application, and click the Delete application button. Use NerdGraph to delete an entity. If you've done the above and are still seeing that app in the UI, you can use NerdGraph to delete the relevant entities. For how to find entity IDs, see Entities. Browser If you've used the copy/paste method to install the browser agent, remove the JavaScript snippet from your application's pages. After 93 days, that app will be removed from the UI. If you want to remove it sooner than that, you have several options: Delete an associated APM app. If your browser app is linked to an APM application, deleting the APM application also removes the browser application. See the instructions for deleting an APM app. Delete it from the UI. Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Settings > Application settings, and click the Delete application button. Use NerdGraph to delete an entity. If you've done the above and are still seeing that app in the UI, you can use NerdGraph to delete the relevant entities. For how to find entity IDs, see Entities. Mobile Remove all references/dependencies to New Relic's mobile monitoring SDK/frameworks, then rebuild the application. For more information, see the iOS and Android install docs. After 93 days, the app will be removed from the UI. If you want to remove it sooner than that, you have several options: Remove it using the UI. Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Settings > Application, and click Delete application. Use NerdGraph to delete an entity. If you've done the above and are still seeing that app in the UI, you can use NerdGraph to delete the relevant entities. For how to find entity IDs, see Entities. Troubleshooting If you have problems removing an app, here are some possible causes and suggested solutions: You lack permissions If you don't have relevant permissions, you won't be able to remove an application. You have not waited long enough All app data must stop reporting to New Relic before you can remove that entity from New Relic. In most cases, this takes between 10-15 minutes. In rare cases, it can take a few minutes longer. Not all agents are disabled If you have multiple agents reporting data under the same UI name, then you must make sure you disable or uninstall all of the agents associated with that entity. You have problems removing your PHP app If you have a PHP app and aren't able to remove it from the UI, possible causes include: You have not disabled both components of the PHP agent. You must stop or uninstall both newrelic.so and newrelic-daemon in order to be able to remove a PHP app. For more information, see New Relic daemon processes. You have set up per-directory monitoring of your PHP app, and unexpected PHP data is reporting as the default PHP application in the New Relic UI. To fix this, change the default app name in the PHP agent config. You don't know where the app's data is coming from If you don't know where an app's data is coming from, it may be because the app's name has been changed. When an app name is changed in the UI, it does not change the underlying app name being reported; it only changes how the app name appears in the UI. To see if there is a difference between the reported name and the displayed name: From one.newrelic.com, select APM, then select an application. Scroll down to Settings and select Application. Compare the name in the Application alias field to the name in the Your application still reports as message directly beneath it. To get host information about an app you are not familiar with: From one.newrelic.com, select APM, then select an application. From the summary view, review the Servers list. Once you have identified where app data is coming from, you can remove the app from New Relic. Browser data is still reporting To remove an app from New Relic, all data must have stopped reporting, including browser monitoring data. To verify that you have disabled or uninstalled the APM agent associated with the app: Ensure that browser monitoring is disabled. If your browser monitoring script is inserted by the APM agent, turn it off from inside the UI, in the agent's config file, or in both. If you copied and pasted the monitoring JavaScript snippet in certain pages, remove that JavaScript snippet manually. Ensure all caches have been cleared that the application uses, such as host caches, CDNs, or anything else that caches built pages. Optional: To see a count of how many page views report from each domain, use this NRQL query: SELECT count(*) FROM PageView WHERE appName = 'YOUR_BROWSER_APP_NAME' FACET domain Copy If these steps don't resolve the issue, it is likely due to an end-user's browser cache that hasn't yet cleared. Wait until those caches clear. If your app has internal users, you may be able to identify the users and clear those caches. For more help",

      "body": "New Relic mobile monitoring includes a number of ways to customize and extend the data your mobile app reports. We refer to this type of implementation as \"custom instrumentation.\" This document explains how to get additional data into New Relic, and how to view that new data in the UI. Choose a custom data type You can use these options to create your own data types for custom instrumentation for your mobile apps. Using these four options, you can get a wide range of data based on your needs for your apps. Custom data options Description Session-level custom attributes In creating your own attributes, consisting of a key-value pair, you can add custom data for use in tracking session data. Custom breadcrumbs Useful for troubleshooting crash causes, custom breadcrumb events track the user's code-level path through the app by seeing which breadcrumb API calls were reached and reporting app status details from those moments. Custom interactions Custom interactions give you tracing power so you can debug method timings and improve network call efficiency. A common use of interactions is to understand the underlying activity associated with loading a particular app screen. Custom events You can instrument custom events to collect data about user activity as a user navigates through your app. That user activity will in turn trigger other data collection: a collection of breadcrumbs, auto-instrumented HTTP requests and errors, auto-instrumented interactions, and custom interactions. Add session-level custom attributes Custom attributes annotate (or \"tag\") your mobile monitoring data. A custom attribute consists of a key-value pair. For example, you might create the key userEmail with values such as alice@bigcorp.test and bob@example.com. The agent automatically attaches custom attributes to default mobile monitoring data, and to any breadcrumbs or custom events you create. You can use custom attributes to capture usage data that's relevant to your business. Common examples include account names or IDs, user emails, and subscription levels. You can then filter and facet in the Crash analysis page and via NRQL query. Setting custom attributes will add the key-value pair information at the session level. All default mobile monitoring events inherit these session-level custom attributes. As a best practice, use custom attributes to track a single value for a key that can be true across a session (for example, a user's subscription level, or whether SAML was used to log in). To track the change of a value over the course of a session, like a change in connection type, you would instead record a breadcrumb and its own custom attributes. To track a series of discrete user actions that occur across the course of a session, use custom events. To add custom attributes, see: Android: Use setAttribute() and incrementAttribute(). iOS: Use setAttribute() and incrementAttribute(). Record breadcrumbs Breadcrumbs track the state of your app as it runs, then report a snapshot of that state if your app crashes. This allows you to debug your mobile app crashes more easily. Custom interactions only inherit custom attributes created at the session level. Breadcrumbs will inherit those same session-level custom attributes, but optionally you can also report additional custom attributes specific to each recordBreadcrumb() API call. You can use breadcrumbs in several ways: You could record a breadcrumb event when your app receives an HTTP response, and also record the values in that response as custom attributes (for example, the response might tell the app what screen to display next or recording unique timestamps for each change in the course of a session). If the app crashes or throws errors, you will be able to see invalid data from the HTTP response. You could track the success of each step of your user login process, with perhaps a status attribute recording a success or failure key for each step. This would let you debug which step is causing issues. Once you have released a version of your app that creates MobileBreadcrumb custom events, you can see them in the crash event trail whenever they appear in the app's code path as part of a crashed session. You can also query them using NRQL and query either all breadcrumbs or just breadcrumbs from crashed sessions. This lets you see the frequency of app paths that include that particular breadcrumb. To add custom breadcrumbs, see: Android: Use recordBreadcrumb(). iOS: Use recordBreadcrumb(). Create custom interactions Our mobile monitoring agent begins instrumenting an interaction when it detects a screen load or partial screen load (such as fragments for Android or view controllers for iOS). New Relic automatically traces slow interactions, providing a complete, in-depth picture of a single slow interaction, including the methods that were called, what network requests were made, and the CPU and memory usage once that interaction started. Our mobile monitoring automatically selects data-rich traces. The specific criteria the agent looks for are interactions whose instrumented methods account for at least 30% of the overall interaction time. In addition to the auto-instrumentation, you can start a custom interaction to force the agent to start recording a trace beginning at that point in your app code and continuing across the subsequent methods and network calls. Custom interaction traces provide deep information. However, they increase the overhead of the agent compared to other custom data collection methods because of the large amount of data collected for the entire duration of an interaction. When associated with a crash, custom interactions show up in the crash event trail. You can also query them with NRQL for flexible analysis. Interactions are powerful for tracing but are less flexible in other ways than other custom data types: While custom breadcrumbs and custom events let you optimize your custom attributes to specific events, interactions can only inherit session-level attributes. You can also manually end a custom interaction. However, ensure that the interaction includes enough method activity to be recorded. If the agent does not detect any traced activity for 0.5 seconds, the agent stops the interaction tracing because it is assumed no interesting data remains. In addition, the agent can only trace one interaction at a time, so if a new interaction is triggered the current trace will automatically be stopped in preference for the new trace. To add custom interaction traces, see: Android: Use startInteraction() and endInteraction(). iOS: Create and complete interactions. You can also configure interaction tracing globally: Android: Disable entirely with withInteractionTracing(), or disable only auto-instrumented traces with withDefaultInteractions(). iOS: Disable entirely with NRFeatureFlag_InteractionTracing(), or disable only auto-instrumented traces with NRFeatureFlag_DefaultInteractions(). Record custom events Custom events are a powerful tool for reporting arbitrary user activity to New Relic. When associated with a crash, custom events show up in the crash event trail. You can also query them with NRQL for flexible analysis. Unlike custom interactions, custom events allow you to add custom attributes to a particular event within the user session. For example, you could record a custom event each time a user taps a button or accesses a certain feature, and then use NRQL to track how often that feature was used. Beyond a simple count, you can FACET on default mobile app attributes such as location, device, or carrier to analyze usage. Adding session-level custom attributes would let you further examine usage based on the criteria important to you, such as user subscription level or other user characteristics. Adding additional attributes for that custom event would allow you to track user behavior more closely: What data did they enter or what option did they select, for example. To add custom events, see: Android: Use recordCustomEvent(). iOS: Use recordCustomEvent().",

      "body": "New Relic mobile monitoring includes a number of ways to customize and extend the data your mobile app reports. We refer to this type of implementation as \"custom instrumentation.\" This document explains how to get additional data into New Relic, and how to view that new data in the UI. Choose a custom data type You can use these options to create your own data types for custom instrumentation for your mobile apps. Using these four options, you can get a wide range of data based on your needs for your apps. Custom data options Description Session-level custom attributes In creating your own attributes, consisting of a key-value pair, you can add custom data for use in tracking session data. Custom breadcrumbs Useful for troubleshooting crash causes, custom breadcrumb events track the user's code-level path through the app by seeing which breadcrumb API calls were reached and reporting app status details from those moments. Custom interactions Custom interactions give you tracing power so you can debug method timings and improve network call efficiency. A common use of interactions is to understand the underlying activity associated with loading a particular app screen. Custom events You can instrument custom events to collect data about user activity as a user navigates through your app. That user activity will in turn trigger other data collection: a collection of breadcrumbs, auto-instrumented HTTP requests and errors, auto-instrumented interactions, and custom interactions. Add session-level custom attributes Custom attributes annotate (or \"tag\") your mobile monitoring data. A custom attribute consists of a key-value pair. For example, you might create the key userEmail with values such as alice@bigcorp.test and bob@example.com. The agent automatically attaches custom attributes to default mobile monitoring data, and to any breadcrumbs or custom events you create. You can use custom attributes to capture usage data that's relevant to your business. Common examples include account names or IDs, user emails, and subscription levels. You can then filter and facet in the Crash analysis page and via NRQL query. Setting custom attributes will add the key-value pair information at the session level. All default mobile monitoring events inherit these session-level custom attributes. As a best practice, use custom attributes to track a single value for a key that can be true across a session (for example, a user's subscription level, or whether SAML was used to log in). To track the change of a value over the course of a session, like a change in connection type, you would instead record a breadcrumb and its own custom attributes. To track a series of discrete user actions that occur across the course of a session, use custom events. To add custom attributes, see: Android: Use setAttribute() and incrementAttribute(). iOS: Use setAttribute() and incrementAttribute(). Record breadcrumbs Breadcrumbs track the state of your app as it runs, then report a snapshot of that state if your app crashes. This allows you to debug your mobile app crashes more easily. Custom interactions only inherit custom attributes created at the session level. Breadcrumbs will inherit those same session-level custom attributes, but optionally you can also report additional custom attributes specific to each recordBreadcrumb() API call. You can use breadcrumbs in several ways: You could record a breadcrumb event when your app receives an HTTP response, and also record the values in that response as custom attributes (for example, the response might tell the app what screen to display next or recording unique timestamps for each change in the course of a session). If the app crashes or throws errors, you will be able to see invalid data from the HTTP response. You could track the success of each step of your user login process, with perhaps a status attribute recording a success or failure key for each step. This would let you debug which step is causing issues. Once you have released a version of your app that creates MobileBreadcrumb custom events, you can see them in the crash event trail whenever they appear in the app's code path as part of a crashed session. You can also query them using NRQL and query either all breadcrumbs or just breadcrumbs from crashed sessions. This lets you see the frequency of app paths that include that particular breadcrumb. To add custom breadcrumbs, see: Android: Use recordBreadcrumb(). iOS: Use recordBreadcrumb(). Create custom interactions Our mobile monitoring agent begins instrumenting an interaction when it detects a screen load or partial screen load (such as fragments for Android or view controllers for iOS). New Relic automatically traces slow interactions, providing a complete, in-depth picture of a single slow interaction, including the methods that were called, what network requests were made, and the CPU and memory usage once that interaction started. Our mobile monitoring automatically selects data-rich traces. The specific criteria the agent looks for are interactions whose instrumented methods account for at least 30% of the overall interaction time. In addition to the auto-instrumentation, you can start a custom interaction to force the agent to start recording a trace beginning at that point in your app code and continuing across the subsequent methods and network calls. Custom interaction traces provide deep information. However, they increase the overhead of the agent compared to other custom data collection methods because of the large amount of data collected for the entire duration of an interaction. When associated with a crash, custom interactions show up in the crash event trail. You can also query them with NRQL for flexible analysis. Interactions are powerful for tracing but are less flexible in other ways than other custom data types: While custom breadcrumbs and custom events let you optimize your custom attributes to specific events, interactions can only inherit session-level attributes. You can also manually end a custom interaction. However, ensure that the interaction includes enough method activity to be recorded. If the agent does not detect any traced activity for 0.5 seconds, the agent stops the interaction tracing because it is assumed no interesting data remains. In addition, the agent can only trace one interaction at a time, so if a new interaction is triggered the current trace will automatically be stopped in preference for the new trace. To add custom interaction traces, see: Android: Use startInteraction() and endInteraction(). iOS: Create and complete interactions. You can also configure interaction tracing globally: Android: Disable entirely with withInteractionTracing(), or disable only auto-instrumented traces with withDefaultInteractions(). iOS: Disable entirely with NRFeatureFlag_InteractionTracing(), or disable only auto-instrumented traces with NRFeatureFlag_DefaultInteractions(). Record custom events Custom events are a powerful tool for reporting arbitrary user activity to New Relic. When associated with a crash, custom events show up in the crash event trail. You can also query them with NRQL for flexible analysis. Unlike custom interactions, custom events allow you to add custom attributes to a particular event within the user session. For example, you could record a custom event each time a user taps a button or accesses a certain feature, and then use NRQL to track how often that feature was used. Beyond a simple count, you can FACET on default mobile app attributes such as location, device, or carrier to analyze usage. Adding session-level custom attributes would let you further examine usage based on the criteria important to you, such as user subscription level or other user characteristics. Adding additional attributes for that custom event would allow you to track user behavior more closely: What data did they enter or what option did they select, for example. To add custom events, see: Android: Use recordCustomEvent(). iOS: Use recordCustomEvent().",

      "body": "Applications are automatically removed from New Relic after 93 days without sending data to our platform. You can also remove an application using the UI, once it has stopped sending data. Key metrics will continue to be available via the New Relic REST API, with the application name remaining reserved. For more information, see Inactive apps in New Relic One and our data retention guidelines. Before attempting to remove an app Before attempting to remove an app monitored by New Relic APM, browser monitoring, or mobile monitoring from the UI, keep in mind: You can downgrade your account to pay less or make it entirely free. The ability to remove an app from the UI may be dependent on permissions. If an agent is still sending data from an app, you cannot remove that app. Remove an application from New Relic Before you can remove an application monitored by New Relic APM, browser monitoring, or mobile monitoring, the app must first stop reporting data. Do this by disabling the agent (explained below) or by uninstalling the agent completely. APM applications Disable an APM agent using these instructions: C SDK: Do a quick recompile and deploy. For example, surround your instrumentation in #ifdef, and set the value of YOURNAMESPACE_NEWRELIC_ENABLED with your build system. Go: Set Enabled to false. Java: Set agent_enabled to false. .NET: Set Newrelic.AgentEnabled to false. Node.js: Set agent_enabled to false. PHP: Remove or disable both the newrelic.so and newrelic-daemon components. Set newrelic.enabled to false. Python: Set monitor_mode to false. Ruby: Set agent_enabled to false. Restart the application server and wait up to ten minutes. Verify the color-coded health status for the app has turned to gray and is no longer reporting data. To remove the APM application from the UI (and any associated apps in browser monitoring), you have a few options: Delete the app from the UI. Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app/service) > Settings > Application, and click the Delete application button. Use NerdGraph to delete an entity. If you've done the above and are still seeing that app in the UI, you can use NerdGraph to delete the relevant entities. For how to find entity IDs, see Entities. Browser If you've used the copy/paste method to install the browser agent, remove the JavaScript snippet from your application's pages. After 93 days, that app will be removed from the UI. If you want to remove it sooner than that, you have several options: Delete an associated APM app. If your browser app is linked to an APM application, deleting the APM application also removes the browser application. See the instructions for deleting an APM app. Delete it from the UI. Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Settings > Application settings, and click the Delete application button. Use NerdGraph to delete an entity. If you've done the above and are still seeing that app in the UI, you can use NerdGraph to delete the relevant entities. For how to find entity IDs, see Entities. Mobile Remove all references/dependencies to New Relic's mobile monitoring SDK/frameworks, then rebuild the application. For more information, see the iOS and Android install docs. After 93 days, the app will be removed from the UI. If you want to remove it sooner than that, you have several options: Remove it using the UI. Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Settings > Application, and click Delete application. Use NerdGraph to delete an entity. If you've done the above and are still seeing that app in the UI, you can use NerdGraph to delete the relevant entities. For how to find entity IDs, see Entities. Troubleshooting If you have problems removing an app, here are some possible causes and suggested solutions: You lack permissions If you don't have relevant permissions, you won't be able to remove an application. You have not waited long enough All app data must stop reporting to New Relic before you can remove that entity from New Relic. In most cases, this takes between 10-15 minutes. In rare cases, it can take a few minutes longer. Not all agents are disabled If you have multiple agents reporting data under the same UI name, then you must make sure you disable or uninstall all of the agents associated with that entity. You have problems removing your PHP app If you have a PHP app and aren't able to remove it from the UI, possible causes include: You have not disabled both components of the PHP agent. You must stop or uninstall both newrelic.so and newrelic-daemon in order to be able to remove a PHP app. For more information, see New Relic daemon processes. You have set up per-directory monitoring of your PHP app, and unexpected PHP data is reporting as the default PHP application in the New Relic UI. To fix this, change the default app name in the PHP agent config. You don't know where the app's data is coming from If you don't know where an app's data is coming from, it may be because the app's name has been changed. When an app name is changed in the UI, it does not change the underlying app name being reported; it only changes how the app name appears in the UI. To see if there is a difference between the reported name and the displayed name: From one.newrelic.com, select APM, then select an application. Scroll down to Settings and select Application. Compare the name in the Application alias field to the name in the Your application still reports as message directly beneath it. To get host information about an app you are not familiar with: From one.newrelic.com, select APM, then select an application. From the summary view, review the Servers list. Once you have identified where app data is coming from, you can remove the app from New Relic. Browser data is still reporting To remove an app from New Relic, all data must have stopped reporting, including browser monitoring data. To verify that you have disabled or uninstalled the APM agent associated with the app: Ensure that browser monitoring is disabled. If your browser monitoring script is inserted by the APM agent, turn it off from inside the UI, in the agent's config file, or in both. If you copied and pasted the monitoring JavaScript snippet in certain pages, remove that JavaScript snippet manually. Ensure all caches have been cleared that the application uses, such as host caches, CDNs, or anything else that caches built pages. Optional: To see a count of how many page views report from each domain, use this NRQL query: SELECT count(*) FROM PageView WHERE appName = 'YOUR_BROWSER_APP_NAME' FACET domain Copy If these steps don't resolve the issue, it is likely due to an end-user's browser cache that hasn't yet cleared. Wait until those caches clear. If your app has internal users, you may be able to identify the users and clear those caches. For more help",

New Relic can automatically translate many common exceptions into network failure types. $failure enum Either this or $exception parameter is required. The type of network failure that occurred. If an exception cannot be resolved to a network failure automatically, this method can be used to categorize the failure accurately. The values are defined by the NetworkFailure enum. Valid values include Unknown, BadURL, TimedOut, CannotConnectToHost, DNSLookupFailed, BadServerResponse, and SecureConnectionFailed. Examples Record network failure Here’s an example of an error listener that uses an error as part of the noticed network failure to New Relic: new Response.ErrorListener() { @Override public void onErrorResponse(Error error) { NewRelic.noticeNetworkFailure(badUrl, \"GET\", System.nanoTime(), System.nanoTime(), NetworkFailure.exceptionToNetworkFailure(error)); } Copy",

      "body": "Mobile monitoring for Android monitors your mobile app, giving you a comprehensive view of your app's performance. It works for Android apps written using Java or Kotlin. Install the Android agent Before you install the Android agent, make sure your app follows the compatibility requirements. As part of the installation process, mobile monitoring automatically generates an application token. This is a 40-character hexadecimal string for authenticating each mobile app that you monitor. Follow the Android installation and configuration procedures for your environment as applicable. If you have problems with your Android installation, or if you do not see data in the mobile monitoring UI for your Android app, follow the troubleshooting procedures. Extend your instrumentation After you install the agent, extend the agent's instrumentation by using the mobile monitoring UI and following up on information in New Relic Insights. To access: In mobile monitoring: In NRQL and dashboards: Custom data Create and record custom events, interaction traces, and attributes to add details to your existing data and traces. Then, view the custom events that you created in NRQL or dashboards. Network requests Enable the MobileRequest event feature so you can perform a full network analysis. To further investigate network request error rates and response times, query MobileRequest and MobileRequestError events. Crash analysis Review detailed information using groups and filters to analyze trends that lead to crashes. To view more information about crashes, create NRQL queries to review Insights charts related to crash data. Android SDK API Use the Android SDK API for mobile monitoring to instrument parts of your code that are not instrumented by default. Then, view those custom events and attributes in New Relic Insights. Handled exceptions Report exceptions so you can identify factors creating a poor mobile app experience. To further improve performance, review MobileHandledException event records in New Relic Insights. Breadcrumbs Boost the level of detail in crash event trails by adding breadcrumbs. Then, query MobileBreadcrumbs events to see all breadcrumbs or just breadcrumbs related to crashes.",

      "body": "Important Starting with version 5.9.0 of the New Relic Android agent, you can set a custom user identifier value to associate user sessions with analytics events and attributes. For more information, see the NewRelic.setUserId method. The Android agent provides an SDK API to set up custom instrumentation for monitoring your application. The API gives you the ability to: Instrument your own code. Create, name, and end interaction traces from events in your mobile app. Record custom metrics. Send custom attributes and events to New Relic Insights. Track networking from libraries not supported automatically. Install the SDK Before using the Android SDK API: Review the Android SDK API release notes to ensure you have your app instrumented with a current SDK for mobile monitoring. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Add more data and then follow the steps for Android. For more information, see the detailed Android installation and configuration procedures. If you need to support Android 2.2, see the legacy Android agent SDK procedures. Instrument your code Caution Tracing is heavily optimized, but it does impose a performance overhead. Avoid instrumenting methods that are expected to be called hundreds of times. If you have custom libraries or application code that you want to include in interaction traces: Use the following Java annotation: import com.newrelic.agent.android.instrumentation.Trace; Copy Add the @Trace annotation to the methods you want to instrument: @Trace public void myHeavyweightMethod() { … Copy To indicate what kind of method is being traced, use the optional category attribute. Automatically instrumented methods Automatic instrumentation is one of the agent's more convenient features. However, if it interferes with the method being traced, add @SkipTrace to the method, and the agent will skip it during compile time instrumentation.

If you want to... Do this Track app activity that may be helpful for troubleshooting crashes See recordBreadcrumb. Track a method as an interaction See startInteraction. Name or rename an interaction See setInteractionName. End an interaction See endInteraction. Disable or enable all interactions See withInteractionTracing. Set an app version associated with an interaction See withApplicationVersion. Set custom build ID See withApplicationBuild. Create custom metrics See recordMetric. Report custom attributes and events There are several ways to add custom attributes and events. For more about which would be the best method to use and why, see Add custom data. Create an attribute: setAttribute Increment an attribute count: incrementAttribute Remove an attribute: removeAttribute Remove all attributes: removeAllAttributes Record custom event: recordCustomEvent Record a breadcrumb event: recordBreadcrumb Set the maximum size of an event pool: setMaxEventPoolSize Set maximum time agent stores events in memory: setMaxEventBufferTime Return the current session's ID: currentSessionId Set custom user ID for associating sessions with events and attributes: setUserId Track custom network requests and failures Use these methods: Record HTTP transactions at varying levels of detail: See noticeHttpTransaction. Record network failures: See noticeNetworkFailure. Record a handled exception as an event, including context See recordHandledException(). Manual cross application tracing The noticeHttpTransaction code does not automatically append the appropriate header ID value needed to get cross application tracing to work. This is why you will not see the application link in your Android app on New Relic's Map page for mobile apps or on the HTTP requests page. You can use a public method in the New Relic Android SDK to get the appropriate ID to pass along with your HTTP request to your back-end application, as long as it is already instrumented by New Relic. The appropriate header ID will be passed from the back-end application in the response, providing everything needed for cross application tracing to function. Cross application tracing example This example adds the NewRelic-ID to the back-end HTTP request, with conn as the external HTTP connection. (Notice the additional import.) import com.newrelic.agent.android.NewRelic; import com.newrelic.agent.android.Agent; //required for getCrossProcessId() ... ... //new method for appending the crossProcessID necessary for CAT in New Relic public static void setCrossProcessHeader(HttpURLConnection conn) { String crossProcessId = Agent.getCrossProcessId(); // API call into the agent for the X-NewRelic-ID if (crossProcessId != null) { conn.setRequestProperty(\"X-NewRelic-ID\", crossProcessId); } } Copy After adding the appropriate header to the request to the back-end app, the response from the app needs to be parsed for the X-Newrelic-App-Data header, and then added to the noticeHttpTransaction call as a string. For example: //NewRelic.noticeHttpTransaction(url, httpMethod, statusCode, startTimeMs, endTimeMs, bytesSent, bytesReceived, responseBody, params, response); //Where xNewRelicAppDataHeader is the value of the X-NewRelic-App-Data header NewRelic.noticeHttpTransaction(\"http://api.newrelic.com\", \"GET\", 200, System.nanoTime(), System.nanoTime(),100 ,100, \"Test\", new HashMap<String, String>(), xNewRelicAppDataHeader); Copy",

If you have previously installed the Android agent SDK for mobile monitoring, follow the steps before upgrading to the latest version with Gradle and Android Studio. Install your Android app As part of the installation process for mobile monitoring, New Relic automatically generates an application token. This is a 40-character hexadecimal string for authenticating each mobile app you monitor in New Relic. Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile. If applicable: From the Mobile apps index, select Add a new app. From the Get started page, select Android as the platform for mobile monitoring. Type a meaningful name for your mobile app, and select Continue. Continue with the steps to configure mobile monitoring with Gradle and Android Studio. OR: To complete the configuration process for a new mobile app later: Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile, then select See instructions next to your mobile app name. To upgrade an existing Android installation: Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Settings > Installation. Configure with Gradle and Android Studio These procedures to configure your Android app with Gradle and Android Studio also appear on the Get started page in New Relic. Merge New Relic's mobile monitoring code in the Gradle & Android Studio tab to your build.gradle file. Project level build.gradle file: In this example, AGENT_VERSION represents your agent version number. See the agent release notes, and use the latest version. buildscript { repositories { mavenCentral() } dependencies { classpath \"com.newrelic.agent.android:agent-gradle-plugin:AGENT_VERSION\" } } Copy App level build.gradle file: In this example, AGENT_VERSION represents your agent version number. See the agent release notes, and use the latest version. repositories { mavenCentral() } apply plugin: 'android' apply plugin: 'newrelic' dependencies { compile 'com.newrelic.agent.android:android-agent:AGENT_VERSION' } Copy ProGuard or DexGuard: In your project’s root directory (projectname/app), add a newrelic.properties file with the following line: com.newrelic.application_token=GENERATED_TOKEN Copy Follow the additional, required configuration steps for using ProGuard or DexGuard with New Relic. Set app permissions: Ensure that your Android app requests INTERNET and ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE permissions by adding these lines to your AndroidManifest.xml file: <uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.INTERNET\" /> <uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE\" /> Copy To start New Relic's mobile monitoring agent: In your Default Activity (as defined in your Manifest), import the NewRelic class: import com.newrelic.agent.android.NewRelic; Copy Important We do not support starting the mobile monitoring agent in other classes, as that can cause unexpected or unstable behavior. To initialize mobile monitoring: In the onCreate() method, add this call: NewRelic.withApplicationToken(\"GENERATED_TOKEN\").start(this.getApplication()); Copy Optional: Change the logging level. To build and run your application: Clean your project, then run your app in an emulator or device to generate traffic. Wait a few minutes, then view data for your Android app from the Overview page: Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app). If you have problems with your Android installation, or if you do not see data in the mobile monitoring UI, follow the troubleshooting procedures. Update your Android installation To keep your Android agent up to date, follow the procedures to upgrade the Android agent SDK for New Relic. To install the latest Android version for your mobile app: Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Settings > Installation. Android 4.x: Multidex support New Relic's mobile monitoring for Android versions prior to Android 5.0 (API level 21) use the Dalvik runtime to execute app code. By default, Dalvik limits apps to a single classes.dex bytecode file per APK. In order to get around this limitation, you must enable multidex support. Then you can use the multidex support library, which becomes part of the primary DEX file of your app and then manages access to the additional DEX files and the code they contain. When building each DEX file for a multidex app, the build tools perform complex decision making to determine which classes are needed in the primary DEX file so that your app can start successfully. If any class required during startup is not provided in the primary DEX file, then your app crashes with the error java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError. If you see the java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError error, then you must manually specify these additional classes as required in the primary DEX file: Create a proguard.multidex.config file within the /app folder of your project. Update mypackage to reflect your package name. #################### # keep class names # #################### #Keep New Relic in the main dex -keep class com.newrelic.** { *; } -keep class com.mypackage.activities.** { *; } Copy Merge the following code into the app-level build.gradle file: android { defaultConfig{ … multiDexKeepProguard file(\"proguard.multidex.config\") } } Copy For more information, see the Android Developers documentation on declaring classes required in the primary DEX file.

Install the Android agent Before you install the Android agent, make sure your app follows the compatibility requirements. As part of the installation process, mobile monitoring automatically generates an application token. This is a 40-character hexadecimal string for authenticating each mobile app that you monitor. Follow the Android installation and configuration procedures for your environment as applicable. If you have problems with your Android installation, or if you do not see data in the mobile monitoring UI for your Android app, follow the troubleshooting procedures. Extend your instrumentation After you install the agent, extend the agent's instrumentation by using the mobile monitoring UI and following up on information in New Relic Insights. To access: In mobile monitoring: In NRQL and dashboards: Custom data Create and record custom events, interaction traces, and attributes to add details to your existing data and traces. Then, view the custom events that you created in NRQL or dashboards. Network requests Enable the MobileRequest event feature so you can perform a full network analysis. To further investigate network request error rates and response times, query MobileRequest and MobileRequestError events. Crash analysis Review detailed information using groups and filters to analyze trends that lead to crashes. To view more information about crashes, create NRQL queries to review Insights charts related to crash data. Android SDK API Use the Android SDK API for mobile monitoring to instrument parts of your code that are not instrumented by default. Then, view those custom events and attributes in New Relic Insights. Handled exceptions Report exceptions so you can identify factors creating a poor mobile app experience.

If you have previously installed the Android agent SDK for mobile monitoring, follow the steps before upgrading to the latest version with Gradle and Android Studio. Install your Android app As part of the installation process for mobile monitoring, New Relic automatically generates an application token. This is a 40-character hexadecimal string for authenticating each mobile app you monitor in New Relic. Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile. If applicable: From the Mobile apps index, select Add a new app. From the Get started page, select Android as the platform for mobile monitoring. Type a meaningful name for your mobile app, and select Continue. Continue with the steps to configure mobile monitoring with Gradle and Android Studio. OR: To complete the configuration process for a new mobile app later: Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile, then select See instructions next to your mobile app name. To upgrade an existing Android installation: Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Settings > Installation. Configure with Gradle and Android Studio These procedures to configure your Android app with Gradle and Android Studio also appear on the Get started page in New Relic. Merge New Relic's mobile monitoring code in the Gradle & Android Studio tab to your build.gradle file. Project level build.gradle file: In this example, AGENT_VERSION represents your agent version number. See the agent release notes, and use the latest version. buildscript { repositories { mavenCentral() } dependencies { classpath \"com.newrelic.agent.android:agent-gradle-plugin:AGENT_VERSION\" } } Copy App level build.gradle file: In this example, AGENT_VERSION represents your agent version number. See the agent release notes, and use the latest version. repositories { mavenCentral() } apply plugin: 'android' apply plugin: 'newrelic' dependencies { compile 'com.newrelic.agent.android:android-agent:AGENT_VERSION' } Copy ProGuard or DexGuard: In your project’s root directory (projectname/app), add a newrelic.properties file with the following line: com.newrelic.application_token=GENERATED_TOKEN Copy Follow the additional, required configuration steps for using ProGuard or DexGuard with New Relic. Set app permissions: Ensure that your Android app requests INTERNET and ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE permissions by adding these lines to your AndroidManifest.xml file: <uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.INTERNET\" /> <uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE\" /> Copy To start New Relic's mobile monitoring agent: In your Default Activity (as defined in your Manifest), import the NewRelic class: import com.newrelic.agent.android.NewRelic; Copy Important We do not support starting the mobile monitoring agent in other classes, as that can cause unexpected or unstable behavior. To initialize mobile monitoring: In the onCreate() method, add this call: NewRelic.withApplicationToken(\"GENERATED_TOKEN\").start(this.getApplication()); Copy Optional: Change the logging level. To build and run your application: Clean your project, then run your app in an emulator or device to generate traffic. Wait a few minutes, then view data for your Android app from the Overview page: Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app). If you have problems with your Android installation, or if you do not see data in the mobile monitoring UI, follow the troubleshooting procedures. Update your Android installation To keep your Android agent up to date, follow the procedures to upgrade the Android agent SDK for New Relic. To install the latest Android version for your mobile app: Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Settings > Installation. Android 4.x: Multidex support New Relic's mobile monitoring for Android versions prior to Android 5.0 (API level 21) use the Dalvik runtime to execute app code. By default, Dalvik limits apps to a single classes.dex bytecode file per APK. In order to get around this limitation, you must enable multidex support. Then you can use the multidex support library, which becomes part of the primary DEX file of your app and then manages access to the additional DEX files and the code they contain. When building each DEX file for a multidex app, the build tools perform complex decision making to determine which classes are needed in the primary DEX file so that your app can start successfully. If any class required during startup is not provided in the primary DEX file, then your app crashes with the error java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError. If you see the java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError error, then you must manually specify these additional classes as required in the primary DEX file: Create a proguard.multidex.config file within the /app folder of your project. Update mypackage to reflect your package name. #################### # keep class names # #################### #Keep New Relic in the main dex -keep class com.newrelic.** { *; } -keep class com.mypackage.activities.** { *; } Copy Merge the following code into the app-level build.gradle file: android { defaultConfig{ … multiDexKeepProguard file(\"proguard.multidex.config\") } } Copy For more information, see the Android Developers documentation on declaring classes required in the primary DEX file.

      "body": "If you're following the Enable distributed tracing procedures and want to set up Infinite Tracing, you'll need to set up a trace observer. A trace observer is a cloud-based New Relic tool that decides what trace data to keep and send to New Relic. The trace observer lives in New Relic Edge, which is an AWS-based service that provides you with a low-latency and low-cost way to send your telemetry data to New Relic. The trace observer sends data via our Trace API, which is the entry point for all distributed trace data we ingest. Tip This documentation is for our Infinite Tracing feature. To learn about all our distributed tracing options, see Intro to distributed tracing. Set up the trace observer Before setting up a trace observer, understand these points: With the exception of the Trace API, these instructions are not standalone; they're part of larger enable procedures. If you're still figuring out what you need, see Enable distributed tracing. To avoid configuration conflict issues, you should ideally enable Infinite Tracing for all associated services. If some services in a trace have our standard distributed tracing enabled, you should upgrade those to Infinite Tracing. To set up a trace observer: Go to one.newrelic.com, and click Apps. Under Your apps, click New Relic Edge. Select an account in the upper-left dropdown. If you have access to multiple accounts, make sure you're in the account where you want Infinite Tracing enabled. If no trace observers are already present, click New trace observer to add one, fill out the information, and click Create. Important Note: If you select a trace observer in an EU region, you’ll still need a US-based New Relic account because data is reported to US data centers. Under the Endpoints dropdown: Copy the For other integrations endpoint value and have it ready: this will be referred to in later instructions as YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL. If you're enabling a language agent, also copy the For language agents value and have it ready: this will be referred to as YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST. (Optional but recommended) To verify things are working, we recommend sending a sample trace payload. If you're using our Trace API: this step is especially recommended to learn how the API works. Send sample payload Important If you're using Zipkin-format data, see Send Zipkin payload. This test sends a sample trace payload with one trace and two spans from a service named Test Service A. To send this sample request: Get the license key for the account you want to report data to and have it ready. Copy the following curl request into a text editor: curl -i -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -H \"Api-Key: $YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" \\ -H 'Data-Format: newrelic' \\ -H 'Data-Format-Version: 1' \\ -X POST \\ -d '[ { \"common\": { \"attributes\": { \"environment\": \"staging\" } }, \"spans\": [ { \"trace.id\": \"123456\", \"id\": \"ABC\", \"attributes\": { \"duration.ms\": 12.53, \"host\": \"host123.example.com\", \"name\": \"/home\", \"service.name\": \"Test Service A\" } }, { \"trace.id\": \"123456\", \"id\": \"DEF\", \"attributes\": { \"duration.ms\": 2.97, \"host\": \"host456.example.com\", \"error.message\": \"Invalid credentials\", \"name\": \"/auth\", \"parent.id\": \"ABC\", \"service.name\": \"Test Service B\" } } ] } ]' \\ '$YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL' Copy Insert your own values into the curl request: Value Description $YOUR_LICENSE_KEY Replace this with your license key. $YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL Replace this with the For other integrations endpoint value you copied in a previous step. Copy the curl request into a terminal and execute it. The test should return HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted, indicating success. If it does not, check the following common issues: Confirm that you used the For other integrations endpoint value. Confirm you're using single quotes around YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL. Check that you're using the correct API key. If your test returned HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted, go to the New Relic UI to see a query of the sample payload data using the span attribute service.name = Test Service A (here's a link for that query). Because the sample payload contains an error attribute, the error sampler will mark it for keeping. If you modify the payload to remove the error attributes, the random sampler may not choose to keep this particular trace. Tip Traces may take up to one minute to show up in the UI. (Optional) There are several ways to configure Infinite Tracing. This configuration can wait until after you've completed the enable procedures. This procedure is complete. Next, return to finish any remaining instructions for the tracing tool you started enabling: Language agents Third-party telemetry integrations (OpenTelemetry, OpenCensus, others) Trace API: once the trace observer is set up, you're finished and can start instrumenting your application. Trace observer endpoints In the trace observer UI, there's an Endpoints dropdown. When setting up the trace observer, we have you copy these values for use at various points of our tracing tool setup instructions. There are two values: For language agents: This value is referenced in our code examples as YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST. This is used for configuring our language agents to send data to the trace observer. For other integrations: This value is referenced in our code examples as YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL. This is used for configuring our telemetry integrations and for sending data via the Trace API (including sending sample payloads).",

DistributedTraceSummary MobileRequest MobileRequestError Span Transaction TransactionError InfrastructureEvent Data sources : InfrastructureCloudTrail InfrastructureEvent describes changes (deltas) that occur in a system's live state. When an inventory or system state is added, removed, or changed, Infrastructure will produce an InfrastructureEvent that logs that activity. Attribute name Definition Data types category A New Relic category used to organize events in the UI. For example: automation, notification, and service. InfrastructureEvent changeType A simple classification of the type of change made to the entity: added, modified, or removed. InfrastructureEvent changedPath The fully specified name of the item that changed. This is constructed by taking the source and adding one or more additional path elements that uniquely identify the item that changed. InfrastructureEvent deltaId Delta refers to a recorded change in the system. The deltaId is a number used by New Relic to organize incoming inventory change data. InfrastructureEvent eventId The unique ID of the event, generated by New Relic. InfrastructureEvent format The type of infrastructure event. Each format type includes attributes that may be used to render the event in the UI. InfrastructureEvent newStatus The new agent status: disconnected or connected. InfrastructureEvent newValue If a change is made to the entity, this attribute contains the new value of the inventory that was changed. This will have no value if no change has been made. The value will display approximately 4K bytes of data. InfrastructureEvent oldValue If a change is made to the entity, this attribute contains the old value of the inventory that was changed. This will be blank if no change has been made. InfrastructureEvent provider For integrations that use generic event types (like the DatastoreSample event), the provider value specifies the source of the data (the service, or a sub-category of data from that service). Some Insights events are generic and are used by several integrations. For example, the DatastoreSample event is used by several integrations, including the AWS DynamoDB integration and the AWS RDS integration. In these cases, the provider attribute value represents the source of that attribute. This will usually be the service that data comes from or, for integrations that use several provider values, a certain sub-category of data from that service. When a provider value is present for a generic event, that event will have additional integration-specific attributes attached to it. Here’s an example of an Insights NRQL query that returns the attributes present for a DatastoreSample event reported by the AWS RDS integration: SELECT * from DatastoreSample where provider = 'RdsDbCluster' InfrastructureEvent source The fully specified origin of this inventory item. This is typically in the form category/plugin, where plugin is the generic word used for the tool that gathered this data. InfrastructureEvent summary A summary of the change that happened. Uses a human-friendly string, such as Agent disconnected. InfrastructureEvent violationUpdateType The type of change to the violation: For example: open or closed.

Infinite Tracing is a fully managed cloud-based solution that can analyze 100% of your trace data and choose the most actionable data, letting you investigate and solve issues quickly. This document only applies to our Infinite Tracing feature. For an overview of all distributed tracing options, see Enable distributed tracing. What is Infinite Tracing? Infinite Tracing allows you to send all your trace data to our cloud-based service and rely on Infinite Tracing to make sampling decisions. You can configure Infinite Tracing in various ways to ensure it's keeping the trace data you need to see. Unlike our standard distributed tracing options, Infinite Tracing can process more trace data. It uses superior tail-based sampling (sampling after data is collected), as opposed to the head-based sampling that our standard tracing feature uses. Resources for learning more about Infinite Tracing: Infinite Tracing product page Technical details about sampling and architecture Requirements Requirements differ depending on your pricing plan: New Relic One pricing: requires Pro or Enterprise edition. Original pricing: requires New Relic help to enable it for your organization. For questions, contact your New Relic account representative. Enable Infinite Tracing When enabling Infinite Tracing, you should ideally enable it for all associated services. If you have a mix of Infinite Tracing and our standard tracing solutions enabled, traces will have configuration conflict issues.

If you have previously installed the Android agent SDK for mobile monitoring, follow the steps before upgrading to the latest version with Gradle and Android Studio. Install your Android app As part of the installation process for mobile monitoring, New Relic automatically generates an application token. This is a 40-character hexadecimal string for authenticating each mobile app you monitor in New Relic. Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile. If applicable: From the Mobile apps index, select Add a new app. From the Get started page, select Android as the platform for mobile monitoring. Type a meaningful name for your mobile app, and select Continue. Continue with the steps to configure mobile monitoring with Gradle and Android Studio. OR: To complete the configuration process for a new mobile app later: Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile, then select See instructions next to your mobile app name. To upgrade an existing Android installation: Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Settings > Installation. Configure with Gradle and Android Studio These procedures to configure your Android app with Gradle and Android Studio also appear on the Get started page in New Relic. Merge New Relic's mobile monitoring code in the Gradle & Android Studio tab to your build.gradle file. Project level build.gradle file: In this example, AGENT_VERSION represents your agent version number. See the agent release notes, and use the latest version. buildscript { repositories { mavenCentral() } dependencies { classpath \"com.newrelic.agent.android:agent-gradle-plugin:AGENT_VERSION\" } } Copy App level build.gradle file: In this example, AGENT_VERSION represents your agent version number. See the agent release notes, and use the latest version. repositories { mavenCentral() } apply plugin: 'android' apply plugin: 'newrelic' dependencies { compile 'com.newrelic.agent.android:android-agent:AGENT_VERSION' } Copy ProGuard or DexGuard: In your project’s root directory (projectname/app), add a newrelic.properties file with the following line: com.newrelic.application_token=GENERATED_TOKEN Copy Follow the additional, required configuration steps for using ProGuard or DexGuard with New Relic. Set app permissions: Ensure that your Android app requests INTERNET and ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE permissions by adding these lines to your AndroidManifest.xml file: <uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.INTERNET\" /> <uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE\" /> Copy To start New Relic's mobile monitoring agent: In your Default Activity (as defined in your Manifest), import the NewRelic class: import com.newrelic.agent.android.NewRelic; Copy Important We do not support starting the mobile monitoring agent in other classes, as that can cause unexpected or unstable behavior. To initialize mobile monitoring: In the onCreate() method, add this call: NewRelic.withApplicationToken(\"GENERATED_TOKEN\").start(this.getApplication()); Copy Optional: Change the logging level. To build and run your application: Clean your project, then run your app in an emulator or device to generate traffic. Wait a few minutes, then view data for your Android app from the Overview page: Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app). If you have problems with your Android installation, or if you do not see data in the mobile monitoring UI, follow the troubleshooting procedures. Update your Android installation To keep your Android agent up to date, follow the procedures to upgrade the Android agent SDK for New Relic. To install the latest Android version for your mobile app: Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Settings > Installation. Android 4.x: Multidex support New Relic's mobile monitoring for Android versions prior to Android 5.0 (API level 21) use the Dalvik runtime to execute app code. By default, Dalvik limits apps to a single classes.dex bytecode file per APK. In order to get around this limitation, you must enable multidex support. Then you can use the multidex support library, which becomes part of the primary DEX file of your app and then manages access to the additional DEX files and the code they contain. When building each DEX file for a multidex app, the build tools perform complex decision making to determine which classes are needed in the primary DEX file so that your app can start successfully. If any class required during startup is not provided in the primary DEX file, then your app crashes with the error java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError. If you see the java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError error, then you must manually specify these additional classes as required in the primary DEX file: Create a proguard.multidex.config file within the /app folder of your project. Update mypackage to reflect your package name. #################### # keep class names # #################### #Keep New Relic in the main dex -keep class com.newrelic.** { *; } -keep class com.mypackage.activities.** { *; } Copy Merge the following code into the app-level build.gradle file: android { defaultConfig{ … multiDexKeepProguard file(\"proguard.multidex.config\") } } Copy For more information, see the Android Developers documentation on declaring classes required in the primary DEX file.

Check our Android compatibility and requirements, and if you have previously installed the Android agent SDK, follow the steps before upgrading to the latest version with ProGuard or DexGuard. Configure ProGuard To add support for ProGuard: Add an exclusion to your app; for example: To support New Relic instrumentation, add keep class. To disable warnings related to unresolved problems, add dont warn. To preserve line numbers for crash reporting, add LineNumberTable. To preserve stack information for handled exceptions, add SourceFile and EnclosingMethod.

To initialize mobile monitoring: In the onCreate() method, add this call: NewRelic.withApplicationToken(\"GENERATED_TOKEN\").start(this.getApplication()); Copy Optional: Change the logging level. To build and run your application: Clean your project, then run your app in an emulator or device to generate traffic. Wait a few minutes, then view data for your Android app from the Overview page: Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app). If you have problems with your Android installation, or if you do not see data in the mobile monitoring UI, follow the troubleshooting procedures. Update your Android installation To keep your Android agent up to date, follow the procedures to upgrade the Android agent SDK for New Relic. To install the latest Android version for your mobile app: Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Settings > Installation. Android 4.x: Multidex support New Relic's mobile monitoring for Android versions prior to Android 5.0 (API level 21) use the Dalvik runtime to execute app code. By default, Dalvik limits apps to a single classes.dex bytecode file per APK. In order to get around this limitation, you must enable multidex support. Then you can use the multidex support library, which becomes part of the primary DEX file of your app and then manages access to the additional DEX files and the code they contain. When building each DEX file for a multidex app, the build tools perform complex decision making to determine which classes are needed in the primary DEX file so that your app can start successfully. If any class required during startup is not provided in the primary DEX file, then your app crashes with the error java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError. If you see the java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError error, then you must manually specify these additional classes as required in the primary DEX file: Create a proguard.multidex.config file within the /app folder of your project. Update mypackage to reflect your package name. #################### # keep class names # #################### #Keep New Relic in the main dex -keep class com.newrelic.** { *; } -keep class com.mypackage.activities.** { *; } Copy Merge the following code into the app-level build.gradle file: android { defaultConfig{ … multiDexKeepProguard file(\"proguard.multidex.config\") } } Copy For more information, see the Android Developers documentation on declaring classes required in the primary DEX file.

Check our Android compatibility and requirements, and if you have previously installed the Android agent SDK, follow the steps before upgrading to the latest version with ProGuard or DexGuard. Configure ProGuard To add support for ProGuard: Add an exclusion to your app; for example: To support New Relic instrumentation, add keep class. To disable warnings related to unresolved problems, add dont warn. To preserve line numbers for crash reporting, add LineNumberTable. To preserve stack information for handled exceptions, add SourceFile and EnclosingMethod. Add the following to your ProGuard config file (proguard.cfg, proguard-android.txt, proguard-rules.pro, etc.): -keep class com.newrelic.** { *; } -dontwarn com.newrelic.** -keepattributes Exceptions, Signature, InnerClasses, LineNumberTable, SourceFile, EnclosingMethod Copy Clean and rebuild your project. Run your app in an emulator or device to start seeing data on your mobile app's Overview page. Optional: Use the mobile monitoring Settings page to customize your mobile app. If no data appears, review your logcat output for errors. Network library support New Relic instrumentation happens before ProGuard obfuscates your code. In order for these libraries to be properly instrumented, their classes must not be obfuscated by ProGuard. Here are examples of rules to be applied to preserve these classes. This is not a complete list. Different rules will be needed depending on your library or version. Library Rules Apache Http -keep class org.apache.http.** { *; } -dontwarn org.apache.http.** Copy OkHttp 2 -keep class com.squareup.okhttp.* { *; } -dontwarn com.squareup.okhttp.** -dontwarn okio.** Copy OkHttp 3 -keep class okhttp3.** { *; } -dontwarn okhttp3.** -dontwarn okio.** Copy Retrofit 2 -keep class retrofit2.** { *; } -dontwarn retrofit2.** Copy Configure DexGuard DexGuard uses the same configuration options as ProGuard, and it can read any pre-existing ProGuard configuration files. DexGuard also has its own set of additional configuration options and provides sample configurations for many common app frameworks. To add support for DexGuard: Add DexGuard to your app and set up the Gradle plugin according to the directions from DexGuard. Create a dexguard-project.txt file to hold specific DexGuard configuration options, and add: -dontnote com.newrelic.agent.android.NewRelic -dontnote com.newrelic.agent.android.harvest.crash.Crash Copy After the DexGuard plugin has been configured, check the following. DexGuard 8.x: verify that your app's buildTypes configuration is similar to this: buildTypes { release { minifyEnabled true proguardFile getDefaultDexGuardFile('dexguard-release.pro') proguardFile 'proguard-rules.pro' proguardFile 'dexguard-project.txt' } ...

Configure with Gradle and Android Studio These procedures to configure your Android app with Gradle and Android Studio also appear on the Get started page in New Relic. Merge New Relic's mobile monitoring code in the Gradle & Android Studio tab to your build.gradle file. Project level build.gradle file: In this example, AGENT_VERSION represents your agent version number. See the agent release notes, and use the latest version. buildscript { repositories { mavenCentral() } dependencies { classpath \"com.newrelic.agent.android:agent-gradle-plugin:AGENT_VERSION\" } } Copy App level build.gradle file: In this example, AGENT_VERSION represents your agent version number. See the agent release notes, and use the latest version. repositories { mavenCentral() } apply plugin: 'android' apply plugin: 'newrelic' dependencies { compile 'com.newrelic.agent.android:android-agent:AGENT_VERSION' } Copy ProGuard or DexGuard: In your project’s root directory (projectname/app), add a newrelic.properties file with the following line: com.newrelic.application_token=GENERATED_TOKEN Copy Follow the additional, required configuration steps for using ProGuard or DexGuard with New Relic. Set app permissions: Ensure that your Android app requests INTERNET and ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE permissions by adding these lines to your AndroidManifest.xml file: <uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.INTERNET\" /> <uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE\" /> Copy To start New Relic's mobile monitoring agent: In your Default Activity (as defined in your Manifest), import the NewRelic class: import com.newrelic.agent.android.NewRelic; Copy Important We do not support starting the mobile monitoring agent in other classes, as that can cause unexpected or unstable behavior. To initialize mobile monitoring: In the onCreate() method, add this call: NewRelic.withApplicationToken(\"GENERATED_TOKEN\").start(this.getApplication()); Copy Optional: Change the logging level. To build and run your application: Clean your project, then run your app in an emulator or device to generate traffic. Wait a few minutes, then view data for your Android app from the Overview page: Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app). If you have problems with your Android installation, or if you do not see data in the mobile monitoring UI, follow the troubleshooting procedures. Update your Android installation To keep your Android agent up to date, follow the procedures to upgrade the Android agent SDK for New Relic. To install the latest Android version for your mobile app: Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Settings > Installation. Android 4.x: Multidex support New Relic's mobile monitoring for Android versions prior to Android 5.0 (API level 21) use the Dalvik runtime to execute app code. By default, Dalvik limits apps to a single classes.dex bytecode file per APK. In order to get around this limitation, you must enable multidex support. Then you can use the multidex support library, which becomes part of the primary DEX file of your app and then manages access to the additional DEX files and the code they contain. When building each DEX file for a multidex app, the build tools perform complex decision making to determine which classes are needed in the primary DEX file so that your app can start successfully. If any class required during startup is not provided in the primary DEX file, then your app crashes with the error java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError. If you see the java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError error, then you must manually specify these additional classes as required in the primary DEX file: Create a proguard.multidex.config file within the /app folder of your project. Update mypackage to reflect your package name. #################### # keep class names # #################### #Keep New Relic in the main dex -keep class com.newrelic.** { *; } -keep class com.mypackage.activities.** { *; } Copy Merge the following code into the app-level build.gradle file: android { defaultConfig{ … multiDexKeepProguard file(\"proguard.multidex.config\") } } Copy For more information, see the Android Developers documentation on declaring classes required in the primary DEX file. New Relic Gradle Plugin configuration For details on how to configure the behavior of the mobile monitoring agent plugin during Gradle builds, see the New Relic Gradle plugin extension guide.",

With the Android agent version 5.17.0 and higher, you can use New Relic to detect and instrument all feature modules for an instant app. Use this documentation along with the standard New Relic procedures to install Android apps with Gradle and Android Studio. After following the standard installation procedures, follow these additional steps for Android instant apps. Terminology This procedure uses the following terms that are specific to the Android Instant Apps plugin: Module: Any packaged class and/or resource collection APK: A module that packages the apps resources and DEX’ed classes Feature module: A slimmed down module that contains only a subset of the total APK Install the plugin To install the New Relic plugin for Android Instant Apps: First follow the steps in the Install Android apps with Gradle and Android Studio documentation. Apply the agent plugin in every project Gradle build file. List the Android agent as a dependency. Start the agent from each Activity class in the feature that could be side-loaded through a Digital Asset Link intent, (for example, mobile.example.com/signin). Minimal build.gradle example apply plugin: ‘com.android.[application|library|feature|instantapp]' apply plugin: ‘newrelic’ dependencies { implementation \"com.newrelic.agent.android:android-agent:${project.agentVersion}\" } Copy Review the considerations for instrumentation. Instrumentation When instrumenting an instant app, be aware of the following considerations with APKs: Instant apps and APKs Comments Instrumentation Instrumentation of instant apps behaves the same as instrumentation with a normal APK. The agent will detect when an APK is an instant app. For feature APKs, the agent will inject a unique build ID that instant apps will use when reporting crashes. The side-loaded (main) activity of every feature must call NewRelic.start() when the activity is created (as per normal instructions). ProGuard and Dexguard support for feature and application APKs Place the newrelic.properties file in the root (main) directory of the project. ProGuard and Dexguard support The Android Studio Gradle plugin will obfuscate any build configuration where minifyEnabled is set to true. In these conditions, the New Relic agent will forward the ProGuard map generated for the build to crash collectors, tagged with a unique build ID generated by the agent. Obfuscation is best configured in the application or instant app project that includes other modules as dependencies. Modules may configure ProGuard as needed. Important When using ProGuard or DexGuard with Android apps, follow the procedures to complete the additional, required configuration steps. For more information, see the ProGuard and DexGuard configuration documentation. Troubleshoot auto-instrumentation If you are not whether the agent is auto-instrumenting an instant app project, try running these steps: Build app with debug (-d, --debug) option, and capture the build log. Search the log for evidence of instant apps by looking for either of these terms: This appears to be an Instant App Copy BuildId[1a2b34c5-def6-7890-g123-h4567890a] Copy The agent will add an attribute named 'instantApp' to the app's Insights session attributes if the app appears to be an instant app.",

      "body": "Mobile monitoring has an HTTP requests UI page that helps you better understand HTTP requests associated with your mobile app and how those network calls are affecting performance. This document describes the Enterprise-level HTTP requests page. Non-Enterprise accounts will see the legacy HTTP requests page. Find and use HTTP requests page To view mobile monitoring's HTTP requests page: Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Network > HTTP requests. Use our standard page functions to look for trends in the HTTP analysis charts. Target specific request and response attributes by grouping, sorting, and filtering the data. Understand HTTP request data Here are some places to find the most important HTTP request information: Response time chart The response time chart shows how your app's network calls are performing across percentiles. Use it to compare the average response time to the 1st, 50th, and 99th percentile. Percentiles let you filter out outliers that may be making your average response time higher than expected. HTTP errors and network failures chart This chart shows the unsuccessful network calls your app is experiencing. Select the chart title to go to the HTTP errors page for more detail on the errors and failures. Total requests Sort by Total requests to identify which network requests are being used most frequently. The reason this can be helpful is because your slowest network calls may be only infrequently used, while more frequently used requests might be more worthy of optimization even if they are not the slowest. For a description of the non-Enterprise HTTP requests UI page, see Legacy HTTP requests. Group, sort, and filter HTTP requests If you want to... Do this... Group and sort HTTP requests in different ways Make selections from the Group by and Sort by dropdowns. By default, the HTTP requests page is grouped by request domain and sorted by average response time. Filter for specific HTTP requests Select an HTTP request from the Errors and failures list and/or select multiple filters from the Filter dropdown. See or remove applied filters The filters you select are displayed next to the filter dropdown. To clear filters, select the X icon on the filter you want to clear.

To ensure data privacy, and to limit the types of information New Relic receives, no customer data is captured except what you supply in API calls or log forwarder configuration. All data for the logs service is then reported to New Relic over HTTPS. This document describes additional security considerations for your logging data. For more information about New Relic's security measures: See our security and privacy documentation. Visit the New Relic security website. Read this blog post that explains how you can use our log management tools to gain visibility into some of the most severe threats to modern digital businesses. Automatic obfuscation The log management service automatically masks number patterns that appear to be for items such as credit cards or Social Security numbers. All integers, including spaces and hyphens that may be used as delimiters, are replaced with a string of Xes. Numbers that appear to be a credit card (thirteen to sixteen digits) are obfuscated as XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX. For example: Numbers with hyphens, such as 4111-1111-1111-1111 Numbers with spaces, such as 4111 1111 1111 1111 Numbers with thirteen (Visa), fourteen (Diner's Club), fifteen (American Express, JCB), or sixteen digits (Visa, Mastercard, Discover, JCB), such as 4111111111111111 Nine-digit numbers with hyphens that appear to be Social Security numbers, such as 123-45-6789, are obfuscated as XXXXXXXXX. Nine-digit numbers with spaces, such as 123 45 6789, or hyphens in a different pattern, such as 12-345-67-89, are not automatically obfuscated. If you need to opt out of automatic obfuscation, get support at support.newrelic.com. Customize your security settings The data you send to New Relic, including any additional filtering, is controlled by the configuration of the log forwarder you use. You control what customer data is logged, so be sure to follow your organization's security guidelines to mask, obfuscate, or prevent sending any sensitive data.",

      "body": "As applications move towards the cloud, microservices architecture is becoming more dispersed, making the ability to monitor logs essential. New Relic offers a fast, scalable log management platform so you can connect your logs with the rest of your telemetry and infrastructure data in a single place. Our log management solution provides deeper visibility into application and infrastructure performance data (events and errors) to reduce mean-time-to-resolve (MTTR) and quickly troubleshoot production incidents. It does this by providing super-fast searching capabilities, alerts, and co-location of application, infrastructure, and log data, while visualizing everything from a single place. Find problems faster, reduce context switching Log management provides a way to connect your log data with the rest of your application and infrastructure data, allowing you to get to the root cause of problems quickly, without losing context switching between tools. Log management features include: Instantly search through your logs. Visualize your log data directly from the Logs UI. Use logging data to create custom charts, dashboards, and alerts. Troubleshoot performance issues without switching between tools. Bring in your logging data To bring your log data into New Relic, you can: Use our infrastructure monitoring agent as a lightweight data collector, without having to install additional software. Select from a wide range of log forwarding plugins, including Amazon, Microsoft, Fluentd, Fluent Bit, Kubernetes, Logstash, and more. Use our OpenTelemetry solutions. Send your log data by using the Log API or TCP endpoint. Once log management is enabled, you can also connect your logs with your APM agent, Kubernetes clusters, or distributed tracing to get additional contextual logging data with our logs in context extensions. View your logging data in New Relic You can explore your logging data in the UI or by API: Logs UI at one.newrelic.com Logs UI for EU region data center if applicable: one.eu.newrelic.com You can also query the Log data type. For example, use NRQL to run: SELECT * FROM Log Copy You can also use NerdGraph, our GraphQL-format API, to request the exact data you need.

      "body": "New Relic has several different APIs that use different API keys. This resource explains our keys, what they're used for, and how to access them. API key UI Most of the keys can be viewed and managed via the API keys UI page: From the account dropdown, click API keys (get a direct link to the API keys page). If you're using NerdGraph, you can manage license keys and user keys from our GraphiQL explorer. Overview of keys If you're using a specific API, see the docs for that API to understand which keys are required and recommended. To learn about our APIs, see Introduction to APIs. Our keys can be broken down into two categories: Keys used for data ingest Keys used for querying and configuration Keys for data ingest There are many ways to get data into New Relic. Here are the API keys used for data ingest: License key: our primary ingest key, used for APM ingest, infrastructure monitoring ingest, and our ingest APIs and the integrations that use them. Browser key: used for browser monitoring ingest. Mobile app token: used for mobile monitoring ingest. Insights insert key: an older key that has been mostly deprecated, it has the same functionality as the license key. We recommend using the license key instead. Keys for querying and configuration Here are keys used for querying New Relic data or configuration of features: User key, also known as a \"personal API key\": used for NerdGraph (our GraphQL API) and for accessing REST API endpoints. REST API key: used for the REST API but we instead recommend using the user key because it has fewer restrictions. Insights query key: used with the Insights query API for querying New Relic data. We recommend using NerdGraph instead of this API. License key Our primary key used for data ingest is called the license key, also referenced in the UI and NerdGraph API as ingest - license. The license key is a 40-character hexadecimal string associated with a New Relic account. Each account in a New Relic organization has its own license key. When you first sign up for New Relic, that creates an organization with a single account, and that account has its own license key. If more accounts are added, each account will have its own license key. The types of data ingest the license key is used for include: APM agent data Infrastructure agent data Data sent via our core data ingest APIs (Metric API, Trace API, Event API, Log API), and the SDKs and integrations that use those APIs The license key is used for all data ingest except for browser monitoring data (which uses a browser key) and mobile monitoring data (which uses a mobile app token). Because the license key is used for data ingest, we recommend you treat your license key securely, like you would a password. This ensures no unwanted data is sent to your New Relic account. If your license key falls into the wrong hands, an attacker could send fake data to your account, which could trigger false alerts and contaminate your data so that detecting actual issues is more difficult. If you believe a license key has been exposed and has led to unwanted data, work with our Support team. View and manage license key To manage the license key: From the account dropdown, click API keys (get a direct link to the API keys page). You can't manage or delete the original license key that was created when an account was initially created. For that, contact New Relic support. You can also create additional license keys and manage them with our NerdGraph API. User key New Relic user keys, sometimes referred to as \"personal API keys\", are required for using NerdGraph and for the REST API. A user key is tied to both a specific New Relic user and a specific account. Our APIs that use this key let a user make queries for any accounts that user has been granted access to. To view and manage the user key and other API keys in the UI: From the account dropdown, click API keys (here's a direct link to the API keys page). To manage this key via API, see Manage keys with NerdGraph. You can also get or generate a user key from the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Browser key One of the New Relic API keys that are used for data ingest is the browser key. The browser key allows the ingestion of data from New Relic browser monitoring. To view and manage this key: From the account dropdown, click API keys (here's a direct link to the API keys page). You can't manage or delete an original browser key that was created when your account was created. For that, contact New Relic support. Insights insert key Important This key is still in use but we highly recommend using the license key, which can be used for the same things and more. One of the New Relic API keys used for data ingest is the Insights insert key, also known as an \"insert key\"). Note that the license key is used for the same functionality and more, which is why we recommend the license key over this key. This key is used for the ingestion of data via our Event API, Log API, Metric API, and Trace API, or via tools that use those APIs. Tips on availability and access: Because these keys are associated with an account and not a specific user, anyone in the account with access to a key can use it. As a best practice for security purposes, we recommend you use different Insights insert keys for different applications or different data sources. To find and manage Insights insert keys: From the account dropdown, click API keys (get a direct link to the API keys page). Then click Insights insert keys. REST API key Important We highly recommend using a user key instead, because that key has fewer restrictions. The REST API key is for using our REST APIs for Alerts, APM, browser, infrastructure alerts, as well as mobile monitoring REST APIs and the API Explorer. Things to consider: We recommend using our newer NerdGraph API over the REST API, if possible. Requires admin-level user permissions. If you don't have access to the REST API key or the REST API explorer, it might be due to lack of permissions. Talk to your New Relic account manager, or use a user key instead. Each New Relic account can have only one REST API key. To find and manage REST API keys: From the account dropdown, click API keys (get a direct link to the API keys page). Then click REST API key. Before you configure or delete an API key, ensure you are doing so for the correct account. Insights query key The Insights query key is used for our Insights query API: we now recommend using NerdGraph for querying New Relic data. To find and manage Insights query keys: From the account dropdown, click API keys (get a direct link to the API keys page). Then click Insights query keys. Admin key Important As of December 4, 2020, all existing admin keys have been migrated to be user keys. You don’t need to do anything for existing admin keys to remain active. They will be automatically accessible via the API keys UI, labeled as user keys, and granted identical permissions. You can manage them as you would any user key via the same workflow. All migrated admin keys will have a note that says “Migrated from an admin user key” in the key table, so you’ll be able to find them easily. Account ID Looking for the account ID? See Account ID.",

      "body": "Your app's dSYM files are stored in Xcode's dSYM archive path folder. This is the folder where the iOS agent gets the dSYM files that are used to symbolicate your crash reports. New Relic provides a post-build script as part of the iOS agent's install process and the tvOS agent's install process. This script automatically uploads your app's dSYM files. Automatic script The script automatically uploads dSYM files only for release builds. Non-release builds must upload their files either manually or through the mobile monitoring UI. Bitcode-enabled apps have their dSYM files generated by Apple. You must download the dSYM files for Bitcode-enabled apps from Apple and upload them to New Relic. If you see unreadable machine code in the Crashes page, your dSYM files may not be uploaded correctly. In some cases, you may need to manually upload dSYM files. The automatic script uses Python 2. As of October 2019 with macOS 10.15 (Catalina), Python won't be installed by default. If you're using the automatic script (recommended), you may need to manually install Python 2. If you're using Homebrew, see Python on Homebrew. Identify missing dSYMs When a Bitcode-enabled app is uploaded to Apple for App Store review or ad-hoc distribution, dSYMs need to be manually downloaded from Apple and uploaded to New Relic to allow the mobile crash reports to be properly symbolicated. These dSYMs can be downloaded through the archives organizer in Xcode within several minutes of uploading the app. In this situation follow the procedures to find the archive and download dSYMs. If an app is missing a dSYM file, you'll see three indicators in the mobile monitoring UI: Banner notification: A banner warning appears on the Crash report page. The warning reads: We were unable to locate your dsym. Copy Upload prompt: From the Crash type summary page you will be automatically prompted to upload a dSYM file if it is missing. Machine code: The crash stack trace on the Crash report page displays machine code and not a human-readable error message. Upload dSYM files through the mobile monitoring UI You can easily upload your dSYM files directly from the New Relic One UI. The maximum file size is 600 MB. To upload your dSYM files: Go to one.newrelic.com and click Mobile. Then select your app from the list. View Crash analysis. Select a specific crash from the Crash types list. Click Upload dSYM. You can either drag and drop your dSYMs directly, or select the file form your computer. Manually upload dSYM files In some circumstances, New Relic's automatic upload of dSYM files may fail. If a dSYM upload is attempted and fails, it creates a build error with a detailed message. For example, if there's a network failure and the dSYM upload isn't completed, Xcode will report an error. For additional information about how New Relic handles dSYM uploads, see New Relic's Online Technical Community. If the automatic upload fails, you can manually upload your dSYM file. If you have multiple dSYM files, they can be within a single zip with a maximum file size of 600 MB. The YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APPLICATION_TOKEN value in the commands below is the same key used for +[NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:] (in Objective-C) or NewRelic.start(withApplicationToken:) (in Swift). To manually upload your dSYM files: Via Python script (agent versions 6.0.0 or higher) In iOS agent versions 6.0.0 or higher, the agent includes a Python script that automatically processes and uploads symbols. You can call this script from the command line: NewRelicAgent.framework/Resources/generateMap.py \"DSYM_ARCHIVE_PATH\" \"YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APPLICATION_TOKEN\" Copy Via command line To manually upload individual dSYM files from the command line: Zip up your dSYM file or files using the following command. Replace ~ /ZIPPED_DSYM_PATH with your new dSYM archive path and file name (for example, Users/my-name/desktop). Also replace ~ /dSYM_PATH with your existing dSYM file path. /usr/bin/zip --recurse-paths --quiet \"~/ZIPPED_DSYM_PATH\" \"~/dSYM_PATH\" Copy Upload the dSYM zip file using the following command: For US accounts: curl -F dsym=@\"~/DSYM_ZIP_PATH\" -H \"X-APP-LICENSE-KEY: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APPLICATION_TOKEN\" https://mobile-symbol-upload.newrelic.com/symbol Copy For EU accounts: curl -F dsym=@\"~/DSYM_ZIP_PATH\" -H \"X-APP-LICENSE-KEY: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APPLICATION_TOKEN\" https://mobile-symbol-upload.eu01.nr-data.net/symbol Copy Troubleshooting Auto-upload failure If a dSYM auto-upload failed, the Report Navigator may have a fully formed cURL command. You can use this cURL command to reattempt an upload. Depending on the error, you may also need to follow some of the dSYM manual upload steps. Here is an example of a successful dSYM upload in the Report Navigator: Example: A successful dSYM upload in the Report Navigator. Missing dSYMs If dSYM files are missing, you may need to check Xcode build settings to ensure the file is being generated. Frameworks which are built locally have separate build settings and may need to be updated as well.

Install your iOS application As part of the installation process, New Relic automatically generates an application token. This is a 40-character hexadecimal string for authenticating each mobile app you monitor in New Relic. To install and configure your iOS application: Go to one.newrelic.com. If applicable: From the Mobile Apps list, select Add a new app. From the Get Started page, select iOS as the platform for mobile monitoring. Type a name for your mobile app, then select Continue. If your installation does not automatically include the prefix header, follow the steps to add the prefix header to your project. Continue with the steps to configure New Relic for mobile monitoring. Configure using Objective-C These procedures to configure your iOS app with CocoaPods and Objective-C also appear on the Get Started page in New Relic. In the Podfile for your project, add the following line: pod 'NewRelicAgent' Copy Close your project in Xcode, and update it by running this command from the Terminal in your project directory: pod install Copy Open your project in Xcode by running this command from the Terminal in your project directory: open App.xcworkspace Copy In your APP_NAME-Prefix.pch project file (generally found in the Supporting Files folder), include the New Relic header inside the #ifdef __OBJC__ #endif block: #import <NewRelic/NewRelic.h> Copy In your AppDelegate.m file, add this call as the first line of application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions, replacing APP_TOKEN with your application token: [NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:@\"APP_TOKEN\"]; Copy Important The agent must be on the first line of didFinishLaunchingWithOptions and run on the main thread to ensure proper instrumentation.

For more about this process, see Apple's Bitcode and app thinning documentation. When Apple compiles an app, the dSYM files are also compiled. For New Relic to be able to symbolicate crashes of your Bitcode-enabled app, these dSYM files need to be downloaded from Apple and then uploaded to New Relic. Identify missing dSYMs When a Bitcode-enabled app is uploaded to Apple for App Store review or ad-hoc distribution, dSYMs need to be manually downloaded from Apple and uploaded to New Relic to allow the mobile crash reports to be properly symbolicated. These dSYMs can be downloaded through the archives organizer in Xcode within several minutes of uploading the app. In this situation follow the procedures to find the archive and download dSYMs. If an app is missing a dSYM file, you'll see three indicators in the mobile monitoring UI: Banner notification: A banner warning appears on the Crash report page. The warning reads: We were unable to locate your dsym. Copy Upload prompt: from the Crash type summary page you will be automatically prompted to upload a dSYM file if it is missing. Machine code: The crash stack trace on the Crash report page displays machine code and not a human-readable error message. Download dSYM files using iTunes Connect To download the dSYM files you need for your app: Log in to Apple iTunes Connect. Select My Apps > (selected app) > Activity.

Then, to upload the resulting zip file directly to New Relic: Follow the instructions to manually upload dSYM, and skip step 1. Unpack one dSYM contained in this zip file to retrieve a build UUID that you can upload. (Follow the last step in the manual upload instructions.) Once New Relic receives the zip file, the build UUIDs for all other dSYMs contained in that zip file will be identified. Download dSYM files using Xcode's app archive Use the app version and build number to identify the applicable app archive in the Xcode Organizer and download the dSYMs. Using Xcode to download dSYMs: From the Archives tab, select the app and version/build, then select Download dSYMs. Open the Xcode Organizer: From the Xcode menu, select Window > Organizer > Archives > (select a mobile app). From Version, select the archive that matches the app version (listed first) and build number (following the app version in parentheses). Select Download dSYMs. The dSYMs will be downloaded from Apple if available and if the file names contain a series of letters and numbers.

New Relic provides a post-build script as part of the iOS agent's install process and the tvOS agent's install process. This script automatically uploads your app's dSYM files. Automatic script The script automatically uploads dSYM files only for release builds. Non-release builds must upload their files either manually or through the mobile monitoring UI. Bitcode-enabled apps have their dSYM files generated by Apple. You must download the dSYM files for Bitcode-enabled apps from Apple and upload them to New Relic. If you see unreadable machine code in the Crashes page, your dSYM files may not be uploaded correctly. In some cases, you may need to manually upload dSYM files. The automatic script uses Python 2. As of October 2019 with macOS 10.15 (Catalina), Python won't be installed by default. If you're using the automatic script (recommended), you may need to manually install Python 2. If you're using Homebrew, see Python on Homebrew. Identify missing dSYMs When a Bitcode-enabled app is uploaded to Apple for App Store review or ad-hoc distribution, dSYMs need to be manually downloaded from Apple and uploaded to New Relic to allow the mobile crash reports to be properly symbolicated.

Upload dSYM files through the mobile monitoring UI You can easily upload your dSYM files directly from the New Relic One UI. The maximum file size is 600 MB. To upload your dSYM files: Go to one.newrelic.com and click Mobile. Then select your app from the list. View Crash analysis. Select a specific crash from the Crash types list. Click Upload dSYM. You can either drag and drop your dSYMs directly, or select the file form your computer. Manually upload dSYM files In some circumstances, New Relic's automatic upload of dSYM files may fail. If a dSYM upload is attempted and fails, it creates a build error with a detailed message. For example, if there's a network failure and the dSYM upload isn't completed, Xcode will report an error. For additional information about how New Relic handles dSYM uploads, see New Relic's Online Technical Community. If the automatic upload fails, you can manually upload your dSYM file. If you have multiple dSYM files, they can be within a single zip with a maximum file size of 600 MB. The YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APPLICATION_TOKEN value in the commands below is the same key used for +[NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:] (in Objective-C) or NewRelic.start(withApplicationToken:) (in Swift). To manually upload your dSYM files: Via Python script (agent versions 6.0.0 or higher) In iOS agent versions 6.0.0 or higher, the agent includes a Python script that automatically processes and uploads symbols. You can call this script from the command line: NewRelicAgent.framework/Resources/generateMap.py \"DSYM_ARCHIVE_PATH\" \"YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APPLICATION_TOKEN\" Copy Via command line To manually upload individual dSYM files from the command line: Zip up your dSYM file or files using the following command. Replace ~ /ZIPPED_DSYM_PATH with your new dSYM archive path and file name (for example, Users/my-name/desktop). Also replace ~ /dSYM_PATH with your existing dSYM file path. /usr/bin/zip --recurse-paths --quiet \"~/ZIPPED_DSYM_PATH\" \"~/dSYM_PATH\" Copy Upload the dSYM zip file using the following command: For US accounts: curl -F dsym=@\"~/DSYM_ZIP_PATH\" -H \"X-APP-LICENSE-KEY: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APPLICATION_TOKEN\" https://mobile-symbol-upload.newrelic.com/symbol Copy For EU accounts: curl -F dsym=@\"~/DSYM_ZIP_PATH\" -H \"X-APP-LICENSE-KEY: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APPLICATION_TOKEN\" https://mobile-symbol-upload.eu01.nr-data.net/symbol Copy Troubleshooting Auto-upload failure If a dSYM auto-upload failed, the Report Navigator may have a fully formed cURL command. You can use this cURL command to reattempt an upload. Depending on the error, you may also need to follow some of the dSYM manual upload steps. Here is an example of a successful dSYM upload in the Report Navigator: Example: A successful dSYM upload in the Report Navigator.

Description By default, the iOS agent collects a maximum of 1000 events per harvest cycle. This method controls the maximum size of the event pool stored in the memory until the next harvest cycle. When the pool size limit is reached, the New Relic Android agent will begin sampling events, discarding some old and some new events, until the pool of events are transmitted with the next harvest cycle. This method lets you override the maximum size of that event pool. You must set this value after Agent.start() is called. The default value for the event harvest cycle is 600 seconds.

      "body": "Your app's dSYM files are stored in Xcode's dSYM archive path folder. This is the folder where the iOS agent gets the dSYM files that are used to symbolicate your crash reports. New Relic provides a post-build script as part of the iOS agent's install process and the tvOS agent's install process. This script automatically uploads your app's dSYM files. Automatic script The script automatically uploads dSYM files only for release builds. Non-release builds must upload their files either manually or through the mobile monitoring UI. Bitcode-enabled apps have their dSYM files generated by Apple. You must download the dSYM files for Bitcode-enabled apps from Apple and upload them to New Relic. If you see unreadable machine code in the Crashes page, your dSYM files may not be uploaded correctly. In some cases, you may need to manually upload dSYM files. The automatic script uses Python 2. As of October 2019 with macOS 10.15 (Catalina), Python won't be installed by default. If you're using the automatic script (recommended), you may need to manually install Python 2. If you're using Homebrew, see Python on Homebrew. Identify missing dSYMs When a Bitcode-enabled app is uploaded to Apple for App Store review or ad-hoc distribution, dSYMs need to be manually downloaded from Apple and uploaded to New Relic to allow the mobile crash reports to be properly symbolicated. These dSYMs can be downloaded through the archives organizer in Xcode within several minutes of uploading the app. In this situation follow the procedures to find the archive and download dSYMs. If an app is missing a dSYM file, you'll see three indicators in the mobile monitoring UI: Banner notification: A banner warning appears on the Crash report page. The warning reads: We were unable to locate your dsym. Copy Upload prompt: From the Crash type summary page you will be automatically prompted to upload a dSYM file if it is missing. Machine code: The crash stack trace on the Crash report page displays machine code and not a human-readable error message. Upload dSYM files through the mobile monitoring UI You can easily upload your dSYM files directly from the New Relic One UI. The maximum file size is 600 MB. To upload your dSYM files: Go to one.newrelic.com and click Mobile. Then select your app from the list. View Crash analysis. Select a specific crash from the Crash types list. Click Upload dSYM. You can either drag and drop your dSYMs directly, or select the file form your computer. Manually upload dSYM files In some circumstances, New Relic's automatic upload of dSYM files may fail. If a dSYM upload is attempted and fails, it creates a build error with a detailed message. For example, if there's a network failure and the dSYM upload isn't completed, Xcode will report an error. For additional information about how New Relic handles dSYM uploads, see New Relic's Online Technical Community. If the automatic upload fails, you can manually upload your dSYM file. If you have multiple dSYM files, they can be within a single zip with a maximum file size of 600 MB. The YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APPLICATION_TOKEN value in the commands below is the same key used for +[NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:] (in Objective-C) or NewRelic.start(withApplicationToken:) (in Swift). To manually upload your dSYM files: Via Python script (agent versions 6.0.0 or higher) In iOS agent versions 6.0.0 or higher, the agent includes a Python script that automatically processes and uploads symbols. You can call this script from the command line: NewRelicAgent.framework/Resources/generateMap.py \"DSYM_ARCHIVE_PATH\" \"YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APPLICATION_TOKEN\" Copy Via command line To manually upload individual dSYM files from the command line: Zip up your dSYM file or files using the following command.

In the Podfile for your project, add the following line: pod 'NewRelicAgent' Copy Close your project in Xcode, and update it by running this command from the Terminal in your project directory: pod install Copy Open your project in Xcode by running this command from the Terminal in your project directory: open App.xcworkspace Copy In your APP_NAME-Prefix.pch project file (generally found in the Supporting Files folder), include the New Relic header inside the #ifdef __OBJC__ #endif block: #import <NewRelic/NewRelic.h> Copy In your AppDelegate.m file, add this call as the first line of application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions, replacing APP_TOKEN with your application token: [NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:@\"APP_TOKEN\"]; Copy Important The agent must be on the first line of didFinishLaunchingWithOptions and run on the main thread to ensure proper instrumentation. Starting the call later, on a background thread, or asynchronously can cause unexpected or unstable behavior. Add a build script to your target's Build Phases. Ensure the new build script is the very last build script. Then paste the following, replacing APP_TOKEN with your application token: SCRIPT=`/usr/bin/find \"${SRCROOT}\" -name newrelic_postbuild.sh | head -n 1` /bin/sh \"${SCRIPT}\" \"APP_TOKEN\" Copy Clean and build your app, then run it in the simulator or other device. Configure using Swift These procedures to configure your iOS app with CocoaPods and Swift also appear on the Get Started page in New Relic. In the Podfile for your project, add the following line: pod 'NewRelicAgent' Copy Close your project in Xcode, and update it by running this command from the Terminal in your project directory: pod install Copy Open your project in Xcode by running this command from the Terminal in your project directory: open App.xcworkspace Copy Create a bridging header: Select File > New > File > Objective-C File. Name the file Placeholder.m, then select Next. Select Create, and confirm Xcode's prompt to generate the bridging header. In your APP_NAME-Bridging-Header.h, add the New Relic header: #import \"NewRelic/NewRelic.h\" Copy In your AppDelegate.swift file, add this call as the first line of application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions, replacing APP_TOKEN with your application token: NewRelic.start(withApplicationToken:\"APP_TOKEN\") Copy Important To ensure proper instrumentation, you must call the agent on the first line of didFinishLaunchingWithOptions(), and run the agent on the main thread. Starting the call later, on a background thread, or asynchronously can cause unexpected or unstable behavior. Add a build script to your target's Build Phases.

For more about this process, see Apple's Bitcode and app thinning documentation. When Apple compiles an app, the dSYM files are also compiled. For New Relic to be able to symbolicate crashes of your Bitcode-enabled app, these dSYM files need to be downloaded from Apple and then uploaded to New Relic. Identify missing dSYMs When a Bitcode-enabled app is uploaded to Apple for App Store review or ad-hoc distribution, dSYMs need to be manually downloaded from Apple and uploaded to New Relic to allow the mobile crash reports to be properly symbolicated. These dSYMs can be downloaded through the archives organizer in Xcode within several minutes of uploading the app. In this situation follow the procedures to find the archive and download dSYMs. If an app is missing a dSYM file, you'll see three indicators in the mobile monitoring UI: Banner notification: A banner warning appears on the Crash report page. The warning reads: We were unable to locate your dsym. Copy Upload prompt: from the Crash type summary page you will be automatically prompted to upload a dSYM file if it is missing. Machine code: The crash stack trace on the Crash report page displays machine code and not a human-readable error message. Download dSYM files using iTunes Connect To download the dSYM files you need for your app: Log in to Apple iTunes Connect. Select My Apps > (selected app) > Activity. From the list of builds for your application, select the build number you need for the dSYM. Select Download dSYM. Then, to upload the resulting zip file directly to New Relic: Follow the instructions to manually upload dSYM, and skip step 1. Unpack one dSYM contained in this zip file to retrieve a build UUID that you can upload. (Follow the last step in the manual upload instructions.) Once New Relic receives the zip file, the build UUIDs for all other dSYMs contained in that zip file will be identified. Download dSYM files using Xcode's app archive Use the app version and build number to identify the applicable app archive in the Xcode Organizer and download the dSYMs. Using Xcode to download dSYMs: From the Archives tab, select the app and version/build, then select Download dSYMs. Open the Xcode Organizer: From the Xcode menu, select Window > Organizer > Archives > (select a mobile app). From Version, select the archive that matches the app version (listed first) and build number (following the app version in parentheses). Select Download dSYMs. The dSYMs will be downloaded from Apple if available and if the file names contain a series of letters and numbers. If the dSYM files are named after the the dependencies in your project, the download will not be successful. Upload dSYMs Once you have located the dSYMs, follow the instructions to upload a dSYM for each zipped dSYM.",

Description By default, the iOS agent collects a maximum of 1000 events per harvest cycle. This method controls the maximum size of the event pool stored in the memory until the next harvest cycle. When the pool size limit is reached, the New Relic Android agent will begin sampling events, discarding some old and some new events, until the pool of events are transmitted with the next harvest cycle.

DistributedTraceSummary MobileRequest MobileRequestError Span Transaction TransactionError InfrastructureEvent Data sources : InfrastructureCloudTrail InfrastructureEvent describes changes (deltas) that occur in a system's live state. When an inventory or system state is added, removed, or changed, Infrastructure will produce an InfrastructureEvent that logs that activity. Attribute name Definition Data types category A New Relic category used to organize events in the UI. For example: automation, notification, and service. InfrastructureEvent changeType A simple classification of the type of change made to the entity: added, modified, or removed. InfrastructureEvent changedPath The fully specified name of the item that changed. This is constructed by taking the source and adding one or more additional path elements that uniquely identify the item that changed. InfrastructureEvent deltaId Delta refers to a recorded change in the system. The deltaId is a number used by New Relic to organize incoming inventory change data. InfrastructureEvent eventId The unique ID of the event, generated by New Relic. InfrastructureEvent format The type of infrastructure event. Each format type includes attributes that may be used to render the event in the UI. InfrastructureEvent newStatus The new agent status: disconnected or connected. InfrastructureEvent newValue If a change is made to the entity, this attribute contains the new value of the inventory that was changed. This will have no value if no change has been made. The value will display approximately 4K bytes of data. InfrastructureEvent oldValue If a change is made to the entity, this attribute contains the old value of the inventory that was changed. This will be blank if no change has been made. InfrastructureEvent provider For integrations that use generic event types (like the DatastoreSample event), the provider value specifies the source of the data (the service, or a sub-category of data from that service). Some Insights events are generic and are used by several integrations. For example, the DatastoreSample event is used by several integrations, including the AWS DynamoDB integration and the AWS RDS integration. In these cases, the provider attribute value represents the source of that attribute. This will usually be the service that data comes from or, for integrations that use several provider values, a certain sub-category of data from that service. When a provider value is present for a generic event, that event will have additional integration-specific attributes attached to it. Here’s an example of an Insights NRQL query that returns the attributes present for a DatastoreSample event reported by the AWS RDS integration: SELECT * from DatastoreSample where provider = 'RdsDbCluster' InfrastructureEvent source The fully specified origin of this inventory item. This is typically in the form category/plugin, where plugin is the generic word used for the tool that gathered this data. InfrastructureEvent summary A summary of the change that happened. Uses a human-friendly string, such as Agent disconnected. InfrastructureEvent violationUpdateType The type of change to the violation: For example: open or closed.

      "body": "Your app's dSYM files are stored in Xcode's dSYM archive path folder. This is the folder where the iOS agent gets the dSYM files that are used to symbolicate your crash reports. New Relic provides a post-build script as part of the iOS agent's install process and the tvOS agent's install process. This script automatically uploads your app's dSYM files. Automatic script The script automatically uploads dSYM files only for release builds. Non-release builds must upload their files either manually or through the mobile monitoring UI. Bitcode-enabled apps have their dSYM files generated by Apple. You must download the dSYM files for Bitcode-enabled apps from Apple and upload them to New Relic. If you see unreadable machine code in the Crashes page, your dSYM files may not be uploaded correctly. In some cases, you may need to manually upload dSYM files. The automatic script uses Python 2. As of October 2019 with macOS 10.15 (Catalina), Python won't be installed by default. If you're using the automatic script (recommended), you may need to manually install Python 2. If you're using Homebrew, see Python on Homebrew. Identify missing dSYMs When a Bitcode-enabled app is uploaded to Apple for App Store review or ad-hoc distribution, dSYMs need to be manually downloaded from Apple and uploaded to New Relic to allow the mobile crash reports to be properly symbolicated. These dSYMs can be downloaded through the archives organizer in Xcode within several minutes of uploading the app. In this situation follow the procedures to find the archive and download dSYMs. If an app is missing a dSYM file, you'll see three indicators in the mobile monitoring UI: Banner notification: A banner warning appears on the Crash report page. The warning reads: We were unable to locate your dsym. Copy Upload prompt: From the Crash type summary page you will be automatically prompted to upload a dSYM file if it is missing. Machine code: The crash stack trace on the Crash report page displays machine code and not a human-readable error message. Upload dSYM files through the mobile monitoring UI You can easily upload your dSYM files directly from the New Relic One UI. The maximum file size is 600 MB. To upload your dSYM files: Go to one.newrelic.com and click Mobile. Then select your app from the list. View Crash analysis. Select a specific crash from the Crash types list. Click Upload dSYM. You can either drag and drop your dSYMs directly, or select the file form your computer. Manually upload dSYM files In some circumstances, New Relic's automatic upload of dSYM files may fail. If a dSYM upload is attempted and fails, it creates a build error with a detailed message. For example, if there's a network failure and the dSYM upload isn't completed, Xcode will report an error. For additional information about how New Relic handles dSYM uploads, see New Relic's Online Technical Community. If the automatic upload fails, you can manually upload your dSYM file. If you have multiple dSYM files, they can be within a single zip with a maximum file size of 600 MB. The YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APPLICATION_TOKEN value in the commands below is the same key used for +[NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:] (in Objective-C) or NewRelic.start(withApplicationToken:) (in Swift). To manually upload your dSYM files: Via Python script (agent versions 6.0.0 or higher) In iOS agent versions 6.0.0 or higher, the agent includes a Python script that automatically processes and uploads symbols. You can call this script from the command line: NewRelicAgent.framework/Resources/generateMap.py \"DSYM_ARCHIVE_PATH\" \"YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APPLICATION_TOKEN\" Copy Via command line To manually upload individual dSYM files from the command line: Zip up your dSYM file or files using the following command. Replace ~ /ZIPPED_DSYM_PATH with your new dSYM archive path and file name (for example, Users/my-name/desktop). Also replace ~ /dSYM_PATH with your existing dSYM file path. /usr/bin/zip --recurse-paths --quiet \"~/ZIPPED_DSYM_PATH\" \"~/dSYM_PATH\" Copy Upload the dSYM zip file using the following command: For US accounts: curl -F dsym=@\"~/DSYM_ZIP_PATH\" -H \"X-APP-LICENSE-KEY: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APPLICATION_TOKEN\" https://mobile-symbol-upload.newrelic.com/symbol Copy For EU accounts: curl -F dsym=@\"~/DSYM_ZIP_PATH\" -H \"X-APP-LICENSE-KEY: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APPLICATION_TOKEN\" https://mobile-symbol-upload.eu01.nr-data.net/symbol Copy Troubleshooting Auto-upload failure If a dSYM auto-upload failed, the Report Navigator may have a fully formed cURL command. You can use this cURL command to reattempt an upload. Depending on the error, you may also need to follow some of the dSYM manual upload steps. Here is an example of a successful dSYM upload in the Report Navigator: Example: A successful dSYM upload in the Report Navigator. Missing dSYMs If dSYM files are missing, you may need to check Xcode build settings to ensure the file is being generated. Frameworks which are built locally have separate build settings and may need to be updated as well.

      "body": "Your app's dSYM files are stored in Xcode's dSYM archive path folder. This is the folder where the iOS agent gets the dSYM files that are used to symbolicate your crash reports. New Relic provides a post-build script as part of the iOS agent's install process and the tvOS agent's install process. This script automatically uploads your app's dSYM files. Automatic script The script automatically uploads dSYM files only for release builds. Non-release builds must upload their files either manually or through the mobile monitoring UI. Bitcode-enabled apps have their dSYM files generated by Apple. You must download the dSYM files for Bitcode-enabled apps from Apple and upload them to New Relic. If you see unreadable machine code in the Crashes page, your dSYM files may not be uploaded correctly. In some cases, you may need to manually upload dSYM files. The automatic script uses Python 2. As of October 2019 with macOS 10.15 (Catalina), Python won't be installed by default. If you're using the automatic script (recommended), you may need to manually install Python 2. If you're using Homebrew, see Python on Homebrew. Identify missing dSYMs When a Bitcode-enabled app is uploaded to Apple for App Store review or ad-hoc distribution, dSYMs need to be manually downloaded from Apple and uploaded to New Relic to allow the mobile crash reports to be properly symbolicated. These dSYMs can be downloaded through the archives organizer in Xcode within several minutes of uploading the app. In this situation follow the procedures to find the archive and download dSYMs. If an app is missing a dSYM file, you'll see three indicators in the mobile monitoring UI: Banner notification: A banner warning appears on the Crash report page. The warning reads: We were unable to locate your dsym. Copy Upload prompt: From the Crash type summary page you will be automatically prompted to upload a dSYM file if it is missing. Machine code: The crash stack trace on the Crash report page displays machine code and not a human-readable error message. Upload dSYM files through the mobile monitoring UI You can easily upload your dSYM files directly from the New Relic One UI. The maximum file size is 600 MB. To upload your dSYM files: Go to one.newrelic.com and click Mobile. Then select your app from the list. View Crash analysis. Select a specific crash from the Crash types list. Click Upload dSYM. You can either drag and drop your dSYMs directly, or select the file form your computer. Manually upload dSYM files In some circumstances, New Relic's automatic upload of dSYM files may fail. If a dSYM upload is attempted and fails, it creates a build error with a detailed message. For example, if there's a network failure and the dSYM upload isn't completed, Xcode will report an error. For additional information about how New Relic handles dSYM uploads, see New Relic's Online Technical Community. If the automatic upload fails, you can manually upload your dSYM file. If you have multiple dSYM files, they can be within a single zip with a maximum file size of 600 MB. The YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APPLICATION_TOKEN value in the commands below is the same key used for +[NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:] (in Objective-C) or NewRelic.start(withApplicationToken:) (in Swift). To manually upload your dSYM files: Via Python script (agent versions 6.0.0 or higher) In iOS agent versions 6.0.0 or higher, the agent includes a Python script that automatically processes and uploads symbols. You can call this script from the command line: NewRelicAgent.framework/Resources/generateMap.py \"DSYM_ARCHIVE_PATH\" \"YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APPLICATION_TOKEN\" Copy Via command line To manually upload individual dSYM files from the command line: Zip up your dSYM file or files using the following command. Replace ~ /ZIPPED_DSYM_PATH with your new dSYM archive path and file name (for example, Users/my-name/desktop). Also replace ~ /dSYM_PATH with your existing dSYM file path. /usr/bin/zip --recurse-paths --quiet \"~/ZIPPED_DSYM_PATH\" \"~/dSYM_PATH\" Copy Upload the dSYM zip file using the following command: For US accounts: curl -F dsym=@\"~/DSYM_ZIP_PATH\" -H \"X-APP-LICENSE-KEY: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APPLICATION_TOKEN\" https://mobile-symbol-upload.newrelic.com/symbol Copy For EU accounts: curl -F dsym=@\"~/DSYM_ZIP_PATH\" -H \"X-APP-LICENSE-KEY: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APPLICATION_TOKEN\" https://mobile-symbol-upload.eu01.nr-data.net/symbol Copy Troubleshooting Auto-upload failure If a dSYM auto-upload failed, the Report Navigator may have a fully formed cURL command. You can use this cURL command to reattempt an upload. Depending on the error, you may also need to follow some of the dSYM manual upload steps. Here is an example of a successful dSYM upload in the Report Navigator: Example: A successful dSYM upload in the Report Navigator. Missing dSYMs If dSYM files are missing, you may need to check Xcode build settings to ensure the file is being generated. Frameworks which are built locally have separate build settings and may need to be updated as well.

When an iOS or tvOS application crashes, the operating system creates a crash report and stores it on the device. New Relic uploads this report the next time the app launches. Using this report and any relevant dSYM files, the crash report includes the complete stack trace with human-readable information. You can then log into New Relic and see each crash, including the method and line where it crashed, plus device and environment details. dSYM files When you create a release build of an iOS or tvOS application, the names of methods and classes are stripped, leaving only machine-readable memory addresses. When the application crashes, the stack trace consists of this machine-readable code. A dSYM file is an Xcode project file for debug symbols. It contains the debugging symbols that allow for translation of the initial crash report to human-readable information. This process is known as symbolication. New Relic has dynamic framework support for dSYM uploading. If your app uses a dynamic framework with multiple dSYM files, New Relic automatically uploads and uses those files. For more information, see Retrieve and download dSYMs or Upload dSYM files. Debug the crash reporter Crash reporting is enabled by default, but there are some circumstances where it will be disabled: If the debugger is enabled: There can only be one uncaught exception handler registered at a time per application. If running with the debugger attached, New Relic will not capture and report crashes.

When an iOS or tvOS application crashes, the operating system creates a crash report and stores it on the device. New Relic uploads this report the next time the app launches. Using this report and any relevant dSYM files, the crash report includes the complete stack trace with human-readable information. You can then log into New Relic and see each crash, including the method and line where it crashed, plus device and environment details. dSYM files When you create a release build of an iOS or tvOS application, the names of methods and classes are stripped, leaving only machine-readable memory addresses. When the application crashes, the stack trace consists of this machine-readable code. A dSYM file is an Xcode project file for debug symbols. It contains the debugging symbols that allow for translation of the initial crash report to human-readable information. This process is known as symbolication. New Relic has dynamic framework support for dSYM uploading. If your app uses a dynamic framework with multiple dSYM files, New Relic automatically uploads and uses those files. For more information, see Retrieve and download dSYMs or Upload dSYM files. Debug the crash reporter Crash reporting is enabled by default, but there are some circumstances where it will be disabled: If the debugger is enabled: There can only be one uncaught exception handler registered at a time per application. If running with the debugger attached, New Relic will not capture and report crashes. If another crash reporter is enabled: If another uncaught exception handler is registered after New Relic starts, this error message is logged: The New Relic exception handler has been replaced. This may result in crashes no longer reporting to New Relic.

      "body": "Your app's dSYM files are stored in Xcode's dSYM archive path folder. This is the folder where the iOS agent gets the dSYM files that are used to symbolicate your crash reports. New Relic provides a post-build script as part of the iOS agent's install process and the tvOS agent's install process. This script automatically uploads your app's dSYM files. Automatic script The script automatically uploads dSYM files only for release builds. Non-release builds must upload their files either manually or through the mobile monitoring UI. Bitcode-enabled apps have their dSYM files generated by Apple. You must download the dSYM files for Bitcode-enabled apps from Apple and upload them to New Relic. If you see unreadable machine code in the Crashes page, your dSYM files may not be uploaded correctly. In some cases, you may need to manually upload dSYM files. The automatic script uses Python 2. As of October 2019 with macOS 10.15 (Catalina), Python won't be installed by default. If you're using the automatic script (recommended), you may need to manually install Python 2. If you're using Homebrew, see Python on Homebrew. Identify missing dSYMs When a Bitcode-enabled app is uploaded to Apple for App Store review or ad-hoc distribution, dSYMs need to be manually downloaded from Apple and uploaded to New Relic to allow the mobile crash reports to be properly symbolicated. These dSYMs can be downloaded through the archives organizer in Xcode within several minutes of uploading the app. In this situation follow the procedures to find the archive and download dSYMs. If an app is missing a dSYM file, you'll see three indicators in the mobile monitoring UI: Banner notification: A banner warning appears on the Crash report page. The warning reads: We were unable to locate your dsym. Copy Upload prompt: From the Crash type summary page you will be automatically prompted to upload a dSYM file if it is missing. Machine code: The crash stack trace on the Crash report page displays machine code and not a human-readable error message. Upload dSYM files through the mobile monitoring UI You can easily upload your dSYM files directly from the New Relic One UI. The maximum file size is 600 MB. To upload your dSYM files: Go to one.newrelic.com and click Mobile. Then select your app from the list. View Crash analysis. Select a specific crash from the Crash types list. Click Upload dSYM. You can either drag and drop your dSYMs directly, or select the file form your computer. Manually upload dSYM files In some circumstances, New Relic's automatic upload of dSYM files may fail. If a dSYM upload is attempted and fails, it creates a build error with a detailed message. For example, if there's a network failure and the dSYM upload isn't completed, Xcode will report an error. For additional information about how New Relic handles dSYM uploads, see New Relic's Online Technical Community. If the automatic upload fails, you can manually upload your dSYM file. If you have multiple dSYM files, they can be within a single zip with a maximum file size of 600 MB. The YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APPLICATION_TOKEN value in the commands below is the same key used for +[NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:] (in Objective-C) or NewRelic.start(withApplicationToken:) (in Swift). To manually upload your dSYM files: Via Python script (agent versions 6.0.0 or higher) In iOS agent versions 6.0.0 or higher, the agent includes a Python script that automatically processes and uploads symbols. You can call this script from the command line: NewRelicAgent.framework/Resources/generateMap.py \"DSYM_ARCHIVE_PATH\" \"YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APPLICATION_TOKEN\" Copy Via command line To manually upload individual dSYM files from the command line: Zip up your dSYM file or files using the following command. Replace ~ /ZIPPED_DSYM_PATH with your new dSYM archive path and file name (for example, Users/my-name/desktop). Also replace ~ /dSYM_PATH with your existing dSYM file path. /usr/bin/zip --recurse-paths --quiet \"~/ZIPPED_DSYM_PATH\" \"~/dSYM_PATH\" Copy Upload the dSYM zip file using the following command: For US accounts: curl -F dsym=@\"~/DSYM_ZIP_PATH\" -H \"X-APP-LICENSE-KEY: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APPLICATION_TOKEN\" https://mobile-symbol-upload.newrelic.com/symbol Copy For EU accounts: curl -F dsym=@\"~/DSYM_ZIP_PATH\" -H \"X-APP-LICENSE-KEY: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APPLICATION_TOKEN\" https://mobile-symbol-upload.eu01.nr-data.net/symbol Copy Troubleshooting Auto-upload failure If a dSYM auto-upload failed, the Report Navigator may have a fully formed cURL command. You can use this cURL command to reattempt an upload. Depending on the error, you may also need to follow some of the dSYM manual upload steps. Here is an example of a successful dSYM upload in the Report Navigator: Example: A successful dSYM upload in the Report Navigator. Missing dSYMs If dSYM files are missing, you may need to check Xcode build settings to ensure the file is being generated. Frameworks which are built locally have separate build settings and may need to be updated as well.

      "body": "Your app's dSYM files are stored in Xcode's dSYM archive path folder. This is the folder where the iOS agent gets the dSYM files that are used to symbolicate your crash reports. New Relic provides a post-build script as part of the iOS agent's install process and the tvOS agent's install process. This script automatically uploads your app's dSYM files. Automatic script The script automatically uploads dSYM files only for release builds. Non-release builds must upload their files either manually or through the mobile monitoring UI. Bitcode-enabled apps have their dSYM files generated by Apple. You must download the dSYM files for Bitcode-enabled apps from Apple and upload them to New Relic. If you see unreadable machine code in the Crashes page, your dSYM files may not be uploaded correctly. In some cases, you may need to manually upload dSYM files. The automatic script uses Python 2. As of October 2019 with macOS 10.15 (Catalina), Python won't be installed by default. If you're using the automatic script (recommended), you may need to manually install Python 2. If you're using Homebrew, see Python on Homebrew. Identify missing dSYMs When a Bitcode-enabled app is uploaded to Apple for App Store review or ad-hoc distribution, dSYMs need to be manually downloaded from Apple and uploaded to New Relic to allow the mobile crash reports to be properly symbolicated. These dSYMs can be downloaded through the archives organizer in Xcode within several minutes of uploading the app. In this situation follow the procedures to find the archive and download dSYMs. If an app is missing a dSYM file, you'll see three indicators in the mobile monitoring UI: Banner notification: A banner warning appears on the Crash report page. The warning reads: We were unable to locate your dsym. Copy Upload prompt: From the Crash type summary page you will be automatically prompted to upload a dSYM file if it is missing. Machine code: The crash stack trace on the Crash report page displays machine code and not a human-readable error message. Upload dSYM files through the mobile monitoring UI You can easily upload your dSYM files directly from the New Relic One UI. The maximum file size is 600 MB. To upload your dSYM files: Go to one.newrelic.com and click Mobile. Then select your app from the list. View Crash analysis. Select a specific crash from the Crash types list. Click Upload dSYM. You can either drag and drop your dSYMs directly, or select the file form your computer. Manually upload dSYM files In some circumstances, New Relic's automatic upload of dSYM files may fail. If a dSYM upload is attempted and fails, it creates a build error with a detailed message. For example, if there's a network failure and the dSYM upload isn't completed, Xcode will report an error. For additional information about how New Relic handles dSYM uploads, see New Relic's Online Technical Community. If the automatic upload fails, you can manually upload your dSYM file. If you have multiple dSYM files, they can be within a single zip with a maximum file size of 600 MB. The YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APPLICATION_TOKEN value in the commands below is the same key used for +[NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:] (in Objective-C) or NewRelic.start(withApplicationToken:) (in Swift). To manually upload your dSYM files: Via Python script (agent versions 6.0.0 or higher) In iOS agent versions 6.0.0 or higher, the agent includes a Python script that automatically processes and uploads symbols. You can call this script from the command line: NewRelicAgent.framework/Resources/generateMap.py \"DSYM_ARCHIVE_PATH\" \"YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APPLICATION_TOKEN\" Copy Via command line To manually upload individual dSYM files from the command line: Zip up your dSYM file or files using the following command. Replace ~ /ZIPPED_DSYM_PATH with your new dSYM archive path and file name (for example, Users/my-name/desktop). Also replace ~ /dSYM_PATH with your existing dSYM file path. /usr/bin/zip --recurse-paths --quiet \"~/ZIPPED_DSYM_PATH\" \"~/dSYM_PATH\" Copy Upload the dSYM zip file using the following command: For US accounts: curl -F dsym=@\"~/DSYM_ZIP_PATH\" -H \"X-APP-LICENSE-KEY: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APPLICATION_TOKEN\" https://mobile-symbol-upload.newrelic.com/symbol Copy For EU accounts: curl -F dsym=@\"~/DSYM_ZIP_PATH\" -H \"X-APP-LICENSE-KEY: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APPLICATION_TOKEN\" https://mobile-symbol-upload.eu01.nr-data.net/symbol Copy Troubleshooting Auto-upload failure If a dSYM auto-upload failed, the Report Navigator may have a fully formed cURL command. You can use this cURL command to reattempt an upload. Depending on the error, you may also need to follow some of the dSYM manual upload steps. Here is an example of a successful dSYM upload in the Report Navigator: Example: A successful dSYM upload in the Report Navigator. Missing dSYMs If dSYM files are missing, you may need to check Xcode build settings to ensure the file is being generated.

Compatibility and requirements Before you install the iOS agent, review the compatibility and requirements. Install the agent As part of the installation process, New Relic automatically generates an application token. This is a 40-character hexadecimal string for authenticating each mobile app that you monitor. There are two ways you can install the iOS agent: We recommend you install and configure the iOS agent using the CocoaPods installation method. You can also manually install and configure the iOS agent by adding the New Relic framework to your app. Extend your instrumentation After you install the agent, you can extend the agent's default instrumentation with various types of custom data: To access: In the mobile UI: In New Relic One dashboards: Custom data Create and record custom events, interaction traces, and attributes to add details to your existing data and traces. You can also query the custom events that you created in New Relic One dashboards and NRQL. Network requests Enable the MobileRequest event feature so you can perform a full network analysis. To further investigate network request error rates and response times, query MobileRequest and MobileRequestError events. Crash analysis Review detailed information using groups and filters to analyze trends that lead to crashes. To view more information about crashes, create NRQL queries to review Insights charts related to crash data. iOS SDK API Use the iOS SDK API to instrument parts of your code that are not instrumented by default. Then, view those custom events and attributes in New Relic Insights. Handled exceptions Report exceptions so you can identify factors creating a poor mobile app experience. To further improve performance, review MobileHandledException event records in New Relic Insights. Breadcrumbs Boost the level of detail in crash event trails by adding breadcrumbs. Then, query MobileBreadcrumbs events to see all breadcrumbs or just breadcrumbs related to crashes.

Type a name for your mobile app, and select Continue. Continue with the steps to configure New Relic. Add the New Relic framework to your app Download and unzip the iOS SDK for New Relic. To add the New Relic framework to your Xcode project: Use Finder to drag the NewRelicAgent.framework folder into your Xcode project, and drop it onto your project in the Project navigator window, under Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content. Make sure Embed & Sign is selected under the Embed dropdown menu. Implement the agent using the appropriate method: Important To ensure proper instrumentation, you must call the agent on the first line of didFinishLaunchingWithOptions(), and run the agent on the main thread. Starting the call later, on a background thread, or asynchronously can cause unexpected or unstable behavior. Language Procedure Objective-C To start the agent: Import the New Relic header at the top of your prefix.pch. Add +[NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:@\"<appToken>\"] to the top of -application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: in your AppDelegate.m, using the unique application token that is automatically generated. Swift Create a bridging header file: Select File > New > File > Objective-C File. Name the file Placeholder.m, then select Next. Select Create, and confirm Xcode's prompt to generate the bridging header. Delete Placeholder.m.

      "body": "Your app's dSYM files are stored in Xcode's dSYM archive path folder. This is the folder where the iOS agent gets the dSYM files that are used to symbolicate your crash reports. New Relic provides a post-build script as part of the iOS agent's install process and the tvOS agent's install process. This script automatically uploads your app's dSYM files. Automatic script The script automatically uploads dSYM files only for release builds. Non-release builds must upload their files either manually or through the mobile monitoring UI. Bitcode-enabled apps have their dSYM files generated by Apple. You must download the dSYM files for Bitcode-enabled apps from Apple and upload them to New Relic. If you see unreadable machine code in the Crashes page, your dSYM files may not be uploaded correctly. In some cases, you may need to manually upload dSYM files. The automatic script uses Python 2. As of October 2019 with macOS 10.15 (Catalina), Python won't be installed by default. If you're using the automatic script (recommended), you may need to manually install Python 2. If you're using Homebrew, see Python on Homebrew. Identify missing dSYMs When a Bitcode-enabled app is uploaded to Apple for App Store review or ad-hoc distribution, dSYMs need to be manually downloaded from Apple and uploaded to New Relic to allow the mobile crash reports to be properly symbolicated. These dSYMs can be downloaded through the archives organizer in Xcode within several minutes of uploading the app. In this situation follow the procedures to find the archive and download dSYMs. If an app is missing a dSYM file, you'll see three indicators in the mobile monitoring UI: Banner notification: A banner warning appears on the Crash report page. The warning reads: We were unable to locate your dsym. Copy Upload prompt: From the Crash type summary page you will be automatically prompted to upload a dSYM file if it is missing. Machine code: The crash stack trace on the Crash report page displays machine code and not a human-readable error message. Upload dSYM files through the mobile monitoring UI You can easily upload your dSYM files directly from the New Relic One UI. The maximum file size is 600 MB. To upload your dSYM files: Go to one.newrelic.com and click Mobile. Then select your app from the list. View Crash analysis. Select a specific crash from the Crash types list. Click Upload dSYM. You can either drag and drop your dSYMs directly, or select the file form your computer. Manually upload dSYM files In some circumstances, New Relic's automatic upload of dSYM files may fail. If a dSYM upload is attempted and fails, it creates a build error with a detailed message. For example, if there's a network failure and the dSYM upload isn't completed, Xcode will report an error. For additional information about how New Relic handles dSYM uploads, see New Relic's Online Technical Community. If the automatic upload fails, you can manually upload your dSYM file. If you have multiple dSYM files, they can be within a single zip with a maximum file size of 600 MB. The YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APPLICATION_TOKEN value in the commands below is the same key used for +[NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:] (in Objective-C) or NewRelic.start(withApplicationToken:) (in Swift). To manually upload your dSYM files: Via Python script (agent versions 6.0.0 or higher) In iOS agent versions 6.0.0 or higher, the agent includes a Python script that automatically processes and uploads symbols. You can call this script from the command line: NewRelicAgent.framework/Resources/generateMap.py \"DSYM_ARCHIVE_PATH\" \"YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APPLICATION_TOKEN\" Copy Via command line To manually upload individual dSYM files from the command line: Zip up your dSYM file or files using the following command. Replace ~ /ZIPPED_DSYM_PATH with your new dSYM archive path and file name (for example, Users/my-name/desktop). Also replace ~ /dSYM_PATH with your existing dSYM file path. /usr/bin/zip --recurse-paths --quiet \"~/ZIPPED_DSYM_PATH\" \"~/dSYM_PATH\" Copy Upload the dSYM zip file using the following command: For US accounts: curl -F dsym=@\"~/DSYM_ZIP_PATH\" -H \"X-APP-LICENSE-KEY: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APPLICATION_TOKEN\" https://mobile-symbol-upload.newrelic.com/symbol Copy For EU accounts: curl -F dsym=@\"~/DSYM_ZIP_PATH\" -H \"X-APP-LICENSE-KEY: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APPLICATION_TOKEN\" https://mobile-symbol-upload.eu01.nr-data.net/symbol Copy Troubleshooting Auto-upload failure If a dSYM auto-upload failed, the Report Navigator may have a fully formed cURL command. You can use this cURL command to reattempt an upload. Depending on the error, you may also need to follow some of the dSYM manual upload steps. Here is an example of a successful dSYM upload in the Report Navigator: Example: A successful dSYM upload in the Report Navigator. Missing dSYMs If dSYM files are missing, you may need to check Xcode build settings to ensure the file is being generated. Frameworks which are built locally have separate build settings and may need to be updated as well.

      "body": "Our custom installation process for the infrastructure agent for Windows allows you to tailor all aspects of the installation. You can place files and folders wherever you want on your filesystem. This method gives you full control of the installation. You are responsible for placing the files in the correct folders, providing the correct configuration values, and ensuring the agent has all the right permissions. Before installation, check the compatibility and requirements. Install the agent To install the agent: Download the packaged agent file. Unpack the file. Make sure the file unpacks with the following structure: Install the service script. Optionally, you can: Change the location of the configuration file. Configure the plugin directory. Configure the agent directory. Configure the log file. Important As of version 1.4.0, the infrastructure agent package includes the additional newrelic-infra-ctl binary, which is used to help troubleshoot a running agent. Although this binary is not required to execute the agent, we recommend to add it in your path. For more information, see our documentation about troubleshooting a running infrastructure agent. Install the service script To proceed with the installation, you need to create the service. Check the file provided in the zip file for reference: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\installer.ps1 Copy Configuration file The infrastructure agent depends on a configuration file, usually named newrelic-infra.yml, to configure the agent's behavior. This file is placed in the same folder with the agent. You can create a new config file based on the config file template. For more information, see how to configure the agent. Changing the config file's location By default, the configuration file is located in C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.yml. To change the location of the configuration file: Execute the command regedit.exe. Browse to the folder Computer\\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\newrelic-infra\\ImagePath. Retrieve the ImagePath key. If the agent binary is on the default path, look for the key at C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.exe. Use the -config flag to add the new location of the configuration file to the key: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.exe -config c:\\config.yaml Copy Configure the plugin directory The infrastructure agent allows you to install integrations that monitor and report data from popular services such as Kubernetes, AWS, MySQL, Redis, Kafka, etc. Each integration has its own configuration file, named integration-name-config.yml by default. This config file is placed in the predefined location C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d. On initialization, the agent loads the config file. To overwrite the predefined location of the integration configuration file, use one of the following methods: Set the location in the NRIA_PLUGIN_DIR environment variable. Set the custom path in the newrelic-infra.yml configuration file using the plugin_dir field. Pass it as a command line argument using -plugin_dir when you run the newrelic-infra binary. Configure the agent directory The agent requires its own defined directory to run the installed integrations, caching data (inventory), etc. The default location is C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\. The agent directory has the following structure and content: LICENSE: Text file containing the New Relic infrastructure agent license. custom-integrations: Directory that stores the installed the custom integrations. newrelic-integrations: Directory that stores the New Relic official integrations. The agent also uses a different folder, app_data_dir, to store data. By default it points to C:\\ProgramData\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\. To overwrite the predefined location of the agent directory, use one of the following methods: Set the location in the NRIA_AGENT_DIR environment variable. Set the custom path in the newrelic-infra.yml configuration file using the agent_dir field. Pass it as a command line argument using -agent_dir when you run the newrelic-infra binary. Configure the log file By default the agent stores the log files in C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.log. To overwrite the predefined location of the log file, use one of the following methods: Set the location in the NRIA_LOG_FILE environment variable. Set the custom path in the newrelic-infra.yml configuration file using the log_file field. Pass it as a command line argument using -log_file when you run the newrelic-infra binary. What's next? You may also want to: Add custom attributes to annotate your infrastructure data. Connect your AWS account if your servers are hosted on Amazon EC2. Add other New Relic infrastructure integrations to collect data from external services. Manually start, stop, restart, or check the agent status.",

You can use our launcher, or follow the instructions in this document to complete a basic installation. No matter which installation option you choose, make sure you've created a free New Relic account (No credit card required). Quick start The quickest way to get started with our infrastructure monitoring agent is through our guided install. Tip Try our guided install for yourself. (If you're hosted in the EU, use our EU guided install.) Step-by-step instructions If guided install doesn't work, you can install the agent manually. Before installing infrastructure, be sure to: Review the requirements. Have a valid New Relic license key. To install infrastructure in Linux, follow these instructions: Create the configuration file and add your license key: echo \"license_key: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" | sudo tee -a /etc/newrelic-infra.yml Copy Determine the distribution version number: Debian cat /etc/os-release Copy Ubuntu cat /etc/lsb-release Copy Amazon Linux, CentOS, RHEL cat /etc/os-release Copy SLES cat /etc/os-release | grep VERSION_ID Copy Enable New Relic's GPG key. Debian curl -s https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/gpg/newrelic-infra.gpg | sudo apt-key add - Copy Ubuntu curl -s https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/gpg/newrelic-infra.gpg | sudo apt-key add - Copy Amazon Linux, CentOS, RHEL yum automatically installs the GPG key using the value in gpgkey.

Important As of version 1.4.0, the infrastructure monitoring agent package includes the additional newrelic-infra-ctl binary, which is used to help troubleshoot a running agent. Although this binary is not required to execute the agent, we recommend to add it in your path. Install using configuration management tools To install the infrastructure monitoring agent with a configuration management tool, see the documentation for: Ansible Chef Docker (install as container) Elastic Beanstalk Puppet Install for Docker containers on instrumented hosts See Docker instrumentation for infrastructure monitoring. Install using Azure extensions See Azure extensions for infrastructure monitoring. Install using tarball files For custom setup scenarios, you can install the infrastructure monitoring agent using our tarball files in assisted or manual modes. This is especially useful when you need to adapt the default installation settings to your environment, or to install the infrastructure monitoring agent on distributions that lack the newrelic-infra package in their repositories. Important Installing the agent using tarball files is officially supported only for the AWS Graviton 2 processor. Update the agent Follow standard procedures to update the infrastructure monitoring agent. If you are using sudo to install or update the agent, use the -E argument to allow bypassing the environment variables, or specify the NRIA_MODE environment variable just after sudo. export NRIA_MODE=\"SET_MODE_HERE\" Copy OR sudo -E YOUR_PACKAGE_MANAGER_UPDATE_COMMAND Copy What's next? Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then view your hosts in the New Relic One UI. If necessary, follow our troubleshooting procedures if no data appears. Important The hostname for your server cannot be localhost. Data will not be reported for servers with that name. Make sure the host name uses a unique name. The only required configuration option is the license_key setting, which is created as part of the installation procedures. You may also want to: Add custom attributes to annotate your infrastructure data. Connect your AWS account if your servers are hosted on Amazon EC2. Enable log forwarding. Add other New Relic infrastructure integrations to collect data from external services.",

      "body": "These instructions are for installing the Ruby agent as a Rails plugin. For most use cases, you should instead install the agent gem. Contents Install the New Relic Rails plugin Important New Relic strongly recommends installing the Ruby agent as a gem in order to have better control over versions and dependencies. To install the Rails plugin from Github, use the following commands for Rails versions 2 or higher: script/plugin install git://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-ruby-agent.git mv vendor/plugins/rpm vendor/plugins/newrelic-ruby-agent Copy This will export the Rails plugin into your application's vendor/plugins directory. If you cannot install the Rails plugin directly from the git URL, you can clone the repository into the vendor/plugins directory. Update the configuration file After installing the agent, copy the newrelic.yml file into the config subdirectory of your application. You can download a fresh newrelic.yml that includes your license key from the Account settings when logged in to New Relic. Important As part of the installation process, change the default application name to a meaningful name. Update the newrelic.yml file Whenever you update the agent, double-check that your Ruby agent configuration file (config/newrelic.yml) is up to date: Open the default newrelic.yml file that lives in the Ruby agent's plugin folder (vendor/plugins/newrelic-ruby-agent/newrelic.yml). Look for new configuration options that are not in your config/newrelic.yml file. Update the Ruby agent When using Subversion with the Rails plugin, be sure to remove the old agent plugin before reinstalling. Tip Use the gem if possible. svn rm vendor/plugins/newrelic-ruby-agent svn commit vendor/plugins -m \"removing old version of newrelic\" Copy Then, to install the latest Ruby agent plugin: script/rails plugin install git://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-ruby-agent.git vendor/plugins/newrelic-ruby-agent mv vendor/plugins/rpm vendor/plugins/newrelic-ruby-agent svn add vendor/plugins/newrelic-ruby-agent svn commit vendor/plugins -m \"upgrading newrelic to version X.X.X\" Copy Uninstall the Rails plugin To uninstall the Rails plugin: svn rm vendor/plugins/newrelic-ruby-agent svn commit vendor/plugins Copy For more help Additional documentation resources include: New Relic for Ruby (compatibility and requirements, general information about installation, configuration, troubleshooting, and known issues) Ruby agent installation (using the New Relic Ruby gem and configuration file)",

      "body": "Your app's dSYM files are stored in Xcode's dSYM archive path folder. This is the folder where the iOS agent gets the dSYM files that are used to symbolicate your crash reports. New Relic provides a post-build script as part of the iOS agent's install process and the tvOS agent's install process. This script automatically uploads your app's dSYM files. Automatic script The script automatically uploads dSYM files only for release builds. Non-release builds must upload their files either manually or through the mobile monitoring UI. Bitcode-enabled apps have their dSYM files generated by Apple. You must download the dSYM files for Bitcode-enabled apps from Apple and upload them to New Relic. If you see unreadable machine code in the Crashes page, your dSYM files may not be uploaded correctly. In some cases, you may need to manually upload dSYM files. The automatic script uses Python 2. As of October 2019 with macOS 10.15 (Catalina), Python won't be installed by default. If you're using the automatic script (recommended), you may need to manually install Python 2. If you're using Homebrew, see Python on Homebrew. Identify missing dSYMs When a Bitcode-enabled app is uploaded to Apple for App Store review or ad-hoc distribution, dSYMs need to be manually downloaded from Apple and uploaded to New Relic to allow the mobile crash reports to be properly symbolicated. These dSYMs can be downloaded through the archives organizer in Xcode within several minutes of uploading the app. In this situation follow the procedures to find the archive and download dSYMs. If an app is missing a dSYM file, you'll see three indicators in the mobile monitoring UI: Banner notification: A banner warning appears on the Crash report page. The warning reads: We were unable to locate your dsym. Copy Upload prompt: From the Crash type summary page you will be automatically prompted to upload a dSYM file if it is missing. Machine code: The crash stack trace on the Crash report page displays machine code and not a human-readable error message. Upload dSYM files through the mobile monitoring UI You can easily upload your dSYM files directly from the New Relic One UI. The maximum file size is 600 MB. To upload your dSYM files: Go to one.newrelic.com and click Mobile. Then select your app from the list. View Crash analysis. Select a specific crash from the Crash types list. Click Upload dSYM. You can either drag and drop your dSYMs directly, or select the file form your computer. Manually upload dSYM files In some circumstances, New Relic's automatic upload of dSYM files may fail. If a dSYM upload is attempted and fails, it creates a build error with a detailed message. For example, if there's a network failure and the dSYM upload isn't completed, Xcode will report an error. For additional information about how New Relic handles dSYM uploads, see New Relic's Online Technical Community. If the automatic upload fails, you can manually upload your dSYM file. If you have multiple dSYM files, they can be within a single zip with a maximum file size of 600 MB. The YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APPLICATION_TOKEN value in the commands below is the same key used for +[NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:] (in Objective-C) or NewRelic.start(withApplicationToken:) (in Swift). To manually upload your dSYM files: Via Python script (agent versions 6.0.0 or higher) In iOS agent versions 6.0.0 or higher, the agent includes a Python script that automatically processes and uploads symbols. You can call this script from the command line: NewRelicAgent.framework/Resources/generateMap.py \"DSYM_ARCHIVE_PATH\" \"YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APPLICATION_TOKEN\" Copy Via command line To manually upload individual dSYM files from the command line: Zip up your dSYM file or files using the following command. Replace ~ /ZIPPED_DSYM_PATH with your new dSYM archive path and file name (for example, Users/my-name/desktop). Also replace ~ /dSYM_PATH with your existing dSYM file path. /usr/bin/zip --recurse-paths --quiet \"~/ZIPPED_DSYM_PATH\" \"~/dSYM_PATH\" Copy Upload the dSYM zip file using the following command: For US accounts: curl -F dsym=@\"~/DSYM_ZIP_PATH\" -H \"X-APP-LICENSE-KEY: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APPLICATION_TOKEN\" https://mobile-symbol-upload.newrelic.com/symbol Copy For EU accounts: curl -F dsym=@\"~/DSYM_ZIP_PATH\" -H \"X-APP-LICENSE-KEY: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APPLICATION_TOKEN\" https://mobile-symbol-upload.eu01.nr-data.net/symbol Copy Troubleshooting Auto-upload failure If a dSYM auto-upload failed, the Report Navigator may have a fully formed cURL command. You can use this cURL command to reattempt an upload. Depending on the error, you may also need to follow some of the dSYM manual upload steps. Here is an example of a successful dSYM upload in the Report Navigator: Example: A successful dSYM upload in the Report Navigator. Missing dSYMs If dSYM files are missing, you may need to check Xcode build settings to ensure the file is being generated. Frameworks which are built locally have separate build settings and may need to be updated as well.

Install your iOS application As part of the installation process, New Relic automatically generates an application token. This is a 40-character hexadecimal string for authenticating each mobile app you monitor in New Relic. To install and configure your iOS application: Go to one.newrelic.com. If applicable: From the Mobile Apps index, select Add a new app. From the Get started page, select XCFramework as the platform for mobile monitoring. Type a name for your mobile app, and select Continue. Continue with the steps to configure New Relic. Add the New Relic framework to your app Download and unzip the iOS SDK for New Relic. To add the New Relic framework to your Xcode project: Use Finder to drag the NewRelicAgent.framework folder into your Xcode project, and drop it onto your project in the Project navigator window, under Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content. Make sure Embed & Sign is selected under the Embed dropdown menu. Implement the agent using the appropriate method: Important To ensure proper instrumentation, you must call the agent on the first line of didFinishLaunchingWithOptions(), and run the agent on the main thread. Starting the call later, on a background thread, or asynchronously can cause unexpected or unstable behavior. Language Procedure Objective-C To start the agent: Import the New Relic header at the top of your prefix.pch. Add +[NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:@\"<appToken>\"] to the top of -application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: in your AppDelegate.m, using the unique application token that is automatically generated. Swift Create a bridging header file: Select File > New > File > Objective-C File. Name the file Placeholder.m, then select Next. Select Create, and confirm Xcode's prompt to generate the bridging header. Delete Placeholder.m. Import the New Relic agent by adding #import \"NewRelic/NewRelic.h\" to the top of MyApp-Bridging-Header.h. Add NewRelic.start(withApplicationToken: \">appToken>\") to the top of application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:) in your AppDelegate.swift using the unique application token that is automatically generated. Add a build script to your target's Build Phases. Ensure the new build script is the very last build phase, then paste the following, replacing PUT_NEW_RELIC_APP_TOKEN_HERE with your application token: SCRIPT=`/usr/bin/find \"${SRCROOT}\" -name newrelic_postbuild.sh | head -n 1` /bin/sh \"${SCRIPT}\" \"PUT_NEW_RELIC_APP_TOKEN_HERE\" Copy Clean and build your app, and then run it in the simulator or other device. Optional: Execute a demo crash If you have trouble getting your app to crash, the New Relic agent provides an API to execute a demo crash. Recommendation: Add one of these lines of code to a button click event handler as applicable: Language Code Objective-C Crash: [NewRelic crashNow]; Copy Crash with log message: [NewRelic crashNow:@\"<reason>\"]; Copy Swift Crash: NewRelic.crashNow() Copy Crash with log message: NewRelic.crashNow(_ message:) Copy Optional: Change the logging level Six log levels are available for mobile apps monitoring: none error warning info verbose ALL To increase your logging level in the app, add the following method: Language Code Objective-C Just before calling startWithApplicationToken in AppDelegate.m, add: [NRLogger setLogLevels:NRLogLevelALL]; Copy Swift Just before calling start(withApplicationToken:) in AppDelegate.swift, add: NRLogger.setLogLevels(NRLogLevelALL.rawValue) Copy",

Install the agent As part of the installation process, New Relic automatically generates an application token. This is a 40-character hexadecimal string for authenticating each mobile app that you monitor. There are two ways you can install the iOS agent: We recommend you install and configure the iOS agent using the CocoaPods installation method. You can also manually install and configure the iOS agent by adding the New Relic framework to your app. Extend your instrumentation After you install the agent, you can extend the agent's default instrumentation with various types of custom data: To access: In the mobile UI: In New Relic One dashboards: Custom data Create and record custom events, interaction traces, and attributes to add details to your existing data and traces. You can also query the custom events that you created in New Relic One dashboards and NRQL. Network requests Enable the MobileRequest event feature so you can perform a full network analysis. To further investigate network request error rates and response times, query MobileRequest and MobileRequestError events. Crash analysis Review detailed information using groups and filters to analyze trends that lead to crashes. To view more information about crashes, create NRQL queries to review Insights charts related to crash data. iOS SDK API Use the iOS SDK API to instrument parts of your code that are not instrumented by default. Then, view those custom events and attributes in New Relic Insights. Handled exceptions Report exceptions so you can identify factors creating a poor mobile app experience. To further improve performance, review MobileHandledException event records in New Relic Insights. Breadcrumbs Boost the level of detail in crash event trails by adding breadcrumbs. Then, query MobileBreadcrumbs events to see all breadcrumbs or just breadcrumbs related to crashes.

Install the SDK Ensure you have your app instrumented with the latest iOS SDK by going to one.newrelic.com > Add more data and following the instructions for iOS. This document contains the iOS SDK instrumentation requirements for: Objective C Swift For details about the available methods for custom attributes and events you can send to to New Relic Insights, see the iOS SDK API reference. You can also configure feature flags for: Objective-C Swift Automatically instrumented classes and methods The following methods (for the listed classes and their sub-classes) are already instrumented by New Relic. You do not need to add custom instrumentation to trace them. Classes Methods automatically instrumented by New Relic UIViewController viewDidLoad: viewWillAppear: viewDidAppear: viewWillDisappear: viewDidDisappear: viewWillLayoutSubviews: viewDidLayoutSubviews: UIImage imageNamed: imageWithContentsOfFile: imageWithData: imageWithData:scale: initWithContentsOfFile: initWithData: initWithData:scale: NSJSONSerialization JSONObjectWithData:options:error: JSONObjectWithStream:options:error: dataWithJSONObject:options:error: writeJSONObject:toStream:options:error: NSManagedObjectContext executeFetchRequest:error: processPendingChanges The agent aggregates performance for various methods into summary metrics that appear in the Interactions page. Summary categories include: View loading UI layout Database Images JSON Network Instrument your Objective-C code To have your own Objective-C code appear in interaction code breakdowns and timelines, add a _START call to the beginning of your method and a _STOP call to the end of it. Important Always include a _STOP for each _START, and only include one set of these commands in a given method. The trace system will automatically pick up the class and method name, and report performance metrics for your method to New Relic. - (void)myMethod { NR_TRACE_METHOD_START(0); // … existing code NR_TRACE_METHOD_STOP; } Copy If you are not using ARC, use this version of the _STOP macro to avoid memory leaks: NR_NONARC_TRACE_METHOD_STOP; Copy If you want your method’s performance to be included in the summary data on the APM Overview page, pass one of the NRTraceType enum values into the _START macro; for example: NR_TRACE_METHOD_START(NRTraceTypeDatabase); Copy Create and complete interactions By default, an interaction starts when a view controller is pushed. To manually start an interaction with Objective-C, use these API calls: NSString* uniqueIdentifier = NR_START_NAMED_INTERACTION(@\"name\"); Copy This macro will automatically begin tracking the name interaction trace from the current line. It will also complete any previously running interaction. It returns a unique identifier that can be used to complete that interaction by using this API call: NR_INTERACTION_STOP(uniqueIdentifier); Copy This macro will complete the interaction associated with the uniqueIdentifier if that interaction has not already completed automatically. You do not need to call this method. Rename a default interaction By default, the iOS agent will start an interaction trace when a new view controller is displayed. The interactions are named using the format Display <ViewController>. To change these default names with Objective-C, implement the - (NSString*) customNewRelicInteractionName instance method in your view controller, where the string returned becomes the interaction's name. Set a custom application version The New Relic iOS SDK allows you to set a custom application version string with Objective-C. Instead of using the string defined in CFBundleShortVersionString, call the +[NewRelic setApplicationVersion:] method and pass along the custom application version before calling +[NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:]; [NewRelic setApplicationVersion:(NSString*) appVersion]; Copy Set a custom build identifier As of version 5.1.0 of the New Relic iOS SDK, an API method allows you to set a custom build identifier that is displayed next to the application version in the Crash details page. Instead of using the CFBundleVersion string defined in Xcode with Objective-C, call the +[NewRelic setApplicationBuild:] method, and pass along the custom build identifier. [NewRelic setApplicationBuild:(NSString*) buildNumber]; Copy Create custom metrics Custom metrics can help track high level events specific to your application. With the recordMetric API, you can record arbitrary numerical data and named events with Objective-C and Swift. You can also use several API calls to record custom metrics that provide different levels of detail. Objective-C: Report custom attributes and events Use methods in the NewRelic object to report custom attributes and events. For details about the available methods for custom attributes and events with Objective-C, see the iOS SDK API reference. Methods that return BOOL results return YES if they succeed, or NO if the operation did not complete. These methods are available in versions 5.0.0 or higher of the New Relic iOS SDK. The SDK can store up to 128 user-defined custom attributes at a time. If you attempt to store more than 128 attributes, the SDK returns NO. Custom attributes names should use the simplest format needed, and New Relic recommends single word attributes, containing no spaces. Attribute phrases can be formatted in camel case, so My Custom Attribute is better specified as myCustomAttribute. As with custom metrics: Avoid using the characters / ] [ | * when naming things. Avoid multi-byte characters. Objective-C: Track custom network requests If you can express a transactional network request in terms similar to an HTTP request, you can track it. Use URLs that are well-formed and do not include highly variable paths or hostnames. For requests that complete, use this method: [NewRelic noticeNetworkRequestForURL:(NSURL*)url httpMethod:(NSString*)httpMethod withTimer:(NRTimer *)timer responseHeaders:(NSDictionary *)headers statusCode:(NSInteger)httpStatusCode bytesSent:(NSUInteger)bytesSent bytesReceived:(NSUInteger)bytesReceived responseData:(NSData *)responseData andParams:(NSDictionary *)params]; Copy Parameters include: Parameter Description url The URL of the request httpMethod The method type of the request; for example, POST, GET, etc. timer An NRTimer that timed the network request headers A dictionary containing the HTTP response headers, if available httpStatusCode The response status code If the httpStatusCode is greater than or equal to 400, the agent will record a server error and may capture the responseData body if provided. bytesSent The size of the request body bytesReceived The size of the responseBody responseData The response body data, captured if the agent records server error params params Additional parameters included in an HTTP error metric if the HTTP transaction is an error For requests that fail due to a socket or operating system error, use this method: [NewRelic noticeNetworkFailureForURL:(NSURL *)url httpMethod:(NSString*)httpMethod withTimer:(NRTimer *)timer andFailureCode:(NSInteger)iOSFailureCode]; Copy Parameters include: Parameter Description url The URL of the request httpMethod The method type of the request; for example, POST, GET, etc. timer An NRTimer that timed the network request iOSFailureCode The failure code Failure codes are interpreted as NSURLError* code. To view a complete list of supported codes, see NRConstants.h. Instrument your Swift code To have your own Swift code appear in interaction code breakdowns and timelines: Add a startTracingMethod() call to the beginning of your method. Add a endTracingMethodWithTimer() call to the end of it. Always include an endTracingMethodWithTimer() call for each startTracingMethod() reference. Include only one set of these commands in a given method. func myMethod(){ let timer = NRTimer(); NewRelic.startTracingMethod(#selector(MyClass.myMethod), object: self, timer: timer, category: NRTraceTypeNone) // … existing code NewRelic.endTracingMethodWithTimer(timer) } Copy If you want your method’s performance to be included in the summary data on the APM Overview page, pass one of the NRTraceType enum values into the startTracingMethod() macro; for example: NewRelic.startTracingMethod(#selector(MyClass.myMethod), object: self, timer: timer, category: NRTraceTypeDatabase) Copy Create and complete Swift interactions By default, an interaction starts when a view controller is pushed. To manually start an interaction, use these API calls: let uniqueIdentifier = NewRelic.startInteraction(withName: \"My Interaction\") Copy This call will automatically begin tracking an interaction trace named My Interaction from the current line. It will also complete any previously running interaction. It returns a unique identifier that can be used to complete that interaction by using this API call: NewRelic.stopCurrentInteraction(uniqueIdentifier) Copy This method will complete the interaction associated with the uniqueIdentifier if that interaction has not already completed automatically. You do not need to call this method. Rename a default Swift interaction By default, the iOS agent will start an interaction trace when a new view controller is displayed. The interactions are named using the format Display <ViewController>. To change these default names, implement the @objc func customNewRelicInteractionName() -> String method in your view controller, where the string returned becomes the interaction's name. Set a custom application version with Swift The New Relic iOS SDK allows you to set a custom application version string. Instead of using the string defined in CFBundleShortVersionString, call the NewRelic.setApplicationVersion() method, and pass along the custom application version before calling NewRelic.startWithApplicationToken();. NewRelic.setApplicationVersion(String appVersion) Copy Set a custom build identifier with Swift As of version 5.1.0 of the New Relic iOS SDK, an API method allows you to set a custom build identifier that is displayed next to the application version in the Crash details page. Instead of using the CFBundleVersion string defined in Xcode, call the NewRelic.setApplicationBuild() method, and pass along the custom build identifier. NewRelic.setApplicationBuild(buildNumber) Copy Create custom metrics with Swift Custom metrics can help track high level events specific to your application. With the recordMetric API, you can record arbitrary numerical data and named events with Objective-C and Swift. You can also use several API calls to record custom metrics that provide different levels of detail. Swift: Report custom attributes and events Use methods in the NewRelic object to report custom attributes and events. For details about the available methods for custom attributes and events with Swift, see the iOS SDK API reference. Methods that return BOOL results return YES if they succeed, or NO if the operation did not complete. These methods are available in versions 5.0.0 or higher of the New Relic iOS SDK. The SDK can store up to 128 user-defined custom attributes at a time. If you attempt to store more than 128 attributes, the SDK returns NO. Custom attributes names should use the simplest format needed, and New Relic recommends single word attributes, containing no spaces. Attribute phrases can be formatted in camel case, so My Custom Attribute is better specified as myCustomAttribute. As with custom metrics: Avoid using the characters / ] [ | * when naming things. Avoid multi-byte characters. Swift: Track custom network requests If you can express a transactional network request in terms similar to an HTTP request, you can track it. Use URLs that are well-formed and do not include highly variable paths or hostnames. For requests that complete, use this method: NewRelic.noticeNetworkRequestForURL(url: NSURL!, httpMethod: String!, withTimer: NRTimer!, responseHeaders:[NSObject : AnyObject]!, statusCode: Int, bytesSent: UInt, bytesReceived: UInt, responseData: NSData!, andParams: [NSObject : AnyObject]!) Copy Parameters include: Parameter Description url The URL of the request httpMethod The method type of the request; for example, POST, GET, etc. timer An NRTimer that timed the network request headers A dictionary containing the HTTP response headers, if available httpStatusCode The response status code If the httpStatusCode is greater than or equal to 400, the agent will record a server error and may capture the responseData body if provided. bytesSent The size of the request body bytesReceived The size of the responseBody responseData The response body data, captured if the agent records Server error params params Additional parameters included in an HTTP error metric if the HTTP transaction is an error For requests that fail due to a socket or operating system error, use this method: NewRelic.noticeNetworkFailureForURL(url: NSURL!, httpMethod: NSString!, withTimer: NRTimer!, andFailureCode: Int) Copy Parameters include: Parameter Description url The URL of the request httpMethod The method type of the request; for example, POST, GET, etc. timer An NRTimer that timed the network request iOSFailureCode The failure code Failure codes are interpreted as NSURLError* code.

For a general overview of mobile monitoring functionality, see Introduction to mobile monitoring. Compatibility and requirements Before you install the iOS agent, review the compatibility and requirements. Install the agent As part of the installation process, New Relic automatically generates an application token. This is a 40-character hexadecimal string for authenticating each mobile app that you monitor. There are two ways you can install the iOS agent: We recommend you install and configure the iOS agent using the CocoaPods installation method. You can also manually install and configure the iOS agent by adding the New Relic framework to your app. Extend your instrumentation After you install the agent, you can extend the agent's default instrumentation with various types of custom data: To access: In the mobile UI: In New Relic One dashboards: Custom data Create and record custom events, interaction traces, and attributes to add details to your existing data and traces. You can also query the custom events that you created in New Relic One dashboards and NRQL. Network requests Enable the MobileRequest event feature so you can perform a full network analysis. To further investigate network request error rates and response times, query MobileRequest and MobileRequestError events. Crash analysis Review detailed information using groups and filters to analyze trends that lead to crashes. To view more information about crashes, create NRQL queries to review Insights charts related to crash data. iOS SDK API Use the iOS SDK API to instrument parts of your code that are not instrumented by default. Then, view those custom events and attributes in New Relic Insights. Handled exceptions Report exceptions so you can identify factors creating a poor mobile app experience. To further improve performance, review MobileHandledException event records in New Relic Insights. Breadcrumbs Boost the level of detail in crash event trails by adding breadcrumbs. Then, query MobileBreadcrumbs events to see all breadcrumbs or just breadcrumbs related to crashes. Troubleshoot your installation If the agent isn't reporting data, try these troubleshooting suggestions.",

Summary categories include: View loading UI layout Database Images JSON Network Instrument your Objective-C code To have your own Objective-C code appear in interaction code breakdowns and timelines, add a _START call to the beginning of your method and a _STOP call to the end of it. Important Always include a _STOP for each _START, and only include one set of these commands in a given method. The trace system will automatically pick up the class and method name, and report performance metrics for your method to New Relic. - (void)myMethod { NR_TRACE_METHOD_START(0); // … existing code NR_TRACE_METHOD_STOP; } Copy If you are not using ARC, use this version of the _STOP macro to avoid memory leaks: NR_NONARC_TRACE_METHOD_STOP; Copy If you want your method’s performance to be included in the summary data on the APM Overview page, pass one of the NRTraceType enum values into the _START macro; for example: NR_TRACE_METHOD_START(NRTraceTypeDatabase); Copy Create and complete interactions By default, an interaction starts when a view controller is pushed.

For a general overview of mobile monitoring functionality, see Introduction to mobile monitoring. Compatibility and requirements Before you install the iOS agent, review the compatibility and requirements. Install the agent As part of the installation process, New Relic automatically generates an application token. This is a 40-character hexadecimal string for authenticating each mobile app that you monitor. There are two ways you can install the iOS agent: We recommend you install and configure the iOS agent using the CocoaPods installation method. You can also manually install and configure the iOS agent by adding the New Relic framework to your app. Extend your instrumentation After you install the agent, you can extend the agent's default instrumentation with various types of custom data: To access: In the mobile UI: In New Relic One dashboards: Custom data Create and record custom events, interaction traces, and attributes to add details to your existing data and traces. You can also query the custom events that you created in New Relic One dashboards and NRQL. Network requests Enable the MobileRequest event feature so you can perform a full network analysis. To further investigate network request error rates and response times, query MobileRequest and MobileRequestError events. Crash analysis Review detailed information using groups and filters to analyze trends that lead to crashes. To view more information about crashes, create NRQL queries to review Insights charts related to crash data. iOS SDK API Use the iOS SDK API to instrument parts of your code that are not instrumented by default. Then, view those custom events and attributes in New Relic Insights. Handled exceptions Report exceptions so you can identify factors creating a poor mobile app experience. To further improve performance, review MobileHandledException event records in New Relic Insights. Breadcrumbs Boost the level of detail in crash event trails by adding breadcrumbs. Then, query MobileBreadcrumbs events to see all breadcrumbs or just breadcrumbs related to crashes.

Send custom attributes and events to Insights. Track networking from libraries not supported automatically. Set a custom identifier value with Objective-C or Swift to associate user sessions with analysis events and attributes (iOS SDK version 5.9.0 or higher). Caution Tracing is heavily optimized, but it does impose a performance overhead. Avoid instrumenting methods that are expected to be called hundreds of times. Install the SDK Ensure you have your app instrumented with the latest iOS SDK by going to one.newrelic.com > Add more data and following the instructions for iOS. This document contains the iOS SDK instrumentation requirements for: Objective C Swift For details about the available methods for custom attributes and events you can send to to New Relic Insights, see the iOS SDK API reference. You can also configure feature flags for: Objective-C Swift Automatically instrumented classes and methods The following methods (for the listed classes and their sub-classes) are already instrumented by New Relic. You do not need to add custom instrumentation to trace them. Classes Methods automatically instrumented by New Relic UIViewController viewDidLoad: viewWillAppear: viewDidAppear: viewWillDisappear: viewDidDisappear: viewWillLayoutSubviews: viewDidLayoutSubviews: UIImage imageNamed: imageWithContentsOfFile: imageWithData: imageWithData:scale: initWithContentsOfFile: initWithData: initWithData:scale: NSJSONSerialization JSONObjectWithData:options:error: JSONObjectWithStream:options:error: dataWithJSONObject:options:error: writeJSONObject:toStream:options:error: NSManagedObjectContext executeFetchRequest:error: processPendingChanges The agent aggregates performance for various methods into summary metrics that appear in the Interactions page. Summary categories include: View loading UI layout Database Images JSON Network Instrument your Objective-C code To have your own Objective-C code appear in interaction code breakdowns and timelines, add a _START call to the beginning of your method and a _STOP call to the end of it. Important Always include a _STOP for each _START, and only include one set of these commands in a given method. The trace system will automatically pick up the class and method name, and report performance metrics for your method to New Relic. - (void)myMethod { NR_TRACE_METHOD_START(0); // … existing code NR_TRACE_METHOD_STOP; } Copy If you are not using ARC, use this version of the _STOP macro to avoid memory leaks: NR_NONARC_TRACE_METHOD_STOP; Copy If you want your method’s performance to be included in the summary data on the APM Overview page, pass one of the NRTraceType enum values into the _START macro; for example: NR_TRACE_METHOD_START(NRTraceTypeDatabase); Copy Create and complete interactions By default, an interaction starts when a view controller is pushed. To manually start an interaction with Objective-C, use these API calls: NSString* uniqueIdentifier = NR_START_NAMED_INTERACTION(@\"name\"); Copy This macro will automatically begin tracking the name interaction trace from the current line. It will also complete any previously running interaction. It returns a unique identifier that can be used to complete that interaction by using this API call: NR_INTERACTION_STOP(uniqueIdentifier); Copy This macro will complete the interaction associated with the uniqueIdentifier if that interaction has not already completed automatically. You do not need to call this method. Rename a default interaction By default, the iOS agent will start an interaction trace when a new view controller is displayed. The interactions are named using the format Display <ViewController>. To change these default names with Objective-C, implement the - (NSString*) customNewRelicInteractionName instance method in your view controller, where the string returned becomes the interaction's name. Set a custom application version The New Relic iOS SDK allows you to set a custom application version string with Objective-C. Instead of using the string defined in CFBundleShortVersionString, call the +[NewRelic setApplicationVersion:] method and pass along the custom application version before calling +[NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:]; [NewRelic setApplicationVersion:(NSString*) appVersion]; Copy Set a custom build identifier As of version 5.1.0 of the New Relic iOS SDK, an API method allows you to set a custom build identifier that is displayed next to the application version in the Crash details page. Instead of using the CFBundleVersion string defined in Xcode with Objective-C, call the +[NewRelic setApplicationBuild:] method, and pass along the custom build identifier. [NewRelic setApplicationBuild:(NSString*) buildNumber]; Copy Create custom metrics Custom metrics can help track high level events specific to your application. With the recordMetric API, you can record arbitrary numerical data and named events with Objective-C and Swift. You can also use several API calls to record custom metrics that provide different levels of detail. Objective-C: Report custom attributes and events Use methods in the NewRelic object to report custom attributes and events. For details about the available methods for custom attributes and events with Objective-C, see the iOS SDK API reference. Methods that return BOOL results return YES if they succeed, or NO if the operation did not complete. These methods are available in versions 5.0.0 or higher of the New Relic iOS SDK. The SDK can store up to 128 user-defined custom attributes at a time. If you attempt to store more than 128 attributes, the SDK returns NO. Custom attributes names should use the simplest format needed, and New Relic recommends single word attributes, containing no spaces. Attribute phrases can be formatted in camel case, so My Custom Attribute is better specified as myCustomAttribute. As with custom metrics: Avoid using the characters / ] [ | * when naming things. Avoid multi-byte characters. Objective-C: Track custom network requests If you can express a transactional network request in terms similar to an HTTP request, you can track it. Use URLs that are well-formed and do not include highly variable paths or hostnames. For requests that complete, use this method: [NewRelic noticeNetworkRequestForURL:(NSURL*)url httpMethod:(NSString*)httpMethod withTimer:(NRTimer *)timer responseHeaders:(NSDictionary *)headers statusCode:(NSInteger)httpStatusCode bytesSent:(NSUInteger)bytesSent bytesReceived:(NSUInteger)bytesReceived responseData:(NSData *)responseData andParams:(NSDictionary *)params]; Copy Parameters include: Parameter Description url The URL of the request httpMethod The method type of the request; for example, POST, GET, etc. timer An NRTimer that timed the network request headers A dictionary containing the HTTP response headers, if available httpStatusCode The response status code If the httpStatusCode is greater than or equal to 400, the agent will record a server error and may capture the responseData body if provided. bytesSent The size of the request body bytesReceived The size of the responseBody responseData The response body data, captured if the agent records server error params params Additional parameters included in an HTTP error metric if the HTTP transaction is an error For requests that fail due to a socket or operating system error, use this method: [NewRelic noticeNetworkFailureForURL:(NSURL *)url httpMethod:(NSString*)httpMethod withTimer:(NRTimer *)timer andFailureCode:(NSInteger)iOSFailureCode]; Copy Parameters include: Parameter Description url The URL of the request httpMethod The method type of the request; for example, POST, GET, etc. timer An NRTimer that timed the network request iOSFailureCode The failure code Failure codes are interpreted as NSURLError* code. To view a complete list of supported codes, see NRConstants.h. Instrument your Swift code To have your own Swift code appear in interaction code breakdowns and timelines: Add a startTracingMethod() call to the beginning of your method. Add a endTracingMethodWithTimer() call to the end of it. Always include an endTracingMethodWithTimer() call for each startTracingMethod() reference. Include only one set of these commands in a given method. func myMethod(){ let timer = NRTimer(); NewRelic.startTracingMethod(#selector(MyClass.myMethod), object: self, timer: timer, category: NRTraceTypeNone) // … existing code NewRelic.endTracingMethodWithTimer(timer) } Copy If you want your method’s performance to be included in the summary data on the APM Overview page, pass one of the NRTraceType enum values into the startTracingMethod() macro; for example: NewRelic.startTracingMethod(#selector(MyClass.myMethod), object: self, timer: timer, category: NRTraceTypeDatabase) Copy Create and complete Swift interactions By default, an interaction starts when a view controller is pushed. To manually start an interaction, use these API calls: let uniqueIdentifier = NewRelic.startInteraction(withName: \"My Interaction\") Copy This call will automatically begin tracking an interaction trace named My Interaction from the current line. It will also complete any previously running interaction. It returns a unique identifier that can be used to complete that interaction by using this API call: NewRelic.stopCurrentInteraction(uniqueIdentifier) Copy This method will complete the interaction associated with the uniqueIdentifier if that interaction has not already completed automatically. You do not need to call this method. Rename a default Swift interaction By default, the iOS agent will start an interaction trace when a new view controller is displayed. The interactions are named using the format Display <ViewController>. To change these default names, implement the @objc func customNewRelicInteractionName() -> String method in your view controller, where the string returned becomes the interaction's name. Set a custom application version with Swift The New Relic iOS SDK allows you to set a custom application version string. Instead of using the string defined in CFBundleShortVersionString, call the NewRelic.setApplicationVersion() method, and pass along the custom application version before calling NewRelic.startWithApplicationToken();. NewRelic.setApplicationVersion(String appVersion) Copy Set a custom build identifier with Swift As of version 5.1.0 of the New Relic iOS SDK, an API method allows you to set a custom build identifier that is displayed next to the application version in the Crash details page. Instead of using the CFBundleVersion string defined in Xcode, call the NewRelic.setApplicationBuild() method, and pass along the custom build identifier.

This document contains the iOS SDK instrumentation requirements for: Objective C Swift For details about the available methods for custom attributes and events you can send to to New Relic Insights, see the iOS SDK API reference. You can also configure feature flags for: Objective-C Swift Automatically instrumented classes and methods The following methods (for the listed classes and their sub-classes) are already instrumented by New Relic. You do not need to add custom instrumentation to trace them.

Summary categories include: View loading UI layout Database Images JSON Network Instrument your Objective-C code To have your own Objective-C code appear in interaction code breakdowns and timelines, add a _START call to the beginning of your method and a _STOP call to the end of it. Important Always include a _STOP for each _START, and only include one set of these commands in a given method. The trace system will automatically pick up the class and method name, and report performance metrics for your method to New Relic. - (void)myMethod { NR_TRACE_METHOD_START(0); // … existing code NR_TRACE_METHOD_STOP; } Copy If you are not using ARC, use this version of the _STOP macro to avoid memory leaks: NR_NONARC_TRACE_METHOD_STOP; Copy If you want your method’s performance to be included in the summary data on the APM Overview page, pass one of the NRTraceType enum values into the _START macro; for example: NR_TRACE_METHOD_START(NRTraceTypeDatabase); Copy Create and complete interactions By default, an interaction starts when a view controller is pushed. To manually start an interaction with Objective-C, use these API calls: NSString* uniqueIdentifier = NR_START_NAMED_INTERACTION(@\"name\"); Copy This macro will automatically begin tracking the name interaction trace from the current line. It will also complete any previously running interaction. It returns a unique identifier that can be used to complete that interaction by using this API call: NR_INTERACTION_STOP(uniqueIdentifier); Copy This macro will complete the interaction associated with the uniqueIdentifier if that interaction has not already completed automatically. You do not need to call this method. Rename a default interaction By default, the iOS agent will start an interaction trace when a new view controller is displayed. The interactions are named using the format Display <ViewController>. To change these default names with Objective-C, implement the - (NSString*) customNewRelicInteractionName instance method in your view controller, where the string returned becomes the interaction's name. Set a custom application version The New Relic iOS SDK allows you to set a custom application version string with Objective-C. Instead of using the string defined in CFBundleShortVersionString, call the +[NewRelic setApplicationVersion:] method and pass along the custom application version before calling +[NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:]; [NewRelic setApplicationVersion:(NSString*) appVersion]; Copy Set a custom build identifier As of version 5.1.0 of the New Relic iOS SDK, an API method allows you to set a custom build identifier that is displayed next to the application version in the Crash details page. Instead of using the CFBundleVersion string defined in Xcode with Objective-C, call the +[NewRelic setApplicationBuild:] method, and pass along the custom build identifier. [NewRelic setApplicationBuild:(NSString*) buildNumber]; Copy Create custom metrics Custom metrics can help track high level events specific to your application. With the recordMetric API, you can record arbitrary numerical data and named events with Objective-C and Swift. You can also use several API calls to record custom metrics that provide different levels of detail. Objective-C: Report custom attributes and events Use methods in the NewRelic object to report custom attributes and events. For details about the available methods for custom attributes and events with Objective-C, see the iOS SDK API reference. Methods that return BOOL results return YES if they succeed, or NO if the operation did not complete. These methods are available in versions 5.0.0 or higher of the New Relic iOS SDK. The SDK can store up to 128 user-defined custom attributes at a time. If you attempt to store more than 128 attributes, the SDK returns NO. Custom attributes names should use the simplest format needed, and New Relic recommends single word attributes, containing no spaces. Attribute phrases can be formatted in camel case, so My Custom Attribute is better specified as myCustomAttribute. As with custom metrics: Avoid using the characters / ] [ | * when naming things. Avoid multi-byte characters. Objective-C: Track custom network requests If you can express a transactional network request in terms similar to an HTTP request, you can track it. Use URLs that are well-formed and do not include highly variable paths or hostnames. For requests that complete, use this method: [NewRelic noticeNetworkRequestForURL:(NSURL*)url httpMethod:(NSString*)httpMethod withTimer:(NRTimer *)timer responseHeaders:(NSDictionary *)headers statusCode:(NSInteger)httpStatusCode bytesSent:(NSUInteger)bytesSent bytesReceived:(NSUInteger)bytesReceived responseData:(NSData *)responseData andParams:(NSDictionary *)params]; Copy Parameters include: Parameter Description url The URL of the request httpMethod The method type of the request; for example, POST, GET, etc. timer An NRTimer that timed the network request headers A dictionary containing the HTTP response headers, if available httpStatusCode The response status code If the httpStatusCode is greater than or equal to 400, the agent will record a server error and may capture the responseData body if provided. bytesSent The size of the request body bytesReceived The size of the responseBody responseData The response body data, captured if the agent records server error params params Additional parameters included in an HTTP error metric if the HTTP transaction is an error For requests that fail due to a socket or operating system error, use this method: [NewRelic noticeNetworkFailureForURL:(NSURL *)url httpMethod:(NSString*)httpMethod withTimer:(NRTimer *)timer andFailureCode:(NSInteger)iOSFailureCode]; Copy Parameters include: Parameter Description url The URL of the request httpMethod The method type of the request; for example, POST, GET, etc. timer An NRTimer that timed the network request iOSFailureCode The failure code Failure codes are interpreted as NSURLError* code. To view a complete list of supported codes, see NRConstants.h. Instrument your Swift code To have your own Swift code appear in interaction code breakdowns and timelines: Add a startTracingMethod() call to the beginning of your method. Add a endTracingMethodWithTimer() call to the end of it. Always include an endTracingMethodWithTimer() call for each startTracingMethod() reference. Include only one set of these commands in a given method. func myMethod(){ let timer = NRTimer(); NewRelic.startTracingMethod(#selector(MyClass.myMethod), object: self, timer: timer, category: NRTraceTypeNone) // … existing code NewRelic.endTracingMethodWithTimer(timer) } Copy If you want your method’s performance to be included in the summary data on the APM Overview page, pass one of the NRTraceType enum values into the startTracingMethod() macro; for example: NewRelic.startTracingMethod(#selector(MyClass.myMethod), object: self, timer: timer, category: NRTraceTypeDatabase) Copy Create and complete Swift interactions By default, an interaction starts when a view controller is pushed. To manually start an interaction, use these API calls: let uniqueIdentifier = NewRelic.startInteraction(withName: \"My Interaction\") Copy This call will automatically begin tracking an interaction trace named My Interaction from the current line. It will also complete any previously running interaction. It returns a unique identifier that can be used to complete that interaction by using this API call: NewRelic.stopCurrentInteraction(uniqueIdentifier) Copy This method will complete the interaction associated with the uniqueIdentifier if that interaction has not already completed automatically. You do not need to call this method. Rename a default Swift interaction By default, the iOS agent will start an interaction trace when a new view controller is displayed. The interactions are named using the format Display <ViewController>. To change these default names, implement the @objc func customNewRelicInteractionName() -> String method in your view controller, where the string returned becomes the interaction's name. Set a custom application version with Swift The New Relic iOS SDK allows you to set a custom application version string. Instead of using the string defined in CFBundleShortVersionString, call the NewRelic.setApplicationVersion() method, and pass along the custom application version before calling NewRelic.startWithApplicationToken();. NewRelic.setApplicationVersion(String appVersion) Copy Set a custom build identifier with Swift As of version 5.1.0 of the New Relic iOS SDK, an API method allows you to set a custom build identifier that is displayed next to the application version in the Crash details page.

For a general overview of mobile monitoring functionality, see Introduction to mobile monitoring. Compatibility and requirements Before you install the iOS agent, review the compatibility and requirements. Install the agent As part of the installation process, New Relic automatically generates an application token. This is a 40-character hexadecimal string for authenticating each mobile app that you monitor. There are two ways you can install the iOS agent: We recommend you install and configure the iOS agent using the CocoaPods installation method. You can also manually install and configure the iOS agent by adding the New Relic framework to your app. Extend your instrumentation After you install the agent, you can extend the agent's default instrumentation with various types of custom data: To access: In the mobile UI: In New Relic One dashboards: Custom data Create and record custom events, interaction traces, and attributes to add details to your existing data and traces. You can also query the custom events that you created in New Relic One dashboards and NRQL. Network requests Enable the MobileRequest event feature so you can perform a full network analysis. To further investigate network request error rates and response times, query MobileRequest and MobileRequestError events. Crash analysis Review detailed information using groups and filters to analyze trends that lead to crashes. To view more information about crashes, create NRQL queries to review Insights charts related to crash data. iOS SDK API Use the iOS SDK API to instrument parts of your code that are not instrumented by default. Then, view those custom events and attributes in New Relic Insights. Handled exceptions Report exceptions so you can identify factors creating a poor mobile app experience. To further improve performance, review MobileHandledException event records in New Relic Insights. Breadcrumbs Boost the level of detail in crash event trails by adding breadcrumbs. Then, query MobileBreadcrumbs events to see all breadcrumbs or just breadcrumbs related to crashes. Troubleshoot your installation If the agent isn't reporting data, try these troubleshooting suggestions.",

For requests that complete, use this method: [NewRelic noticeNetworkRequestForURL:(NSURL*)url httpMethod:(NSString*)httpMethod withTimer:(NRTimer *)timer responseHeaders:(NSDictionary *)headers statusCode:(NSInteger)httpStatusCode bytesSent:(NSUInteger)bytesSent bytesReceived:(NSUInteger)bytesReceived responseData:(NSData *)responseData andParams:(NSDictionary *)params]; Copy Parameters include: Parameter Description url The URL of the request httpMethod The method type of the request; for example, POST, GET, etc. timer An NRTimer that timed the network request headers A dictionary containing the HTTP response headers, if available httpStatusCode The response status code If the httpStatusCode is greater than or equal to 400, the agent will record a server error and may capture the responseData body if provided. bytesSent The size of the request body bytesReceived The size of the responseBody responseData The response body data, captured if the agent records server error params params Additional parameters included in an HTTP error metric if the HTTP transaction is an error For requests that fail due to a socket or operating system error, use this method: [NewRelic noticeNetworkFailureForURL:(NSURL *)url httpMethod:(NSString*)httpMethod withTimer:(NRTimer *)timer andFailureCode:(NSInteger)iOSFailureCode]; Copy Parameters include: Parameter Description url The URL of the request httpMethod The method type of the request; for example, POST, GET, etc. timer An NRTimer that timed the network request iOSFailureCode The failure code Failure codes are interpreted as NSURLError* code. To view a complete list of supported codes, see NRConstants.h. Instrument your Swift code To have your own Swift code appear in interaction code breakdowns and timelines: Add a startTracingMethod() call to the beginning of your method. Add a endTracingMethodWithTimer() call to the end of it. Always include an endTracingMethodWithTimer() call for each startTracingMethod() reference. Include only one set of these commands in a given method. func myMethod(){ let timer = NRTimer(); NewRelic.startTracingMethod(#selector(MyClass.myMethod), object: self, timer: timer, category: NRTraceTypeNone) // … existing code NewRelic.endTracingMethodWithTimer(timer) } Copy If you want your method’s performance to be included in the summary data on the APM Overview page, pass one of the NRTraceType enum values into the startTracingMethod() macro; for example: NewRelic.startTracingMethod(#selector(MyClass.myMethod), object: self, timer: timer, category: NRTraceTypeDatabase) Copy Create and complete Swift interactions By default, an interaction starts when a view controller is pushed. To manually start an interaction, use these API calls: let uniqueIdentifier = NewRelic.startInteraction(withName: \"My Interaction\") Copy This call will automatically begin tracking an interaction trace named My Interaction from the current line. It will also complete any previously running interaction. It returns a unique identifier that can be used to complete that interaction by using this API call: NewRelic.stopCurrentInteraction(uniqueIdentifier) Copy This method will complete the interaction associated with the uniqueIdentifier if that interaction has not already completed automatically. You do not need to call this method. Rename a default Swift interaction By default, the iOS agent will start an interaction trace when a new view controller is displayed. The interactions are named using the format Display <ViewController>. To change these default names, implement the @objc func customNewRelicInteractionName() -> String method in your view controller, where the string returned becomes the interaction's name. Set a custom application version with Swift The New Relic iOS SDK allows you to set a custom application version string. Instead of using the string defined in CFBundleShortVersionString, call the NewRelic.setApplicationVersion() method, and pass along the custom application version before calling NewRelic.startWithApplicationToken();. NewRelic.setApplicationVersion(String appVersion) Copy Set a custom build identifier with Swift As of version 5.1.0 of the New Relic iOS SDK, an API method allows you to set a custom build identifier that is displayed next to the application version in the Crash details page. Instead of using the CFBundleVersion string defined in Xcode, call the NewRelic.setApplicationBuild() method, and pass along the custom build identifier. NewRelic.setApplicationBuild(buildNumber) Copy Create custom metrics with Swift Custom metrics can help track high level events specific to your application. With the recordMetric API, you can record arbitrary numerical data and named events with Objective-C and Swift. You can also use several API calls to record custom metrics that provide different levels of detail. Swift: Report custom attributes and events Use methods in the NewRelic object to report custom attributes and events. For details about the available methods for custom attributes and events with Swift, see the iOS SDK API reference. Methods that return BOOL results return YES if they succeed, or NO if the operation did not complete. These methods are available in versions 5.0.0 or higher of the New Relic iOS SDK. The SDK can store up to 128 user-defined custom attributes at a time. If you attempt to store more than 128 attributes, the SDK returns NO. Custom attributes names should use the simplest format needed, and New Relic recommends single word attributes, containing no spaces. Attribute phrases can be formatted in camel case, so My Custom Attribute is better specified as myCustomAttribute. As with custom metrics: Avoid using the characters / ] [ | * when naming things. Avoid multi-byte characters. Swift: Track custom network requests If you can express a transactional network request in terms similar to an HTTP request, you can track it. Use URLs that are well-formed and do not include highly variable paths or hostnames. For requests that complete, use this method: NewRelic.noticeNetworkRequestForURL(url: NSURL!, httpMethod: String!, withTimer: NRTimer!, responseHeaders:[NSObject : AnyObject]!, statusCode: Int, bytesSent: UInt, bytesReceived: UInt, responseData: NSData!, andParams: [NSObject : AnyObject]!) Copy Parameters include: Parameter Description url The URL of the request httpMethod The method type of the request; for example, POST, GET, etc. timer An NRTimer that timed the network request headers A dictionary containing the HTTP response headers, if available httpStatusCode The response status code If the httpStatusCode is greater than or equal to 400, the agent will record a server error and may capture the responseData body if provided. bytesSent The size of the request body bytesReceived The size of the responseBody responseData The response body data, captured if the agent records Server error params params Additional parameters included in an HTTP error metric if the HTTP transaction is an error For requests that fail due to a socket or operating system error, use this method: NewRelic.noticeNetworkFailureForURL(url: NSURL!, httpMethod: NSString!, withTimer: NRTimer!, andFailureCode: Int) Copy Parameters include: Parameter Description url The URL of the request httpMethod The method type of the request; for example, POST, GET, etc. timer An NRTimer that timed the network request iOSFailureCode The failure code Failure codes are interpreted as NSURLError* code.

For a general overview of mobile monitoring functionality, see Introduction to mobile monitoring. Compatibility and requirements Before you install the iOS agent, review the compatibility and requirements. Install the agent As part of the installation process, New Relic automatically generates an application token. This is a 40-character hexadecimal string for authenticating each mobile app that you monitor. There are two ways you can install the iOS agent: We recommend you install and configure the iOS agent using the CocoaPods installation method. You can also manually install and configure the iOS agent by adding the New Relic framework to your app. Extend your instrumentation After you install the agent, you can extend the agent's default instrumentation with various types of custom data: To access: In the mobile UI: In New Relic One dashboards: Custom data Create and record custom events, interaction traces, and attributes to add details to your existing data and traces. You can also query the custom events that you created in New Relic One dashboards and NRQL. Network requests Enable the MobileRequest event feature so you can perform a full network analysis. To further investigate network request error rates and response times, query MobileRequest and MobileRequestError events. Crash analysis Review detailed information using groups and filters to analyze trends that lead to crashes. To view more information about crashes, create NRQL queries to review Insights charts related to crash data. iOS SDK API Use the iOS SDK API to instrument parts of your code that are not instrumented by default. Then, view those custom events and attributes in New Relic Insights. Handled exceptions Report exceptions so you can identify factors creating a poor mobile app experience. To further improve performance, review MobileHandledException event records in New Relic Insights. Breadcrumbs Boost the level of detail in crash event trails by adding breadcrumbs. Then, query MobileBreadcrumbs events to see all breadcrumbs or just breadcrumbs related to crashes. Troubleshoot your installation If the agent isn't reporting data, try these troubleshooting suggestions.",

Send custom attributes and events to Insights. Track networking from libraries not supported automatically. Set a custom identifier value with Objective-C or Swift to associate user sessions with analysis events and attributes (iOS SDK version 5.9.0 or higher). Caution Tracing is heavily optimized, but it does impose a performance overhead. Avoid instrumenting methods that are expected to be called hundreds of times. Install the SDK Ensure you have your app instrumented with the latest iOS SDK by going to one.newrelic.com > Add more data and following the instructions for iOS. This document contains the iOS SDK instrumentation requirements for: Objective C Swift For details about the available methods for custom attributes and events you can send to to New Relic Insights, see the iOS SDK API reference. You can also configure feature flags for: Objective-C Swift Automatically instrumented classes and methods The following methods (for the listed classes and their sub-classes) are already instrumented by New Relic. You do not need to add custom instrumentation to trace them. Classes Methods automatically instrumented by New Relic UIViewController viewDidLoad: viewWillAppear: viewDidAppear: viewWillDisappear: viewDidDisappear: viewWillLayoutSubviews: viewDidLayoutSubviews: UIImage imageNamed: imageWithContentsOfFile: imageWithData: imageWithData:scale: initWithContentsOfFile: initWithData: initWithData:scale: NSJSONSerialization JSONObjectWithData:options:error: JSONObjectWithStream:options:error: dataWithJSONObject:options:error: writeJSONObject:toStream:options:error: NSManagedObjectContext executeFetchRequest:error: processPendingChanges The agent aggregates performance for various methods into summary metrics that appear in the Interactions page. Summary categories include: View loading UI layout Database Images JSON Network Instrument your Objective-C code To have your own Objective-C code appear in interaction code breakdowns and timelines, add a _START call to the beginning of your method and a _STOP call to the end of it. Important Always include a _STOP for each _START, and only include one set of these commands in a given method. The trace system will automatically pick up the class and method name, and report performance metrics for your method to New Relic. - (void)myMethod { NR_TRACE_METHOD_START(0); // … existing code NR_TRACE_METHOD_STOP; } Copy If you are not using ARC, use this version of the _STOP macro to avoid memory leaks: NR_NONARC_TRACE_METHOD_STOP; Copy If you want your method’s performance to be included in the summary data on the APM Overview page, pass one of the NRTraceType enum values into the _START macro; for example: NR_TRACE_METHOD_START(NRTraceTypeDatabase); Copy Create and complete interactions By default, an interaction starts when a view controller is pushed. To manually start an interaction with Objective-C, use these API calls: NSString* uniqueIdentifier = NR_START_NAMED_INTERACTION(@\"name\"); Copy This macro will automatically begin tracking the name interaction trace from the current line. It will also complete any previously running interaction. It returns a unique identifier that can be used to complete that interaction by using this API call: NR_INTERACTION_STOP(uniqueIdentifier); Copy This macro will complete the interaction associated with the uniqueIdentifier if that interaction has not already completed automatically. You do not need to call this method. Rename a default interaction By default, the iOS agent will start an interaction trace when a new view controller is displayed. The interactions are named using the format Display <ViewController>. To change these default names with Objective-C, implement the - (NSString*) customNewRelicInteractionName instance method in your view controller, where the string returned becomes the interaction's name. Set a custom application version The New Relic iOS SDK allows you to set a custom application version string with Objective-C. Instead of using the string defined in CFBundleShortVersionString, call the +[NewRelic setApplicationVersion:] method and pass along the custom application version before calling +[NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:]; [NewRelic setApplicationVersion:(NSString*) appVersion]; Copy Set a custom build identifier As of version 5.1.0 of the New Relic iOS SDK, an API method allows you to set a custom build identifier that is displayed next to the application version in the Crash details page. Instead of using the CFBundleVersion string defined in Xcode with Objective-C, call the +[NewRelic setApplicationBuild:] method, and pass along the custom build identifier. [NewRelic setApplicationBuild:(NSString*) buildNumber]; Copy Create custom metrics Custom metrics can help track high level events specific to your application. With the recordMetric API, you can record arbitrary numerical data and named events with Objective-C and Swift. You can also use several API calls to record custom metrics that provide different levels of detail. Objective-C: Report custom attributes and events Use methods in the NewRelic object to report custom attributes and events. For details about the available methods for custom attributes and events with Objective-C, see the iOS SDK API reference. Methods that return BOOL results return YES if they succeed, or NO if the operation did not complete. These methods are available in versions 5.0.0 or higher of the New Relic iOS SDK. The SDK can store up to 128 user-defined custom attributes at a time. If you attempt to store more than 128 attributes, the SDK returns NO. Custom attributes names should use the simplest format needed, and New Relic recommends single word attributes, containing no spaces. Attribute phrases can be formatted in camel case, so My Custom Attribute is better specified as myCustomAttribute. As with custom metrics: Avoid using the characters / ] [ | * when naming things. Avoid multi-byte characters. Objective-C: Track custom network requests If you can express a transactional network request in terms similar to an HTTP request, you can track it. Use URLs that are well-formed and do not include highly variable paths or hostnames. For requests that complete, use this method: [NewRelic noticeNetworkRequestForURL:(NSURL*)url httpMethod:(NSString*)httpMethod withTimer:(NRTimer *)timer responseHeaders:(NSDictionary *)headers statusCode:(NSInteger)httpStatusCode bytesSent:(NSUInteger)bytesSent bytesReceived:(NSUInteger)bytesReceived responseData:(NSData *)responseData andParams:(NSDictionary *)params]; Copy Parameters include: Parameter Description url The URL of the request httpMethod The method type of the request; for example, POST, GET, etc. timer An NRTimer that timed the network request headers A dictionary containing the HTTP response headers, if available httpStatusCode The response status code If the httpStatusCode is greater than or equal to 400, the agent will record a server error and may capture the responseData body if provided. bytesSent The size of the request body bytesReceived The size of the responseBody responseData The response body data, captured if the agent records server error params params Additional parameters included in an HTTP error metric if the HTTP transaction is an error For requests that fail due to a socket or operating system error, use this method: [NewRelic noticeNetworkFailureForURL:(NSURL *)url httpMethod:(NSString*)httpMethod withTimer:(NRTimer *)timer andFailureCode:(NSInteger)iOSFailureCode]; Copy Parameters include: Parameter Description url The URL of the request httpMethod The method type of the request; for example, POST, GET, etc. timer An NRTimer that timed the network request iOSFailureCode The failure code Failure codes are interpreted as NSURLError* code. To view a complete list of supported codes, see NRConstants.h. Instrument your Swift code To have your own Swift code appear in interaction code breakdowns and timelines: Add a startTracingMethod() call to the beginning of your method. Add a endTracingMethodWithTimer() call to the end of it. Always include an endTracingMethodWithTimer() call for each startTracingMethod() reference. Include only one set of these commands in a given method. func myMethod(){ let timer = NRTimer(); NewRelic.startTracingMethod(#selector(MyClass.myMethod), object: self, timer: timer, category: NRTraceTypeNone) // … existing code NewRelic.endTracingMethodWithTimer(timer) } Copy If you want your method’s performance to be included in the summary data on the APM Overview page, pass one of the NRTraceType enum values into the startTracingMethod() macro; for example: NewRelic.startTracingMethod(#selector(MyClass.myMethod), object: self, timer: timer, category: NRTraceTypeDatabase) Copy Create and complete Swift interactions By default, an interaction starts when a view controller is pushed. To manually start an interaction, use these API calls: let uniqueIdentifier = NewRelic.startInteraction(withName: \"My Interaction\") Copy This call will automatically begin tracking an interaction trace named My Interaction from the current line. It will also complete any previously running interaction. It returns a unique identifier that can be used to complete that interaction by using this API call: NewRelic.stopCurrentInteraction(uniqueIdentifier) Copy This method will complete the interaction associated with the uniqueIdentifier if that interaction has not already completed automatically. You do not need to call this method. Rename a default Swift interaction By default, the iOS agent will start an interaction trace when a new view controller is displayed. The interactions are named using the format Display <ViewController>. To change these default names, implement the @objc func customNewRelicInteractionName() -> String method in your view controller, where the string returned becomes the interaction's name. Set a custom application version with Swift The New Relic iOS SDK allows you to set a custom application version string. Instead of using the string defined in CFBundleShortVersionString, call the NewRelic.setApplicationVersion() method, and pass along the custom application version before calling NewRelic.startWithApplicationToken();. NewRelic.setApplicationVersion(String appVersion) Copy Set a custom build identifier with Swift As of version 5.1.0 of the New Relic iOS SDK, an API method allows you to set a custom build identifier that is displayed next to the application version in the Crash details page. Instead of using the CFBundleVersion string defined in Xcode, call the NewRelic.setApplicationBuild() method, and pass along the custom build identifier.

Install the SDK Ensure you have your app instrumented with the latest iOS SDK by going to one.newrelic.com > Add more data and following the instructions for iOS. This document contains the iOS SDK instrumentation requirements for: Objective C Swift For details about the available methods for custom attributes and events you can send to to New Relic Insights, see the iOS SDK API reference. You can also configure feature flags for: Objective-C Swift Automatically instrumented classes and methods The following methods (for the listed classes and their sub-classes) are already instrumented by New Relic. You do not need to add custom instrumentation to trace them. Classes Methods automatically instrumented by New Relic UIViewController viewDidLoad: viewWillAppear: viewDidAppear: viewWillDisappear: viewDidDisappear: viewWillLayoutSubviews: viewDidLayoutSubviews: UIImage imageNamed: imageWithContentsOfFile: imageWithData: imageWithData:scale: initWithContentsOfFile: initWithData: initWithData:scale: NSJSONSerialization JSONObjectWithData:options:error: JSONObjectWithStream:options:error: dataWithJSONObject:options:error: writeJSONObject:toStream:options:error: NSManagedObjectContext executeFetchRequest:error: processPendingChanges The agent aggregates performance for various methods into summary metrics that appear in the Interactions page. Summary categories include: View loading UI layout Database Images JSON Network Instrument your Objective-C code To have your own Objective-C code appear in interaction code breakdowns and timelines, add a _START call to the beginning of your method and a _STOP call to the end of it. Important Always include a _STOP for each _START, and only include one set of these commands in a given method. The trace system will automatically pick up the class and method name, and report performance metrics for your method to New Relic. - (void)myMethod { NR_TRACE_METHOD_START(0); // … existing code NR_TRACE_METHOD_STOP; } Copy If you are not using ARC, use this version of the _STOP macro to avoid memory leaks: NR_NONARC_TRACE_METHOD_STOP; Copy If you want your method’s performance to be included in the summary data on the APM Overview page, pass one of the NRTraceType enum values into the _START macro; for example: NR_TRACE_METHOD_START(NRTraceTypeDatabase); Copy Create and complete interactions By default, an interaction starts when a view controller is pushed. To manually start an interaction with Objective-C, use these API calls: NSString* uniqueIdentifier = NR_START_NAMED_INTERACTION(@\"name\"); Copy This macro will automatically begin tracking the name interaction trace from the current line. It will also complete any previously running interaction. It returns a unique identifier that can be used to complete that interaction by using this API call: NR_INTERACTION_STOP(uniqueIdentifier); Copy This macro will complete the interaction associated with the uniqueIdentifier if that interaction has not already completed automatically. You do not need to call this method. Rename a default interaction By default, the iOS agent will start an interaction trace when a new view controller is displayed. The interactions are named using the format Display <ViewController>. To change these default names with Objective-C, implement the - (NSString*) customNewRelicInteractionName instance method in your view controller, where the string returned becomes the interaction's name. Set a custom application version The New Relic iOS SDK allows you to set a custom application version string with Objective-C. Instead of using the string defined in CFBundleShortVersionString, call the +[NewRelic setApplicationVersion:] method and pass along the custom application version before calling +[NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:]; [NewRelic setApplicationVersion:(NSString*) appVersion]; Copy Set a custom build identifier As of version 5.1.0 of the New Relic iOS SDK, an API method allows you to set a custom build identifier that is displayed next to the application version in the Crash details page. Instead of using the CFBundleVersion string defined in Xcode with Objective-C, call the +[NewRelic setApplicationBuild:] method, and pass along the custom build identifier. [NewRelic setApplicationBuild:(NSString*) buildNumber]; Copy Create custom metrics Custom metrics can help track high level events specific to your application. With the recordMetric API, you can record arbitrary numerical data and named events with Objective-C and Swift. You can also use several API calls to record custom metrics that provide different levels of detail. Objective-C: Report custom attributes and events Use methods in the NewRelic object to report custom attributes and events. For details about the available methods for custom attributes and events with Objective-C, see the iOS SDK API reference. Methods that return BOOL results return YES if they succeed, or NO if the operation did not complete. These methods are available in versions 5.0.0 or higher of the New Relic iOS SDK. The SDK can store up to 128 user-defined custom attributes at a time. If you attempt to store more than 128 attributes, the SDK returns NO. Custom attributes names should use the simplest format needed, and New Relic recommends single word attributes, containing no spaces. Attribute phrases can be formatted in camel case, so My Custom Attribute is better specified as myCustomAttribute. As with custom metrics: Avoid using the characters / ] [ | * when naming things. Avoid multi-byte characters. Objective-C: Track custom network requests If you can express a transactional network request in terms similar to an HTTP request, you can track it. Use URLs that are well-formed and do not include highly variable paths or hostnames. For requests that complete, use this method: [NewRelic noticeNetworkRequestForURL:(NSURL*)url httpMethod:(NSString*)httpMethod withTimer:(NRTimer *)timer responseHeaders:(NSDictionary *)headers statusCode:(NSInteger)httpStatusCode bytesSent:(NSUInteger)bytesSent bytesReceived:(NSUInteger)bytesReceived responseData:(NSData *)responseData andParams:(NSDictionary *)params]; Copy Parameters include: Parameter Description url The URL of the request httpMethod The method type of the request; for example, POST, GET, etc. timer An NRTimer that timed the network request headers A dictionary containing the HTTP response headers, if available httpStatusCode The response status code If the httpStatusCode is greater than or equal to 400, the agent will record a server error and may capture the responseData body if provided. bytesSent The size of the request body bytesReceived The size of the responseBody responseData The response body data, captured if the agent records server error params params Additional parameters included in an HTTP error metric if the HTTP transaction is an error For requests that fail due to a socket or operating system error, use this method: [NewRelic noticeNetworkFailureForURL:(NSURL *)url httpMethod:(NSString*)httpMethod withTimer:(NRTimer *)timer andFailureCode:(NSInteger)iOSFailureCode]; Copy Parameters include: Parameter Description url The URL of the request httpMethod The method type of the request; for example, POST, GET, etc. timer An NRTimer that timed the network request iOSFailureCode The failure code Failure codes are interpreted as NSURLError* code. To view a complete list of supported codes, see NRConstants.h. Instrument your Swift code To have your own Swift code appear in interaction code breakdowns and timelines: Add a startTracingMethod() call to the beginning of your method. Add a endTracingMethodWithTimer() call to the end of it. Always include an endTracingMethodWithTimer() call for each startTracingMethod() reference. Include only one set of these commands in a given method. func myMethod(){ let timer = NRTimer(); NewRelic.startTracingMethod(#selector(MyClass.myMethod), object: self, timer: timer, category: NRTraceTypeNone) // … existing code NewRelic.endTracingMethodWithTimer(timer) } Copy If you want your method’s performance to be included in the summary data on the APM Overview page, pass one of the NRTraceType enum values into the startTracingMethod() macro; for example: NewRelic.startTracingMethod(#selector(MyClass.myMethod), object: self, timer: timer, category: NRTraceTypeDatabase) Copy Create and complete Swift interactions By default, an interaction starts when a view controller is pushed. To manually start an interaction, use these API calls: let uniqueIdentifier = NewRelic.startInteraction(withName: \"My Interaction\") Copy This call will automatically begin tracking an interaction trace named My Interaction from the current line. It will also complete any previously running interaction. It returns a unique identifier that can be used to complete that interaction by using this API call: NewRelic.stopCurrentInteraction(uniqueIdentifier) Copy This method will complete the interaction associated with the uniqueIdentifier if that interaction has not already completed automatically. You do not need to call this method. Rename a default Swift interaction By default, the iOS agent will start an interaction trace when a new view controller is displayed. The interactions are named using the format Display <ViewController>. To change these default names, implement the @objc func customNewRelicInteractionName() -> String method in your view controller, where the string returned becomes the interaction's name. Set a custom application version with Swift The New Relic iOS SDK allows you to set a custom application version string. Instead of using the string defined in CFBundleShortVersionString, call the NewRelic.setApplicationVersion() method, and pass along the custom application version before calling NewRelic.startWithApplicationToken();. NewRelic.setApplicationVersion(String appVersion) Copy Set a custom build identifier with Swift As of version 5.1.0 of the New Relic iOS SDK, an API method allows you to set a custom build identifier that is displayed next to the application version in the Crash details page.

For a general overview of mobile monitoring functionality, see Introduction to mobile monitoring. Compatibility and requirements Before you install the iOS agent, review the compatibility and requirements. Install the agent As part of the installation process, New Relic automatically generates an application token. This is a 40-character hexadecimal string for authenticating each mobile app that you monitor. There are two ways you can install the iOS agent: We recommend you install and configure the iOS agent using the CocoaPods installation method. You can also manually install and configure the iOS agent by adding the New Relic framework to your app. Extend your instrumentation After you install the agent, you can extend the agent's default instrumentation with various types of custom data: To access: In the mobile UI: In New Relic One dashboards: Custom data Create and record custom events, interaction traces, and attributes to add details to your existing data and traces. You can also query the custom events that you created in New Relic One dashboards and NRQL. Network requests Enable the MobileRequest event feature so you can perform a full network analysis. To further investigate network request error rates and response times, query MobileRequest and MobileRequestError events. Crash analysis Review detailed information using groups and filters to analyze trends that lead to crashes. To view more information about crashes, create NRQL queries to review Insights charts related to crash data. iOS SDK API Use the iOS SDK API to instrument parts of your code that are not instrumented by default. Then, view those custom events and attributes in New Relic Insights. Handled exceptions Report exceptions so you can identify factors creating a poor mobile app experience. To further improve performance, review MobileHandledException event records in New Relic Insights. Breadcrumbs Boost the level of detail in crash event trails by adding breadcrumbs. Then, query MobileBreadcrumbs events to see all breadcrumbs or just breadcrumbs related to crashes.

Instead of using the string defined in CFBundleShortVersionString, call the +[NewRelic setApplicationVersion:] method and pass along the custom application version before calling +[NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:]; [NewRelic setApplicationVersion:(NSString*) appVersion]; Copy Set a custom build identifier As of version 5.1.0 of the New Relic iOS SDK, an API method allows you to set a custom build identifier that is displayed next to the application version in the Crash details page. Instead of using the CFBundleVersion string defined in Xcode with Objective-C, call the +[NewRelic setApplicationBuild:] method, and pass along the custom build identifier. [NewRelic setApplicationBuild:(NSString*) buildNumber]; Copy Create custom metrics Custom metrics can help track high level events specific to your application. With the recordMetric API, you can record arbitrary numerical data and named events with Objective-C and Swift. You can also use several API calls to record custom metrics that provide different levels of detail. Objective-C: Report custom attributes and events Use methods in the NewRelic object to report custom attributes and events. For details about the available methods for custom attributes and events with Objective-C, see the iOS SDK API reference. Methods that return BOOL results return YES if they succeed, or NO if the operation did not complete. These methods are available in versions 5.0.0 or higher of the New Relic iOS SDK. The SDK can store up to 128 user-defined custom attributes at a time. If you attempt to store more than 128 attributes, the SDK returns NO. Custom attributes names should use the simplest format needed, and New Relic recommends single word attributes, containing no spaces. Attribute phrases can be formatted in camel case, so My Custom Attribute is better specified as myCustomAttribute. As with custom metrics: Avoid using the characters / ] [ | * when naming things. Avoid multi-byte characters. Objective-C: Track custom network requests If you can express a transactional network request in terms similar to an HTTP request, you can track it. Use URLs that are well-formed and do not include highly variable paths or hostnames. For requests that complete, use this method: [NewRelic noticeNetworkRequestForURL:(NSURL*)url httpMethod:(NSString*)httpMethod withTimer:(NRTimer *)timer responseHeaders:(NSDictionary *)headers statusCode:(NSInteger)httpStatusCode bytesSent:(NSUInteger)bytesSent bytesReceived:(NSUInteger)bytesReceived responseData:(NSData *)responseData andParams:(NSDictionary *)params]; Copy Parameters include: Parameter Description url The URL of the request httpMethod The method type of the request; for example, POST, GET, etc. timer An NRTimer that timed the network request headers A dictionary containing the HTTP response headers, if available httpStatusCode The response status code If the httpStatusCode is greater than or equal to 400, the agent will record a server error and may capture the responseData body if provided. bytesSent The size of the request body bytesReceived The size of the responseBody responseData The response body data, captured if the agent records server error params params Additional parameters included in an HTTP error metric if the HTTP transaction is an error For requests that fail due to a socket or operating system error, use this method: [NewRelic noticeNetworkFailureForURL:(NSURL *)url httpMethod:(NSString*)httpMethod withTimer:(NRTimer *)timer andFailureCode:(NSInteger)iOSFailureCode]; Copy Parameters include: Parameter Description url The URL of the request httpMethod The method type of the request; for example, POST, GET, etc. timer An NRTimer that timed the network request iOSFailureCode The failure code Failure codes are interpreted as NSURLError* code. To view a complete list of supported codes, see NRConstants.h. Instrument your Swift code To have your own Swift code appear in interaction code breakdowns and timelines: Add a startTracingMethod() call to the beginning of your method. Add a endTracingMethodWithTimer() call to the end of it. Always include an endTracingMethodWithTimer() call for each startTracingMethod() reference. Include only one set of these commands in a given method. func myMethod(){ let timer = NRTimer(); NewRelic.startTracingMethod(#selector(MyClass.myMethod), object: self, timer: timer, category: NRTraceTypeNone) // … existing code NewRelic.endTracingMethodWithTimer(timer) } Copy If you want your method’s performance to be included in the summary data on the APM Overview page, pass one of the NRTraceType enum values into the startTracingMethod() macro; for example: NewRelic.startTracingMethod(#selector(MyClass.myMethod), object: self, timer: timer, category: NRTraceTypeDatabase) Copy Create and complete Swift interactions By default, an interaction starts when a view controller is pushed. To manually start an interaction, use these API calls: let uniqueIdentifier = NewRelic.startInteraction(withName: \"My Interaction\") Copy This call will automatically begin tracking an interaction trace named My Interaction from the current line. It will also complete any previously running interaction. It returns a unique identifier that can be used to complete that interaction by using this API call: NewRelic.stopCurrentInteraction(uniqueIdentifier) Copy This method will complete the interaction associated with the uniqueIdentifier if that interaction has not already completed automatically. You do not need to call this method. Rename a default Swift interaction By default, the iOS agent will start an interaction trace when a new view controller is displayed. The interactions are named using the format Display <ViewController>. To change these default names, implement the @objc func customNewRelicInteractionName() -> String method in your view controller, where the string returned becomes the interaction's name. Set a custom application version with Swift The New Relic iOS SDK allows you to set a custom application version string. Instead of using the string defined in CFBundleShortVersionString, call the NewRelic.setApplicationVersion() method, and pass along the custom application version before calling NewRelic.startWithApplicationToken();. NewRelic.setApplicationVersion(String appVersion) Copy Set a custom build identifier with Swift As of version 5.1.0 of the New Relic iOS SDK, an API method allows you to set a custom build identifier that is displayed next to the application version in the Crash details page. Instead of using the CFBundleVersion string defined in Xcode, call the NewRelic.setApplicationBuild() method, and pass along the custom build identifier.

For a general overview of mobile monitoring functionality, see Introduction to mobile monitoring. Compatibility and requirements Before you install the iOS agent, review the compatibility and requirements. Install the agent As part of the installation process, New Relic automatically generates an application token. This is a 40-character hexadecimal string for authenticating each mobile app that you monitor. There are two ways you can install the iOS agent: We recommend you install and configure the iOS agent using the CocoaPods installation method. You can also manually install and configure the iOS agent by adding the New Relic framework to your app. Extend your instrumentation After you install the agent, you can extend the agent's default instrumentation with various types of custom data: To access: In the mobile UI: In New Relic One dashboards: Custom data Create and record custom events, interaction traces, and attributes to add details to your existing data and traces. You can also query the custom events that you created in New Relic One dashboards and NRQL. Network requests Enable the MobileRequest event feature so you can perform a full network analysis. To further investigate network request error rates and response times, query MobileRequest and MobileRequestError events. Crash analysis Review detailed information using groups and filters to analyze trends that lead to crashes. To view more information about crashes, create NRQL queries to review Insights charts related to crash data. iOS SDK API Use the iOS SDK API to instrument parts of your code that are not instrumented by default. Then, view those custom events and attributes in New Relic Insights. Handled exceptions Report exceptions so you can identify factors creating a poor mobile app experience. To further improve performance, review MobileHandledException event records in New Relic Insights. Breadcrumbs Boost the level of detail in crash event trails by adding breadcrumbs. Then, query MobileBreadcrumbs events to see all breadcrumbs or just breadcrumbs related to crashes. Troubleshoot your installation If the agent isn't reporting data, try these troubleshooting suggestions.",

For a general overview of mobile monitoring functionality, see Introduction to mobile monitoring. Compatibility and requirements Before you install the iOS agent, review the compatibility and requirements. Install the agent As part of the installation process, New Relic automatically generates an application token. This is a 40-character hexadecimal string for authenticating each mobile app that you monitor. There are two ways you can install the iOS agent: We recommend you install and configure the iOS agent using the CocoaPods installation method. You can also manually install and configure the iOS agent by adding the New Relic framework to your app. Extend your instrumentation After you install the agent, you can extend the agent's default instrumentation with various types of custom data: To access: In the mobile UI: In New Relic One dashboards: Custom data Create and record custom events, interaction traces, and attributes to add details to your existing data and traces. You can also query the custom events that you created in New Relic One dashboards and NRQL. Network requests Enable the MobileRequest event feature so you can perform a full network analysis. To further investigate network request error rates and response times, query MobileRequest and MobileRequestError events. Crash analysis Review detailed information using groups and filters to analyze trends that lead to crashes. To view more information about crashes, create NRQL queries to review Insights charts related to crash data. iOS SDK API Use the iOS SDK API to instrument parts of your code that are not instrumented by default. Then, view those custom events and attributes in New Relic Insights. Handled exceptions Report exceptions so you can identify factors creating a poor mobile app experience. To further improve performance, review MobileHandledException event records in New Relic Insights. Breadcrumbs Boost the level of detail in crash event trails by adding breadcrumbs. Then, query MobileBreadcrumbs events to see all breadcrumbs or just breadcrumbs related to crashes. Troubleshoot your installation If the agent isn't reporting data, try these troubleshooting suggestions.",

Send custom attributes and events to Insights. Track networking from libraries not supported automatically. Set a custom identifier value with Objective-C or Swift to associate user sessions with analysis events and attributes (iOS SDK version 5.9.0 or higher). Caution Tracing is heavily optimized, but it does impose a performance overhead. Avoid instrumenting methods that are expected to be called hundreds of times. Install the SDK Ensure you have your app instrumented with the latest iOS SDK by going to one.newrelic.com > Add more data and following the instructions for iOS. This document contains the iOS SDK instrumentation requirements for: Objective C Swift For details about the available methods for custom attributes and events you can send to to New Relic Insights, see the iOS SDK API reference. You can also configure feature flags for: Objective-C Swift Automatically instrumented classes and methods The following methods (for the listed classes and their sub-classes) are already instrumented by New Relic. You do not need to add custom instrumentation to trace them. Classes Methods automatically instrumented by New Relic UIViewController viewDidLoad: viewWillAppear: viewDidAppear: viewWillDisappear: viewDidDisappear: viewWillLayoutSubviews: viewDidLayoutSubviews: UIImage imageNamed: imageWithContentsOfFile: imageWithData: imageWithData:scale: initWithContentsOfFile: initWithData: initWithData:scale: NSJSONSerialization JSONObjectWithData:options:error: JSONObjectWithStream:options:error: dataWithJSONObject:options:error: writeJSONObject:toStream:options:error: NSManagedObjectContext executeFetchRequest:error: processPendingChanges The agent aggregates performance for various methods into summary metrics that appear in the Interactions page. Summary categories include: View loading UI layout Database Images JSON Network Instrument your Objective-C code To have your own Objective-C code appear in interaction code breakdowns and timelines, add a _START call to the beginning of your method and a _STOP call to the end of it. Important Always include a _STOP for each _START, and only include one set of these commands in a given method. The trace system will automatically pick up the class and method name, and report performance metrics for your method to New Relic. - (void)myMethod { NR_TRACE_METHOD_START(0); // … existing code NR_TRACE_METHOD_STOP; } Copy If you are not using ARC, use this version of the _STOP macro to avoid memory leaks: NR_NONARC_TRACE_METHOD_STOP; Copy If you want your method’s performance to be included in the summary data on the APM Overview page, pass one of the NRTraceType enum values into the _START macro; for example: NR_TRACE_METHOD_START(NRTraceTypeDatabase); Copy Create and complete interactions By default, an interaction starts when a view controller is pushed. To manually start an interaction with Objective-C, use these API calls: NSString* uniqueIdentifier = NR_START_NAMED_INTERACTION(@\"name\"); Copy This macro will automatically begin tracking the name interaction trace from the current line. It will also complete any previously running interaction. It returns a unique identifier that can be used to complete that interaction by using this API call: NR_INTERACTION_STOP(uniqueIdentifier); Copy This macro will complete the interaction associated with the uniqueIdentifier if that interaction has not already completed automatically. You do not need to call this method. Rename a default interaction By default, the iOS agent will start an interaction trace when a new view controller is displayed. The interactions are named using the format Display <ViewController>. To change these default names with Objective-C, implement the - (NSString*) customNewRelicInteractionName instance method in your view controller, where the string returned becomes the interaction's name. Set a custom application version The New Relic iOS SDK allows you to set a custom application version string with Objective-C. Instead of using the string defined in CFBundleShortVersionString, call the +[NewRelic setApplicationVersion:] method and pass along the custom application version before calling +[NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:]; [NewRelic setApplicationVersion:(NSString*) appVersion]; Copy Set a custom build identifier As of version 5.1.0 of the New Relic iOS SDK, an API method allows you to set a custom build identifier that is displayed next to the application version in the Crash details page. Instead of using the CFBundleVersion string defined in Xcode with Objective-C, call the +[NewRelic setApplicationBuild:] method, and pass along the custom build identifier. [NewRelic setApplicationBuild:(NSString*) buildNumber]; Copy Create custom metrics Custom metrics can help track high level events specific to your application. With the recordMetric API, you can record arbitrary numerical data and named events with Objective-C and Swift. You can also use several API calls to record custom metrics that provide different levels of detail. Objective-C: Report custom attributes and events Use methods in the NewRelic object to report custom attributes and events. For details about the available methods for custom attributes and events with Objective-C, see the iOS SDK API reference. Methods that return BOOL results return YES if they succeed, or NO if the operation did not complete. These methods are available in versions 5.0.0 or higher of the New Relic iOS SDK. The SDK can store up to 128 user-defined custom attributes at a time. If you attempt to store more than 128 attributes, the SDK returns NO. Custom attributes names should use the simplest format needed, and New Relic recommends single word attributes, containing no spaces. Attribute phrases can be formatted in camel case, so My Custom Attribute is better specified as myCustomAttribute. As with custom metrics: Avoid using the characters / ] [ | * when naming things. Avoid multi-byte characters. Objective-C: Track custom network requests If you can express a transactional network request in terms similar to an HTTP request, you can track it. Use URLs that are well-formed and do not include highly variable paths or hostnames. For requests that complete, use this method: [NewRelic noticeNetworkRequestForURL:(NSURL*)url httpMethod:(NSString*)httpMethod withTimer:(NRTimer *)timer responseHeaders:(NSDictionary *)headers statusCode:(NSInteger)httpStatusCode bytesSent:(NSUInteger)bytesSent bytesReceived:(NSUInteger)bytesReceived responseData:(NSData *)responseData andParams:(NSDictionary *)params]; Copy Parameters include: Parameter Description url The URL of the request httpMethod The method type of the request; for example, POST, GET, etc. timer An NRTimer that timed the network request headers A dictionary containing the HTTP response headers, if available httpStatusCode The response status code If the httpStatusCode is greater than or equal to 400, the agent will record a server error and may capture the responseData body if provided. bytesSent The size of the request body bytesReceived The size of the responseBody responseData The response body data, captured if the agent records server error params params Additional parameters included in an HTTP error metric if the HTTP transaction is an error For requests that fail due to a socket or operating system error, use this method: [NewRelic noticeNetworkFailureForURL:(NSURL *)url httpMethod:(NSString*)httpMethod withTimer:(NRTimer *)timer andFailureCode:(NSInteger)iOSFailureCode]; Copy Parameters include: Parameter Description url The URL of the request httpMethod The method type of the request; for example, POST, GET, etc. timer An NRTimer that timed the network request iOSFailureCode The failure code Failure codes are interpreted as NSURLError* code. To view a complete list of supported codes, see NRConstants.h. Instrument your Swift code To have your own Swift code appear in interaction code breakdowns and timelines: Add a startTracingMethod() call to the beginning of your method. Add a endTracingMethodWithTimer() call to the end of it. Always include an endTracingMethodWithTimer() call for each startTracingMethod() reference. Include only one set of these commands in a given method. func myMethod(){ let timer = NRTimer(); NewRelic.startTracingMethod(#selector(MyClass.myMethod), object: self, timer: timer, category: NRTraceTypeNone) // … existing code NewRelic.endTracingMethodWithTimer(timer) } Copy If you want your method’s performance to be included in the summary data on the APM Overview page, pass one of the NRTraceType enum values into the startTracingMethod() macro; for example: NewRelic.startTracingMethod(#selector(MyClass.myMethod), object: self, timer: timer, category: NRTraceTypeDatabase) Copy Create and complete Swift interactions By default, an interaction starts when a view controller is pushed. To manually start an interaction, use these API calls: let uniqueIdentifier = NewRelic.startInteraction(withName: \"My Interaction\") Copy This call will automatically begin tracking an interaction trace named My Interaction from the current line. It will also complete any previously running interaction. It returns a unique identifier that can be used to complete that interaction by using this API call: NewRelic.stopCurrentInteraction(uniqueIdentifier) Copy This method will complete the interaction associated with the uniqueIdentifier if that interaction has not already completed automatically. You do not need to call this method. Rename a default Swift interaction By default, the iOS agent will start an interaction trace when a new view controller is displayed. The interactions are named using the format Display <ViewController>. To change these default names, implement the @objc func customNewRelicInteractionName() -> String method in your view controller, where the string returned becomes the interaction's name. Set a custom application version with Swift The New Relic iOS SDK allows you to set a custom application version string. Instead of using the string defined in CFBundleShortVersionString, call the NewRelic.setApplicationVersion() method, and pass along the custom application version before calling NewRelic.startWithApplicationToken();. NewRelic.setApplicationVersion(String appVersion) Copy Set a custom build identifier with Swift As of version 5.1.0 of the New Relic iOS SDK, an API method allows you to set a custom build identifier that is displayed next to the application version in the Crash details page.

For a general overview of mobile monitoring functionality, see Introduction to mobile monitoring. Compatibility and requirements Before you install the iOS agent, review the compatibility and requirements. Install the agent As part of the installation process, New Relic automatically generates an application token. This is a 40-character hexadecimal string for authenticating each mobile app that you monitor. There are two ways you can install the iOS agent: We recommend you install and configure the iOS agent using the CocoaPods installation method. You can also manually install and configure the iOS agent by adding the New Relic framework to your app. Extend your instrumentation After you install the agent, you can extend the agent's default instrumentation with various types of custom data: To access: In the mobile UI: In New Relic One dashboards: Custom data Create and record custom events, interaction traces, and attributes to add details to your existing data and traces. You can also query the custom events that you created in New Relic One dashboards and NRQL. Network requests Enable the MobileRequest event feature so you can perform a full network analysis. To further investigate network request error rates and response times, query MobileRequest and MobileRequestError events. Crash analysis Review detailed information using groups and filters to analyze trends that lead to crashes. To view more information about crashes, create NRQL queries to review Insights charts related to crash data. iOS SDK API Use the iOS SDK API to instrument parts of your code that are not instrumented by default. Then, view those custom events and attributes in New Relic Insights. Handled exceptions Report exceptions so you can identify factors creating a poor mobile app experience. To further improve performance, review MobileHandledException event records in New Relic Insights. Breadcrumbs Boost the level of detail in crash event trails by adding breadcrumbs. Then, query MobileBreadcrumbs events to see all breadcrumbs or just breadcrumbs related to crashes. Troubleshoot your installation If the agent isn't reporting data, try these troubleshooting suggestions.",

Send custom attributes and events to Insights. Track networking from libraries not supported automatically. Set a custom identifier value with Objective-C or Swift to associate user sessions with analysis events and attributes (iOS SDK version 5.9.0 or higher). Caution Tracing is heavily optimized, but it does impose a performance overhead. Avoid instrumenting methods that are expected to be called hundreds of times. Install the SDK Ensure you have your app instrumented with the latest iOS SDK by going to one.newrelic.com > Add more data and following the instructions for iOS. This document contains the iOS SDK instrumentation requirements for: Objective C Swift For details about the available methods for custom attributes and events you can send to to New Relic Insights, see the iOS SDK API reference. You can also configure feature flags for: Objective-C Swift Automatically instrumented classes and methods The following methods (for the listed classes and their sub-classes) are already instrumented by New Relic. You do not need to add custom instrumentation to trace them. Classes Methods automatically instrumented by New Relic UIViewController viewDidLoad: viewWillAppear: viewDidAppear: viewWillDisappear: viewDidDisappear: viewWillLayoutSubviews: viewDidLayoutSubviews: UIImage imageNamed: imageWithContentsOfFile: imageWithData: imageWithData:scale: initWithContentsOfFile: initWithData: initWithData:scale: NSJSONSerialization JSONObjectWithData:options:error: JSONObjectWithStream:options:error: dataWithJSONObject:options:error: writeJSONObject:toStream:options:error: NSManagedObjectContext executeFetchRequest:error: processPendingChanges The agent aggregates performance for various methods into summary metrics that appear in the Interactions page. Summary categories include: View loading UI layout Database Images JSON Network Instrument your Objective-C code To have your own Objective-C code appear in interaction code breakdowns and timelines, add a _START call to the beginning of your method and a _STOP call to the end of it. Important Always include a _STOP for each _START, and only include one set of these commands in a given method. The trace system will automatically pick up the class and method name, and report performance metrics for your method to New Relic. - (void)myMethod { NR_TRACE_METHOD_START(0); // … existing code NR_TRACE_METHOD_STOP; } Copy If you are not using ARC, use this version of the _STOP macro to avoid memory leaks: NR_NONARC_TRACE_METHOD_STOP; Copy If you want your method’s performance to be included in the summary data on the APM Overview page, pass one of the NRTraceType enum values into the _START macro; for example: NR_TRACE_METHOD_START(NRTraceTypeDatabase); Copy Create and complete interactions By default, an interaction starts when a view controller is pushed. To manually start an interaction with Objective-C, use these API calls: NSString* uniqueIdentifier = NR_START_NAMED_INTERACTION(@\"name\"); Copy This macro will automatically begin tracking the name interaction trace from the current line. It will also complete any previously running interaction. It returns a unique identifier that can be used to complete that interaction by using this API call: NR_INTERACTION_STOP(uniqueIdentifier); Copy This macro will complete the interaction associated with the uniqueIdentifier if that interaction has not already completed automatically. You do not need to call this method. Rename a default interaction By default, the iOS agent will start an interaction trace when a new view controller is displayed. The interactions are named using the format Display <ViewController>. To change these default names with Objective-C, implement the - (NSString*) customNewRelicInteractionName instance method in your view controller, where the string returned becomes the interaction's name. Set a custom application version The New Relic iOS SDK allows you to set a custom application version string with Objective-C. Instead of using the string defined in CFBundleShortVersionString, call the +[NewRelic setApplicationVersion:] method and pass along the custom application version before calling +[NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:]; [NewRelic setApplicationVersion:(NSString*) appVersion]; Copy Set a custom build identifier As of version 5.1.0 of the New Relic iOS SDK, an API method allows you to set a custom build identifier that is displayed next to the application version in the Crash details page. Instead of using the CFBundleVersion string defined in Xcode with Objective-C, call the +[NewRelic setApplicationBuild:] method, and pass along the custom build identifier. [NewRelic setApplicationBuild:(NSString*) buildNumber]; Copy Create custom metrics Custom metrics can help track high level events specific to your application. With the recordMetric API, you can record arbitrary numerical data and named events with Objective-C and Swift. You can also use several API calls to record custom metrics that provide different levels of detail. Objective-C: Report custom attributes and events Use methods in the NewRelic object to report custom attributes and events. For details about the available methods for custom attributes and events with Objective-C, see the iOS SDK API reference. Methods that return BOOL results return YES if they succeed, or NO if the operation did not complete. These methods are available in versions 5.0.0 or higher of the New Relic iOS SDK. The SDK can store up to 128 user-defined custom attributes at a time. If you attempt to store more than 128 attributes, the SDK returns NO. Custom attributes names should use the simplest format needed, and New Relic recommends single word attributes, containing no spaces. Attribute phrases can be formatted in camel case, so My Custom Attribute is better specified as myCustomAttribute. As with custom metrics: Avoid using the characters / ] [ | * when naming things. Avoid multi-byte characters. Objective-C: Track custom network requests If you can express a transactional network request in terms similar to an HTTP request, you can track it. Use URLs that are well-formed and do not include highly variable paths or hostnames. For requests that complete, use this method: [NewRelic noticeNetworkRequestForURL:(NSURL*)url httpMethod:(NSString*)httpMethod withTimer:(NRTimer *)timer responseHeaders:(NSDictionary *)headers statusCode:(NSInteger)httpStatusCode bytesSent:(NSUInteger)bytesSent bytesReceived:(NSUInteger)bytesReceived responseData:(NSData *)responseData andParams:(NSDictionary *)params]; Copy Parameters include: Parameter Description url The URL of the request httpMethod The method type of the request; for example, POST, GET, etc. timer An NRTimer that timed the network request headers A dictionary containing the HTTP response headers, if available httpStatusCode The response status code If the httpStatusCode is greater than or equal to 400, the agent will record a server error and may capture the responseData body if provided. bytesSent The size of the request body bytesReceived The size of the responseBody responseData The response body data, captured if the agent records server error params params Additional parameters included in an HTTP error metric if the HTTP transaction is an error For requests that fail due to a socket or operating system error, use this method: [NewRelic noticeNetworkFailureForURL:(NSURL *)url httpMethod:(NSString*)httpMethod withTimer:(NRTimer *)timer andFailureCode:(NSInteger)iOSFailureCode]; Copy Parameters include: Parameter Description url The URL of the request httpMethod The method type of the request; for example, POST, GET, etc. timer An NRTimer that timed the network request iOSFailureCode The failure code Failure codes are interpreted as NSURLError* code. To view a complete list of supported codes, see NRConstants.h. Instrument your Swift code To have your own Swift code appear in interaction code breakdowns and timelines: Add a startTracingMethod() call to the beginning of your method. Add a endTracingMethodWithTimer() call to the end of it. Always include an endTracingMethodWithTimer() call for each startTracingMethod() reference. Include only one set of these commands in a given method. func myMethod(){ let timer = NRTimer(); NewRelic.startTracingMethod(#selector(MyClass.myMethod), object: self, timer: timer, category: NRTraceTypeNone) // … existing code NewRelic.endTracingMethodWithTimer(timer) } Copy If you want your method’s performance to be included in the summary data on the APM Overview page, pass one of the NRTraceType enum values into the startTracingMethod() macro; for example: NewRelic.startTracingMethod(#selector(MyClass.myMethod), object: self, timer: timer, category: NRTraceTypeDatabase) Copy Create and complete Swift interactions By default, an interaction starts when a view controller is pushed. To manually start an interaction, use these API calls: let uniqueIdentifier = NewRelic.startInteraction(withName: \"My Interaction\") Copy This call will automatically begin tracking an interaction trace named My Interaction from the current line. It will also complete any previously running interaction. It returns a unique identifier that can be used to complete that interaction by using this API call: NewRelic.stopCurrentInteraction(uniqueIdentifier) Copy This method will complete the interaction associated with the uniqueIdentifier if that interaction has not already completed automatically. You do not need to call this method. Rename a default Swift interaction By default, the iOS agent will start an interaction trace when a new view controller is displayed. The interactions are named using the format Display <ViewController>. To change these default names, implement the @objc func customNewRelicInteractionName() -> String method in your view controller, where the string returned becomes the interaction's name. Set a custom application version with Swift The New Relic iOS SDK allows you to set a custom application version string. Instead of using the string defined in CFBundleShortVersionString, call the NewRelic.setApplicationVersion() method, and pass along the custom application version before calling NewRelic.startWithApplicationToken();. NewRelic.setApplicationVersion(String appVersion) Copy Set a custom build identifier with Swift As of version 5.1.0 of the New Relic iOS SDK, an API method allows you to set a custom build identifier that is displayed next to the application version in the Crash details page.

Summary categories include: View loading UI layout Database Images JSON Network Instrument your Objective-C code To have your own Objective-C code appear in interaction code breakdowns and timelines, add a _START call to the beginning of your method and a _STOP call to the end of it. Important Always include a _STOP for each _START, and only include one set of these commands in a given method. The trace system will automatically pick up the class and method name, and report performance metrics for your method to New Relic. - (void)myMethod { NR_TRACE_METHOD_START(0); // … existing code NR_TRACE_METHOD_STOP; } Copy If you are not using ARC, use this version of the _STOP macro to avoid memory leaks: NR_NONARC_TRACE_METHOD_STOP; Copy If you want your method’s performance to be included in the summary data on the APM Overview page, pass one of the NRTraceType enum values into the _START macro; for example: NR_TRACE_METHOD_START(NRTraceTypeDatabase); Copy Create and complete interactions By default, an interaction starts when a view controller is pushed. To manually start an interaction with Objective-C, use these API calls: NSString* uniqueIdentifier = NR_START_NAMED_INTERACTION(@\"name\"); Copy This macro will automatically begin tracking the name interaction trace from the current line. It will also complete any previously running interaction. It returns a unique identifier that can be used to complete that interaction by using this API call: NR_INTERACTION_STOP(uniqueIdentifier); Copy This macro will complete the interaction associated with the uniqueIdentifier if that interaction has not already completed automatically. You do not need to call this method. Rename a default interaction By default, the iOS agent will start an interaction trace when a new view controller is displayed. The interactions are named using the format Display <ViewController>. To change these default names with Objective-C, implement the - (NSString*) customNewRelicInteractionName instance method in your view controller, where the string returned becomes the interaction's name. Set a custom application version The New Relic iOS SDK allows you to set a custom application version string with Objective-C. Instead of using the string defined in CFBundleShortVersionString, call the +[NewRelic setApplicationVersion:] method and pass along the custom application version before calling +[NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:]; [NewRelic setApplicationVersion:(NSString*) appVersion]; Copy Set a custom build identifier As of version 5.1.0 of the New Relic iOS SDK, an API method allows you to set a custom build identifier that is displayed next to the application version in the Crash details page. Instead of using the CFBundleVersion string defined in Xcode with Objective-C, call the +[NewRelic setApplicationBuild:] method, and pass along the custom build identifier. [NewRelic setApplicationBuild:(NSString*) buildNumber]; Copy Create custom metrics Custom metrics can help track high level events specific to your application. With the recordMetric API, you can record arbitrary numerical data and named events with Objective-C and Swift. You can also use several API calls to record custom metrics that provide different levels of detail. Objective-C: Report custom attributes and events Use methods in the NewRelic object to report custom attributes and events. For details about the available methods for custom attributes and events with Objective-C, see the iOS SDK API reference. Methods that return BOOL results return YES if they succeed, or NO if the operation did not complete. These methods are available in versions 5.0.0 or higher of the New Relic iOS SDK. The SDK can store up to 128 user-defined custom attributes at a time. If you attempt to store more than 128 attributes, the SDK returns NO. Custom attributes names should use the simplest format needed, and New Relic recommends single word attributes, containing no spaces. Attribute phrases can be formatted in camel case, so My Custom Attribute is better specified as myCustomAttribute. As with custom metrics: Avoid using the characters / ] [ | * when naming things. Avoid multi-byte characters. Objective-C: Track custom network requests If you can express a transactional network request in terms similar to an HTTP request, you can track it. Use URLs that are well-formed and do not include highly variable paths or hostnames. For requests that complete, use this method: [NewRelic noticeNetworkRequestForURL:(NSURL*)url httpMethod:(NSString*)httpMethod withTimer:(NRTimer *)timer responseHeaders:(NSDictionary *)headers statusCode:(NSInteger)httpStatusCode bytesSent:(NSUInteger)bytesSent bytesReceived:(NSUInteger)bytesReceived responseData:(NSData *)responseData andParams:(NSDictionary *)params]; Copy Parameters include: Parameter Description url The URL of the request httpMethod The method type of the request; for example, POST, GET, etc. timer An NRTimer that timed the network request headers A dictionary containing the HTTP response headers, if available httpStatusCode The response status code If the httpStatusCode is greater than or equal to 400, the agent will record a server error and may capture the responseData body if provided. bytesSent The size of the request body bytesReceived The size of the responseBody responseData The response body data, captured if the agent records server error params params Additional parameters included in an HTTP error metric if the HTTP transaction is an error For requests that fail due to a socket or operating system error, use this method: [NewRelic noticeNetworkFailureForURL:(NSURL *)url httpMethod:(NSString*)httpMethod withTimer:(NRTimer *)timer andFailureCode:(NSInteger)iOSFailureCode]; Copy Parameters include: Parameter Description url The URL of the request httpMethod The method type of the request; for example, POST, GET, etc. timer An NRTimer that timed the network request iOSFailureCode The failure code Failure codes are interpreted as NSURLError* code.

To manually start an interaction, use these API calls: let uniqueIdentifier = NewRelic.startInteraction(withName: \"My Interaction\") Copy This call will automatically begin tracking an interaction trace named My Interaction from the current line. It will also complete any previously running interaction. It returns a unique identifier that can be used to complete that interaction by using this API call: NewRelic.stopCurrentInteraction(uniqueIdentifier) Copy This method will complete the interaction associated with the uniqueIdentifier if that interaction has not already completed automatically.

For a general overview of mobile monitoring functionality, see Introduction to mobile monitoring. Compatibility and requirements Before you install the iOS agent, review the compatibility and requirements. Install the agent As part of the installation process, New Relic automatically generates an application token. This is a 40-character hexadecimal string for authenticating each mobile app that you monitor. There are two ways you can install the iOS agent: We recommend you install and configure the iOS agent using the CocoaPods installation method. You can also manually install and configure the iOS agent by adding the New Relic framework to your app. Extend your instrumentation After you install the agent, you can extend the agent's default instrumentation with various types of custom data: To access: In the mobile UI: In New Relic One dashboards: Custom data Create and record custom events, interaction traces, and attributes to add details to your existing data and traces. You can also query the custom events that you created in New Relic One dashboards and NRQL. Network requests Enable the MobileRequest event feature so you can perform a full network analysis. To further investigate network request error rates and response times, query MobileRequest and MobileRequestError events. Crash analysis Review detailed information using groups and filters to analyze trends that lead to crashes. To view more information about crashes, create NRQL queries to review Insights charts related to crash data. iOS SDK API Use the iOS SDK API to instrument parts of your code that are not instrumented by default. Then, view those custom events and attributes in New Relic Insights. Handled exceptions Report exceptions so you can identify factors creating a poor mobile app experience. To further improve performance, review MobileHandledException event records in New Relic Insights. Breadcrumbs Boost the level of detail in crash event trails by adding breadcrumbs. Then, query MobileBreadcrumbs events to see all breadcrumbs or just breadcrumbs related to crashes. Troubleshoot your installation If the agent isn't reporting data, try these troubleshooting suggestions.",

NewRelic.setApplicationVersion(String appVersion) Copy Set a custom build identifier with Swift As of version 5.1.0 of the New Relic iOS SDK, an API method allows you to set a custom build identifier that is displayed next to the application version in the Crash details page. Instead of using the CFBundleVersion string defined in Xcode, call the NewRelic.setApplicationBuild() method, and pass along the custom build identifier. NewRelic.setApplicationBuild(buildNumber) Copy Create custom metrics with Swift Custom metrics can help track high level events specific to your application. With the recordMetric API, you can record arbitrary numerical data and named events with Objective-C and Swift. You can also use several API calls to record custom metrics that provide different levels of detail. Swift: Report custom attributes and events Use methods in the NewRelic object to report custom attributes and events. For details about the available methods for custom attributes and events with Swift, see the iOS SDK API reference. Methods that return BOOL results return YES if they succeed, or NO if the operation did not complete. These methods are available in versions 5.0.0 or higher of the New Relic iOS SDK. The SDK can store up to 128 user-defined custom attributes at a time. If you attempt to store more than 128 attributes, the SDK returns NO. Custom attributes names should use the simplest format needed, and New Relic recommends single word attributes, containing no spaces. Attribute phrases can be formatted in camel case, so My Custom Attribute is better specified as myCustomAttribute. As with custom metrics: Avoid using the characters / ] [ | * when naming things. Avoid multi-byte characters. Swift: Track custom network requests If you can express a transactional network request in terms similar to an HTTP request, you can track it. Use URLs that are well-formed and do not include highly variable paths or hostnames. For requests that complete, use this method: NewRelic.noticeNetworkRequestForURL(url: NSURL!, httpMethod: String!, withTimer: NRTimer!, responseHeaders:[NSObject : AnyObject]!, statusCode: Int, bytesSent: UInt, bytesReceived: UInt, responseData: NSData!, andParams: [NSObject : AnyObject]!) Copy Parameters include: Parameter Description url The URL of the request httpMethod The method type of the request; for example, POST, GET, etc. timer An NRTimer that timed the network request headers A dictionary containing the HTTP response headers, if available httpStatusCode The response status code If the httpStatusCode is greater than or equal to 400, the agent will record a server error and may capture the responseData body if provided. bytesSent The size of the request body bytesReceived The size of the responseBody responseData The response body data, captured if the agent records Server error params params Additional parameters included in an HTTP error metric if the HTTP transaction is an error For requests that fail due to a socket or operating system error, use this method: NewRelic.noticeNetworkFailureForURL(url: NSURL!, httpMethod: NSString!, withTimer: NRTimer!, andFailureCode: Int) Copy Parameters include: Parameter Description url The URL of the request httpMethod The method type of the request; for example, POST, GET, etc. timer An NRTimer that timed the network request iOSFailureCode The failure code Failure codes are interpreted as NSURLError* code.

For a general overview of mobile monitoring functionality, see Introduction to mobile monitoring. Compatibility and requirements Before you install the iOS agent, review the compatibility and requirements. Install the agent As part of the installation process, New Relic automatically generates an application token. This is a 40-character hexadecimal string for authenticating each mobile app that you monitor. There are two ways you can install the iOS agent: We recommend you install and configure the iOS agent using the CocoaPods installation method. You can also manually install and configure the iOS agent by adding the New Relic framework to your app. Extend your instrumentation After you install the agent, you can extend the agent's default instrumentation with various types of custom data: To access: In the mobile UI: In New Relic One dashboards: Custom data Create and record custom events, interaction traces, and attributes to add details to your existing data and traces. You can also query the custom events that you created in New Relic One dashboards and NRQL. Network requests Enable the MobileRequest event feature so you can perform a full network analysis. To further investigate network request error rates and response times, query MobileRequest and MobileRequestError events. Crash analysis Review detailed information using groups and filters to analyze trends that lead to crashes. To view more information about crashes, create NRQL queries to review Insights charts related to crash data. iOS SDK API Use the iOS SDK API to instrument parts of your code that are not instrumented by default. Then, view those custom events and attributes in New Relic Insights. Handled exceptions Report exceptions so you can identify factors creating a poor mobile app experience. To further improve performance, review MobileHandledException event records in New Relic Insights. Breadcrumbs Boost the level of detail in crash event trails by adding breadcrumbs. Then, query MobileBreadcrumbs events to see all breadcrumbs or just breadcrumbs related to crashes. Troubleshoot your installation If the agent isn't reporting data, try these troubleshooting suggestions.",

Summary categories include: View loading UI layout Database Images JSON Network Instrument your Objective-C code To have your own Objective-C code appear in interaction code breakdowns and timelines, add a _START call to the beginning of your method and a _STOP call to the end of it. Important Always include a _STOP for each _START, and only include one set of these commands in a given method. The trace system will automatically pick up the class and method name, and report performance metrics for your method to New Relic. - (void)myMethod { NR_TRACE_METHOD_START(0); // … existing code NR_TRACE_METHOD_STOP; } Copy If you are not using ARC, use this version of the _STOP macro to avoid memory leaks: NR_NONARC_TRACE_METHOD_STOP; Copy If you want your method’s performance to be included in the summary data on the APM Overview page, pass one of the NRTraceType enum values into the _START macro; for example: NR_TRACE_METHOD_START(NRTraceTypeDatabase); Copy Create and complete interactions By default, an interaction starts when a view controller is pushed. To manually start an interaction with Objective-C, use these API calls: NSString* uniqueIdentifier = NR_START_NAMED_INTERACTION(@\"name\"); Copy This macro will automatically begin tracking the name interaction trace from the current line. It will also complete any previously running interaction. It returns a unique identifier that can be used to complete that interaction by using this API call: NR_INTERACTION_STOP(uniqueIdentifier); Copy This macro will complete the interaction associated with the uniqueIdentifier if that interaction has not already completed automatically. You do not need to call this method. Rename a default interaction By default, the iOS agent will start an interaction trace when a new view controller is displayed. The interactions are named using the format Display <ViewController>. To change these default names with Objective-C, implement the - (NSString*) customNewRelicInteractionName instance method in your view controller, where the string returned becomes the interaction's name. Set a custom application version The New Relic iOS SDK allows you to set a custom application version string with Objective-C. Instead of using the string defined in CFBundleShortVersionString, call the +[NewRelic setApplicationVersion:] method and pass along the custom application version before calling +[NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:]; [NewRelic setApplicationVersion:(NSString*) appVersion]; Copy Set a custom build identifier As of version 5.1.0 of the New Relic iOS SDK, an API method allows you to set a custom build identifier that is displayed next to the application version in the Crash details page. Instead of using the CFBundleVersion string defined in Xcode with Objective-C, call the +[NewRelic setApplicationBuild:] method, and pass along the custom build identifier.

Methods that return BOOL results return YES if they succeed, or NO if the operation did not complete. These methods are available in versions 5.0.0 or higher of the New Relic iOS SDK. The SDK can store up to 128 user-defined custom attributes at a time. If you attempt to store more than 128 attributes, the SDK returns NO. Custom attributes names should use the simplest format needed, and New Relic recommends single word attributes, containing no spaces. Attribute phrases can be formatted in camel case, so My Custom Attribute is better specified as myCustomAttribute. As with custom metrics: Avoid using the characters / ] [ | * when naming things. Avoid multi-byte characters. Objective-C: Track custom network requests If you can express a transactional network request in terms similar to an HTTP request, you can track it. Use URLs that are well-formed and do not include highly variable paths or hostnames. For requests that complete, use this method: [NewRelic noticeNetworkRequestForURL:(NSURL*)url httpMethod:(NSString*)httpMethod withTimer:(NRTimer *)timer responseHeaders:(NSDictionary *)headers statusCode:(NSInteger)httpStatusCode bytesSent:(NSUInteger)bytesSent bytesReceived:(NSUInteger)bytesReceived responseData:(NSData *)responseData andParams:(NSDictionary *)params]; Copy Parameters include: Parameter Description url The URL of the request httpMethod The method type of the request; for example, POST, GET, etc. timer An NRTimer that timed the network request headers A dictionary containing the HTTP response headers, if available httpStatusCode The response status code If the httpStatusCode is greater than or equal to 400, the agent will record a server error and may capture the responseData body if provided. bytesSent The size of the request body bytesReceived The size of the responseBody responseData The response body data, captured if the agent records server error params params Additional parameters included in an HTTP error metric if the HTTP transaction is an error For requests that fail due to a socket or operating system error, use this method: [NewRelic noticeNetworkFailureForURL:(NSURL *)url httpMethod:(NSString*)httpMethod withTimer:(NRTimer *)timer andFailureCode:(NSInteger)iOSFailureCode]; Copy Parameters include: Parameter Description url The URL of the request httpMethod The method type of the request; for example, POST, GET, etc. timer An NRTimer that timed the network request iOSFailureCode The failure code Failure codes are interpreted as NSURLError* code. To view a complete list of supported codes, see NRConstants.h. Instrument your Swift code To have your own Swift code appear in interaction code breakdowns and timelines: Add a startTracingMethod() call to the beginning of your method. Add a endTracingMethodWithTimer() call to the end of it. Always include an endTracingMethodWithTimer() call for each startTracingMethod() reference. Include only one set of these commands in a given method. func myMethod(){ let timer = NRTimer(); NewRelic.startTracingMethod(#selector(MyClass.myMethod), object: self, timer: timer, category: NRTraceTypeNone) // … existing code NewRelic.endTracingMethodWithTimer(timer) } Copy If you want your method’s performance to be included in the summary data on the APM Overview page, pass one of the NRTraceType enum values into the startTracingMethod() macro; for example: NewRelic.startTracingMethod(#selector(MyClass.myMethod), object: self, timer: timer, category: NRTraceTypeDatabase) Copy Create and complete Swift interactions By default, an interaction starts when a view controller is pushed. To manually start an interaction, use these API calls: let uniqueIdentifier = NewRelic.startInteraction(withName: \"My Interaction\") Copy This call will automatically begin tracking an interaction trace named My Interaction from the current line. It will also complete any previously running interaction. It returns a unique identifier that can be used to complete that interaction by using this API call: NewRelic.stopCurrentInteraction(uniqueIdentifier) Copy This method will complete the interaction associated with the uniqueIdentifier if that interaction has not already completed automatically.

In the Podfile for your project, add the following line: pod 'NewRelicAgent' Copy Close your project in Xcode, and update it by running this command from the Terminal in your project directory: pod install Copy Open your project in Xcode by running this command from the Terminal in your project directory: open App.xcworkspace Copy In your APP_NAME-Prefix.pch project file (generally found in the Supporting Files folder), include the New Relic header inside the #ifdef __OBJC__ #endif block: #import <NewRelic/NewRelic.h> Copy In your AppDelegate.m file, add this call as the first line of application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions, replacing APP_TOKEN with your application token: [NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:@\"APP_TOKEN\"]; Copy Important The agent must be on the first line of didFinishLaunchingWithOptions and run on the main thread to ensure proper instrumentation. Starting the call later, on a background thread, or asynchronously can cause unexpected or unstable behavior. Add a build script to your target's Build Phases. Ensure the new build script is the very last build script. Then paste the following, replacing APP_TOKEN with your application token: SCRIPT=`/usr/bin/find \"${SRCROOT}\" -name newrelic_postbuild.sh | head -n 1` /bin/sh \"${SCRIPT}\" \"APP_TOKEN\" Copy Clean and build your app, then run it in the simulator or other device. Configure using Swift These procedures to configure your iOS app with CocoaPods and Swift also appear on the Get Started page in New Relic.

      "body": "Your app's dSYM files are stored in Xcode's dSYM archive path folder. This is the folder where the iOS agent gets the dSYM files that are used to symbolicate your crash reports. New Relic provides a post-build script as part of the iOS agent's install process and the tvOS agent's install process. This script automatically uploads your app's dSYM files. Automatic script The script automatically uploads dSYM files only for release builds. Non-release builds must upload their files either manually or through the mobile monitoring UI. Bitcode-enabled apps have their dSYM files generated by Apple. You must download the dSYM files for Bitcode-enabled apps from Apple and upload them to New Relic. If you see unreadable machine code in the Crashes page, your dSYM files may not be uploaded correctly. In some cases, you may need to manually upload dSYM files. The automatic script uses Python 2. As of October 2019 with macOS 10.15 (Catalina), Python won't be installed by default. If you're using the automatic script (recommended), you may need to manually install Python 2. If you're using Homebrew, see Python on Homebrew. Identify missing dSYMs When a Bitcode-enabled app is uploaded to Apple for App Store review or ad-hoc distribution, dSYMs need to be manually downloaded from Apple and uploaded to New Relic to allow the mobile crash reports to be properly symbolicated. These dSYMs can be downloaded through the archives organizer in Xcode within several minutes of uploading the app. In this situation follow the procedures to find the archive and download dSYMs. If an app is missing a dSYM file, you'll see three indicators in the mobile monitoring UI: Banner notification: A banner warning appears on the Crash report page. The warning reads: We were unable to locate your dsym. Copy Upload prompt: From the Crash type summary page you will be automatically prompted to upload a dSYM file if it is missing. Machine code: The crash stack trace on the Crash report page displays machine code and not a human-readable error message. Upload dSYM files through the mobile monitoring UI You can easily upload your dSYM files directly from the New Relic One UI. The maximum file size is 600 MB. To upload your dSYM files: Go to one.newrelic.com and click Mobile. Then select your app from the list. View Crash analysis. Select a specific crash from the Crash types list. Click Upload dSYM. You can either drag and drop your dSYMs directly, or select the file form your computer. Manually upload dSYM files In some circumstances, New Relic's automatic upload of dSYM files may fail. If a dSYM upload is attempted and fails, it creates a build error with a detailed message. For example, if there's a network failure and the dSYM upload isn't completed, Xcode will report an error. For additional information about how New Relic handles dSYM uploads, see New Relic's Online Technical Community. If the automatic upload fails, you can manually upload your dSYM file. If you have multiple dSYM files, they can be within a single zip with a maximum file size of 600 MB. The YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APPLICATION_TOKEN value in the commands below is the same key used for +[NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:] (in Objective-C) or NewRelic.start(withApplicationToken:) (in Swift). To manually upload your dSYM files: Via Python script (agent versions 6.0.0 or higher) In iOS agent versions 6.0.0 or higher, the agent includes a Python script that automatically processes and uploads symbols. You can call this script from the command line: NewRelicAgent.framework/Resources/generateMap.py \"DSYM_ARCHIVE_PATH\" \"YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APPLICATION_TOKEN\" Copy Via command line To manually upload individual dSYM files from the command line: Zip up your dSYM file or files using the following command.

Compatibility and requirements Before you install the iOS agent, review the compatibility and requirements. Install the agent As part of the installation process, New Relic automatically generates an application token. This is a 40-character hexadecimal string for authenticating each mobile app that you monitor. There are two ways you can install the iOS agent: We recommend you install and configure the iOS agent using the CocoaPods installation method. You can also manually install and configure the iOS agent by adding the New Relic framework to your app. Extend your instrumentation After you install the agent, you can extend the agent's default instrumentation with various types of custom data: To access: In the mobile UI: In New Relic One dashboards: Custom data Create and record custom events, interaction traces, and attributes to add details to your existing data and traces. You can also query the custom events that you created in New Relic One dashboards and NRQL. Network requests Enable the MobileRequest event feature so you can perform a full network analysis. To further investigate network request error rates and response times, query MobileRequest and MobileRequestError events. Crash analysis Review detailed information using groups and filters to analyze trends that lead to crashes. To view more information about crashes, create NRQL queries to review Insights charts related to crash data. iOS SDK API Use the iOS SDK API to instrument parts of your code that are not instrumented by default. Then, view those custom events and attributes in New Relic Insights. Handled exceptions Report exceptions so you can identify factors creating a poor mobile app experience. To further improve performance, review MobileHandledException event records in New Relic Insights. Breadcrumbs Boost the level of detail in crash event trails by adding breadcrumbs. Then, query MobileBreadcrumbs events to see all breadcrumbs or just breadcrumbs related to crashes. Troubleshoot your installation If the agent isn't reporting data, try these troubleshooting suggestions.",

      "body": "Your app's dSYM files are stored in Xcode's dSYM archive path folder. This is the folder where the iOS agent gets the dSYM files that are used to symbolicate your crash reports. New Relic provides a post-build script as part of the iOS agent's install process and the tvOS agent's install process. This script automatically uploads your app's dSYM files. Automatic script The script automatically uploads dSYM files only for release builds. Non-release builds must upload their files either manually or through the mobile monitoring UI. Bitcode-enabled apps have their dSYM files generated by Apple. You must download the dSYM files for Bitcode-enabled apps from Apple and upload them to New Relic. If you see unreadable machine code in the Crashes page, your dSYM files may not be uploaded correctly. In some cases, you may need to manually upload dSYM files. The automatic script uses Python 2. As of October 2019 with macOS 10.15 (Catalina), Python won't be installed by default. If you're using the automatic script (recommended), you may need to manually install Python 2. If you're using Homebrew, see Python on Homebrew. Identify missing dSYMs When a Bitcode-enabled app is uploaded to Apple for App Store review or ad-hoc distribution, dSYMs need to be manually downloaded from Apple and uploaded to New Relic to allow the mobile crash reports to be properly symbolicated. These dSYMs can be downloaded through the archives organizer in Xcode within several minutes of uploading the app. In this situation follow the procedures to find the archive and download dSYMs. If an app is missing a dSYM file, you'll see three indicators in the mobile monitoring UI: Banner notification: A banner warning appears on the Crash report page. The warning reads: We were unable to locate your dsym. Copy Upload prompt: From the Crash type summary page you will be automatically prompted to upload a dSYM file if it is missing. Machine code: The crash stack trace on the Crash report page displays machine code and not a human-readable error message. Upload dSYM files through the mobile monitoring UI You can easily upload your dSYM files directly from the New Relic One UI. The maximum file size is 600 MB. To upload your dSYM files: Go to one.newrelic.com and click Mobile. Then select your app from the list. View Crash analysis. Select a specific crash from the Crash types list. Click Upload dSYM. You can either drag and drop your dSYMs directly, or select the file form your computer. Manually upload dSYM files In some circumstances, New Relic's automatic upload of dSYM files may fail. If a dSYM upload is attempted and fails, it creates a build error with a detailed message. For example, if there's a network failure and the dSYM upload isn't completed, Xcode will report an error. For additional information about how New Relic handles dSYM uploads, see New Relic's Online Technical Community. If the automatic upload fails, you can manually upload your dSYM file. If you have multiple dSYM files, they can be within a single zip with a maximum file size of 600 MB. The YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APPLICATION_TOKEN value in the commands below is the same key used for +[NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:] (in Objective-C) or NewRelic.start(withApplicationToken:) (in Swift). To manually upload your dSYM files: Via Python script (agent versions 6.0.0 or higher) In iOS agent versions 6.0.0 or higher, the agent includes a Python script that automatically processes and uploads symbols. You can call this script from the command line: NewRelicAgent.framework/Resources/generateMap.py \"DSYM_ARCHIVE_PATH\" \"YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APPLICATION_TOKEN\" Copy Via command line To manually upload individual dSYM files from the command line: Zip up your dSYM file or files using the following command. Replace ~ /ZIPPED_DSYM_PATH with your new dSYM archive path and file name (for example, Users/my-name/desktop). Also replace ~ /dSYM_PATH with your existing dSYM file path. /usr/bin/zip --recurse-paths --quiet \"~/ZIPPED_DSYM_PATH\" \"~/dSYM_PATH\" Copy Upload the dSYM zip file using the following command: For US accounts: curl -F dsym=@\"~/DSYM_ZIP_PATH\" -H \"X-APP-LICENSE-KEY: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APPLICATION_TOKEN\" https://mobile-symbol-upload.newrelic.com/symbol Copy For EU accounts: curl -F dsym=@\"~/DSYM_ZIP_PATH\" -H \"X-APP-LICENSE-KEY: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APPLICATION_TOKEN\" https://mobile-symbol-upload.eu01.nr-data.net/symbol Copy Troubleshooting Auto-upload failure If a dSYM auto-upload failed, the Report Navigator may have a fully formed cURL command. You can use this cURL command to reattempt an upload. Depending on the error, you may also need to follow some of the dSYM manual upload steps. Here is an example of a successful dSYM upload in the Report Navigator: Example: A successful dSYM upload in the Report Navigator. Missing dSYMs If dSYM files are missing, you may need to check Xcode build settings to ensure the file is being generated.

      "body": "Your app's dSYM files are stored in Xcode's dSYM archive path folder. This is the folder where the iOS agent gets the dSYM files that are used to symbolicate your crash reports. New Relic provides a post-build script as part of the iOS agent's install process and the tvOS agent's install process. This script automatically uploads your app's dSYM files. Automatic script The script automatically uploads dSYM files only for release builds. Non-release builds must upload their files either manually or through the mobile monitoring UI. Bitcode-enabled apps have their dSYM files generated by Apple. You must download the dSYM files for Bitcode-enabled apps from Apple and upload them to New Relic. If you see unreadable machine code in the Crashes page, your dSYM files may not be uploaded correctly. In some cases, you may need to manually upload dSYM files. The automatic script uses Python 2. As of October 2019 with macOS 10.15 (Catalina), Python won't be installed by default. If you're using the automatic script (recommended), you may need to manually install Python 2. If you're using Homebrew, see Python on Homebrew. Identify missing dSYMs When a Bitcode-enabled app is uploaded to Apple for App Store review or ad-hoc distribution, dSYMs need to be manually downloaded from Apple and uploaded to New Relic to allow the mobile crash reports to be properly symbolicated. These dSYMs can be downloaded through the archives organizer in Xcode within several minutes of uploading the app. In this situation follow the procedures to find the archive and download dSYMs. If an app is missing a dSYM file, you'll see three indicators in the mobile monitoring UI: Banner notification: A banner warning appears on the Crash report page. The warning reads: We were unable to locate your dsym. Copy Upload prompt: From the Crash type summary page you will be automatically prompted to upload a dSYM file if it is missing. Machine code: The crash stack trace on the Crash report page displays machine code and not a human-readable error message. Upload dSYM files through the mobile monitoring UI You can easily upload your dSYM files directly from the New Relic One UI. The maximum file size is 600 MB. To upload your dSYM files: Go to one.newrelic.com and click Mobile. Then select your app from the list. View Crash analysis. Select a specific crash from the Crash types list. Click Upload dSYM. You can either drag and drop your dSYMs directly, or select the file form your computer. Manually upload dSYM files In some circumstances, New Relic's automatic upload of dSYM files may fail. If a dSYM upload is attempted and fails, it creates a build error with a detailed message. For example, if there's a network failure and the dSYM upload isn't completed, Xcode will report an error. For additional information about how New Relic handles dSYM uploads, see New Relic's Online Technical Community. If the automatic upload fails, you can manually upload your dSYM file. If you have multiple dSYM files, they can be within a single zip with a maximum file size of 600 MB. The YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APPLICATION_TOKEN value in the commands below is the same key used for +[NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:] (in Objective-C) or NewRelic.start(withApplicationToken:) (in Swift). To manually upload your dSYM files: Via Python script (agent versions 6.0.0 or higher) In iOS agent versions 6.0.0 or higher, the agent includes a Python script that automatically processes and uploads symbols. You can call this script from the command line: NewRelicAgent.framework/Resources/generateMap.py \"DSYM_ARCHIVE_PATH\" \"YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APPLICATION_TOKEN\" Copy Via command line To manually upload individual dSYM files from the command line: Zip up your dSYM file or files using the following command. Replace ~ /ZIPPED_DSYM_PATH with your new dSYM archive path and file name (for example, Users/my-name/desktop). Also replace ~ /dSYM_PATH with your existing dSYM file path. /usr/bin/zip --recurse-paths --quiet \"~/ZIPPED_DSYM_PATH\" \"~/dSYM_PATH\" Copy Upload the dSYM zip file using the following command: For US accounts: curl -F dsym=@\"~/DSYM_ZIP_PATH\" -H \"X-APP-LICENSE-KEY: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APPLICATION_TOKEN\" https://mobile-symbol-upload.newrelic.com/symbol Copy For EU accounts: curl -F dsym=@\"~/DSYM_ZIP_PATH\" -H \"X-APP-LICENSE-KEY: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APPLICATION_TOKEN\" https://mobile-symbol-upload.eu01.nr-data.net/symbol Copy Troubleshooting Auto-upload failure If a dSYM auto-upload failed, the Report Navigator may have a fully formed cURL command. You can use this cURL command to reattempt an upload. Depending on the error, you may also need to follow some of the dSYM manual upload steps. Here is an example of a successful dSYM upload in the Report Navigator: Example: A successful dSYM upload in the Report Navigator. Missing dSYMs If dSYM files are missing, you may need to check Xcode build settings to ensure the file is being generated. Frameworks which are built locally have separate build settings and may need to be updated as well.

For SNMPv3, set it to default_v3 default_v3 SNMPv3 configuration to scan during SNMP polling use_snmp_v1 Indicates whether to use SNMPv1 during discovery. By default, it's set to false add_devices ✓ Indicates whether to add discovered devices to the devices section of the snmp-base.yaml file. By default, it's set to true add_mibs ✓ Indicates whether to add discovered MIBs to the global.mibs_enabled section of the snmp-base.yaml file. By default, it's set to true replace_devices ✓ Indicates whether to replace discovered devices if they already exist in the devices section of the snmp-base.yaml file. By default, it's set to true debug Indicates whether to enable debug level logging during discovery. By default, it's set to false threads ✓ Integer limit of threads to use during discovery. It must be less than the number of cores available to the container Global section Option name Required Description poll_time_sec ✓ Time in seconds to poll devices. By default, it's set to 60 timeout_ms ✓ Time in milliseconds queries timeout. By default, it's set to 5000 retries ✓ Number of attempts to retry failed polls. By default, it's set to 0 mibs_enabled ✓ Array of all active MIBs the ktranslate docker image will poll. Polling only occurs if the MIB is valid for a given device drop_if_outside_poll Indicates whether to drop all values from this cycle if polling takes longer than the value set in poll_time_sec. By default, it's set to false mib_profile_dir Directory to find curated MIB profiles SNMPv3 optional configuration Here's an example of SNMPv3 configuration section for the snmp-base.yaml file: yaml default_v3: user_name: userNamev3 authentication_protocol: MD5 authentication_passphrase: authPassPrivacy privacy_protocol: AES256 privacy_passphrase: passPrivacy Copy Option name Required Description user_name ✓ User name for SNMPv3 authentication authentication_protocol ✓ SNMPv3 authentication protocol. The possible values are NoAuth, MD5, or SHA authentication_passphrase SNMPv3 authentication passphrase privacy_protocol ✓ SNMPv3 privacy protocol. The possible values are AuthNoPriv, DES, AES, AES192, AES256, AES192C, or AES256C privacy_passphrase SNMPv3 privacy passphrase context_engine_id SNMPv3 context engine ID context_name SNMPv3 context name The flow_only attribute There are several supported configurations available for running ktranslate against devices for both SNMP and network flow data collection. The flow_only attribute on both a ktranslate docker container level and in the devices section of the snmp-base.yaml file allows you to get different results: If you have multiple containers collecting both SNMP and network flow data with the ktranslate docker image, define your devices in the snmp-base.yaml file, following the standards for SNMP data polling. They will be automatically matched to their respective flows based on their device_ip matching the sampling IP for the flow device. For network flow data devices, run the ktranslate docker image with the -flow_only=true option. snmp-base.yaml file - No setting changes needed If you have multiple containers collecting both SNMP and network flow data with the ktranslate docker image, and you have specific devices where you only want network flow or SNMP data collection and no SNMP or network flow data polling respectively, you can set them up in their respective device configuration section in the snmp-base.yaml file. For network flow data devices, run the ktranslate docker image with the -flow_only=true option. snmp-base.yaml file - Change the flow_only to true: flow_only: true Copy Advanced options for running the ktranslate docker image In this table you can find additional options you can use with the ktranslate docker image. Option name Description -max_threads Lets you process higher volumes of flow. We recommend one CPU core available for every 2,000 flows per second (fps) of network flow data sent. -sample_rate=100 Changes the default sample rate value at which flows are passed to New Relic One Events. It also sets the sample rate value for flow types that don't have a default sample rate value. -nf.workers=1 Overrides the number of workers used in processing udp packets. Use one worker for every 4,000 of flows per second (fps) of network flow data sent. -nf.port Overrides the default 9995 listening port for incoming flow packets. -listen Overrides the default 8082 port used by ktranslate to expose health metrics. You must use this option when running multiple ktranslate containers on a single host. -metalisten Overrides the default 8083 port used by ktranslate to expose metadata. You must use this option when running multiple ktranslate containers on a single host. -metrics=jchf Forwards health metrics from ktranslate into New Relic One. -log_level Overrides the default info log level for ktranslate. The available options are debug, info, warn, or error. -tee_logs Forwards logs from ktranslate into New Relic One Logs. HTTPS_PROXY Environment variable that can be used during Docker runtime to setup ktranslate to ship data to New Relic via proxy. Ex: -e HTTPS_PROXY=https://user:password@hostname:port You can also run several ktranslate images to monitor different network flow types simultaneously. See the follwing example: bash Copy $ docker run -d --name ktranslate-sflow --net=host \\ > -e NEW_RELIC_API_KEY=$INSERT_API_KEY \\ > kentik/ktranslate:v2 \\ > -snmp /snmp-base.yaml \\ > -nr_account_id=$NR_ACCOUNT_ID \\ > -metrics=jchf \\ > -log_level=info \\ > -tee_logs=true \\ > -nf.source=sflow \\ > -nf.port=9996 \\ > -max_threads=1 \\ > -listen 0.0.0.0:8084 \\ > -metalisten 0.0.0.0:8085 \\ > nr1.flow $ $ $ docker run -d --name ktranslate-netflow9 --net=host \\ > -e NEW_RELIC_API_KEY=$INSERT_API_KEY \\ > kentik/ktranslate:v2 \\ > -snmp /snmp-base.yaml \\ > -nr_account_id=$NR_ACCOUNT_ID \\ > -metrics=jchf \\ > -log_level=info \\ > -tee_logs=true \\ > -nf.source=netflow9 \\ > -nf.port=2055 \\ > -max_threads=2 \\ > -listen 0.0.0.0:8086 \\ > -metalisten 0.0.0.0:8087 \\ > nr1.flow Logs sent with Network performance monitoring If you want to check the logs locally, run docker logs ktranslate-snmp. The -tee_logs=true option sends logs to New Relic One when polling devices. To see them, do the following: Go to one.newrelic.com > Logs. In Find logs where enter collector.name:\"ktranslate\" and click Query logs. Tip If you want to filter out all the information messages, enter collector.name:\"ktranslate\" message:-*\\[Info\\]*. Metrics sent with Network performance monitoring The -metrics option captures one of the following performance metrics when polling devices: Metric Description baseserver_healthcheck_execution_total Rate of internal health checks. Shows mostly that things are not deadlocked. delivery_metrics_nr Rate of metrics sent to New Relic One. delivery_logs_nr Rate of logs sent to New Relic One. delivery_wins_nr Rate of 200 HTTP codes received from sending metrics and events to New Relic One. device_metrics Rate of SNMP polling of device level metrics. inputq Messages per second (msg/sec) recieved over the last 60 seconds from SNMP or network flow devices. interface_metrics Rate of SNMP polling of interface level metrics. jchfq Gauge rate with number of available pre-allocated buffers. It should be 8,000 aproximately. To see these metrics in New Relic One: Go to one.newrelic.com and click Query your data. Enter the following NRQL query: FROM Metric SELECT latest(kentik.ktranslate.chf.kkc.baseserver_healthcheck_execution_total) AS 'baseserver_healthcheck_execution_total', latest(kentik.ktranslate.chf.kkc.delivery_metrics_nr) AS 'delivery_metrics_nr', latest(kentik.ktranslate.chf.kkc.delivery_logs_nr) AS 'delivery_logs_nr', latest(kentik.ktranslate.chf.kkc.delivery_wins_nr) AS 'delivery_wins_nr', latest(kentik.ktranslate.chf.kkc.device_metrics) AS 'device_metrics', latest(kentik.ktranslate.chf.kkc.inputq) AS 'inputq', latest(kentik.ktranslate.chf.kkc.interface_metrics) AS 'interface_metrics', latest(kentik.ktranslate.chf.kkc.jchfq) AS 'jchfq' WHERE provider = 'kentik-agent' AND instrumentation.name = 'heartbeat' LIMIT MAX Copy",

When running the ktranslate container, you will specify which major type you want to monitor using the -nf.source option. Important The ktranslate container only supports monitoring one type of network flow data type at a time. If you want to monitor several types, each will require a container. IPFIX and NetFlow v9 can be sent to the same container, but we recommend running a separate container as a best practice. Network flow data type -nf.source value IPFIX ipfix NetFlow v5 netflow5 NetFlow v9 netflow9 sFlow sflow AppFlow netflow5 Argus netflow5 cflowd netflow5 J-Flow netflow5 NetStream netflow5 RFlow netflow5 Cisco NSEL netflow9 Scaling network flow collection When planning your strategy for collecting network flows at scale, New Relic recommends 1 CPU per 2000 flows-per-second (120,000 flows-per-minute). Deciding whether to run more small containers to distribute load or fewer large containers to consolidate management is a matter of personal preference.

To get better visibility into your network device performance, set up SNMP data monitoring. Visualize your network performance data in New Relic. Manual setup If you prefer to do the setup manually, proceed with the following steps. In your local machine, from a Linux host with Docker installed, download the ktranslate image from dockerhub by running bash Copy $ docker pull kentik/ktranslate:v2 Copy the snmp-base.yaml file to the local $HOME directory of your Docker user, and discard the container by running bash Copy $ cd . $ id=$(docker create kentik/ktranslate:v2) $ docker cp $id:/etc/ktranslate/snmp-base.yaml . $ docker rm -v $id In the snmp-base.yaml file, add your network flow devices inside the devices key with the following structure: devices: flowDevice: device_name: edge-router device_ip: 10.10.1.254 flow_only: true # Optional user tags user_tags: owning_team: net_eng environment: production Copy Tip If you're already monitoring SNMP data devices that send network flow data, you don't need to add them in your snmp-base.yaml file a second time. Run ktranslate to listen for network flows by running: Tip Add your New Relic license key and your account ID in the $NR_LICENSE_KEY and $NR_ACCOUNT_ID variables respectively. bash Copy $ docker run -d --name ktranslate-sflow --restart unless-stopped --net=host \\ > -v `pwd`/snmp-base.yaml:/snmp-base.yaml \\ > -e NEW_RELIC_API_KEY=$NR_LICENSE_KEY \\ > kentik/ktranslate:v2 \\ > -snmp /snmp-base.yaml \\ > -nr_account_id=$NR_ACCOUNT_ID \\ > -metrics=jchf \\ > -log_level=info \\ > -tee_logs=true \\ > -flow_only=true \\ > -nf.source=sflow \\ > nr1.flow $ ## If your account is located in Europe, you need to add the following option before the nr1.flow line $ ## -nr_region=EU \\ Tip This command assumes collection of sflow data. If you are collecting other flow types, you should change the suffix in the --name flag for the container and update the -nf.source argument as necessary To get better visibility into your network device performance, set up SNMP data monitoring.

Optionally, you can point to a cidrs.yaml file in the snmp-base.yaml file: discovery: cidrs: \"@cidrs.yaml\" Copy The cidrs.yaml file should be similar to the following - 10.10.0.0/24 - 10.20.0.0/24 - 192.168.0.21/32 Copy ports ✓ Array of target ports to scan during SNMP polling default_communities ✓ Array of SNMPv1/v2c community strings to scan during SNMP polling. This array is evaluated in order and discovery accepts the first passing community. For SNMPv3, set it to default_v3 default_v3 SNMPv3 configuration to scan during SNMP polling use_snmp_v1 Indicates whether to use SNMPv1 during discovery. By default, it's set to false add_devices ✓ Indicates whether to add discovered devices to the devices section of the snmp-base.yaml file. By default, it's set to true add_mibs ✓ Indicates whether to add discovered MIBs to the global.mibs_enabled section of the snmp-base.yaml file. By default, it's set to true replace_devices ✓ Indicates whether to replace discovered devices if they already exist in the devices section of the snmp-base.yaml file. By default, it's set to true debug Indicates whether to enable debug level logging during discovery. By default, it's set to false threads ✓ Integer limit of threads to use during discovery. It must be less than the number of cores available to the container Global section Option name Required Description poll_time_sec ✓ Time in seconds to poll devices. By default, it's set to 60 timeout_ms ✓ Time in milliseconds queries timeout. By default, it's set to 5000 retries ✓ Number of attempts to retry failed polls. By default, it's set to 0 mibs_enabled ✓ Array of all active MIBs the ktranslate docker image will poll. Polling only occurs if the MIB is valid for a given device drop_if_outside_poll Indicates whether to drop all values from this cycle if polling takes longer than the value set in poll_time_sec. By default, it's set to false mib_profile_dir Directory to find curated MIB profiles SNMPv3 optional configuration Here's an example of SNMPv3 configuration section for the snmp-base.yaml file: yaml default_v3: user_name: userNamev3 authentication_protocol: MD5 authentication_passphrase: authPassPrivacy privacy_protocol: AES256 privacy_passphrase: passPrivacy Copy Option name Required Description user_name ✓ User name for SNMPv3 authentication authentication_protocol ✓ SNMPv3 authentication protocol. The possible values are NoAuth, MD5, or SHA authentication_passphrase SNMPv3 authentication passphrase privacy_protocol ✓ SNMPv3 privacy protocol. The possible values are AuthNoPriv, DES, AES, AES192, AES256, AES192C, or AES256C privacy_passphrase SNMPv3 privacy passphrase context_engine_id SNMPv3 context engine ID context_name SNMPv3 context name The flow_only attribute There are several supported configurations available for running ktranslate against devices for both SNMP and network flow data collection. The flow_only attribute on both a ktranslate docker container level and in the devices section of the snmp-base.yaml file allows you to get different results: If you have multiple containers collecting both SNMP and network flow data with the ktranslate docker image, define your devices in the snmp-base.yaml file, following the standards for SNMP data polling. They will be automatically matched to their respective flows based on their device_ip matching the sampling IP for the flow device. For network flow data devices, run the ktranslate docker image with the -flow_only=true option. snmp-base.yaml file - No setting changes needed If you have multiple containers collecting both SNMP and network flow data with the ktranslate docker image, and you have specific devices where you only want network flow or SNMP data collection and no SNMP or network flow data polling respectively, you can set them up in their respective device configuration section in the snmp-base.yaml file. For network flow data devices, run the ktranslate docker image with the -flow_only=true option. snmp-base.yaml file - Change the flow_only to true: flow_only: true Copy Advanced options for running the ktranslate docker image In this table you can find additional options you can use with the ktranslate docker image. Option name Description -max_threads Lets you process higher volumes of flow. We recommend one CPU core available for every 2,000 flows per second (fps) of network flow data sent. -sample_rate=100 Changes the default sample rate value at which flows are passed to New Relic One Events. It also sets the sample rate value for flow types that don't have a default sample rate value. -nf.workers=1 Overrides the number of workers used in processing udp packets. Use one worker for every 4,000 of flows per second (fps) of network flow data sent. -nf.port Overrides the default 9995 listening port for incoming flow packets. -listen Overrides the default 8082 port used by ktranslate to expose health metrics. You must use this option when running multiple ktranslate containers on a single host. -metalisten Overrides the default 8083 port used by ktranslate to expose metadata. You must use this option when running multiple ktranslate containers on a single host. -metrics=jchf Forwards health metrics from ktranslate into New Relic One. -log_level Overrides the default info log level for ktranslate. The available options are debug, info, warn, or error. -tee_logs Forwards logs from ktranslate into New Relic One Logs. HTTPS_PROXY Environment variable that can be used during Docker runtime to setup ktranslate to ship data to New Relic via proxy. Ex: -e HTTPS_PROXY=https://user:password@hostname:port You can also run several ktranslate images to monitor different network flow types simultaneously. See the follwing example: bash Copy $ docker run -d --name ktranslate-sflow --net=host \\ > -e NEW_RELIC_API_KEY=$INSERT_API_KEY \\ > kentik/ktranslate:v2 \\ > -snmp /snmp-base.yaml \\ > -nr_account_id=$NR_ACCOUNT_ID \\ > -metrics=jchf \\ > -log_level=info \\ > -tee_logs=true \\ > -nf.source=sflow \\ > -nf.port=9996 \\ > -max_threads=1 \\ > -listen 0.0.0.0:8084 \\ > -metalisten 0.0.0.0:8085 \\ > nr1.flow $ $ $ docker run -d --name ktranslate-netflow9 --net=host \\ > -e NEW_RELIC_API_KEY=$INSERT_API_KEY \\ > kentik/ktranslate:v2 \\ > -snmp /snmp-base.yaml \\ > -nr_account_id=$NR_ACCOUNT_ID \\ > -metrics=jchf \\ > -log_level=info \\ > -tee_logs=true \\ > -nf.source=netflow9 \\ > -nf.port=2055 \\ > -max_threads=2 \\ > -listen 0.0.0.0:8086 \\ > -metalisten 0.0.0.0:8087 \\ > nr1.flow Logs sent with Network performance monitoring If you want to check the logs locally, run docker logs ktranslate-snmp. The -tee_logs=true option sends logs to New Relic One when polling devices. To see them, do the following: Go to one.newrelic.com > Logs. In Find logs where enter collector.name:\"ktranslate\" and click Query logs. Tip If you want to filter out all the information messages, enter collector.name:\"ktranslate\" message:-*\\[Info\\]*. Metrics sent with Network performance monitoring The -metrics option captures one of the following performance metrics when polling devices: Metric Description baseserver_healthcheck_execution_total Rate of internal health checks. Shows mostly that things are not deadlocked. delivery_metrics_nr Rate of metrics sent to New Relic One. delivery_logs_nr Rate of logs sent to New Relic One. delivery_wins_nr Rate of 200 HTTP codes received from sending metrics and events to New Relic One. device_metrics Rate of SNMP polling of device level metrics. inputq Messages per second (msg/sec) recieved over the last 60 seconds from SNMP or network flow devices. interface_metrics Rate of SNMP polling of interface level metrics. jchfq Gauge rate with number of available pre-allocated buffers. It should be 8,000 aproximately. To see these metrics in New Relic One: Go to one.newrelic.com and click Query your data. Enter the following NRQL query: FROM Metric SELECT latest(kentik.ktranslate.chf.kkc.baseserver_healthcheck_execution_total) AS 'baseserver_healthcheck_execution_total', latest(kentik.ktranslate.chf.kkc.delivery_metrics_nr) AS 'delivery_metrics_nr', latest(kentik.ktranslate.chf.kkc.delivery_logs_nr) AS 'delivery_logs_nr', latest(kentik.ktranslate.chf.kkc.delivery_wins_nr) AS 'delivery_wins_nr', latest(kentik.ktranslate.chf.kkc.device_metrics) AS 'device_metrics', latest(kentik.ktranslate.chf.kkc.inputq) AS 'inputq', latest(kentik.ktranslate.chf.kkc.interface_metrics) AS 'interface_metrics', latest(kentik.ktranslate.chf.kkc.jchfq) AS 'jchfq' WHERE provider = 'kentik-agent' AND instrumentation.name = 'heartbeat' LIMIT MAX Copy",

In your local machine, from a Linux host with Docker installed, download the ktranslate image from dockerhub by running bash Copy $ docker pull kentik/ktranslate:v2 Copy the snmp-base.yaml file to the local $HOME directory of your Docker user, and discard the container by running bash Copy $ cd . $ id=$(docker create kentik/ktranslate:v2) $ docker cp $id:/etc/ktranslate/snmp-base.yaml . $ docker rm -v $id In the snmp-base.yaml file, add your network flow devices inside the devices key with the following structure: devices: flowDevice: device_name: edge-router device_ip: 10.10.1.254 flow_only: true # Optional user tags user_tags: owning_team: net_eng environment: production Copy Tip If you're already monitoring SNMP data devices that send network flow data, you don't need to add them in your snmp-base.yaml file a second time. Run ktranslate to listen for network flows by running: Tip Add your New Relic license key and your account ID in the $NR_LICENSE_KEY and $NR_ACCOUNT_ID variables respectively. bash Copy $ docker run -d --name ktranslate-sflow --restart unless-stopped --net=host \\ > -v `pwd`/snmp-base.yaml:/snmp-base.yaml \\ > -e NEW_RELIC_API_KEY=$NR_LICENSE_KEY \\ > kentik/ktranslate:v2 \\ > -snmp /snmp-base.yaml \\ > -nr_account_id=$NR_ACCOUNT_ID \\ > -metrics=jchf \\ > -log_level=info \\ > -tee_logs=true \\ > -flow_only=true \\ > -nf.source=sflow \\ > nr1.flow $ ## If your account is located in Europe, you need to add the following option before the nr1.flow line $ ## -nr_region=EU \\ Tip This command assumes collection of sflow data. If you are collecting other flow types, you should change the suffix in the --name flag for the container and update the -nf.source argument as necessary To get better visibility into your network device performance, set up SNMP data monitoring.

The possible values are AuthNoPriv, DES, AES, AES192, AES256, AES192C, or AES256C privacy_passphrase SNMPv3 privacy passphrase context_engine_id SNMPv3 context engine ID context_name SNMPv3 context name The flow_only attribute There are several supported configurations available for running ktranslate against devices for both SNMP and network flow data collection. The flow_only attribute on both a ktranslate docker container level and in the devices section of the snmp-base.yaml file allows you to get different results: If you have multiple containers collecting both SNMP and network flow data with the ktranslate docker image, define your devices in the snmp-base.yaml file, following the standards for SNMP data polling. They will be automatically matched to their respective flows based on their device_ip matching the sampling IP for the flow device. For network flow data devices, run the ktranslate docker image with the -flow_only=true option. snmp-base.yaml file - No setting changes needed If you have multiple containers collecting both SNMP and network flow data with the ktranslate docker image, and you have specific devices where you only want network flow or SNMP data collection and no SNMP or network flow data polling respectively, you can set them up in their respective device configuration section in the snmp-base.yaml file. For network flow data devices, run the ktranslate docker image with the -flow_only=true option. snmp-base.yaml file - Change the flow_only to true: flow_only: true Copy Advanced options for running the ktranslate docker image In this table you can find additional options you can use with the ktranslate docker image. Option name Description -max_threads Lets you process higher volumes of flow. We recommend one CPU core available for every 2,000 flows per second (fps) of network flow data sent. -sample_rate=100 Changes the default sample rate value at which flows are passed to New Relic One Events. It also sets the sample rate value for flow types that don't have a default sample rate value. -nf.workers=1 Overrides the number of workers used in processing udp packets. Use one worker for every 4,000 of flows per second (fps) of network flow data sent. -nf.port Overrides the default 9995 listening port for incoming flow packets. -listen Overrides the default 8082 port used by ktranslate to expose health metrics. You must use this option when running multiple ktranslate containers on a single host. -metalisten Overrides the default 8083 port used by ktranslate to expose metadata. You must use this option when running multiple ktranslate containers on a single host. -metrics=jchf Forwards health metrics from ktranslate into New Relic One. -log_level Overrides the default info log level for ktranslate. The available options are debug, info, warn, or error. -tee_logs Forwards logs from ktranslate into New Relic One Logs. HTTPS_PROXY Environment variable that can be used during Docker runtime to setup ktranslate to ship data to New Relic via proxy. Ex: -e HTTPS_PROXY=https://user:password@hostname:port You can also run several ktranslate images to monitor different network flow types simultaneously. See the follwing example: bash Copy $ docker run -d --name ktranslate-sflow --net=host \\ > -e NEW_RELIC_API_KEY=$INSERT_API_KEY \\ > kentik/ktranslate:v2 \\ > -snmp /snmp-base.yaml \\ > -nr_account_id=$NR_ACCOUNT_ID \\ > -metrics=jchf \\ > -log_level=info \\ > -tee_logs=true \\ > -nf.source=sflow \\ > -nf.port=9996 \\ > -max_threads=1 \\ > -listen 0.0.0.0:8084 \\ > -metalisten 0.0.0.0:8085 \\ > nr1.flow $ $ $ docker run -d --name ktranslate-netflow9 --net=host \\ > -e NEW_RELIC_API_KEY=$INSERT_API_KEY \\ > kentik/ktranslate:v2 \\ > -snmp /snmp-base.yaml \\ > -nr_account_id=$NR_ACCOUNT_ID \\ > -metrics=jchf \\ > -log_level=info \\ > -tee_logs=true \\ > -nf.source=netflow9 \\ > -nf.port=2055 \\ > -max_threads=2 \\ > -listen 0.0.0.0:8086 \\ > -metalisten 0.0.0.0:8087 \\ > nr1.flow Logs sent with Network performance monitoring If you want to check the logs locally, run docker logs ktranslate-snmp. The -tee_logs=true option sends logs to New Relic One when polling devices. To see them, do the following: Go to one.newrelic.com > Logs. In Find logs where enter collector.name:\"ktranslate\" and click Query logs. Tip If you want to filter out all the information messages, enter collector.name:\"ktranslate\" message:-*\\[Info\\]*. Metrics sent with Network performance monitoring The -metrics option captures one of the following performance metrics when polling devices: Metric Description baseserver_healthcheck_execution_total Rate of internal health checks. Shows mostly that things are not deadlocked. delivery_metrics_nr Rate of metrics sent to New Relic One. delivery_logs_nr Rate of logs sent to New Relic One. delivery_wins_nr Rate of 200 HTTP codes received from sending metrics and events to New Relic One. device_metrics Rate of SNMP polling of device level metrics. inputq Messages per second (msg/sec) recieved over the last 60 seconds from SNMP or network flow devices. interface_metrics Rate of SNMP polling of interface level metrics. jchfq Gauge rate with number of available pre-allocated buffers. It should be 8,000 aproximately. To see these metrics in New Relic One: Go to one.newrelic.com and click Query your data. Enter the following NRQL query: FROM Metric SELECT latest(kentik.ktranslate.chf.kkc.baseserver_healthcheck_execution_total) AS 'baseserver_healthcheck_execution_total', latest(kentik.ktranslate.chf.kkc.delivery_metrics_nr) AS 'delivery_metrics_nr', latest(kentik.ktranslate.chf.kkc.delivery_logs_nr) AS 'delivery_logs_nr', latest(kentik.ktranslate.chf.kkc.delivery_wins_nr) AS 'delivery_wins_nr', latest(kentik.ktranslate.chf.kkc.device_metrics) AS 'device_metrics', latest(kentik.ktranslate.chf.kkc.inputq) AS 'inputq', latest(kentik.ktranslate.chf.kkc.interface_metrics) AS 'interface_metrics', latest(kentik.ktranslate.chf.kkc.jchfq) AS 'jchfq' WHERE provider = 'kentik-agent' AND instrumentation.name = 'heartbeat' LIMIT MAX Copy",

When running the ktranslate container, you will specify which major type you want to monitor using the -nf.source option. Important The ktranslate container only supports monitoring one type of network flow data type at a time. If you want to monitor several types, each will require a container. IPFIX and NetFlow v9 can be sent to the same container, but we recommend running a separate container as a best practice. Network flow data type -nf.source value IPFIX ipfix NetFlow v5 netflow5 NetFlow v9 netflow9 sFlow sflow AppFlow netflow5 Argus netflow5 cflowd netflow5 J-Flow netflow5 NetStream netflow5 RFlow netflow5 Cisco NSEL netflow9 Scaling network flow collection When planning your strategy for collecting network flows at scale, New Relic recommends 1 CPU per 2000 flows-per-second (120,000 flows-per-minute). Deciding whether to run more small containers to distribute load or fewer large containers to consolidate management is a matter of personal preference.

Follow the steps in New Relic One. one.newrelic.com > Add more data > Network performance monitoring > Network Flows to set up network flow data monitoring. To get better visibility into your network device performance, set up SNMP data monitoring. Visualize your network performance data in New Relic. Manual setup If you prefer to do the setup manually, proceed with the following steps. In your local machine, from a Linux host with Docker installed, download the ktranslate image from dockerhub by running bash Copy $ docker pull kentik/ktranslate:v2 Copy the snmp-base.yaml file to the local $HOME directory of your Docker user, and discard the container by running bash Copy $ cd . $ id=$(docker create kentik/ktranslate:v2) $ docker cp $id:/etc/ktranslate/snmp-base.yaml . $ docker rm -v $id In the snmp-base.yaml file, add your network flow devices inside the devices key with the following structure: devices: flowDevice: device_name: edge-router device_ip: 10.10.1.254 flow_only: true # Optional user tags user_tags: owning_team: net_eng environment: production Copy Tip If you're already monitoring SNMP data devices that send network flow data, you don't need to add them in your snmp-base.yaml file a second time. Run ktranslate to listen for network flows by running: Tip Add your New Relic license key and your account ID in the $NR_LICENSE_KEY and $NR_ACCOUNT_ID variables respectively. bash Copy $ docker run -d --name ktranslate-sflow --restart unless-stopped --net=host \\ > -v `pwd`/snmp-base.yaml:/snmp-base.yaml \\ > -e NEW_RELIC_API_KEY=$NR_LICENSE_KEY \\ > kentik/ktranslate:v2 \\ > -snmp /snmp-base.yaml \\ > -nr_account_id=$NR_ACCOUNT_ID \\ > -metrics=jchf \\ > -log_level=info \\ > -tee_logs=true \\ > -flow_only=true \\ > -nf.source=sflow \\ > nr1.flow $ ## If your account is located in Europe, you need to add the following option before the nr1.flow line $ ## -nr_region=EU \\ Tip This command assumes collection of sflow data. If you are collecting other flow types, you should change the suffix in the --name flag for the container and update the -nf.source argument as necessary To get better visibility into your network device performance, set up SNMP data monitoring.

We recommend one CPU core available for every 2,000 flows per second (fps) of network flow data sent. -sample_rate=100 Changes the default sample rate value at which flows are passed to New Relic One Events. It also sets the sample rate value for flow types that don't have a default sample rate value. -nf.workers=1 Overrides the number of workers used in processing udp packets. Use one worker for every 4,000 of flows per second (fps) of network flow data sent. -nf.port Overrides the default 9995 listening port for incoming flow packets. -listen Overrides the default 8082 port used by ktranslate to expose health metrics. You must use this option when running multiple ktranslate containers on a single host. -metalisten Overrides the default 8083 port used by ktranslate to expose metadata. You must use this option when running multiple ktranslate containers on a single host. -metrics=jchf Forwards health metrics from ktranslate into New Relic One. -log_level Overrides the default info log level for ktranslate. The available options are debug, info, warn, or error. -tee_logs Forwards logs from ktranslate into New Relic One Logs. HTTPS_PROXY Environment variable that can be used during Docker runtime to setup ktranslate to ship data to New Relic via proxy.

IPFIX and NetFlow v9 can be sent to the same container, but we recommend running a separate container as a best practice. Network flow data type -nf.source value IPFIX ipfix NetFlow v5 netflow5 NetFlow v9 netflow9 sFlow sflow AppFlow netflow5 Argus netflow5 cflowd netflow5 J-Flow netflow5 NetStream netflow5 RFlow netflow5 Cisco NSEL netflow9 Scaling network flow collection When planning your strategy for collecting network flows at scale, New Relic recommends 1 CPU per 2000 flows-per-second (120,000 flows-per-minute). Deciding whether to run more small containers to distribute load or fewer large containers to consolidate management is a matter of personal preference.

To get better visibility into your network device performance, set up SNMP data monitoring. Visualize your network performance data in New Relic. Manual setup If you prefer to do the setup manually, proceed with the following steps. In your local machine, from a Linux host with Docker installed, download the ktranslate image from dockerhub by running bash Copy $ docker pull kentik/ktranslate:v2 Copy the snmp-base.yaml file to the local $HOME directory of your Docker user, and discard the container by running bash Copy $ cd . $ id=$(docker create kentik/ktranslate:v2) $ docker cp $id:/etc/ktranslate/snmp-base.yaml . $ docker rm -v $id In the snmp-base.yaml file, add your network flow devices inside the devices key with the following structure: devices: flowDevice: device_name: edge-router device_ip: 10.10.1.254 flow_only: true # Optional user tags user_tags: owning_team: net_eng environment: production Copy Tip If you're already monitoring SNMP data devices that send network flow data, you don't need to add them in your snmp-base.yaml file a second time. Run ktranslate to listen for network flows by running: Tip Add your New Relic license key and your account ID in the $NR_LICENSE_KEY and $NR_ACCOUNT_ID variables respectively. bash Copy $ docker run -d --name ktranslate-sflow --restart unless-stopped --net=host \\ > -v `pwd`/snmp-base.yaml:/snmp-base.yaml \\ > -e NEW_RELIC_API_KEY=$NR_LICENSE_KEY \\ > kentik/ktranslate:v2 \\ > -snmp /snmp-base.yaml \\ > -nr_account_id=$NR_ACCOUNT_ID \\ > -metrics=jchf \\ > -log_level=info \\ > -tee_logs=true \\ > -flow_only=true \\ > -nf.source=sflow \\ > nr1.flow $ ## If your account is located in Europe, you need to add the following option before the nr1.flow line $ ## -nr_region=EU \\ Tip This command assumes collection of sflow data. If you are collecting other flow types, you should change the suffix in the --name flag for the container and update the -nf.source argument as necessary To get better visibility into your network device performance, set up SNMP data monitoring.

      "body": "New Relic monitoring is built around the concept of entities. In this doc, you'll learn how we define entities, what you can do with them, and how you can create your own entities or groupings of entities. What's an entity? From a New Relic perspective, entity is purposefully a broad concept. An entity is anything that a) reports data to New Relic or that contains data that we have access to, and b) is something we've identified with a unique entity ID. For most entities, the ID is indicated by the attribute entityGuid. An entity can be any fundamental data-reporting component, like an application, a host, or a database service, but it can also refer to larger groupings of those components. For example, to monitor a data center, you could aggregate those hosts in New Relic to be a workload (a custom grouping of entities). That workload is, itself, also an entity. Also very important is the relationships between entities. Our behind-the-scenes relationship-mapping helps us understand how entities are connected, how they affect each other. And this allows us to give you the power to configure how any data you're bringing in is related to existing entities, or how it's related to other entities. Our focus on entities and their relationships is important because our goal is to give you practical information about your business-important entities, and not give you an unhelpfully huge stream of data from a huge list of monitored things. With more insight at the entity level, you can better monitor and troubleshoot complex, modern systems. Find and explore entities and entity data Tip You can create new entity types for monitoring any data source. Learn more about entity synthesis. Some tips for finding and understanding entity data: To find an entity's entityGuid and entityName and other metadata: from any list of monitored entities in the New Relic Explorer, click an entity's icon, and click See metadata and tags. For most entities, its GUID is reported as the attribute entityGuid. For workloads, it's workloadGuid. You can run NRQL queries to find entities by their GUID. To see connections between entities, you have several options: When viewing an entity in the UI, use the Related entities UI. Service maps. Distributed tracing. Our NerdGraph API. To group entities together, see Group entities. Customize entity definitions and relationships. To learn technical details about entity types, see our GitHub repo. In an entity type's definition file, you'll see information like: The domain: for example, APM, or Infra. Its type: for example, Application or AWSECSCONTAINERINSTANCE. Default tags. The entityExpirationTime: how long data from that entity lasts in the UI, which is different from database data retention. Group and organize entities You can place entities into groups that reflect business-important relationships in your organization. For example, you might group all entities related to a specific team or department, or related to a specific service. Or you might group multiple hosts together to reflect their grouping in a data center. To group your entities, see: Tag entities. Create workloads, which allow you to group business-important sets of entities. Create entities and customize entity data Customize entity data with entity synthesis If you have telemetry from any source that's not supported by New Relic out of the box, you can propose a mapping for it. Once approved, any telemetry received by New Relic that matches your definition file will be synthesized into an entity. To learn more: For reserved attributes and how entity relationships are defined, keep reading this doc. For how to do the work of modifying existing entity types or creating new ones, see our GitHub repo on entity synthesis. Reserved attributes for synthesized entities These attributes are meant to be synthesized from the telemetry we receive. Do not set them unless you're aware of the implications and consequences. Attribute Description entity.guid Generally, you should not set this attribute field on your telemetry data. New Relic may add this field to ingested data to store a unique identifier for the entity associated with the data point. If telemetry arrives with the entity.guid attribute already present, then New Relic will not change the value. However, it may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI, or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. One use case for passing this attribute is to associate ingested telemetry with an entity already created by New Relic. When the entity.guid attribute is sent, the value will override New Relic’s entity identification system (such as entity synthesis definitions) and instead will use the attribute as the data. entity.name This attribute shouldn't be put on ingested telemetry data unless you're trying to override the entity name that would have been selected by New Relic’s entity identification system. While New Relic won't change the value if it's already present on the data, New Relic may add the attribute to your data. Therefore invalid or unexpected values may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI, or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. If this field is present on ingested telemetry, its value will be used to name the entity associated with the data point. This name will be used instead of the name selected by New Relic’s entity identification system (for example, entity synthesis definitions). Note that many entities use the name as part of their identification, so changing this field may result in the generation of a new entity. entity.type This attribute shouldn't be put on ingested telemetry data except for certain legacy cases where it's required to distinguish entity types. Passing this field may interfere with entity detection, particularly if unrecognized values are sent in this field. While New Relic won't change the value if already present on the data, the field is not guaranteed to provide unambiguous filtering of telemetry at query-time. Existing entity definitions already have overlapping values, and we recommend avoiding entity.type in favor of other fields for filtering telemetry queries. This field is used by New Relic, meaning that invalid or unexpected values may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI, or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. To learn how to do the work of modifying existing entity types or creating new ones, see our GitHub repo on entity synthesis. Entity relationships Connections between entities are automatically created by New Relic based on what we can infer from your telemetry. For example, when two services that communicate using HTTP are instrumented with New Relic, we infer a \"calls/called-by\" relationship between them. When viewing a specific entity in either the New Relic Explorer, Navigator, or Lookout, you can see its Related entities in the entity's mini overview. This gives a visualization of the various entities connected directly to the current entity. You can quickly view important metrics for these related entities and navigate from one entity to another, through all the connected parts of your stack. Tip Learn more about how entities are related with our NerdGraph API. When relationships are not automatically detected, you can manually create them using the \"Add/edit related entities\" link in Related entities. Important Currently, you can only manually create calls/called-by relationships between service entities. Tip To manage manual relationships, you need to have modify and delete capabilities on entity relationships. If you don’t see the edit relationships button, contact your account admin. Which relationships are created? These are the relationships created between entities: Source: New Relic agent Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? Application instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS Application instrumented with a New Relic agent Relationships between applications monitored by New Relic agents are reported using the DurationByCaller metric. The callee reports the metric. For example, the metric DurationByCaller/Mobile/100/1234/HTTP/all indicates that the caller is APPLICATION 1234 for account 100. Application instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS Service instrumented with a New Relic agent An application (caller) that calls a service (callee) monitored by New Relic creates a relationship that's reported by the caller using the ExternalApp metric. For example, the metric ExternalApp/dirac.vips.net/100#1234/all indicates that the callee is APPLICATION 1234 for account 100. The metric is reported if the callee successfully responds to the caller. Service instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS Service instrumented with a New Relic agent When a New Relic agent detects that a service (caller) calls another service (callee) instrumented by New Relic, the callee reports the metric ClientApplication. For example, the metric ClientApplication/100#1234/all indicates that the caller is APPLICATION 1234 for account 100. Service instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS A datastore instance When an application calls a datastore instance it creates a relationship reported with the DatastoreInstance metric. For example, the metric Datastore/instance/MySQL/172.16.16.3/3306 indicates the datastore instance is vendor: MySQL, host: 172.16.16.3, port: 3306. This metric also supports the legacy datastore instance format Datastore/instance/MySQL/172.16.16.3:3306. Currently we cannot determine whether the datastore instance is instrumented by New Relic and has an entity associated to it. APM agent SERVES Browser agent This relationship is created when an APM agent injects the browser agent into a page. Workload entity CONTAINS Any entity When a workload is created or updated, relationships for each of the entities that belong to the workload are created. Because some workloads are “dynamic” (defined by tags), relationships are re-created every 5 minutes. This way entities can join or leave the workload. Source: Infrastructure Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? Infrastructure host HOSTS Application This relationship is created when an application is running in one or more hosts, and the infra agent is running in those hosts. Infrastructure host HOSTS Container This relationship is created when containers are running in one or more hosts, and the host is instrumented with the infra agent. Source: Synthetics monitor Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? Synthetics Monitor CALLS Browser agent This relationship is created when a synthetics monitor checks a page instrumented with the browser agent. Synthetics Monitor CALLS APM application Agent events that contain the attribute nr.syntheticsMonitorId have been described as synthetics monitors (the source) interacting with an APM application (the target). If the header exists and the APM application Id exists, a relationship is created between the monitor and the app. Source: Kubernetes Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? Cluster CONTAINS Pod This relationship is created when a pod is created in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Cluster CONTAINS Deployment This relationship is created when a deployment is created in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Cluster CONTAINS DaemonSet This relationship is created when a DaemonSet is created in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Cluster CONTAINS StatefulSet This relationship is created when a StatefulSet is created in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Cluster CONTAINS Host This relationship is created when a host that's part of a cluster is instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Deployment CONTAINS Pod This relationship is created when a deployment creates a pod in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. DaemonSet CONTAINS Pod This relationship is created when a DaemonSet is created a pod in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. StatefulSet CONTAINS Pod This relationship is created when a StatefulSet creates a pod in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Pod CONTAINS Container This relationship is created when a pod creates a container in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Host HOSTS Pod This relationship is created when a pod is running in a host that's part of a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Container HOSTS Application This relationship is created when an application is running in docker, and the hosts where docker is running are instrumented by the the infra agent. External services Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? External service CALLS External service When the relationship is created, the external service reports a span with its name on the service.name attribute and the name of the service that initiates the call in the parent.service.name attribute. Application IS External service A relationship between an application and an external service is created so that users can navigate between them using the related entities component. Browser application instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS External service A browser application reports an Ajax/HostTransaction metric when calling an external service (URL). Example metric: Ajax/HostTransaction/api.segment.io:443/CallbackTime' Cluster CONTAINS External service When the relationship is created, the external service reports a span with the attribute k8s.cluster.name, the name of the cluster. The cluster must be instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration and the cluster name set for the integration must match the one reported in the span. Pod HOSTS External service When the relationship is created, the external service reports a span with the following attributes: service.name: The name of the service. k8s.cluster.name: The name of the cluster. k8s.pod.name: The name of the pod that’s running the service. k8s.namespace.name: The namespace where the pod was created. The cluster must be instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration and the cluster name set for the integration must match the one reported in the span.",

For some charts, selecting a point on the chart will take you to a UI page with more information about that metric. Hide or return chart elements To hide or unhide a displayed chart element, select that element's name below the chart. The chart display will adjust to reflect the absence or presence of that element. Share New Relic views with others Here are some options for sharing New Relic UI pages and visualizations. If you want to... Do this... Share UI pages and dashboards To share an entire New Relic UI page, click Share near the top of the UI to copy the URL. Share charts If New Relic charts are built with NRQL queries, they have a menu that exposes various options, including sharing options like Get as image and Get chart link. Some notes about sharing: The person you share with may not have access to view the data from that account. To solve that, someone on your team with New Relic user management abilities must add that person to the account. If someone can't access a custom dashboard, it may be that it is set to private. Read more about dashboard permissions. Some sharing options have associated time ranges, which may impact later viewings of it. For example, if you use a chart's Get chart link option and that chart is set to 'Last 30 minutes', when viewed it will show the last 30 minutes, not the time range displayed when it was shared. To share a specific time range, you must select that time range in the UI. Account and user settings To find account settings and user preferences, use the account dropdown, located at the top right of the UI, beside your user name. Other UI experiences This has been a look at a few basic platform UI experiences. For more about the UI, search for docs related to the specific New Relic solution you're using.",

      "body": "As applications move towards the cloud, microservices architecture is becoming more dispersed, making the ability to monitor logs essential. New Relic offers a fast, scalable log management platform so you can connect your logs with the rest of your telemetry and infrastructure data in a single place. Our log management solution provides deeper visibility into application and infrastructure performance data (events and errors) to reduce mean-time-to-resolve (MTTR) and quickly troubleshoot production incidents. It does this by providing super-fast searching capabilities, alerts, and co-location of application, infrastructure, and log data, while visualizing everything from a single place. Find problems faster, reduce context switching Log management provides a way to connect your log data with the rest of your application and infrastructure data, allowing you to get to the root cause of problems quickly, without losing context switching between tools. Log management features include: Instantly search through your logs. Visualize your log data directly from the Logs UI. Use logging data to create custom charts, dashboards, and alerts. Troubleshoot performance issues without switching between tools. Bring in your logging data To bring your log data into New Relic, you can: Use our infrastructure monitoring agent as a lightweight data collector, without having to install additional software. Select from a wide range of log forwarding plugins, including Amazon, Microsoft, Fluentd, Fluent Bit, Kubernetes, Logstash, and more. Use our OpenTelemetry solutions. Send your log data by using the Log API or TCP endpoint. Once log management is enabled, you can also connect your logs with your APM agent, Kubernetes clusters, or distributed tracing to get additional contextual logging data with our logs in context extensions. View your logging data in New Relic You can explore your logging data in the UI or by API: Logs UI at one.newrelic.com Logs UI for EU region data center if applicable: one.eu.newrelic.com You can also query the Log data type.

When using NerdGraph, it helps to understand that our dashboards are entities that report data from other entities, such as monitored apps, hosts and services. Find the NerdGraph API explorer at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Operations We have defined a granular GraphQL API that lets you execute different dashboard operations depending on their goal and scope. Dashboard CRUD operations Operation GraphQL operation type Notes actor > entity() query Get dashboard operation. You can get all dashboard and widget data for a given dashboard entity GUID. dashboardCreate() mutation Create dashboard operation. You can create a dashboard attached to a specific account by specifying all its elements, from metadata to widget configuration. dashboardUpdate() mutation Update dashboard operation. You can update an existing dashboard given a dashboard entity GUID. You need to specify the complete, updated dashboard elements, from metadata to widget configuration. dashboardDelete() mutation Delete dashboard operation. You can delete an existing dashboard given a dashboard entity GUID. This operation executes a logical delete that lets you recover your dashboard. dashboardUndelete() mutation Undelete dashboard operation. You can recover a previously deleted dashboard given a dashboard entity GUID. Dashboard page operations Operation GraphQL operation type Notes dashboardUpdatePage() mutation Update dashboard page operation. You can update one page of an existing dashboard given a dashboard page entity GUID. You need to specify the complete, updated dashboard page elements, from metadata to widget configuration. dashboardUpdateWidgetsInPage() mutation Update widgets operation. You can update a set of existing widgets of a dashboard page given a dashboard page entity GUID. You need to specify the set of widgets to be updated and their complete configuration. dashboardAddWidgetsToPage() mutation Add widgets operation. You can add a set of new widgets to a dashboard page given a dashboard page entity GUID. You need to specify the set of new widgets and their complete configuration. Other operations Operation GraphQL operation type Notes dashboardCreateSnapshotUrl() mutation Create dashboard page snapshot operation. You can create a public URL for a given dashboard page entity GUID. The dashboard page can then be accessed in the form of a static snapshot in the resulting public URL. actor > dashboard > liveUrls() query List all live URLs operation. You can get the complete list of live URLs you have access to. A live URL is a mechanism that allows you to share dashboard pages and widgets publicly with up-to-date or live data. dashboardWidgetRevokeLiveUrl() mutation Revoke widget live URL operation. You can revoke a previously created live URL of a widget. As a result, the live URL will become unavailable to the public. Limits We have limited the values you can set to some of the dashboard properties. This allows us to keep dashboards in good shape while boosting their usability. Dashboard limits Limit Value Maximum number of pages in a dashboard 20 Maximum length of a dashboard name 255 Maximum length of a dashboard description 1024 Dashboard page limits Limit Value Maximum number of widgets in a dashboard page 100 Maximum length of a dashboard page name 255 Maximum length of a dashboard page description 1024 Widget limits Limit Value Maximum length of a widget title 255 Maximum number of entities linked to a widget 1 Maximum number of queries in a widget 20 Maximum layout column of a widget 12 Minimum layout column of a widget 1 Minimum layout row of a widget 1 Maximum layout width of a widget 12 Minimum layout width of a widget 1 Maximum layout height of a widget 32 Minimum layout height of a widget 1 Errors as first class citizens All dashboard mutations offer a way to ask for errors when being executed.

      "body": "New Relic monitoring is built around the concept of entities. In this doc, you'll learn how we define entities, what you can do with them, and how you can create your own entities or groupings of entities. What's an entity? From a New Relic perspective, entity is purposefully a broad concept. An entity is anything that a) reports data to New Relic or that contains data that we have access to, and b) is something we've identified with a unique entity ID. For most entities, the ID is indicated by the attribute entityGuid. An entity can be any fundamental data-reporting component, like an application, a host, or a database service, but it can also refer to larger groupings of those components. For example, to monitor a data center, you could aggregate those hosts in New Relic to be a workload (a custom grouping of entities). That workload is, itself, also an entity. Also very important is the relationships between entities. Our behind-the-scenes relationship-mapping helps us understand how entities are connected, how they affect each other. And this allows us to give you the power to configure how any data you're bringing in is related to existing entities, or how it's related to other entities. Our focus on entities and their relationships is important because our goal is to give you practical information about your business-important entities, and not give you an unhelpfully huge stream of data from a huge list of monitored things. With more insight at the entity level, you can better monitor and troubleshoot complex, modern systems. Find and explore entities and entity data Tip You can create new entity types for monitoring any data source. Learn more about entity synthesis. Some tips for finding and understanding entity data: To find an entity's entityGuid and entityName and other metadata: from any list of monitored entities in the New Relic Explorer, click an entity's icon, and click See metadata and tags. For most entities, its GUID is reported as the attribute entityGuid. For workloads, it's workloadGuid. You can run NRQL queries to find entities by their GUID. To see connections between entities, you have several options: When viewing an entity in the UI, use the Related entities UI. Service maps. Distributed tracing. Our NerdGraph API. To group entities together, see Group entities. Customize entity definitions and relationships. To learn technical details about entity types, see our GitHub repo. In an entity type's definition file, you'll see information like: The domain: for example, APM, or Infra. Its type: for example, Application or AWSECSCONTAINERINSTANCE. Default tags. The entityExpirationTime: how long data from that entity lasts in the UI, which is different from database data retention. Group and organize entities You can place entities into groups that reflect business-important relationships in your organization. For example, you might group all entities related to a specific team or department, or related to a specific service. Or you might group multiple hosts together to reflect their grouping in a data center. To group your entities, see: Tag entities. Create workloads, which allow you to group business-important sets of entities. Create entities and customize entity data Customize entity data with entity synthesis If you have telemetry from any source that's not supported by New Relic out of the box, you can propose a mapping for it. Once approved, any telemetry received by New Relic that matches your definition file will be synthesized into an entity. To learn more: For reserved attributes and how entity relationships are defined, keep reading this doc. For how to do the work of modifying existing entity types or creating new ones, see our GitHub repo on entity synthesis. Reserved attributes for synthesized entities These attributes are meant to be synthesized from the telemetry we receive. Do not set them unless you're aware of the implications and consequences. Attribute Description entity.guid Generally, you should not set this attribute field on your telemetry data. New Relic may add this field to ingested data to store a unique identifier for the entity associated with the data point. If telemetry arrives with the entity.guid attribute already present, then New Relic will not change the value. However, it may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI, or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. One use case for passing this attribute is to associate ingested telemetry with an entity already created by New Relic. When the entity.guid attribute is sent, the value will override New Relic’s entity identification system (such as entity synthesis definitions) and instead will use the attribute as the data. entity.name This attribute shouldn't be put on ingested telemetry data unless you're trying to override the entity name that would have been selected by New Relic’s entity identification system. While New Relic won't change the value if it's already present on the data, New Relic may add the attribute to your data. Therefore invalid or unexpected values may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI, or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. If this field is present on ingested telemetry, its value will be used to name the entity associated with the data point. This name will be used instead of the name selected by New Relic’s entity identification system (for example, entity synthesis definitions). Note that many entities use the name as part of their identification, so changing this field may result in the generation of a new entity. entity.type This attribute shouldn't be put on ingested telemetry data except for certain legacy cases where it's required to distinguish entity types. Passing this field may interfere with entity detection, particularly if unrecognized values are sent in this field. While New Relic won't change the value if already present on the data, the field is not guaranteed to provide unambiguous filtering of telemetry at query-time. Existing entity definitions already have overlapping values, and we recommend avoiding entity.type in favor of other fields for filtering telemetry queries. This field is used by New Relic, meaning that invalid or unexpected values may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI, or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. To learn how to do the work of modifying existing entity types or creating new ones, see our GitHub repo on entity synthesis. Entity relationships Connections between entities are automatically created by New Relic based on what we can infer from your telemetry. For example, when two services that communicate using HTTP are instrumented with New Relic, we infer a \"calls/called-by\" relationship between them. When viewing a specific entity in either the New Relic Explorer, Navigator, or Lookout, you can see its Related entities in the entity's mini overview. This gives a visualization of the various entities connected directly to the current entity. You can quickly view important metrics for these related entities and navigate from one entity to another, through all the connected parts of your stack. Tip Learn more about how entities are related with our NerdGraph API. When relationships are not automatically detected, you can manually create them using the \"Add/edit related entities\" link in Related entities. Important Currently, you can only manually create calls/called-by relationships between service entities. Tip To manage manual relationships, you need to have modify and delete capabilities on entity relationships. If you don’t see the edit relationships button, contact your account admin. Which relationships are created? These are the relationships created between entities: Source: New Relic agent Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? Application instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS Application instrumented with a New Relic agent Relationships between applications monitored by New Relic agents are reported using the DurationByCaller metric. The callee reports the metric. For example, the metric DurationByCaller/Mobile/100/1234/HTTP/all indicates that the caller is APPLICATION 1234 for account 100. Application instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS Service instrumented with a New Relic agent An application (caller) that calls a service (callee) monitored by New Relic creates a relationship that's reported by the caller using the ExternalApp metric. For example, the metric ExternalApp/dirac.vips.net/100#1234/all indicates that the callee is APPLICATION 1234 for account 100. The metric is reported if the callee successfully responds to the caller. Service instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS Service instrumented with a New Relic agent When a New Relic agent detects that a service (caller) calls another service (callee) instrumented by New Relic, the callee reports the metric ClientApplication. For example, the metric ClientApplication/100#1234/all indicates that the caller is APPLICATION 1234 for account 100. Service instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS A datastore instance When an application calls a datastore instance it creates a relationship reported with the DatastoreInstance metric. For example, the metric Datastore/instance/MySQL/172.16.16.3/3306 indicates the datastore instance is vendor: MySQL, host: 172.16.16.3, port: 3306. This metric also supports the legacy datastore instance format Datastore/instance/MySQL/172.16.16.3:3306. Currently we cannot determine whether the datastore instance is instrumented by New Relic and has an entity associated to it. APM agent SERVES Browser agent This relationship is created when an APM agent injects the browser agent into a page. Workload entity CONTAINS Any entity When a workload is created or updated, relationships for each of the entities that belong to the workload are created. Because some workloads are “dynamic” (defined by tags), relationships are re-created every 5 minutes. This way entities can join or leave the workload. Source: Infrastructure Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? Infrastructure host HOSTS Application This relationship is created when an application is running in one or more hosts, and the infra agent is running in those hosts. Infrastructure host HOSTS Container This relationship is created when containers are running in one or more hosts, and the host is instrumented with the infra agent. Source: Synthetics monitor Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? Synthetics Monitor CALLS Browser agent This relationship is created when a synthetics monitor checks a page instrumented with the browser agent. Synthetics Monitor CALLS APM application Agent events that contain the attribute nr.syntheticsMonitorId have been described as synthetics monitors (the source) interacting with an APM application (the target). If the header exists and the APM application Id exists, a relationship is created between the monitor and the app. Source: Kubernetes Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? Cluster CONTAINS Pod This relationship is created when a pod is created in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Cluster CONTAINS Deployment This relationship is created when a deployment is created in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Cluster CONTAINS DaemonSet This relationship is created when a DaemonSet is created in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Cluster CONTAINS StatefulSet This relationship is created when a StatefulSet is created in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Cluster CONTAINS Host This relationship is created when a host that's part of a cluster is instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Deployment CONTAINS Pod This relationship is created when a deployment creates a pod in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. DaemonSet CONTAINS Pod This relationship is created when a DaemonSet is created a pod in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. StatefulSet CONTAINS Pod This relationship is created when a StatefulSet creates a pod in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Pod CONTAINS Container This relationship is created when a pod creates a container in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Host HOSTS Pod This relationship is created when a pod is running in a host that's part of a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Container HOSTS Application This relationship is created when an application is running in docker, and the hosts where docker is running are instrumented by the the infra agent. External services Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? External service CALLS External service When the relationship is created, the external service reports a span with its name on the service.name attribute and the name of the service that initiates the call in the parent.service.name attribute. Application IS External service A relationship between an application and an external service is created so that users can navigate between them using the related entities component. Browser application instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS External service A browser application reports an Ajax/HostTransaction metric when calling an external service (URL). Example metric: Ajax/HostTransaction/api.segment.io:443/CallbackTime' Cluster CONTAINS External service When the relationship is created, the external service reports a span with the attribute k8s.cluster.name, the name of the cluster. The cluster must be instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration and the cluster name set for the integration must match the one reported in the span. Pod HOSTS External service When the relationship is created, the external service reports a span with the following attributes: service.name: The name of the service. k8s.cluster.name: The name of the cluster. k8s.pod.name: The name of the pod that’s running the service. k8s.namespace.name: The namespace where the pod was created. The cluster must be instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration and the cluster name set for the integration must match the one reported in the span.",

      "body": "In the software industry, a tag typically refers to a piece of metadata added to a data set for the purpose of improving data organization and findability. At New Relic, our tags are key:value pairs (like team: operations) added to various sets of data, like monitored apps and hosts, agents, dashboards, and workloads. We make some important attributes available as tags (for example, app metadata like app name and language, and host metadata like host name and AWS region). You can also add your own custom tags. You can use tags in the UI to filter down to relevant data. Here is an example: Here you can see an accountId tag being used to filter workloads to a specific account. Tags help you to: Organize data coming from a large number of sources and/or to a large number of New Relic accounts. Identify teams, roles, environments, or regions to know who’s responsible for what (see example use cases). Better organize and search dashboards and workloads. Query and chart APM data. Tags are useful for organizing data at a high level. If you want to add more fine-grained detail, like capturing user names or other high-cardinality values, custom attributes or custom events are a better solution. Tip Tags were previously called labels in the New Relic UI. You may sometimes see labelin our code; for example, some of our APM agent config files use a label config option for tags. Tag format and limits Format requirements and limits for tags: The UI has limits on the total number of tags it can display per entity: Limit of 100 for tags reported by default or added via agent/integration configuration. Limit of 100 for custom tags added via UI or API. The following are maximum character length for tags: Key: 128 characters Value: 256 characters When using our API to add tags, a dash (-) in a tag key is interpreted as a minus symbol. If your tag key has a dash, use back ticks around it (like `key-name`). Best practices and tips Before adding tags, we recommend first seeing how our default tags work for you. When you're ready to add your own tags, review the following best practices tips to get the most out of them. Tips on keeping tags simple: Start by adding only tags you know you’ll definitely use. Unused tags create noise and may add confusion. Try to use short tags. Shorter tags are easier to parse, and also the UI may sometimes truncate longer tags. (See character limits.) When possible, use keys and values that are human-readable (for example, region: EMEA is better than Param8323 : 1229072). Avoid including several values like regions: EMEA | US | LATAM in a single tag. We recommend using three different tags for that, like region: emea, region: us, and region: latam. If you want to match multiple tags, you can do that using the advanced options in the filter UI. Tips on using tags consistently: Try to be consistent with tag language across your teams and entities. Be consistent with naming. For example, avoid using both region: emea and reg: emea. Be consistent with format. For example, avoid using both camelCase and kebab-case. Although tag searching is not case-sensitive in the UI and API, try to be consistent with capitalization. For example, avoid using both env: staging and env: Staging. Tips on cross-team implementation: Tags help improve observability and cost allocation. For this reason, responsibility for tag implementation is often assigned to an observability team, SREs, a group of architects, or a cross-team task force. We recommend the people responsible for implementing tags meet and create an internal policy to describe how the tags are defined and which conventions are to be used. Then: Keep this reference manual up to date. Automate the definition of tags when you deploy New Relic agents, at the cloud provider, or through New Relic automation tools, such as the API or Terraform. Create recurring reports that identify entities that are non-compliant with your tagging standards. Tag examples Here are some examples of common ways to use tags to organize data: Team-related tags Creating tags for team names can be helpful to understand which team, group, department, or region was responsible for a change that led to a performance issue. Team examples: team: backend team: frontend team: db Role examples: roles: architecture roles: devops roles: pm Region examples: region: emea region: america region: asia Environment-related tags You can create entities for the environment they belong to. Examples: env: production env: qa env: development env: staging Criticality-related tags You can create tags related to criticality levels, which lets you easier track the most critical issues. Examples: layer: level1 layer: level2 layer: level3 How tags are added Some important attributes, by default, are available for use as tags. For example, the account name, the account ID, and some basic host/server metadata are available as default tags. You can't remove these available-by-default tags. Here are some details about how tags are added for some specific data sources: Add tags via UI or API When you add tags via the UI or API, this occurs at the entity level. This means that, for example, if you have multiple APM agents monitoring a single entity and apply a tag via the UI, that tag is available for all data coming from that entity. To add or delete tags via the UI: Select a monitored entity, like a monitored app or host. Near the entity’s name at the top of the page, select the See metadata and manage tags menu. In the menu that pops up, add or delete a tag. For APM agents, restart your service. To manage tags via API: see our NerdGraph tagging docs. For a guide to using our CLI to automate tagging, see our developer site. APM agent tags You can add tags via the UI and API or you can add tags using APM agent configuration, both methods require you to restart your service. There are differences in how these apply tags: Via agent config: These tags are applied at the agent-level, not the entity/application level. This would be a good option if you have multiple agents monitoring different aspects of the same app (for example, a blue-green deployment model). Via the UI or API: These tags are applied at the entity/application level. Here are links to the agent configuration options: C SDK: not available Java Go .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby For information on querying APM tags, see Query APM tags. Infrastructure data tags There are several ways tags are added to infrastructure entities and services: Use the UI or API to add tags at the entity level. Infrastructure agent: some attributes are available by default as tags. You can also add custom attributes, which are also available as tags in the UI. On-host integrations: some attributes are available by default as tags. You can also add tags by using integration-specific labels config options (for an example, see the labels config for the Apache integration). Cloud service integrations: by default we report tags and labels that are defined in the cloud service. To add tags, you'd add them on the cloud-service-side. Automate tags with our CLI For a guide to automating tags using our CLI tool, see our developer site. Use tags to filter the UI Use the filter field at the top of the New Relic Explorer to filter down to the entities you care about. You can use multiple filter conditions. To filter down to certain entities using tags: From one.newrelic.com, click Explorer. Click the Filter by... field to see a dropdown of available attributes and tags. You can filter by multiple elements and use advanced search options. To find an entity’s metadata and tags from the UI, here are two options: From a list of entities in the UI, at the far right, select an entity's icon. OR Select an entity. Near the top of the page, select the icon. To use the API to view tags, see our NerdGraph docs. Learn about how to use tags with dashboards and how to use tags with workloads. Custom queries, charts, and alerts Different features handle tags differently. Here are some details about how you can use NRQL to query tag data, or create NRQL condition alerts. Query and alert on APM tags You can query APM tags using NRQL. Minimum agent versions: C: not available Go: 2.3.0 Java: 4.9.0 .NET: 8.17 Node: v4.13.0 PHP: not available Python: v4.10.0.112 Ruby: 6.1.0.352 Here are some query examples: Throughput across shards Given a service that is distributed across nine shards, each shard assigned as an environment, we can plot the transaction throughput on all shards using a wildcard query like: SELECT rate(count(apm.service.transaction.duration), 1 minute) FROM Metric WHERE appName LIKE 'MyApp (%' AND transactionType = 'Other' FACET tags.Environment TIMESERIES Copy Transactions per team To see the number of transactions per service for a specific team, we might use a query like: FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) WHERE tags.Team = 'team-a' FACET tags.Project TIMESERIES Copy Alert on error rate for teams You can use a query for your services’ error rate for setting an alert without having to create a rule for each service. Here is the error rate for all services on a team called team-b. And this alert will automatically monitor any new app names added with the team tag. FROM Metric SELECT count(apm.service.error.count) / count(apm.service.transaction.duration) WHERE tags.Team = 'team-b' FACET appName Copy Related to this, you might create a general rule for a specific service deployed across several environments, so that we have an alarm for a single service monitoring each environment individually: From Metric SELECT count(apm.service.error.count) / count(apm.service.transaction.duration) WHERE tags.Project = 'MyProject' FACET tags.Environment Copy Query and alert on attributes As explained in the tag sources information, some important attributes are used as tags. You can query all attributes and create custom charts using NRQL, and create NRQL alert conditions.",

      "body": "New Relic Lookout provides visibility into your entire estate. It doesn't require any configuration — you can query anything in your estate that matters to you right now and understand your system as a whole, or dive deep into causes and effects, so you can quickly get the data you need to take action. Know exactly where to focus your attention with New Relic Lookout. The brighter the color, the more severe the change, and the bigger the size, the bigger the scale. Then dig deeper with correlations and abnormal history to see how it impacts your whole system—no configuration needed. Why it matters New Relic Lookout helps software teams of any size discover potential issues before they have an impact. Fill gaps in monitoring with full coverage out-of-the-box, no configuration or setup required. Immediately see anything deviating from normal across your entire estate. Proactively spot emerging problems in a real-time visualization of all system components. Gain faster incidents resolution through automatically surfaced causes and effects. Analyze any data in New Relic database (NRDB), including third-party, open, and custom data. Launch into other areas of New Relic One for deeper understanding Requirements New Relic Lookout requires Pro or Enterprise edition. If you are on Standard edition, you can still use the New Relic Lookout view in the New Relic Explorer. If you want to see data spanning 13-months, correlations, profiles, traces, and other details, you must upgrade to a higher edition. Get started with New Relic Lookout To access New Relic Lookout, click the Apps button in New Relic One and locate the New Relic Lookout launcher. You can also access New Relic Lookout directly from the New Relic One header bar, via the More dropdown. Enablement of key service performance indicator data is required for New Relic Lookout to provide value from the data you already have. The default view provides insight into three key Service performance indicators broken down by application: throughput, response time, and errors. These metrics are analyzed to show how the data has behaved during the last five minutes compared to the prior hour. one.newrelic.com > Apps > New Relic Lookout: Anything that significantly deviates from the trend is automatically discovered by New Relic Lookout, which doesn't require any configuration. Circle visualization and table view Each application (or other facet) is represented by a circle. The size of the circles indicate the magnitude of the signal for that application and the color indicates whether the value has significantly decreased or increased in the last five minutes, based on the standard deviation of the prior hour (default evaluation and comparison time windows.) Please note that the type of signal is important when interpreting your results. When you first look at the legend below, you might be tempted to interpret yellow as good and dark purple as bad, but that is not always the case. Here are some examples: In the APM/services golden signals, a dark yellow circle in Throughput might signify that something bad has occurred and led to a drop in traffic. At the same time, a dark purple circle might also be concerning due to unexpected load. Both are significant findings worth exploring. In browser golden signals, a dark purple circle in Page Views might be great, as you are seeing more traffic to your site! With errors golden signals (in all entity types), a large circle, even if gray (not deviating from normal volume), is worth exploring because a high count of errors in your system is important to investigate. The legend allows you to change the colors used to highlight deviating services To change the color palette, click the gear icon by the low-high color legend. This allows you to change the colors used to highlight deviating services. To get a table view of the same data, click the toggle on the right. You can also hover over each color to filter the view by degree lower or higher deviance. Abnormal golden signals On the right, New Relic Lookout displays the most significantly deviating applications (or other facet) in a side panel, weighted by both the magnitude of the performance indicators and the scale of their deviations. Details include the name of the key performance indicator, their magnitude during the recent time window, and the difference between the averages from one time compared to the other. Instant search Click the magnifying glass icon in the side panel to open a search box. Typing into the search box filters the circles, table, and abnormal signals to applications (or other facets) that contain the text. This is a good way to quickly zoom to various subsystems. New Relic Lookout doesn't rerun the analysis when using the instant search. Change view Click the Change View button on the right side panel. The panel that appears shows you all the entity-specific golden signals you can toggle between out of the box. By choosing the Browser Golden Signal or other views, you can change from the default view. Each new view will have the golden signals appropriate for that entity type. Drill down into the details To analyze an application or facet, click a circle, table row, or abnormal golden signal. The details panel shows the degree of deviation of the performance indicator, a link to the affected entity, and recent alert and deployment activity for that entity, when available. There’s also an indication of whether the selected evaluation time period would be abnormal or not in reference to other comparison time windows, such as the same time yesterday or the same time last week. This allows you to quickly see if the abnormal behavior is odd in general, or just based on the comparison time window. Performance tab The default tab shows charts for other key performance indicators for the selected application or facet. The charts compare the two time windows being analyzed. You can click their titles to rerun the analysis, focusing on the selected key performance indicator. When the target is a New Relic One application, we show the top transactions, error classes, external services, and database operations, alongside links to the relevant New Relic One features. Abnormal History tab This section analyzes past performance of the selected signal and calls out any time periods with notable abnormalities. Each card represents an abnormal time window and can be clicked for more details. The charts will display any relevant violations and deployments in New Relic. Correlations tab New Relic Lookout can find other signals that began behaving differently around the same time as the selected signal for that entity type. Clicking the name of the signal reruns the analysis, focusing on that key performance indicator. The chart titles link to New Relic One when there’s an associated entity in your account. Note that correlations currently do not analyze across accounts. The correlated signals displayed are for others in the account of the original application you are viewing. This helps focus the data on correlations that are more likely related to your issue. Profile tab Based on the same technology as New Relic’s error profiles, this tab compares the last five minutes to the prior hour by default (or whatever time windows you’ve selected with query editing) and surfaces any attributes that have significantly different distributions in the events being targeted by the selected signal. For example, if a custom attribute indicated that a recent throughput spike came from one user, that would surface highly in Profiles if most of the traffic usually comes from many users. Traces tab If the entity has distributed traces configured and available in the selected evaluated time window, the Traces section is enabled. Each card shows a summary of a trace and can be clicked for details. The Explore all traces links to the distributed traces application, filtered to the selected entity. Create a custom view To target signals and time windows beyond the default values, click the Change view button and select Custom view. To create your own view: Select the account or subaccount. Select the data type (metrics or events). Different functionality is available depending on the type. In View a chart with, select the metric or event you are interested in. Default is golden signals (throughput, response time, and errors). You can also build custom queries (filters) to target a signal that isn't on the list. In Facet by, select what the circles represent. Default is appName, but you can also choose host or any other facetable attribute available for the signal you’ve selected. If you plan to save/favorite this new view, provide a name in the Name your view box. Keep in mind that you can edit this view at any time using the pencil icon. The default time windows analyzed by New Relic Lookout are the last five minutes compared to the hour before. Use the time controls (View data from and Compare data to) to target other time windows. one.newrelic.com > Apps > New Relic Lookout: All event and metric data in the New Relic database can be queried using the Edit query feature. Click Analyze to begin analyzing the signal you’ve selected. You can also create your own query: Create your query. This query is comparing data from the past thirty minutes to data from the same range a day ago. Change from Basic to Advanced after clicking the Custom view button. Select the data type (metrics or events). Different functionality is available depending on the type. Enter your query using NRQL. Please note that not all NRQL features are available in the Lookout Advanced query feature. By default, the system will run this query using the last five minutes of data compared to the previous hour. Some examples of the syntax for changing the comparison and evaluation time windows are below. Click Analyze to begin analyzing the signal you’ve selected. Query: Compare the last 15 minutes to the same time 1 day ago Please note that the UNTIL NOW portion is required here unlike in standard NRQL. Without the UNTIL NOW added, the system will query a 5 minute slice of data starting 15 minutes ago SINCE 15 minutes AGO UNTIL NOW COMPARE WITH 1 day ago Copy Query: Compare a specific time range to the same range a month ago SINCE '2021-03-07 07:00:00-0500' UNTIL '2021-03-08 07:00:00-0500' COMPARE WITH 1 month ago Copy Or: SINCE 'today at midnight' UNTIL 'now' COMPARE WITH 1 MONTH AGO Copy Example: Unusual increases in error count The default view of New Relic Lookout shows application status across your estate, comparing the last five minutes to the hour before. Under regular operation, most large systems may have a handful of abnormalities, but usually most things will indicate normal behavior. Suddenly, several circles begin to change to red under the Errors section. This indicates that several applications are experiencing unusual increases in error count. It may be that one or two circles for important systems are red, and perhaps much larger than they usually appear. Clicking one of these can provide more information on what is happening. You might see that the error rate is substantially elevated, even thousands of percent higher than normal. To troubleshoot this issue, here's what you might discover in the New Relic Lookout tabs: Performance would show you data about other signals, illuminating the characteristics of the change in system dynamics. Correlations would surface other applications that are affected and how, as well as opportunities to pivot to other applications that may be closer to the underlying causes. Traces, in turn, would show distributed traces, which can provide specific examples of traffic running through those systems. Abnormal history would show other times in the past week with elevated errors, showing whether or not this problem happens regularly, such as every day at the same time or whenever there is a deployment. Profiles might show that all or most of the new errors share common properties, such as all being isolated to just one region/account/user. Combining the information from these sections, not only can you get a sense of what is going on, but also where to focus actions to resolve the problem.",

      "body": "New Relic monitoring is built around the concept of entities. In this doc, you'll learn how we define entities, what you can do with them, and how you can create your own entities or groupings of entities. What's an entity? From a New Relic perspective, entity is purposefully a broad concept. An entity is anything that a) reports data to New Relic or that contains data that we have access to, and b) is something we've identified with a unique entity ID. For most entities, the ID is indicated by the attribute entityGuid. An entity can be any fundamental data-reporting component, like an application, a host, or a database service, but it can also refer to larger groupings of those components. For example, to monitor a data center, you could aggregate those hosts in New Relic to be a workload (a custom grouping of entities). That workload is, itself, also an entity. Also very important is the relationships between entities. Our behind-the-scenes relationship-mapping helps us understand how entities are connected, how they affect each other. And this allows us to give you the power to configure how any data you're bringing in is related to existing entities, or how it's related to other entities. Our focus on entities and their relationships is important because our goal is to give you practical information about your business-important entities, and not give you an unhelpfully huge stream of data from a huge list of monitored things. With more insight at the entity level, you can better monitor and troubleshoot complex, modern systems. Find and explore entities and entity data Tip You can create new entity types for monitoring any data source. Learn more about entity synthesis. Some tips for finding and understanding entity data: To find an entity's entityGuid and entityName and other metadata: from any list of monitored entities in the New Relic Explorer, click an entity's icon, and click See metadata and tags. For most entities, its GUID is reported as the attribute entityGuid. For workloads, it's workloadGuid. You can run NRQL queries to find entities by their GUID. To see connections between entities, you have several options: When viewing an entity in the UI, use the Related entities UI. Service maps. Distributed tracing. Our NerdGraph API. To group entities together, see Group entities. Customize entity definitions and relationships. To learn technical details about entity types, see our GitHub repo. In an entity type's definition file, you'll see information like: The domain: for example, APM, or Infra. Its type: for example, Application or AWSECSCONTAINERINSTANCE. Default tags. The entityExpirationTime: how long data from that entity lasts in the UI, which is different from database data retention. Group and organize entities You can place entities into groups that reflect business-important relationships in your organization. For example, you might group all entities related to a specific team or department, or related to a specific service. Or you might group multiple hosts together to reflect their grouping in a data center. To group your entities, see: Tag entities. Create workloads, which allow you to group business-important sets of entities. Create entities and customize entity data Customize entity data with entity synthesis If you have telemetry from any source that's not supported by New Relic out of the box, you can propose a mapping for it. Once approved, any telemetry received by New Relic that matches your definition file will be synthesized into an entity. To learn more: For reserved attributes and how entity relationships are defined, keep reading this doc. For how to do the work of modifying existing entity types or creating new ones, see our GitHub repo on entity synthesis. Reserved attributes for synthesized entities These attributes are meant to be synthesized from the telemetry we receive. Do not set them unless you're aware of the implications and consequences. Attribute Description entity.guid Generally, you should not set this attribute field on your telemetry data. New Relic may add this field to ingested data to store a unique identifier for the entity associated with the data point. If telemetry arrives with the entity.guid attribute already present, then New Relic will not change the value. However, it may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI, or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. One use case for passing this attribute is to associate ingested telemetry with an entity already created by New Relic. When the entity.guid attribute is sent, the value will override New Relic’s entity identification system (such as entity synthesis definitions) and instead will use the attribute as the data. entity.name This attribute shouldn't be put on ingested telemetry data unless you're trying to override the entity name that would have been selected by New Relic’s entity identification system. While New Relic won't change the value if it's already present on the data, New Relic may add the attribute to your data. Therefore invalid or unexpected values may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI, or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. If this field is present on ingested telemetry, its value will be used to name the entity associated with the data point. This name will be used instead of the name selected by New Relic’s entity identification system (for example, entity synthesis definitions). Note that many entities use the name as part of their identification, so changing this field may result in the generation of a new entity. entity.type This attribute shouldn't be put on ingested telemetry data except for certain legacy cases where it's required to distinguish entity types. Passing this field may interfere with entity detection, particularly if unrecognized values are sent in this field. While New Relic won't change the value if already present on the data, the field is not guaranteed to provide unambiguous filtering of telemetry at query-time. Existing entity definitions already have overlapping values, and we recommend avoiding entity.type in favor of other fields for filtering telemetry queries. This field is used by New Relic, meaning that invalid or unexpected values may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI, or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. To learn how to do the work of modifying existing entity types or creating new ones, see our GitHub repo on entity synthesis. Entity relationships Connections between entities are automatically created by New Relic based on what we can infer from your telemetry. For example, when two services that communicate using HTTP are instrumented with New Relic, we infer a \"calls/called-by\" relationship between them. When viewing a specific entity in either the New Relic Explorer, Navigator, or Lookout, you can see its Related entities in the entity's mini overview. This gives a visualization of the various entities connected directly to the current entity. You can quickly view important metrics for these related entities and navigate from one entity to another, through all the connected parts of your stack. Tip Learn more about how entities are related with our NerdGraph API. When relationships are not automatically detected, you can manually create them using the \"Add/edit related entities\" link in Related entities. Important Currently, you can only manually create calls/called-by relationships between service entities. Tip To manage manual relationships, you need to have modify and delete capabilities on entity relationships. If you don’t see the edit relationships button, contact your account admin. Which relationships are created? These are the relationships created between entities: Source: New Relic agent Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? Application instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS Application instrumented with a New Relic agent Relationships between applications monitored by New Relic agents are reported using the DurationByCaller metric. The callee reports the metric. For example, the metric DurationByCaller/Mobile/100/1234/HTTP/all indicates that the caller is APPLICATION 1234 for account 100. Application instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS Service instrumented with a New Relic agent An application (caller) that calls a service (callee) monitored by New Relic creates a relationship that's reported by the caller using the ExternalApp metric. For example, the metric ExternalApp/dirac.vips.net/100#1234/all indicates that the callee is APPLICATION 1234 for account 100. The metric is reported if the callee successfully responds to the caller. Service instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS Service instrumented with a New Relic agent When a New Relic agent detects that a service (caller) calls another service (callee) instrumented by New Relic, the callee reports the metric ClientApplication. For example, the metric ClientApplication/100#1234/all indicates that the caller is APPLICATION 1234 for account 100. Service instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS A datastore instance When an application calls a datastore instance it creates a relationship reported with the DatastoreInstance metric. For example, the metric Datastore/instance/MySQL/172.16.16.3/3306 indicates the datastore instance is vendor: MySQL, host: 172.16.16.3, port: 3306. This metric also supports the legacy datastore instance format Datastore/instance/MySQL/172.16.16.3:3306. Currently we cannot determine whether the datastore instance is instrumented by New Relic and has an entity associated to it. APM agent SERVES Browser agent This relationship is created when an APM agent injects the browser agent into a page. Workload entity CONTAINS Any entity When a workload is created or updated, relationships for each of the entities that belong to the workload are created. Because some workloads are “dynamic” (defined by tags), relationships are re-created every 5 minutes. This way entities can join or leave the workload. Source: Infrastructure Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? Infrastructure host HOSTS Application This relationship is created when an application is running in one or more hosts, and the infra agent is running in those hosts. Infrastructure host HOSTS Container This relationship is created when containers are running in one or more hosts, and the host is instrumented with the infra agent. Source: Synthetics monitor Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? Synthetics Monitor CALLS Browser agent This relationship is created when a synthetics monitor checks a page instrumented with the browser agent. Synthetics Monitor CALLS APM application Agent events that contain the attribute nr.syntheticsMonitorId have been described as synthetics monitors (the source) interacting with an APM application (the target). If the header exists and the APM application Id exists, a relationship is created between the monitor and the app. Source: Kubernetes Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? Cluster CONTAINS Pod This relationship is created when a pod is created in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Cluster CONTAINS Deployment This relationship is created when a deployment is created in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Cluster CONTAINS DaemonSet This relationship is created when a DaemonSet is created in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Cluster CONTAINS StatefulSet This relationship is created when a StatefulSet is created in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Cluster CONTAINS Host This relationship is created when a host that's part of a cluster is instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Deployment CONTAINS Pod This relationship is created when a deployment creates a pod in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. DaemonSet CONTAINS Pod This relationship is created when a DaemonSet is created a pod in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. StatefulSet CONTAINS Pod This relationship is created when a StatefulSet creates a pod in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Pod CONTAINS Container This relationship is created when a pod creates a container in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Host HOSTS Pod This relationship is created when a pod is running in a host that's part of a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Container HOSTS Application This relationship is created when an application is running in docker, and the hosts where docker is running are instrumented by the the infra agent. External services Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? External service CALLS External service When the relationship is created, the external service reports a span with its name on the service.name attribute and the name of the service that initiates the call in the parent.service.name attribute. Application IS External service A relationship between an application and an external service is created so that users can navigate between them using the related entities component. Browser application instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS External service A browser application reports an Ajax/HostTransaction metric when calling an external service (URL). Example metric: Ajax/HostTransaction/api.segment.io:443/CallbackTime' Cluster CONTAINS External service When the relationship is created, the external service reports a span with the attribute k8s.cluster.name, the name of the cluster. The cluster must be instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration and the cluster name set for the integration must match the one reported in the span. Pod HOSTS External service When the relationship is created, the external service reports a span with the following attributes: service.name: The name of the service. k8s.cluster.name: The name of the cluster. k8s.pod.name: The name of the pod that’s running the service. k8s.namespace.name: The namespace where the pod was created. The cluster must be instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration and the cluster name set for the integration must match the one reported in the span.",

      "body": "In the software industry, a tag typically refers to a piece of metadata added to a data set for the purpose of improving data organization and findability. At New Relic, our tags are key:value pairs (like team: operations) added to various sets of data, like monitored apps and hosts, agents, dashboards, and workloads. We make some important attributes available as tags (for example, app metadata like app name and language, and host metadata like host name and AWS region). You can also add your own custom tags. You can use tags in the UI to filter down to relevant data. Here is an example: Here you can see an accountId tag being used to filter workloads to a specific account. Tags help you to: Organize data coming from a large number of sources and/or to a large number of New Relic accounts. Identify teams, roles, environments, or regions to know who’s responsible for what (see example use cases). Better organize and search dashboards and workloads. Query and chart APM data. Tags are useful for organizing data at a high level. If you want to add more fine-grained detail, like capturing user names or other high-cardinality values, custom attributes or custom events are a better solution. Tip Tags were previously called labels in the New Relic UI. You may sometimes see labelin our code; for example, some of our APM agent config files use a label config option for tags. Tag format and limits Format requirements and limits for tags: The UI has limits on the total number of tags it can display per entity: Limit of 100 for tags reported by default or added via agent/integration configuration. Limit of 100 for custom tags added via UI or API. The following are maximum character length for tags: Key: 128 characters Value: 256 characters When using our API to add tags, a dash (-) in a tag key is interpreted as a minus symbol. If your tag key has a dash, use back ticks around it (like `key-name`). Best practices and tips Before adding tags, we recommend first seeing how our default tags work for you. When you're ready to add your own tags, review the following best practices tips to get the most out of them. Tips on keeping tags simple: Start by adding only tags you know you’ll definitely use. Unused tags create noise and may add confusion. Try to use short tags. Shorter tags are easier to parse, and also the UI may sometimes truncate longer tags. (See character limits.) When possible, use keys and values that are human-readable (for example, region: EMEA is better than Param8323 : 1229072). Avoid including several values like regions: EMEA | US | LATAM in a single tag. We recommend using three different tags for that, like region: emea, region: us, and region: latam. If you want to match multiple tags, you can do that using the advanced options in the filter UI. Tips on using tags consistently: Try to be consistent with tag language across your teams and entities. Be consistent with naming. For example, avoid using both region: emea and reg: emea. Be consistent with format. For example, avoid using both camelCase and kebab-case. Although tag searching is not case-sensitive in the UI and API, try to be consistent with capitalization. For example, avoid using both env: staging and env: Staging. Tips on cross-team implementation: Tags help improve observability and cost allocation. For this reason, responsibility for tag implementation is often assigned to an observability team, SREs, a group of architects, or a cross-team task force. We recommend the people responsible for implementing tags meet and create an internal policy to describe how the tags are defined and which conventions are to be used. Then: Keep this reference manual up to date. Automate the definition of tags when you deploy New Relic agents, at the cloud provider, or through New Relic automation tools, such as the API or Terraform. Create recurring reports that identify entities that are non-compliant with your tagging standards. Tag examples Here are some examples of common ways to use tags to organize data: Team-related tags Creating tags for team names can be helpful to understand which team, group, department, or region was responsible for a change that led to a performance issue. Team examples: team: backend team: frontend team: db Role examples: roles: architecture roles: devops roles: pm Region examples: region: emea region: america region: asia Environment-related tags You can create entities for the environment they belong to. Examples: env: production env: qa env: development env: staging Criticality-related tags You can create tags related to criticality levels, which lets you easier track the most critical issues. Examples: layer: level1 layer: level2 layer: level3 How tags are added Some important attributes, by default, are available for use as tags. For example, the account name, the account ID, and some basic host/server metadata are available as default tags. You can't remove these available-by-default tags. Here are some details about how tags are added for some specific data sources: Add tags via UI or API When you add tags via the UI or API, this occurs at the entity level. This means that, for example, if you have multiple APM agents monitoring a single entity and apply a tag via the UI, that tag is available for all data coming from that entity. To add or delete tags via the UI: Select a monitored entity, like a monitored app or host. Near the entity’s name at the top of the page, select the See metadata and manage tags menu. In the menu that pops up, add or delete a tag. For APM agents, restart your service. To manage tags via API: see our NerdGraph tagging docs. For a guide to using our CLI to automate tagging, see our developer site. APM agent tags You can add tags via the UI and API or you can add tags using APM agent configuration, both methods require you to restart your service. There are differences in how these apply tags: Via agent config: These tags are applied at the agent-level, not the entity/application level. This would be a good option if you have multiple agents monitoring different aspects of the same app (for example, a blue-green deployment model). Via the UI or API: These tags are applied at the entity/application level. Here are links to the agent configuration options: C SDK: not available Java Go .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby For information on querying APM tags, see Query APM tags. Infrastructure data tags There are several ways tags are added to infrastructure entities and services: Use the UI or API to add tags at the entity level. Infrastructure agent: some attributes are available by default as tags. You can also add custom attributes, which are also available as tags in the UI. On-host integrations: some attributes are available by default as tags. You can also add tags by using integration-specific labels config options (for an example, see the labels config for the Apache integration). Cloud service integrations: by default we report tags and labels that are defined in the cloud service. To add tags, you'd add them on the cloud-service-side. Automate tags with our CLI For a guide to automating tags using our CLI tool, see our developer site. Use tags to filter the UI Use the filter field at the top of the New Relic Explorer to filter down to the entities you care about. You can use multiple filter conditions. To filter down to certain entities using tags: From one.newrelic.com, click Explorer. Click the Filter by... field to see a dropdown of available attributes and tags. You can filter by multiple elements and use advanced search options. To find an entity’s metadata and tags from the UI, here are two options: From a list of entities in the UI, at the far right, select an entity's icon. OR Select an entity. Near the top of the page, select the icon. To use the API to view tags, see our NerdGraph docs. Learn about how to use tags with dashboards and how to use tags with workloads. Custom queries, charts, and alerts Different features handle tags differently. Here are some details about how you can use NRQL to query tag data, or create NRQL condition alerts. Query and alert on APM tags You can query APM tags using NRQL. Minimum agent versions: C: not available Go: 2.3.0 Java: 4.9.0 .NET: 8.17 Node: v4.13.0 PHP: not available Python: v4.10.0.112 Ruby: 6.1.0.352 Here are some query examples: Throughput across shards Given a service that is distributed across nine shards, each shard assigned as an environment, we can plot the transaction throughput on all shards using a wildcard query like: SELECT rate(count(apm.service.transaction.duration), 1 minute) FROM Metric WHERE appName LIKE 'MyApp (%' AND transactionType = 'Other' FACET tags.Environment TIMESERIES Copy Transactions per team To see the number of transactions per service for a specific team, we might use a query like: FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) WHERE tags.Team = 'team-a' FACET tags.Project TIMESERIES Copy Alert on error rate for teams You can use a query for your services’ error rate for setting an alert without having to create a rule for each service. Here is the error rate for all services on a team called team-b. And this alert will automatically monitor any new app names added with the team tag. FROM Metric SELECT count(apm.service.error.count) / count(apm.service.transaction.duration) WHERE tags.Team = 'team-b' FACET appName Copy Related to this, you might create a general rule for a specific service deployed across several environments, so that we have an alarm for a single service monitoring each environment individually: From Metric SELECT count(apm.service.error.count) / count(apm.service.transaction.duration) WHERE tags.Project = 'MyProject' FACET tags.Environment Copy Query and alert on attributes As explained in the tag sources information, some important attributes are used as tags. You can query all attributes and create custom charts using NRQL, and create NRQL alert conditions.",

      "body": "In digital business, systems are becoming increasingly large, complex, and interdependent. You have hundreds of applications and services running at the same time, and you need to monitor thousands of elements emitting data (we call those data sources entities). With the New Relic Explorer, we give you a new, efficient front-door experience to easily observe the full stack of your software. We automatically create and maintain visibility from the data you send us. Use the New Relic Explorer to access and give context to the performance data from all your monitored applications, services, hosts, containers, synthetic monitors, etc. You can quickly see the entities related to a problem, exposing possible root causes and what other systems might be affected. Why it matters With the New Relic Explorer, it’s more than just observing the metrics: understand the root of what’s happening, not just the symptoms. Gain extensive visibility of each entity in your solution, its alert status, and how the entities are connected, at a glance. See all your workloads, and create a new one in a click. Get a high level view of how your system’s doing with the New Relic Navigator. Quickly grasp unusual trends and behaviors with New Relic Lookout. Filter and group related entities to quickly drill down to the issues. Troubleshoot issues with tools that are faster, less cumbersome, and more accurate. Identify areas of improvement, and plan your changes. Want to learn more? See the video (it's only 45 seconds!): Short guide to using the New Relic Explorer. View and connect the performance of your entities Access the New Relic Explorer at one.newrelic.com and see together data reported by any entity from across all of your New Relic accounts. Entity categories include: Services: APM-monitored applications and services monitored. Hosts: your monitored infrastructure (your servers and hosts). Mobile applications: your mobile apps. Browser applications: your front-end browser apps. Integration-reported data: data from services monitored by our integrations, including our on-host integrations (like Kubernetes, StatsD, and NGINX), and cloud platform integrations, like Amazon, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Workloads, your customized entity groupings. Containers, such as Kubernetes or Docker. Synthetic monitors, for simulations. Tip You can create new entity types to monitor any data source. Learn more about entity synthesis. Toggle between the Explorer's three views and the following features: one.newrelic.com > Explorer: Use the New Relic Explorer to locate and examine the entities you monitor. List. Browse and filter from a list of all the entities in your account. Use this landing interface to navigate, group, and filter your entities. New Relic Navigator. Get a high density overview of all your entities, grouped by entity type or by tags. Use this to detect any issues and health patterns at a glance. New Relic Lookout. Spot entities that have recent performance deviations. Use this to quickly identify unusual behaviors. Saved views. Save your favorite filters as a view and recover them in a click each time you return to the Explorer. Filterbar. Drill down and locate problematic entities easily with our improved search capabilities, and benefit from the AND and OR operators in one place. See everything. All the different entity types you have access to are listed in the collapsible sidebar on the left of the screen. This sidebar is interactive and used for exploratory purposes. It allows you to see only entities of the selected type, as it updates the filter from the filterbar. Create a new workload for meaningful groupings of your monitored entities. Add more data to instrument more elements of your system and achieve full stack observability. List view Your monitored entities are on the left, in a collapsable menu. You may need to scroll your list of entities to see them all. The list view also has a collapsable activity stream on the right side. You can see different useful events related to the first 25 alerting entities which are currently being filtered. Click on any entity for more details on its performance. The entity overview also incorporates the relationship between the selected entity and other entities in your system. New Relic Navigator The New Relic Navigator makes it easy to explore large numbers of entities as it intuitively displays the entire estate of your system in a highly dense honeycomb view with traffic light colors based on alerts. With the New Relic Navigator you can: Quickly explore the health of your environment at a glance. See all the entities that belong to all your accounts, and focus on specific entity types or specific groups of entities grouped by tags. Group and filter across all your entities to quickly zero in on issues. Click on any entity to see a mini-overview of its activity, metrics, and meta-data. New Relic Lookout New Relic Lookout provides an intuitive view of entities that are deviating from normal behavior, using circle visualization with color indicating severity and size conveying the scale of recent changes. You don’t need to configure anything: New Relic Lookout automatically compares performance within the last five minutes against the previous hour. Use New Relic Lookout to: Select the entity type to see golden signals of throughput, response time, and errors across all your accounts. Zoom in with correlations, abnormal history, traces, and the ability to leverage New Relic’s profiles across your estate. Click on an entity of interest to access the mini-overview component. Read more about New Relic Lookout. Tip You can modify the color palette to focus on clusters of interest. Understand the state of your system with the health (alert) status The New Relic Explorer shows a color-coded health status for entities. For example, you may see a red alert status indicating a critical violation in progress. To see what an alert status means, mouse over it. To see details about an entity's alerting status, select the entity. NRQL alert conditions aren't used to determine alert status because they aren't associated with specific entities. Important Starting June 8, 2020, New Relic One will not continue to display any APM application that hasn't reported data for 93 days. To match our published APM data retention guidelines, applications that have not reported data will be available within the New Relic UI for 90 days. After 90 days, those applications will be removed from the UI; however, key metrics will continue to be available via the New Relic REST API based on subscription level. For more information, see New Relic's Explorers Hub post. Filter entities using the filterbar The filterbar lets you select the entities displayed according to the conditions you enter: Type in a string of characters and/or numbers (for example, an environment) to find any entity that has this string in their name or ID. When typing, the UI suggests items that coincide with the string you're entering, so you can select one of those from the dropdown. You can also filter by the name of the entity, the entity type, account ID, environment, or a tag. Tip Selection parameters, once created, have a blue background. If you filter using a string, the filter will have the = operator. If you filter using the dropdown menu, once the first element of the searched item (tag key or attribute) is entered, you need to select an operator (=, !=, LIKE, NOT_LIKE, IN, NOT IN) for your filter. Once the operator is selected, complete the filter by selecting the value to complete the search item. To add more filters, first you have to select an operator, AND or OR. Use AND to indicate you want to restrict the selection removing entities from the list of results. You can also use the AND operator to add conditions that need to be met in the list of results, for example, entityType = Services AND location = APAC. Note that entityType = Services AND entityType = Hosts doesn’t return any results, as entities can only have one type and no entity would match this condition. Use OR to add more entities to the selection. For example, the filter entityType = Services OR entityType = Hosts returns every entity you have access to that is of type Services or Hosts. Entity data retention Availability of data depends on these factors: Scope Data retention New Relic Explorer and search In the UI, data is available for eight days after an entity no longer exists, with one exception: data reported by integrations, such as Amazon AWS, is only available for one day after an entity ceases to exist. Our database (accessible via NRQL query) For querying our database (for example, via the query builder or data explorer), availability is dependent on the data retention for that data type. As a result of these factors, a short-lived entity (like a cloud host) may not be available in the explorer list or via search, but its data may still be available via NRQL query.",

      "body": "New Relic monitoring is built around the concept of entities. In this doc, you'll learn how we define entities, what you can do with them, and how you can create your own entities or groupings of entities. What's an entity? From a New Relic perspective, entity is purposefully a broad concept. An entity is anything that a) reports data to New Relic or that contains data that we have access to, and b) is something we've identified with a unique entity ID. For most entities, the ID is indicated by the attribute entityGuid. An entity can be any fundamental data-reporting component, like an application, a host, or a database service, but it can also refer to larger groupings of those components. For example, to monitor a data center, you could aggregate those hosts in New Relic to be a workload (a custom grouping of entities). That workload is, itself, also an entity. Also very important is the relationships between entities. Our behind-the-scenes relationship-mapping helps us understand how entities are connected, how they affect each other. And this allows us to give you the power to configure how any data you're bringing in is related to existing entities, or how it's related to other entities. Our focus on entities and their relationships is important because our goal is to give you practical information about your business-important entities, and not give you an unhelpfully huge stream of data from a huge list of monitored things. With more insight at the entity level, you can better monitor and troubleshoot complex, modern systems. Find and explore entities and entity data Tip You can create new entity types for monitoring any data source. Learn more about entity synthesis. Some tips for finding and understanding entity data: To find an entity's entityGuid and entityName and other metadata: from any list of monitored entities in the New Relic Explorer, click an entity's icon, and click See metadata and tags. For most entities, its GUID is reported as the attribute entityGuid. For workloads, it's workloadGuid. You can run NRQL queries to find entities by their GUID. To see connections between entities, you have several options: When viewing an entity in the UI, use the Related entities UI. Service maps. Distributed tracing. Our NerdGraph API. To group entities together, see Group entities. Customize entity definitions and relationships. To learn technical details about entity types, see our GitHub repo. In an entity type's definition file, you'll see information like: The domain: for example, APM, or Infra. Its type: for example, Application or AWSECSCONTAINERINSTANCE. Default tags. The entityExpirationTime: how long data from that entity lasts in the UI, which is different from database data retention. Group and organize entities You can place entities into groups that reflect business-important relationships in your organization. For example, you might group all entities related to a specific team or department, or related to a specific service. Or you might group multiple hosts together to reflect their grouping in a data center. To group your entities, see: Tag entities. Create workloads, which allow you to group business-important sets of entities. Create entities and customize entity data Customize entity data with entity synthesis If you have telemetry from any source that's not supported by New Relic out of the box, you can propose a mapping for it. Once approved, any telemetry received by New Relic that matches your definition file will be synthesized into an entity. To learn more: For reserved attributes and how entity relationships are defined, keep reading this doc. For how to do the work of modifying existing entity types or creating new ones, see our GitHub repo on entity synthesis. Reserved attributes for synthesized entities These attributes are meant to be synthesized from the telemetry we receive. Do not set them unless you're aware of the implications and consequences. Attribute Description entity.guid Generally, you should not set this attribute field on your telemetry data. New Relic may add this field to ingested data to store a unique identifier for the entity associated with the data point. If telemetry arrives with the entity.guid attribute already present, then New Relic will not change the value. However, it may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI, or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. One use case for passing this attribute is to associate ingested telemetry with an entity already created by New Relic. When the entity.guid attribute is sent, the value will override New Relic’s entity identification system (such as entity synthesis definitions) and instead will use the attribute as the data. entity.name This attribute shouldn't be put on ingested telemetry data unless you're trying to override the entity name that would have been selected by New Relic’s entity identification system. While New Relic won't change the value if it's already present on the data, New Relic may add the attribute to your data. Therefore invalid or unexpected values may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI, or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. If this field is present on ingested telemetry, its value will be used to name the entity associated with the data point. This name will be used instead of the name selected by New Relic’s entity identification system (for example, entity synthesis definitions). Note that many entities use the name as part of their identification, so changing this field may result in the generation of a new entity. entity.type This attribute shouldn't be put on ingested telemetry data except for certain legacy cases where it's required to distinguish entity types. Passing this field may interfere with entity detection, particularly if unrecognized values are sent in this field. While New Relic won't change the value if already present on the data, the field is not guaranteed to provide unambiguous filtering of telemetry at query-time. Existing entity definitions already have overlapping values, and we recommend avoiding entity.type in favor of other fields for filtering telemetry queries. This field is used by New Relic, meaning that invalid or unexpected values may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI, or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. To learn how to do the work of modifying existing entity types or creating new ones, see our GitHub repo on entity synthesis. Entity relationships Connections between entities are automatically created by New Relic based on what we can infer from your telemetry. For example, when two services that communicate using HTTP are instrumented with New Relic, we infer a \"calls/called-by\" relationship between them. When viewing a specific entity in either the New Relic Explorer, Navigator, or Lookout, you can see its Related entities in the entity's mini overview. This gives a visualization of the various entities connected directly to the current entity. You can quickly view important metrics for these related entities and navigate from one entity to another, through all the connected parts of your stack. Tip Learn more about how entities are related with our NerdGraph API. When relationships are not automatically detected, you can manually create them using the \"Add/edit related entities\" link in Related entities. Important Currently, you can only manually create calls/called-by relationships between service entities. Tip To manage manual relationships, you need to have modify and delete capabilities on entity relationships. If you don’t see the edit relationships button, contact your account admin. Which relationships are created? These are the relationships created between entities: Source: New Relic agent Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? Application instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS Application instrumented with a New Relic agent Relationships between applications monitored by New Relic agents are reported using the DurationByCaller metric. The callee reports the metric. For example, the metric DurationByCaller/Mobile/100/1234/HTTP/all indicates that the caller is APPLICATION 1234 for account 100. Application instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS Service instrumented with a New Relic agent An application (caller) that calls a service (callee) monitored by New Relic creates a relationship that's reported by the caller using the ExternalApp metric. For example, the metric ExternalApp/dirac.vips.net/100#1234/all indicates that the callee is APPLICATION 1234 for account 100. The metric is reported if the callee successfully responds to the caller. Service instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS Service instrumented with a New Relic agent When a New Relic agent detects that a service (caller) calls another service (callee) instrumented by New Relic, the callee reports the metric ClientApplication. For example, the metric ClientApplication/100#1234/all indicates that the caller is APPLICATION 1234 for account 100. Service instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS A datastore instance When an application calls a datastore instance it creates a relationship reported with the DatastoreInstance metric. For example, the metric Datastore/instance/MySQL/172.16.16.3/3306 indicates the datastore instance is vendor: MySQL, host: 172.16.16.3, port: 3306. This metric also supports the legacy datastore instance format Datastore/instance/MySQL/172.16.16.3:3306. Currently we cannot determine whether the datastore instance is instrumented by New Relic and has an entity associated to it. APM agent SERVES Browser agent This relationship is created when an APM agent injects the browser agent into a page. Workload entity CONTAINS Any entity When a workload is created or updated, relationships for each of the entities that belong to the workload are created. Because some workloads are “dynamic” (defined by tags), relationships are re-created every 5 minutes. This way entities can join or leave the workload. Source: Infrastructure Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? Infrastructure host HOSTS Application This relationship is created when an application is running in one or more hosts, and the infra agent is running in those hosts. Infrastructure host HOSTS Container This relationship is created when containers are running in one or more hosts, and the host is instrumented with the infra agent. Source: Synthetics monitor Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? Synthetics Monitor CALLS Browser agent This relationship is created when a synthetics monitor checks a page instrumented with the browser agent. Synthetics Monitor CALLS APM application Agent events that contain the attribute nr.syntheticsMonitorId have been described as synthetics monitors (the source) interacting with an APM application (the target). If the header exists and the APM application Id exists, a relationship is created between the monitor and the app. Source: Kubernetes Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? Cluster CONTAINS Pod This relationship is created when a pod is created in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Cluster CONTAINS Deployment This relationship is created when a deployment is created in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Cluster CONTAINS DaemonSet This relationship is created when a DaemonSet is created in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Cluster CONTAINS StatefulSet This relationship is created when a StatefulSet is created in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Cluster CONTAINS Host This relationship is created when a host that's part of a cluster is instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Deployment CONTAINS Pod This relationship is created when a deployment creates a pod in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. DaemonSet CONTAINS Pod This relationship is created when a DaemonSet is created a pod in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. StatefulSet CONTAINS Pod This relationship is created when a StatefulSet creates a pod in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Pod CONTAINS Container This relationship is created when a pod creates a container in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Host HOSTS Pod This relationship is created when a pod is running in a host that's part of a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Container HOSTS Application This relationship is created when an application is running in docker, and the hosts where docker is running are instrumented by the the infra agent. External services Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? External service CALLS External service When the relationship is created, the external service reports a span with its name on the service.name attribute and the name of the service that initiates the call in the parent.service.name attribute. Application IS External service A relationship between an application and an external service is created so that users can navigate between them using the related entities component. Browser application instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS External service A browser application reports an Ajax/HostTransaction metric when calling an external service (URL). Example metric: Ajax/HostTransaction/api.segment.io:443/CallbackTime' Cluster CONTAINS External service When the relationship is created, the external service reports a span with the attribute k8s.cluster.name, the name of the cluster. The cluster must be instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration and the cluster name set for the integration must match the one reported in the span. Pod HOSTS External service When the relationship is created, the external service reports a span with the following attributes: service.name: The name of the service. k8s.cluster.name: The name of the cluster. k8s.pod.name: The name of the pod that’s running the service. k8s.namespace.name: The namespace where the pod was created. The cluster must be instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration and the cluster name set for the integration must match the one reported in the span.",

      "body": "In the software industry, a tag typically refers to a piece of metadata added to a data set for the purpose of improving data organization and findability. At New Relic, our tags are key:value pairs (like team: operations) added to various sets of data, like monitored apps and hosts, agents, dashboards, and workloads. We make some important attributes available as tags (for example, app metadata like app name and language, and host metadata like host name and AWS region). You can also add your own custom tags. You can use tags in the UI to filter down to relevant data. Here is an example: Here you can see an accountId tag being used to filter workloads to a specific account. Tags help you to: Organize data coming from a large number of sources and/or to a large number of New Relic accounts. Identify teams, roles, environments, or regions to know who’s responsible for what (see example use cases). Better organize and search dashboards and workloads. Query and chart APM data. Tags are useful for organizing data at a high level. If you want to add more fine-grained detail, like capturing user names or other high-cardinality values, custom attributes or custom events are a better solution. Tip Tags were previously called labels in the New Relic UI. You may sometimes see labelin our code; for example, some of our APM agent config files use a label config option for tags. Tag format and limits Format requirements and limits for tags: The UI has limits on the total number of tags it can display per entity: Limit of 100 for tags reported by default or added via agent/integration configuration. Limit of 100 for custom tags added via UI or API. The following are maximum character length for tags: Key: 128 characters Value: 256 characters When using our API to add tags, a dash (-) in a tag key is interpreted as a minus symbol. If your tag key has a dash, use back ticks around it (like `key-name`). Best practices and tips Before adding tags, we recommend first seeing how our default tags work for you. When you're ready to add your own tags, review the following best practices tips to get the most out of them. Tips on keeping tags simple: Start by adding only tags you know you’ll definitely use. Unused tags create noise and may add confusion. Try to use short tags. Shorter tags are easier to parse, and also the UI may sometimes truncate longer tags. (See character limits.) When possible, use keys and values that are human-readable (for example, region: EMEA is better than Param8323 : 1229072). Avoid including several values like regions: EMEA | US | LATAM in a single tag. We recommend using three different tags for that, like region: emea, region: us, and region: latam. If you want to match multiple tags, you can do that using the advanced options in the filter UI. Tips on using tags consistently: Try to be consistent with tag language across your teams and entities. Be consistent with naming. For example, avoid using both region: emea and reg: emea. Be consistent with format. For example, avoid using both camelCase and kebab-case. Although tag searching is not case-sensitive in the UI and API, try to be consistent with capitalization. For example, avoid using both env: staging and env: Staging. Tips on cross-team implementation: Tags help improve observability and cost allocation. For this reason, responsibility for tag implementation is often assigned to an observability team, SREs, a group of architects, or a cross-team task force. We recommend the people responsible for implementing tags meet and create an internal policy to describe how the tags are defined and which conventions are to be used. Then: Keep this reference manual up to date. Automate the definition of tags when you deploy New Relic agents, at the cloud provider, or through New Relic automation tools, such as the API or Terraform. Create recurring reports that identify entities that are non-compliant with your tagging standards. Tag examples Here are some examples of common ways to use tags to organize data: Team-related tags Creating tags for team names can be helpful to understand which team, group, department, or region was responsible for a change that led to a performance issue. Team examples: team: backend team: frontend team: db Role examples: roles: architecture roles: devops roles: pm Region examples: region: emea region: america region: asia Environment-related tags You can create entities for the environment they belong to. Examples: env: production env: qa env: development env: staging Criticality-related tags You can create tags related to criticality levels, which lets you easier track the most critical issues. Examples: layer: level1 layer: level2 layer: level3 How tags are added Some important attributes, by default, are available for use as tags. For example, the account name, the account ID, and some basic host/server metadata are available as default tags. You can't remove these available-by-default tags. Here are some details about how tags are added for some specific data sources: Add tags via UI or API When you add tags via the UI or API, this occurs at the entity level. This means that, for example, if you have multiple APM agents monitoring a single entity and apply a tag via the UI, that tag is available for all data coming from that entity. To add or delete tags via the UI: Select a monitored entity, like a monitored app or host. Near the entity’s name at the top of the page, select the See metadata and manage tags menu. In the menu that pops up, add or delete a tag. For APM agents, restart your service. To manage tags via API: see our NerdGraph tagging docs. For a guide to using our CLI to automate tagging, see our developer site. APM agent tags You can add tags via the UI and API or you can add tags using APM agent configuration, both methods require you to restart your service. There are differences in how these apply tags: Via agent config: These tags are applied at the agent-level, not the entity/application level. This would be a good option if you have multiple agents monitoring different aspects of the same app (for example, a blue-green deployment model). Via the UI or API: These tags are applied at the entity/application level. Here are links to the agent configuration options: C SDK: not available Java Go .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby For information on querying APM tags, see Query APM tags. Infrastructure data tags There are several ways tags are added to infrastructure entities and services: Use the UI or API to add tags at the entity level. Infrastructure agent: some attributes are available by default as tags. You can also add custom attributes, which are also available as tags in the UI. On-host integrations: some attributes are available by default as tags. You can also add tags by using integration-specific labels config options (for an example, see the labels config for the Apache integration). Cloud service integrations: by default we report tags and labels that are defined in the cloud service. To add tags, you'd add them on the cloud-service-side. Automate tags with our CLI For a guide to automating tags using our CLI tool, see our developer site. Use tags to filter the UI Use the filter field at the top of the New Relic Explorer to filter down to the entities you care about. You can use multiple filter conditions. To filter down to certain entities using tags: From one.newrelic.com, click Explorer. Click the Filter by... field to see a dropdown of available attributes and tags. You can filter by multiple elements and use advanced search options. To find an entity’s metadata and tags from the UI, here are two options: From a list of entities in the UI, at the far right, select an entity's icon. OR Select an entity. Near the top of the page, select the icon. To use the API to view tags, see our NerdGraph docs. Learn about how to use tags with dashboards and how to use tags with workloads. Custom queries, charts, and alerts Different features handle tags differently. Here are some details about how you can use NRQL to query tag data, or create NRQL condition alerts. Query and alert on APM tags You can query APM tags using NRQL. Minimum agent versions: C: not available Go: 2.3.0 Java: 4.9.0 .NET: 8.17 Node: v4.13.0 PHP: not available Python: v4.10.0.112 Ruby: 6.1.0.352 Here are some query examples: Throughput across shards Given a service that is distributed across nine shards, each shard assigned as an environment, we can plot the transaction throughput on all shards using a wildcard query like: SELECT rate(count(apm.service.transaction.duration), 1 minute) FROM Metric WHERE appName LIKE 'MyApp (%' AND transactionType = 'Other' FACET tags.Environment TIMESERIES Copy Transactions per team To see the number of transactions per service for a specific team, we might use a query like: FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) WHERE tags.Team = 'team-a' FACET tags.Project TIMESERIES Copy Alert on error rate for teams You can use a query for your services’ error rate for setting an alert without having to create a rule for each service. Here is the error rate for all services on a team called team-b. And this alert will automatically monitor any new app names added with the team tag. FROM Metric SELECT count(apm.service.error.count) / count(apm.service.transaction.duration) WHERE tags.Team = 'team-b' FACET appName Copy Related to this, you might create a general rule for a specific service deployed across several environments, so that we have an alarm for a single service monitoring each environment individually: From Metric SELECT count(apm.service.error.count) / count(apm.service.transaction.duration) WHERE tags.Project = 'MyProject' FACET tags.Environment Copy Query and alert on attributes As explained in the tag sources information, some important attributes are used as tags. You can query all attributes and create custom charts using NRQL, and create NRQL alert conditions.",

      "body": "New Relic Lookout provides visibility into your entire estate. It doesn't require any configuration — you can query anything in your estate that matters to you right now and understand your system as a whole, or dive deep into causes and effects, so you can quickly get the data you need to take action. Know exactly where to focus your attention with New Relic Lookout. The brighter the color, the more severe the change, and the bigger the size, the bigger the scale. Then dig deeper with correlations and abnormal history to see how it impacts your whole system—no configuration needed. Why it matters New Relic Lookout helps software teams of any size discover potential issues before they have an impact. Fill gaps in monitoring with full coverage out-of-the-box, no configuration or setup required. Immediately see anything deviating from normal across your entire estate. Proactively spot emerging problems in a real-time visualization of all system components. Gain faster incidents resolution through automatically surfaced causes and effects. Analyze any data in New Relic database (NRDB), including third-party, open, and custom data. Launch into other areas of New Relic One for deeper understanding Requirements New Relic Lookout requires Pro or Enterprise edition. If you are on Standard edition, you can still use the New Relic Lookout view in the New Relic Explorer. If you want to see data spanning 13-months, correlations, profiles, traces, and other details, you must upgrade to a higher edition. Get started with New Relic Lookout To access New Relic Lookout, click the Apps button in New Relic One and locate the New Relic Lookout launcher. You can also access New Relic Lookout directly from the New Relic One header bar, via the More dropdown. Enablement of key service performance indicator data is required for New Relic Lookout to provide value from the data you already have. The default view provides insight into three key Service performance indicators broken down by application: throughput, response time, and errors. These metrics are analyzed to show how the data has behaved during the last five minutes compared to the prior hour. one.newrelic.com > Apps > New Relic Lookout: Anything that significantly deviates from the trend is automatically discovered by New Relic Lookout, which doesn't require any configuration. Circle visualization and table view Each application (or other facet) is represented by a circle. The size of the circles indicate the magnitude of the signal for that application and the color indicates whether the value has significantly decreased or increased in the last five minutes, based on the standard deviation of the prior hour (default evaluation and comparison time windows.) Please note that the type of signal is important when interpreting your results. When you first look at the legend below, you might be tempted to interpret yellow as good and dark purple as bad, but that is not always the case. Here are some examples: In the APM/services golden signals, a dark yellow circle in Throughput might signify that something bad has occurred and led to a drop in traffic. At the same time, a dark purple circle might also be concerning due to unexpected load. Both are significant findings worth exploring. In browser golden signals, a dark purple circle in Page Views might be great, as you are seeing more traffic to your site! With errors golden signals (in all entity types), a large circle, even if gray (not deviating from normal volume), is worth exploring because a high count of errors in your system is important to investigate. The legend allows you to change the colors used to highlight deviating services To change the color palette, click the gear icon by the low-high color legend. This allows you to change the colors used to highlight deviating services. To get a table view of the same data, click the toggle on the right. You can also hover over each color to filter the view by degree lower or higher deviance. Abnormal golden signals On the right, New Relic Lookout displays the most significantly deviating applications (or other facet) in a side panel, weighted by both the magnitude of the performance indicators and the scale of their deviations. Details include the name of the key performance indicator, their magnitude during the recent time window, and the difference between the averages from one time compared to the other. Instant search Click the magnifying glass icon in the side panel to open a search box. Typing into the search box filters the circles, table, and abnormal signals to applications (or other facets) that contain the text. This is a good way to quickly zoom to various subsystems. New Relic Lookout doesn't rerun the analysis when using the instant search. Change view Click the Change View button on the right side panel. The panel that appears shows you all the entity-specific golden signals you can toggle between out of the box. By choosing the Browser Golden Signal or other views, you can change from the default view. Each new view will have the golden signals appropriate for that entity type. Drill down into the details To analyze an application or facet, click a circle, table row, or abnormal golden signal. The details panel shows the degree of deviation of the performance indicator, a link to the affected entity, and recent alert and deployment activity for that entity, when available. There’s also an indication of whether the selected evaluation time period would be abnormal or not in reference to other comparison time windows, such as the same time yesterday or the same time last week. This allows you to quickly see if the abnormal behavior is odd in general, or just based on the comparison time window. Performance tab The default tab shows charts for other key performance indicators for the selected application or facet. The charts compare the two time windows being analyzed. You can click their titles to rerun the analysis, focusing on the selected key performance indicator. When the target is a New Relic One application, we show the top transactions, error classes, external services, and database operations, alongside links to the relevant New Relic One features. Abnormal History tab This section analyzes past performance of the selected signal and calls out any time periods with notable abnormalities. Each card represents an abnormal time window and can be clicked for more details. The charts will display any relevant violations and deployments in New Relic. Correlations tab New Relic Lookout can find other signals that began behaving differently around the same time as the selected signal for that entity type. Clicking the name of the signal reruns the analysis, focusing on that key performance indicator. The chart titles link to New Relic One when there’s an associated entity in your account. Note that correlations currently do not analyze across accounts. The correlated signals displayed are for others in the account of the original application you are viewing. This helps focus the data on correlations that are more likely related to your issue. Profile tab Based on the same technology as New Relic’s error profiles, this tab compares the last five minutes to the prior hour by default (or whatever time windows you’ve selected with query editing) and surfaces any attributes that have significantly different distributions in the events being targeted by the selected signal. For example, if a custom attribute indicated that a recent throughput spike came from one user, that would surface highly in Profiles if most of the traffic usually comes from many users. Traces tab If the entity has distributed traces configured and available in the selected evaluated time window, the Traces section is enabled. Each card shows a summary of a trace and can be clicked for details. The Explore all traces links to the distributed traces application, filtered to the selected entity. Create a custom view To target signals and time windows beyond the default values, click the Change view button and select Custom view. To create your own view: Select the account or subaccount. Select the data type (metrics or events). Different functionality is available depending on the type. In View a chart with, select the metric or event you are interested in. Default is golden signals (throughput, response time, and errors). You can also build custom queries (filters) to target a signal that isn't on the list. In Facet by, select what the circles represent. Default is appName, but you can also choose host or any other facetable attribute available for the signal you’ve selected. If you plan to save/favorite this new view, provide a name in the Name your view box. Keep in mind that you can edit this view at any time using the pencil icon. The default time windows analyzed by New Relic Lookout are the last five minutes compared to the hour before. Use the time controls (View data from and Compare data to) to target other time windows. one.newrelic.com > Apps > New Relic Lookout: All event and metric data in the New Relic database can be queried using the Edit query feature. Click Analyze to begin analyzing the signal you’ve selected. You can also create your own query: Create your query. This query is comparing data from the past thirty minutes to data from the same range a day ago. Change from Basic to Advanced after clicking the Custom view button. Select the data type (metrics or events). Different functionality is available depending on the type. Enter your query using NRQL. Please note that not all NRQL features are available in the Lookout Advanced query feature. By default, the system will run this query using the last five minutes of data compared to the previous hour. Some examples of the syntax for changing the comparison and evaluation time windows are below. Click Analyze to begin analyzing the signal you’ve selected. Query: Compare the last 15 minutes to the same time 1 day ago Please note that the UNTIL NOW portion is required here unlike in standard NRQL. Without the UNTIL NOW added, the system will query a 5 minute slice of data starting 15 minutes ago SINCE 15 minutes AGO UNTIL NOW COMPARE WITH 1 day ago Copy Query: Compare a specific time range to the same range a month ago SINCE '2021-03-07 07:00:00-0500' UNTIL '2021-03-08 07:00:00-0500' COMPARE WITH 1 month ago Copy Or: SINCE 'today at midnight' UNTIL 'now' COMPARE WITH 1 MONTH AGO Copy Example: Unusual increases in error count The default view of New Relic Lookout shows application status across your estate, comparing the last five minutes to the hour before. Under regular operation, most large systems may have a handful of abnormalities, but usually most things will indicate normal behavior. Suddenly, several circles begin to change to red under the Errors section. This indicates that several applications are experiencing unusual increases in error count. It may be that one or two circles for important systems are red, and perhaps much larger than they usually appear. Clicking one of these can provide more information on what is happening. You might see that the error rate is substantially elevated, even thousands of percent higher than normal. To troubleshoot this issue, here's what you might discover in the New Relic Lookout tabs: Performance would show you data about other signals, illuminating the characteristics of the change in system dynamics. Correlations would surface other applications that are affected and how, as well as opportunities to pivot to other applications that may be closer to the underlying causes. Traces, in turn, would show distributed traces, which can provide specific examples of traffic running through those systems. Abnormal history would show other times in the past week with elevated errors, showing whether or not this problem happens regularly, such as every day at the same time or whenever there is a deployment. Profiles might show that all or most of the new errors share common properties, such as all being isolated to just one region/account/user. Combining the information from these sections, not only can you get a sense of what is going on, but also where to focus actions to resolve the problem.",

      "body": "New Relic monitoring is built around the concept of entities. In this doc, you'll learn how we define entities, what you can do with them, and how you can create your own entities or groupings of entities. What's an entity? From a New Relic perspective, entity is purposefully a broad concept. An entity is anything that a) reports data to New Relic or that contains data that we have access to, and b) is something we've identified with a unique entity ID. For most entities, the ID is indicated by the attribute entityGuid. An entity can be any fundamental data-reporting component, like an application, a host, or a database service, but it can also refer to larger groupings of those components. For example, to monitor a data center, you could aggregate those hosts in New Relic to be a workload (a custom grouping of entities). That workload is, itself, also an entity. Also very important is the relationships between entities. Our behind-the-scenes relationship-mapping helps us understand how entities are connected, how they affect each other. And this allows us to give you the power to configure how any data you're bringing in is related to existing entities, or how it's related to other entities. Our focus on entities and their relationships is important because our goal is to give you practical information about your business-important entities, and not give you an unhelpfully huge stream of data from a huge list of monitored things. With more insight at the entity level, you can better monitor and troubleshoot complex, modern systems. Find and explore entities and entity data Tip You can create new entity types for monitoring any data source. Learn more about entity synthesis. Some tips for finding and understanding entity data: To find an entity's entityGuid and entityName and other metadata: from any list of monitored entities in the New Relic Explorer, click an entity's icon, and click See metadata and tags. For most entities, its GUID is reported as the attribute entityGuid. For workloads, it's workloadGuid. You can run NRQL queries to find entities by their GUID. To see connections between entities, you have several options: When viewing an entity in the UI, use the Related entities UI. Service maps. Distributed tracing. Our NerdGraph API. To group entities together, see Group entities. Customize entity definitions and relationships. To learn technical details about entity types, see our GitHub repo. In an entity type's definition file, you'll see information like: The domain: for example, APM, or Infra. Its type: for example, Application or AWSECSCONTAINERINSTANCE. Default tags. The entityExpirationTime: how long data from that entity lasts in the UI, which is different from database data retention. Group and organize entities You can place entities into groups that reflect business-important relationships in your organization. For example, you might group all entities related to a specific team or department, or related to a specific service. Or you might group multiple hosts together to reflect their grouping in a data center. To group your entities, see: Tag entities. Create workloads, which allow you to group business-important sets of entities. Create entities and customize entity data Customize entity data with entity synthesis If you have telemetry from any source that's not supported by New Relic out of the box, you can propose a mapping for it. Once approved, any telemetry received by New Relic that matches your definition file will be synthesized into an entity. To learn more: For reserved attributes and how entity relationships are defined, keep reading this doc. For how to do the work of modifying existing entity types or creating new ones, see our GitHub repo on entity synthesis. Reserved attributes for synthesized entities These attributes are meant to be synthesized from the telemetry we receive. Do not set them unless you're aware of the implications and consequences. Attribute Description entity.guid Generally, you should not set this attribute field on your telemetry data. New Relic may add this field to ingested data to store a unique identifier for the entity associated with the data point. If telemetry arrives with the entity.guid attribute already present, then New Relic will not change the value. However, it may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI, or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. One use case for passing this attribute is to associate ingested telemetry with an entity already created by New Relic. When the entity.guid attribute is sent, the value will override New Relic’s entity identification system (such as entity synthesis definitions) and instead will use the attribute as the data. entity.name This attribute shouldn't be put on ingested telemetry data unless you're trying to override the entity name that would have been selected by New Relic’s entity identification system. While New Relic won't change the value if it's already present on the data, New Relic may add the attribute to your data. Therefore invalid or unexpected values may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI, or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. If this field is present on ingested telemetry, its value will be used to name the entity associated with the data point. This name will be used instead of the name selected by New Relic’s entity identification system (for example, entity synthesis definitions). Note that many entities use the name as part of their identification, so changing this field may result in the generation of a new entity. entity.type This attribute shouldn't be put on ingested telemetry data except for certain legacy cases where it's required to distinguish entity types. Passing this field may interfere with entity detection, particularly if unrecognized values are sent in this field. While New Relic won't change the value if already present on the data, the field is not guaranteed to provide unambiguous filtering of telemetry at query-time. Existing entity definitions already have overlapping values, and we recommend avoiding entity.type in favor of other fields for filtering telemetry queries. This field is used by New Relic, meaning that invalid or unexpected values may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI, or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. To learn how to do the work of modifying existing entity types or creating new ones, see our GitHub repo on entity synthesis. Entity relationships Connections between entities are automatically created by New Relic based on what we can infer from your telemetry. For example, when two services that communicate using HTTP are instrumented with New Relic, we infer a \"calls/called-by\" relationship between them. When viewing a specific entity in either the New Relic Explorer, Navigator, or Lookout, you can see its Related entities in the entity's mini overview. This gives a visualization of the various entities connected directly to the current entity. You can quickly view important metrics for these related entities and navigate from one entity to another, through all the connected parts of your stack. Tip Learn more about how entities are related with our NerdGraph API. When relationships are not automatically detected, you can manually create them using the \"Add/edit related entities\" link in Related entities. Important Currently, you can only manually create calls/called-by relationships between service entities. Tip To manage manual relationships, you need to have modify and delete capabilities on entity relationships. If you don’t see the edit relationships button, contact your account admin. Which relationships are created? These are the relationships created between entities: Source: New Relic agent Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? Application instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS Application instrumented with a New Relic agent Relationships between applications monitored by New Relic agents are reported using the DurationByCaller metric. The callee reports the metric. For example, the metric DurationByCaller/Mobile/100/1234/HTTP/all indicates that the caller is APPLICATION 1234 for account 100. Application instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS Service instrumented with a New Relic agent An application (caller) that calls a service (callee) monitored by New Relic creates a relationship that's reported by the caller using the ExternalApp metric. For example, the metric ExternalApp/dirac.vips.net/100#1234/all indicates that the callee is APPLICATION 1234 for account 100. The metric is reported if the callee successfully responds to the caller. Service instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS Service instrumented with a New Relic agent When a New Relic agent detects that a service (caller) calls another service (callee) instrumented by New Relic, the callee reports the metric ClientApplication. For example, the metric ClientApplication/100#1234/all indicates that the caller is APPLICATION 1234 for account 100. Service instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS A datastore instance When an application calls a datastore instance it creates a relationship reported with the DatastoreInstance metric. For example, the metric Datastore/instance/MySQL/172.16.16.3/3306 indicates the datastore instance is vendor: MySQL, host: 172.16.16.3, port: 3306. This metric also supports the legacy datastore instance format Datastore/instance/MySQL/172.16.16.3:3306. Currently we cannot determine whether the datastore instance is instrumented by New Relic and has an entity associated to it. APM agent SERVES Browser agent This relationship is created when an APM agent injects the browser agent into a page. Workload entity CONTAINS Any entity When a workload is created or updated, relationships for each of the entities that belong to the workload are created. Because some workloads are “dynamic” (defined by tags), relationships are re-created every 5 minutes. This way entities can join or leave the workload. Source: Infrastructure Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? Infrastructure host HOSTS Application This relationship is created when an application is running in one or more hosts, and the infra agent is running in those hosts. Infrastructure host HOSTS Container This relationship is created when containers are running in one or more hosts, and the host is instrumented with the infra agent. Source: Synthetics monitor Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? Synthetics Monitor CALLS Browser agent This relationship is created when a synthetics monitor checks a page instrumented with the browser agent. Synthetics Monitor CALLS APM application Agent events that contain the attribute nr.syntheticsMonitorId have been described as synthetics monitors (the source) interacting with an APM application (the target). If the header exists and the APM application Id exists, a relationship is created between the monitor and the app. Source: Kubernetes Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? Cluster CONTAINS Pod This relationship is created when a pod is created in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Cluster CONTAINS Deployment This relationship is created when a deployment is created in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Cluster CONTAINS DaemonSet This relationship is created when a DaemonSet is created in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Cluster CONTAINS StatefulSet This relationship is created when a StatefulSet is created in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Cluster CONTAINS Host This relationship is created when a host that's part of a cluster is instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Deployment CONTAINS Pod This relationship is created when a deployment creates a pod in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. DaemonSet CONTAINS Pod This relationship is created when a DaemonSet is created a pod in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. StatefulSet CONTAINS Pod This relationship is created when a StatefulSet creates a pod in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Pod CONTAINS Container This relationship is created when a pod creates a container in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Host HOSTS Pod This relationship is created when a pod is running in a host that's part of a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Container HOSTS Application This relationship is created when an application is running in docker, and the hosts where docker is running are instrumented by the the infra agent. External services Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? External service CALLS External service When the relationship is created, the external service reports a span with its name on the service.name attribute and the name of the service that initiates the call in the parent.service.name attribute. Application IS External service A relationship between an application and an external service is created so that users can navigate between them using the related entities component. Browser application instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS External service A browser application reports an Ajax/HostTransaction metric when calling an external service (URL). Example metric: Ajax/HostTransaction/api.segment.io:443/CallbackTime' Cluster CONTAINS External service When the relationship is created, the external service reports a span with the attribute k8s.cluster.name, the name of the cluster. The cluster must be instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration and the cluster name set for the integration must match the one reported in the span. Pod HOSTS External service When the relationship is created, the external service reports a span with the following attributes: service.name: The name of the service. k8s.cluster.name: The name of the cluster. k8s.pod.name: The name of the pod that’s running the service. k8s.namespace.name: The namespace where the pod was created. The cluster must be instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration and the cluster name set for the integration must match the one reported in the span.",

      "body": "New Relic Lookout provides visibility into your entire estate. It doesn't require any configuration — you can query anything in your estate that matters to you right now and understand your system as a whole, or dive deep into causes and effects, so you can quickly get the data you need to take action. Know exactly where to focus your attention with New Relic Lookout. The brighter the color, the more severe the change, and the bigger the size, the bigger the scale. Then dig deeper with correlations and abnormal history to see how it impacts your whole system—no configuration needed. Why it matters New Relic Lookout helps software teams of any size discover potential issues before they have an impact. Fill gaps in monitoring with full coverage out-of-the-box, no configuration or setup required. Immediately see anything deviating from normal across your entire estate. Proactively spot emerging problems in a real-time visualization of all system components. Gain faster incidents resolution through automatically surfaced causes and effects. Analyze any data in New Relic database (NRDB), including third-party, open, and custom data. Launch into other areas of New Relic One for deeper understanding Requirements New Relic Lookout requires Pro or Enterprise edition. If you are on Standard edition, you can still use the New Relic Lookout view in the New Relic Explorer. If you want to see data spanning 13-months, correlations, profiles, traces, and other details, you must upgrade to a higher edition. Get started with New Relic Lookout To access New Relic Lookout, click the Apps button in New Relic One and locate the New Relic Lookout launcher. You can also access New Relic Lookout directly from the New Relic One header bar, via the More dropdown. Enablement of key service performance indicator data is required for New Relic Lookout to provide value from the data you already have. The default view provides insight into three key Service performance indicators broken down by application: throughput, response time, and errors. These metrics are analyzed to show how the data has behaved during the last five minutes compared to the prior hour. one.newrelic.com > Apps > New Relic Lookout: Anything that significantly deviates from the trend is automatically discovered by New Relic Lookout, which doesn't require any configuration. Circle visualization and table view Each application (or other facet) is represented by a circle. The size of the circles indicate the magnitude of the signal for that application and the color indicates whether the value has significantly decreased or increased in the last five minutes, based on the standard deviation of the prior hour (default evaluation and comparison time windows.) Please note that the type of signal is important when interpreting your results. When you first look at the legend below, you might be tempted to interpret yellow as good and dark purple as bad, but that is not always the case. Here are some examples: In the APM/services golden signals, a dark yellow circle in Throughput might signify that something bad has occurred and led to a drop in traffic. At the same time, a dark purple circle might also be concerning due to unexpected load. Both are significant findings worth exploring. In browser golden signals, a dark purple circle in Page Views might be great, as you are seeing more traffic to your site! With errors golden signals (in all entity types), a large circle, even if gray (not deviating from normal volume), is worth exploring because a high count of errors in your system is important to investigate. The legend allows you to change the colors used to highlight deviating services To change the color palette, click the gear icon by the low-high color legend. This allows you to change the colors used to highlight deviating services. To get a table view of the same data, click the toggle on the right. You can also hover over each color to filter the view by degree lower or higher deviance. Abnormal golden signals On the right, New Relic Lookout displays the most significantly deviating applications (or other facet) in a side panel, weighted by both the magnitude of the performance indicators and the scale of their deviations. Details include the name of the key performance indicator, their magnitude during the recent time window, and the difference between the averages from one time compared to the other. Instant search Click the magnifying glass icon in the side panel to open a search box. Typing into the search box filters the circles, table, and abnormal signals to applications (or other facets) that contain the text. This is a good way to quickly zoom to various subsystems. New Relic Lookout doesn't rerun the analysis when using the instant search. Change view Click the Change View button on the right side panel. The panel that appears shows you all the entity-specific golden signals you can toggle between out of the box. By choosing the Browser Golden Signal or other views, you can change from the default view. Each new view will have the golden signals appropriate for that entity type. Drill down into the details To analyze an application or facet, click a circle, table row, or abnormal golden signal. The details panel shows the degree of deviation of the performance indicator, a link to the affected entity, and recent alert and deployment activity for that entity, when available. There’s also an indication of whether the selected evaluation time period would be abnormal or not in reference to other comparison time windows, such as the same time yesterday or the same time last week. This allows you to quickly see if the abnormal behavior is odd in general, or just based on the comparison time window. Performance tab The default tab shows charts for other key performance indicators for the selected application or facet. The charts compare the two time windows being analyzed. You can click their titles to rerun the analysis, focusing on the selected key performance indicator. When the target is a New Relic One application, we show the top transactions, error classes, external services, and database operations, alongside links to the relevant New Relic One features. Abnormal History tab This section analyzes past performance of the selected signal and calls out any time periods with notable abnormalities. Each card represents an abnormal time window and can be clicked for more details. The charts will display any relevant violations and deployments in New Relic. Correlations tab New Relic Lookout can find other signals that began behaving differently around the same time as the selected signal for that entity type. Clicking the name of the signal reruns the analysis, focusing on that key performance indicator. The chart titles link to New Relic One when there’s an associated entity in your account. Note that correlations currently do not analyze across accounts. The correlated signals displayed are for others in the account of the original application you are viewing. This helps focus the data on correlations that are more likely related to your issue. Profile tab Based on the same technology as New Relic’s error profiles, this tab compares the last five minutes to the prior hour by default (or whatever time windows you’ve selected with query editing) and surfaces any attributes that have significantly different distributions in the events being targeted by the selected signal. For example, if a custom attribute indicated that a recent throughput spike came from one user, that would surface highly in Profiles if most of the traffic usually comes from many users. Traces tab If the entity has distributed traces configured and available in the selected evaluated time window, the Traces section is enabled. Each card shows a summary of a trace and can be clicked for details. The Explore all traces links to the distributed traces application, filtered to the selected entity. Create a custom view To target signals and time windows beyond the default values, click the Change view button and select Custom view. To create your own view: Select the account or subaccount. Select the data type (metrics or events). Different functionality is available depending on the type. In View a chart with, select the metric or event you are interested in. Default is golden signals (throughput, response time, and errors). You can also build custom queries (filters) to target a signal that isn't on the list. In Facet by, select what the circles represent. Default is appName, but you can also choose host or any other facetable attribute available for the signal you’ve selected. If you plan to save/favorite this new view, provide a name in the Name your view box. Keep in mind that you can edit this view at any time using the pencil icon. The default time windows analyzed by New Relic Lookout are the last five minutes compared to the hour before. Use the time controls (View data from and Compare data to) to target other time windows. one.newrelic.com > Apps > New Relic Lookout: All event and metric data in the New Relic database can be queried using the Edit query feature. Click Analyze to begin analyzing the signal you’ve selected. You can also create your own query: Create your query. This query is comparing data from the past thirty minutes to data from the same range a day ago. Change from Basic to Advanced after clicking the Custom view button. Select the data type (metrics or events). Different functionality is available depending on the type. Enter your query using NRQL. Please note that not all NRQL features are available in the Lookout Advanced query feature. By default, the system will run this query using the last five minutes of data compared to the previous hour. Some examples of the syntax for changing the comparison and evaluation time windows are below. Click Analyze to begin analyzing the signal you’ve selected. Query: Compare the last 15 minutes to the same time 1 day ago Please note that the UNTIL NOW portion is required here unlike in standard NRQL. Without the UNTIL NOW added, the system will query a 5 minute slice of data starting 15 minutes ago SINCE 15 minutes AGO UNTIL NOW COMPARE WITH 1 day ago Copy Query: Compare a specific time range to the same range a month ago SINCE '2021-03-07 07:00:00-0500' UNTIL '2021-03-08 07:00:00-0500' COMPARE WITH 1 month ago Copy Or: SINCE 'today at midnight' UNTIL 'now' COMPARE WITH 1 MONTH AGO Copy Example: Unusual increases in error count The default view of New Relic Lookout shows application status across your estate, comparing the last five minutes to the hour before. Under regular operation, most large systems may have a handful of abnormalities, but usually most things will indicate normal behavior. Suddenly, several circles begin to change to red under the Errors section. This indicates that several applications are experiencing unusual increases in error count. It may be that one or two circles for important systems are red, and perhaps much larger than they usually appear. Clicking one of these can provide more information on what is happening. You might see that the error rate is substantially elevated, even thousands of percent higher than normal. To troubleshoot this issue, here's what you might discover in the New Relic Lookout tabs: Performance would show you data about other signals, illuminating the characteristics of the change in system dynamics. Correlations would surface other applications that are affected and how, as well as opportunities to pivot to other applications that may be closer to the underlying causes. Traces, in turn, would show distributed traces, which can provide specific examples of traffic running through those systems. Abnormal history would show other times in the past week with elevated errors, showing whether or not this problem happens regularly, such as every day at the same time or whenever there is a deployment. Profiles might show that all or most of the new errors share common properties, such as all being isolated to just one region/account/user. Combining the information from these sections, not only can you get a sense of what is going on, but also where to focus actions to resolve the problem.",

Read more about New Relic Lookout. Tip You can modify the color palette to focus on clusters of interest. Understand the state of your system with the health (alert) status The New Relic Explorer shows a color-coded health status for entities. For example, you may see a red alert status indicating a critical violation in progress. To see what an alert status means, mouse over it. To see details about an entity's alerting status, select the entity. NRQL alert conditions aren't used to determine alert status because they aren't associated with specific entities. Important Starting June 8, 2020, New Relic One will not continue to display any APM application that hasn't reported data for 93 days. To match our published APM data retention guidelines, applications that have not reported data will be available within the New Relic UI for 90 days. After 90 days, those applications will be removed from the UI; however, key metrics will continue to be available via the New Relic REST API based on subscription level. For more information, see New Relic's Explorers Hub post. Filter entities using the filterbar The filterbar lets you select the entities displayed according to the conditions you enter: Type in a string of characters and/or numbers (for example, an environment) to find any entity that has this string in their name or ID. When typing, the UI suggests items that coincide with the string you're entering, so you can select one of those from the dropdown. You can also filter by the name of the entity, the entity type, account ID, environment, or a tag. Tip Selection parameters, once created, have a blue background. If you filter using a string, the filter will have the = operator. If you filter using the dropdown menu, once the first element of the searched item (tag key or attribute) is entered, you need to select an operator (=, !=, LIKE, NOT_LIKE, IN, NOT IN) for your filter. Once the operator is selected, complete the filter by selecting the value to complete the search item. To add more filters, first you have to select an operator, AND or OR. Use AND to indicate you want to restrict the selection removing entities from the list of results. You can also use the AND operator to add conditions that need to be met in the list of results, for example, entityType = Services AND location = APAC. Note that entityType = Services AND entityType = Hosts doesn’t return any results, as entities can only have one type and no entity would match this condition. Use OR to add more entities to the selection. For example, the filter entityType = Services OR entityType = Hosts returns every entity you have access to that is of type Services or Hosts. Entity data retention Availability of data depends on these factors: Scope Data retention New Relic Explorer and search In the UI, data is available for eight days after an entity no longer exists, with one exception: data reported by integrations, such as Amazon AWS, is only available for one day after an entity ceases to exist. Our database (accessible via NRQL query) For querying our database (for example, via the query builder or data explorer), availability is dependent on the data retention for that data type. As a result of these factors, a short-lived entity (like a cloud host) may not be available in the explorer list or via search, but its data may still be available via NRQL query.",

      "body": "In the software industry, a tag typically refers to a piece of metadata added to a data set for the purpose of improving data organization and findability. At New Relic, our tags are key:value pairs (like team: operations) added to various sets of data, like monitored apps and hosts, agents, dashboards, and workloads. We make some important attributes available as tags (for example, app metadata like app name and language, and host metadata like host name and AWS region). You can also add your own custom tags. You can use tags in the UI to filter down to relevant data. Here is an example: Here you can see an accountId tag being used to filter workloads to a specific account. Tags help you to: Organize data coming from a large number of sources and/or to a large number of New Relic accounts. Identify teams, roles, environments, or regions to know who’s responsible for what (see example use cases). Better organize and search dashboards and workloads. Query and chart APM data. Tags are useful for organizing data at a high level. If you want to add more fine-grained detail, like capturing user names or other high-cardinality values, custom attributes or custom events are a better solution. Tip Tags were previously called labels in the New Relic UI. You may sometimes see labelin our code; for example, some of our APM agent config files use a label config option for tags. Tag format and limits Format requirements and limits for tags: The UI has limits on the total number of tags it can display per entity: Limit of 100 for tags reported by default or added via agent/integration configuration. Limit of 100 for custom tags added via UI or API. The following are maximum character length for tags: Key: 128 characters Value: 256 characters When using our API to add tags, a dash (-) in a tag key is interpreted as a minus symbol. If your tag key has a dash, use back ticks around it (like `key-name`). Best practices and tips Before adding tags, we recommend first seeing how our default tags work for you. When you're ready to add your own tags, review the following best practices tips to get the most out of them. Tips on keeping tags simple: Start by adding only tags you know you’ll definitely use. Unused tags create noise and may add confusion. Try to use short tags. Shorter tags are easier to parse, and also the UI may sometimes truncate longer tags. (See character limits.) When possible, use keys and values that are human-readable (for example, region: EMEA is better than Param8323 : 1229072). Avoid including several values like regions: EMEA | US | LATAM in a single tag. We recommend using three different tags for that, like region: emea, region: us, and region: latam. If you want to match multiple tags, you can do that using the advanced options in the filter UI. Tips on using tags consistently: Try to be consistent with tag language across your teams and entities. Be consistent with naming. For example, avoid using both region: emea and reg: emea. Be consistent with format. For example, avoid using both camelCase and kebab-case. Although tag searching is not case-sensitive in the UI and API, try to be consistent with capitalization. For example, avoid using both env: staging and env: Staging. Tips on cross-team implementation: Tags help improve observability and cost allocation. For this reason, responsibility for tag implementation is often assigned to an observability team, SREs, a group of architects, or a cross-team task force. We recommend the people responsible for implementing tags meet and create an internal policy to describe how the tags are defined and which conventions are to be used. Then: Keep this reference manual up to date. Automate the definition of tags when you deploy New Relic agents, at the cloud provider, or through New Relic automation tools, such as the API or Terraform. Create recurring reports that identify entities that are non-compliant with your tagging standards. Tag examples Here are some examples of common ways to use tags to organize data: Team-related tags Creating tags for team names can be helpful to understand which team, group, department, or region was responsible for a change that led to a performance issue. Team examples: team: backend team: frontend team: db Role examples: roles: architecture roles: devops roles: pm Region examples: region: emea region: america region: asia Environment-related tags You can create entities for the environment they belong to. Examples: env: production env: qa env: development env: staging Criticality-related tags You can create tags related to criticality levels, which lets you easier track the most critical issues. Examples: layer: level1 layer: level2 layer: level3 How tags are added Some important attributes, by default, are available for use as tags. For example, the account name, the account ID, and some basic host/server metadata are available as default tags. You can't remove these available-by-default tags. Here are some details about how tags are added for some specific data sources: Add tags via UI or API When you add tags via the UI or API, this occurs at the entity level. This means that, for example, if you have multiple APM agents monitoring a single entity and apply a tag via the UI, that tag is available for all data coming from that entity. To add or delete tags via the UI: Select a monitored entity, like a monitored app or host. Near the entity’s name at the top of the page, select the See metadata and manage tags menu. In the menu that pops up, add or delete a tag. For APM agents, restart your service. To manage tags via API: see our NerdGraph tagging docs. For a guide to using our CLI to automate tagging, see our developer site. APM agent tags You can add tags via the UI and API or you can add tags using APM agent configuration, both methods require you to restart your service. There are differences in how these apply tags: Via agent config: These tags are applied at the agent-level, not the entity/application level. This would be a good option if you have multiple agents monitoring different aspects of the same app (for example, a blue-green deployment model). Via the UI or API: These tags are applied at the entity/application level. Here are links to the agent configuration options: C SDK: not available Java Go .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby For information on querying APM tags, see Query APM tags. Infrastructure data tags There are several ways tags are added to infrastructure entities and services: Use the UI or API to add tags at the entity level. Infrastructure agent: some attributes are available by default as tags. You can also add custom attributes, which are also available as tags in the UI. On-host integrations: some attributes are available by default as tags. You can also add tags by using integration-specific labels config options (for an example, see the labels config for the Apache integration). Cloud service integrations: by default we report tags and labels that are defined in the cloud service. To add tags, you'd add them on the cloud-service-side. Automate tags with our CLI For a guide to automating tags using our CLI tool, see our developer site. Use tags to filter the UI Use the filter field at the top of the New Relic Explorer to filter down to the entities you care about. You can use multiple filter conditions. To filter down to certain entities using tags: From one.newrelic.com, click Explorer. Click the Filter by... field to see a dropdown of available attributes and tags. You can filter by multiple elements and use advanced search options. To find an entity’s metadata and tags from the UI, here are two options: From a list of entities in the UI, at the far right, select an entity's icon. OR Select an entity. Near the top of the page, select the icon. To use the API to view tags, see our NerdGraph docs. Learn about how to use tags with dashboards and how to use tags with workloads. Custom queries, charts, and alerts Different features handle tags differently. Here are some details about how you can use NRQL to query tag data, or create NRQL condition alerts. Query and alert on APM tags You can query APM tags using NRQL. Minimum agent versions: C: not available Go: 2.3.0 Java: 4.9.0 .NET: 8.17 Node: v4.13.0 PHP: not available Python: v4.10.0.112 Ruby: 6.1.0.352 Here are some query examples: Throughput across shards Given a service that is distributed across nine shards, each shard assigned as an environment, we can plot the transaction throughput on all shards using a wildcard query like: SELECT rate(count(apm.service.transaction.duration), 1 minute) FROM Metric WHERE appName LIKE 'MyApp (%' AND transactionType = 'Other' FACET tags.Environment TIMESERIES Copy Transactions per team To see the number of transactions per service for a specific team, we might use a query like: FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) WHERE tags.Team = 'team-a' FACET tags.Project TIMESERIES Copy Alert on error rate for teams You can use a query for your services’ error rate for setting an alert without having to create a rule for each service. Here is the error rate for all services on a team called team-b. And this alert will automatically monitor any new app names added with the team tag. FROM Metric SELECT count(apm.service.error.count) / count(apm.service.transaction.duration) WHERE tags.Team = 'team-b' FACET appName Copy Related to this, you might create a general rule for a specific service deployed across several environments, so that we have an alarm for a single service monitoring each environment individually: From Metric SELECT count(apm.service.error.count) / count(apm.service.transaction.duration) WHERE tags.Project = 'MyProject' FACET tags.Environment Copy Query and alert on attributes As explained in the tag sources information, some important attributes are used as tags. You can query all attributes and create custom charts using NRQL, and create NRQL alert conditions.",

      "body": "New Relic Lookout provides visibility into your entire estate. It doesn't require any configuration — you can query anything in your estate that matters to you right now and understand your system as a whole, or dive deep into causes and effects, so you can quickly get the data you need to take action. Know exactly where to focus your attention with New Relic Lookout. The brighter the color, the more severe the change, and the bigger the size, the bigger the scale. Then dig deeper with correlations and abnormal history to see how it impacts your whole system—no configuration needed. Why it matters New Relic Lookout helps software teams of any size discover potential issues before they have an impact. Fill gaps in monitoring with full coverage out-of-the-box, no configuration or setup required. Immediately see anything deviating from normal across your entire estate. Proactively spot emerging problems in a real-time visualization of all system components. Gain faster incidents resolution through automatically surfaced causes and effects. Analyze any data in New Relic database (NRDB), including third-party, open, and custom data. Launch into other areas of New Relic One for deeper understanding Requirements New Relic Lookout requires Pro or Enterprise edition. If you are on Standard edition, you can still use the New Relic Lookout view in the New Relic Explorer. If you want to see data spanning 13-months, correlations, profiles, traces, and other details, you must upgrade to a higher edition. Get started with New Relic Lookout To access New Relic Lookout, click the Apps button in New Relic One and locate the New Relic Lookout launcher. You can also access New Relic Lookout directly from the New Relic One header bar, via the More dropdown. Enablement of key service performance indicator data is required for New Relic Lookout to provide value from the data you already have. The default view provides insight into three key Service performance indicators broken down by application: throughput, response time, and errors. These metrics are analyzed to show how the data has behaved during the last five minutes compared to the prior hour. one.newrelic.com > Apps > New Relic Lookout: Anything that significantly deviates from the trend is automatically discovered by New Relic Lookout, which doesn't require any configuration. Circle visualization and table view Each application (or other facet) is represented by a circle. The size of the circles indicate the magnitude of the signal for that application and the color indicates whether the value has significantly decreased or increased in the last five minutes, based on the standard deviation of the prior hour (default evaluation and comparison time windows.) Please note that the type of signal is important when interpreting your results. When you first look at the legend below, you might be tempted to interpret yellow as good and dark purple as bad, but that is not always the case. Here are some examples: In the APM/services golden signals, a dark yellow circle in Throughput might signify that something bad has occurred and led to a drop in traffic. At the same time, a dark purple circle might also be concerning due to unexpected load. Both are significant findings worth exploring. In browser golden signals, a dark purple circle in Page Views might be great, as you are seeing more traffic to your site! With errors golden signals (in all entity types), a large circle, even if gray (not deviating from normal volume), is worth exploring because a high count of errors in your system is important to investigate. The legend allows you to change the colors used to highlight deviating services To change the color palette, click the gear icon by the low-high color legend. This allows you to change the colors used to highlight deviating services. To get a table view of the same data, click the toggle on the right. You can also hover over each color to filter the view by degree lower or higher deviance. Abnormal golden signals On the right, New Relic Lookout displays the most significantly deviating applications (or other facet) in a side panel, weighted by both the magnitude of the performance indicators and the scale of their deviations. Details include the name of the key performance indicator, their magnitude during the recent time window, and the difference between the averages from one time compared to the other. Instant search Click the magnifying glass icon in the side panel to open a search box. Typing into the search box filters the circles, table, and abnormal signals to applications (or other facets) that contain the text. This is a good way to quickly zoom to various subsystems. New Relic Lookout doesn't rerun the analysis when using the instant search. Change view Click the Change View button on the right side panel. The panel that appears shows you all the entity-specific golden signals you can toggle between out of the box. By choosing the Browser Golden Signal or other views, you can change from the default view. Each new view will have the golden signals appropriate for that entity type. Drill down into the details To analyze an application or facet, click a circle, table row, or abnormal golden signal. The details panel shows the degree of deviation of the performance indicator, a link to the affected entity, and recent alert and deployment activity for that entity, when available. There’s also an indication of whether the selected evaluation time period would be abnormal or not in reference to other comparison time windows, such as the same time yesterday or the same time last week. This allows you to quickly see if the abnormal behavior is odd in general, or just based on the comparison time window. Performance tab The default tab shows charts for other key performance indicators for the selected application or facet. The charts compare the two time windows being analyzed. You can click their titles to rerun the analysis, focusing on the selected key performance indicator. When the target is a New Relic One application, we show the top transactions, error classes, external services, and database operations, alongside links to the relevant New Relic One features. Abnormal History tab This section analyzes past performance of the selected signal and calls out any time periods with notable abnormalities. Each card represents an abnormal time window and can be clicked for more details. The charts will display any relevant violations and deployments in New Relic. Correlations tab New Relic Lookout can find other signals that began behaving differently around the same time as the selected signal for that entity type. Clicking the name of the signal reruns the analysis, focusing on that key performance indicator. The chart titles link to New Relic One when there’s an associated entity in your account. Note that correlations currently do not analyze across accounts. The correlated signals displayed are for others in the account of the original application you are viewing. This helps focus the data on correlations that are more likely related to your issue. Profile tab Based on the same technology as New Relic’s error profiles, this tab compares the last five minutes to the prior hour by default (or whatever time windows you’ve selected with query editing) and surfaces any attributes that have significantly different distributions in the events being targeted by the selected signal. For example, if a custom attribute indicated that a recent throughput spike came from one user, that would surface highly in Profiles if most of the traffic usually comes from many users. Traces tab If the entity has distributed traces configured and available in the selected evaluated time window, the Traces section is enabled. Each card shows a summary of a trace and can be clicked for details. The Explore all traces links to the distributed traces application, filtered to the selected entity. Create a custom view To target signals and time windows beyond the default values, click the Change view button and select Custom view. To create your own view: Select the account or subaccount. Select the data type (metrics or events). Different functionality is available depending on the type. In View a chart with, select the metric or event you are interested in. Default is golden signals (throughput, response time, and errors). You can also build custom queries (filters) to target a signal that isn't on the list. In Facet by, select what the circles represent. Default is appName, but you can also choose host or any other facetable attribute available for the signal you’ve selected. If you plan to save/favorite this new view, provide a name in the Name your view box. Keep in mind that you can edit this view at any time using the pencil icon. The default time windows analyzed by New Relic Lookout are the last five minutes compared to the hour before. Use the time controls (View data from and Compare data to) to target other time windows. one.newrelic.com > Apps > New Relic Lookout: All event and metric data in the New Relic database can be queried using the Edit query feature. Click Analyze to begin analyzing the signal you’ve selected. You can also create your own query: Create your query. This query is comparing data from the past thirty minutes to data from the same range a day ago. Change from Basic to Advanced after clicking the Custom view button. Select the data type (metrics or events). Different functionality is available depending on the type. Enter your query using NRQL. Please note that not all NRQL features are available in the Lookout Advanced query feature. By default, the system will run this query using the last five minutes of data compared to the previous hour. Some examples of the syntax for changing the comparison and evaluation time windows are below. Click Analyze to begin analyzing the signal you’ve selected. Query: Compare the last 15 minutes to the same time 1 day ago Please note that the UNTIL NOW portion is required here unlike in standard NRQL. Without the UNTIL NOW added, the system will query a 5 minute slice of data starting 15 minutes ago SINCE 15 minutes AGO UNTIL NOW COMPARE WITH 1 day ago Copy Query: Compare a specific time range to the same range a month ago SINCE '2021-03-07 07:00:00-0500' UNTIL '2021-03-08 07:00:00-0500' COMPARE WITH 1 month ago Copy Or: SINCE 'today at midnight' UNTIL 'now' COMPARE WITH 1 MONTH AGO Copy Example: Unusual increases in error count The default view of New Relic Lookout shows application status across your estate, comparing the last five minutes to the hour before. Under regular operation, most large systems may have a handful of abnormalities, but usually most things will indicate normal behavior. Suddenly, several circles begin to change to red under the Errors section. This indicates that several applications are experiencing unusual increases in error count. It may be that one or two circles for important systems are red, and perhaps much larger than they usually appear. Clicking one of these can provide more information on what is happening. You might see that the error rate is substantially elevated, even thousands of percent higher than normal. To troubleshoot this issue, here's what you might discover in the New Relic Lookout tabs: Performance would show you data about other signals, illuminating the characteristics of the change in system dynamics. Correlations would surface other applications that are affected and how, as well as opportunities to pivot to other applications that may be closer to the underlying causes. Traces, in turn, would show distributed traces, which can provide specific examples of traffic running through those systems. Abnormal history would show other times in the past week with elevated errors, showing whether or not this problem happens regularly, such as every day at the same time or whenever there is a deployment. Profiles might show that all or most of the new errors share common properties, such as all being isolated to just one region/account/user. Combining the information from these sections, not only can you get a sense of what is going on, but also where to focus actions to resolve the problem.",

Drill down and locate problematic entities easily with our improved search capabilities, and benefit from the AND and OR operators in one place. See everything. All the different entity types you have access to are listed in the collapsible sidebar on the left of the screen. This sidebar is interactive and used for exploratory purposes. It allows you to see only entities of the selected type, as it updates the filter from the filterbar. Create a new workload for meaningful groupings of your monitored entities. Add more data to instrument more elements of your system and achieve full stack observability. List view Your monitored entities are on the left, in a collapsable menu. You may need to scroll your list of entities to see them all. The list view also has a collapsable activity stream on the right side. You can see different useful events related to the first 25 alerting entities which are currently being filtered. Click on any entity for more details on its performance. The entity overview also incorporates the relationship between the selected entity and other entities in your system. New Relic Navigator The New Relic Navigator makes it easy to explore large numbers of entities as it intuitively displays the entire estate of your system in a highly dense honeycomb view with traffic light colors based on alerts. With the New Relic Navigator you can: Quickly explore the health of your environment at a glance. See all the entities that belong to all your accounts, and focus on specific entity types or specific groups of entities grouped by tags. Group and filter across all your entities to quickly zero in on issues. Click on any entity to see a mini-overview of its activity, metrics, and meta-data. New Relic Lookout New Relic Lookout provides an intuitive view of entities that are deviating from normal behavior, using circle visualization with color indicating severity and size conveying the scale of recent changes. You don’t need to configure anything: New Relic Lookout automatically compares performance within the last five minutes against the previous hour. Use New Relic Lookout to: Select the entity type to see golden signals of throughput, response time, and errors across all your accounts. Zoom in with correlations, abnormal history, traces, and the ability to leverage New Relic’s profiles across your estate. Click on an entity of interest to access the mini-overview component. Read more about New Relic Lookout. Tip You can modify the color palette to focus on clusters of interest. Understand the state of your system with the health (alert) status The New Relic Explorer shows a color-coded health status for entities. For example, you may see a red alert status indicating a critical violation in progress. To see what an alert status means, mouse over it. To see details about an entity's alerting status, select the entity. NRQL alert conditions aren't used to determine alert status because they aren't associated with specific entities. Important Starting June 8, 2020, New Relic One will not continue to display any APM application that hasn't reported data for 93 days. To match our published APM data retention guidelines, applications that have not reported data will be available within the New Relic UI for 90 days. After 90 days, those applications will be removed from the UI; however, key metrics will continue to be available via the New Relic REST API based on subscription level. For more information, see New Relic's Explorers Hub post. Filter entities using the filterbar The filterbar lets you select the entities displayed according to the conditions you enter: Type in a string of characters and/or numbers (for example, an environment) to find any entity that has this string in their name or ID. When typing, the UI suggests items that coincide with the string you're entering, so you can select one of those from the dropdown. You can also filter by the name of the entity, the entity type, account ID, environment, or a tag. Tip Selection parameters, once created, have a blue background. If you filter using a string, the filter will have the = operator. If you filter using the dropdown menu, once the first element of the searched item (tag key or attribute) is entered, you need to select an operator (=, !=, LIKE, NOT_LIKE, IN, NOT IN) for your filter. Once the operator is selected, complete the filter by selecting the value to complete the search item. To add more filters, first you have to select an operator, AND or OR. Use AND to indicate you want to restrict the selection removing entities from the list of results. You can also use the AND operator to add conditions that need to be met in the list of results, for example, entityType = Services AND location = APAC. Note that entityType = Services AND entityType = Hosts doesn’t return any results, as entities can only have one type and no entity would match this condition. Use OR to add more entities to the selection. For example, the filter entityType = Services OR entityType = Hosts returns every entity you have access to that is of type Services or Hosts. Entity data retention Availability of data depends on these factors: Scope Data retention New Relic Explorer and search In the UI, data is available for eight days after an entity no longer exists, with one exception: data reported by integrations, such as Amazon AWS, is only available for one day after an entity ceases to exist. Our database (accessible via NRQL query) For querying our database (for example, via the query builder or data explorer), availability is dependent on the data retention for that data type. As a result of these factors, a short-lived entity (like a cloud host) may not be available in the explorer list or via search, but its data may still be available via NRQL query.",

      "body": "New Relic Lookout provides visibility into your entire estate. It doesn't require any configuration — you can query anything in your estate that matters to you right now and understand your system as a whole, or dive deep into causes and effects, so you can quickly get the data you need to take action. Know exactly where to focus your attention with New Relic Lookout. The brighter the color, the more severe the change, and the bigger the size, the bigger the scale. Then dig deeper with correlations and abnormal history to see how it impacts your whole system—no configuration needed. Why it matters New Relic Lookout helps software teams of any size discover potential issues before they have an impact. Fill gaps in monitoring with full coverage out-of-the-box, no configuration or setup required. Immediately see anything deviating from normal across your entire estate. Proactively spot emerging problems in a real-time visualization of all system components. Gain faster incidents resolution through automatically surfaced causes and effects. Analyze any data in New Relic database (NRDB), including third-party, open, and custom data. Launch into other areas of New Relic One for deeper understanding Requirements New Relic Lookout requires Pro or Enterprise edition. If you are on Standard edition, you can still use the New Relic Lookout view in the New Relic Explorer. If you want to see data spanning 13-months, correlations, profiles, traces, and other details, you must upgrade to a higher edition. Get started with New Relic Lookout To access New Relic Lookout, click the Apps button in New Relic One and locate the New Relic Lookout launcher. You can also access New Relic Lookout directly from the New Relic One header bar, via the More dropdown. Enablement of key service performance indicator data is required for New Relic Lookout to provide value from the data you already have. The default view provides insight into three key Service performance indicators broken down by application: throughput, response time, and errors. These metrics are analyzed to show how the data has behaved during the last five minutes compared to the prior hour. one.newrelic.com > Apps > New Relic Lookout: Anything that significantly deviates from the trend is automatically discovered by New Relic Lookout, which doesn't require any configuration. Circle visualization and table view Each application (or other facet) is represented by a circle. The size of the circles indicate the magnitude of the signal for that application and the color indicates whether the value has significantly decreased or increased in the last five minutes, based on the standard deviation of the prior hour (default evaluation and comparison time windows.) Please note that the type of signal is important when interpreting your results. When you first look at the legend below, you might be tempted to interpret yellow as good and dark purple as bad, but that is not always the case. Here are some examples: In the APM/services golden signals, a dark yellow circle in Throughput might signify that something bad has occurred and led to a drop in traffic. At the same time, a dark purple circle might also be concerning due to unexpected load. Both are significant findings worth exploring. In browser golden signals, a dark purple circle in Page Views might be great, as you are seeing more traffic to your site! With errors golden signals (in all entity types), a large circle, even if gray (not deviating from normal volume), is worth exploring because a high count of errors in your system is important to investigate. The legend allows you to change the colors used to highlight deviating services To change the color palette, click the gear icon by the low-high color legend. This allows you to change the colors used to highlight deviating services. To get a table view of the same data, click the toggle on the right. You can also hover over each color to filter the view by degree lower or higher deviance. Abnormal golden signals On the right, New Relic Lookout displays the most significantly deviating applications (or other facet) in a side panel, weighted by both the magnitude of the performance indicators and the scale of their deviations. Details include the name of the key performance indicator, their magnitude during the recent time window, and the difference between the averages from one time compared to the other. Instant search Click the magnifying glass icon in the side panel to open a search box. Typing into the search box filters the circles, table, and abnormal signals to applications (or other facets) that contain the text. This is a good way to quickly zoom to various subsystems. New Relic Lookout doesn't rerun the analysis when using the instant search. Change view Click the Change View button on the right side panel. The panel that appears shows you all the entity-specific golden signals you can toggle between out of the box. By choosing the Browser Golden Signal or other views, you can change from the default view. Each new view will have the golden signals appropriate for that entity type. Drill down into the details To analyze an application or facet, click a circle, table row, or abnormal golden signal. The details panel shows the degree of deviation of the performance indicator, a link to the affected entity, and recent alert and deployment activity for that entity, when available. There’s also an indication of whether the selected evaluation time period would be abnormal or not in reference to other comparison time windows, such as the same time yesterday or the same time last week. This allows you to quickly see if the abnormal behavior is odd in general, or just based on the comparison time window. Performance tab The default tab shows charts for other key performance indicators for the selected application or facet. The charts compare the two time windows being analyzed. You can click their titles to rerun the analysis, focusing on the selected key performance indicator. When the target is a New Relic One application, we show the top transactions, error classes, external services, and database operations, alongside links to the relevant New Relic One features. Abnormal History tab This section analyzes past performance of the selected signal and calls out any time periods with notable abnormalities. Each card represents an abnormal time window and can be clicked for more details. The charts will display any relevant violations and deployments in New Relic. Correlations tab New Relic Lookout can find other signals that began behaving differently around the same time as the selected signal for that entity type. Clicking the name of the signal reruns the analysis, focusing on that key performance indicator. The chart titles link to New Relic One when there’s an associated entity in your account. Note that correlations currently do not analyze across accounts. The correlated signals displayed are for others in the account of the original application you are viewing. This helps focus the data on correlations that are more likely related to your issue. Profile tab Based on the same technology as New Relic’s error profiles, this tab compares the last five minutes to the prior hour by default (or whatever time windows you’ve selected with query editing) and surfaces any attributes that have significantly different distributions in the events being targeted by the selected signal. For example, if a custom attribute indicated that a recent throughput spike came from one user, that would surface highly in Profiles if most of the traffic usually comes from many users. Traces tab If the entity has distributed traces configured and available in the selected evaluated time window, the Traces section is enabled. Each card shows a summary of a trace and can be clicked for details. The Explore all traces links to the distributed traces application, filtered to the selected entity. Create a custom view To target signals and time windows beyond the default values, click the Change view button and select Custom view. To create your own view: Select the account or subaccount. Select the data type (metrics or events). Different functionality is available depending on the type. In View a chart with, select the metric or event you are interested in. Default is golden signals (throughput, response time, and errors). You can also build custom queries (filters) to target a signal that isn't on the list. In Facet by, select what the circles represent. Default is appName, but you can also choose host or any other facetable attribute available for the signal you’ve selected. If you plan to save/favorite this new view, provide a name in the Name your view box. Keep in mind that you can edit this view at any time using the pencil icon. The default time windows analyzed by New Relic Lookout are the last five minutes compared to the hour before. Use the time controls (View data from and Compare data to) to target other time windows. one.newrelic.com > Apps > New Relic Lookout: All event and metric data in the New Relic database can be queried using the Edit query feature. Click Analyze to begin analyzing the signal you’ve selected. You can also create your own query: Create your query. This query is comparing data from the past thirty minutes to data from the same range a day ago. Change from Basic to Advanced after clicking the Custom view button. Select the data type (metrics or events). Different functionality is available depending on the type. Enter your query using NRQL. Please note that not all NRQL features are available in the Lookout Advanced query feature. By default, the system will run this query using the last five minutes of data compared to the previous hour. Some examples of the syntax for changing the comparison and evaluation time windows are below. Click Analyze to begin analyzing the signal you’ve selected. Query: Compare the last 15 minutes to the same time 1 day ago Please note that the UNTIL NOW portion is required here unlike in standard NRQL. Without the UNTIL NOW added, the system will query a 5 minute slice of data starting 15 minutes ago SINCE 15 minutes AGO UNTIL NOW COMPARE WITH 1 day ago Copy Query: Compare a specific time range to the same range a month ago SINCE '2021-03-07 07:00:00-0500' UNTIL '2021-03-08 07:00:00-0500' COMPARE WITH 1 month ago Copy Or: SINCE 'today at midnight' UNTIL 'now' COMPARE WITH 1 MONTH AGO Copy Example: Unusual increases in error count The default view of New Relic Lookout shows application status across your estate, comparing the last five minutes to the hour before. Under regular operation, most large systems may have a handful of abnormalities, but usually most things will indicate normal behavior. Suddenly, several circles begin to change to red under the Errors section. This indicates that several applications are experiencing unusual increases in error count. It may be that one or two circles for important systems are red, and perhaps much larger than they usually appear. Clicking one of these can provide more information on what is happening. You might see that the error rate is substantially elevated, even thousands of percent higher than normal. To troubleshoot this issue, here's what you might discover in the New Relic Lookout tabs: Performance would show you data about other signals, illuminating the characteristics of the change in system dynamics. Correlations would surface other applications that are affected and how, as well as opportunities to pivot to other applications that may be closer to the underlying causes. Traces, in turn, would show distributed traces, which can provide specific examples of traffic running through those systems. Abnormal history would show other times in the past week with elevated errors, showing whether or not this problem happens regularly, such as every day at the same time or whenever there is a deployment. Profiles might show that all or most of the new errors share common properties, such as all being isolated to just one region/account/user. Combining the information from these sections, not only can you get a sense of what is going on, but also where to focus actions to resolve the problem.",

      "body": "New Relic monitoring is built around the concept of entities. In this doc, you'll learn how we define entities, what you can do with them, and how you can create your own entities or groupings of entities. What's an entity? From a New Relic perspective, entity is purposefully a broad concept. An entity is anything that a) reports data to New Relic or that contains data that we have access to, and b) is something we've identified with a unique entity ID. For most entities, the ID is indicated by the attribute entityGuid. An entity can be any fundamental data-reporting component, like an application, a host, or a database service, but it can also refer to larger groupings of those components. For example, to monitor a data center, you could aggregate those hosts in New Relic to be a workload (a custom grouping of entities). That workload is, itself, also an entity. Also very important is the relationships between entities. Our behind-the-scenes relationship-mapping helps us understand how entities are connected, how they affect each other. And this allows us to give you the power to configure how any data you're bringing in is related to existing entities, or how it's related to other entities. Our focus on entities and their relationships is important because our goal is to give you practical information about your business-important entities, and not give you an unhelpfully huge stream of data from a huge list of monitored things. With more insight at the entity level, you can better monitor and troubleshoot complex, modern systems. Find and explore entities and entity data Tip You can create new entity types for monitoring any data source. Learn more about entity synthesis. Some tips for finding and understanding entity data: To find an entity's entityGuid and entityName and other metadata: from any list of monitored entities in the New Relic Explorer, click an entity's icon, and click See metadata and tags. For most entities, its GUID is reported as the attribute entityGuid. For workloads, it's workloadGuid. You can run NRQL queries to find entities by their GUID. To see connections between entities, you have several options: When viewing an entity in the UI, use the Related entities UI. Service maps. Distributed tracing. Our NerdGraph API. To group entities together, see Group entities. Customize entity definitions and relationships. To learn technical details about entity types, see our GitHub repo. In an entity type's definition file, you'll see information like: The domain: for example, APM, or Infra. Its type: for example, Application or AWSECSCONTAINERINSTANCE. Default tags. The entityExpirationTime: how long data from that entity lasts in the UI, which is different from database data retention. Group and organize entities You can place entities into groups that reflect business-important relationships in your organization. For example, you might group all entities related to a specific team or department, or related to a specific service. Or you might group multiple hosts together to reflect their grouping in a data center. To group your entities, see: Tag entities. Create workloads, which allow you to group business-important sets of entities. Create entities and customize entity data Customize entity data with entity synthesis If you have telemetry from any source that's not supported by New Relic out of the box, you can propose a mapping for it. Once approved, any telemetry received by New Relic that matches your definition file will be synthesized into an entity. To learn more: For reserved attributes and how entity relationships are defined, keep reading this doc. For how to do the work of modifying existing entity types or creating new ones, see our GitHub repo on entity synthesis. Reserved attributes for synthesized entities These attributes are meant to be synthesized from the telemetry we receive. Do not set them unless you're aware of the implications and consequences. Attribute Description entity.guid Generally, you should not set this attribute field on your telemetry data. New Relic may add this field to ingested data to store a unique identifier for the entity associated with the data point. If telemetry arrives with the entity.guid attribute already present, then New Relic will not change the value. However, it may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI, or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. One use case for passing this attribute is to associate ingested telemetry with an entity already created by New Relic. When the entity.guid attribute is sent, the value will override New Relic’s entity identification system (such as entity synthesis definitions) and instead will use the attribute as the data. entity.name This attribute shouldn't be put on ingested telemetry data unless you're trying to override the entity name that would have been selected by New Relic’s entity identification system. While New Relic won't change the value if it's already present on the data, New Relic may add the attribute to your data. Therefore invalid or unexpected values may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI, or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. If this field is present on ingested telemetry, its value will be used to name the entity associated with the data point. This name will be used instead of the name selected by New Relic’s entity identification system (for example, entity synthesis definitions). Note that many entities use the name as part of their identification, so changing this field may result in the generation of a new entity. entity.type This attribute shouldn't be put on ingested telemetry data except for certain legacy cases where it's required to distinguish entity types. Passing this field may interfere with entity detection, particularly if unrecognized values are sent in this field. While New Relic won't change the value if already present on the data, the field is not guaranteed to provide unambiguous filtering of telemetry at query-time. Existing entity definitions already have overlapping values, and we recommend avoiding entity.type in favor of other fields for filtering telemetry queries. This field is used by New Relic, meaning that invalid or unexpected values may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI, or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. To learn how to do the work of modifying existing entity types or creating new ones, see our GitHub repo on entity synthesis. Entity relationships Connections between entities are automatically created by New Relic based on what we can infer from your telemetry. For example, when two services that communicate using HTTP are instrumented with New Relic, we infer a \"calls/called-by\" relationship between them. When viewing a specific entity in either the New Relic Explorer, Navigator, or Lookout, you can see its Related entities in the entity's mini overview. This gives a visualization of the various entities connected directly to the current entity. You can quickly view important metrics for these related entities and navigate from one entity to another, through all the connected parts of your stack. Tip Learn more about how entities are related with our NerdGraph API. When relationships are not automatically detected, you can manually create them using the \"Add/edit related entities\" link in Related entities. Important Currently, you can only manually create calls/called-by relationships between service entities. Tip To manage manual relationships, you need to have modify and delete capabilities on entity relationships. If you don’t see the edit relationships button, contact your account admin. Which relationships are created? These are the relationships created between entities: Source: New Relic agent Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? Application instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS Application instrumented with a New Relic agent Relationships between applications monitored by New Relic agents are reported using the DurationByCaller metric. The callee reports the metric. For example, the metric DurationByCaller/Mobile/100/1234/HTTP/all indicates that the caller is APPLICATION 1234 for account 100. Application instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS Service instrumented with a New Relic agent An application (caller) that calls a service (callee) monitored by New Relic creates a relationship that's reported by the caller using the ExternalApp metric. For example, the metric ExternalApp/dirac.vips.net/100#1234/all indicates that the callee is APPLICATION 1234 for account 100. The metric is reported if the callee successfully responds to the caller. Service instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS Service instrumented with a New Relic agent When a New Relic agent detects that a service (caller) calls another service (callee) instrumented by New Relic, the callee reports the metric ClientApplication. For example, the metric ClientApplication/100#1234/all indicates that the caller is APPLICATION 1234 for account 100. Service instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS A datastore instance When an application calls a datastore instance it creates a relationship reported with the DatastoreInstance metric. For example, the metric Datastore/instance/MySQL/172.16.16.3/3306 indicates the datastore instance is vendor: MySQL, host: 172.16.16.3, port: 3306. This metric also supports the legacy datastore instance format Datastore/instance/MySQL/172.16.16.3:3306. Currently we cannot determine whether the datastore instance is instrumented by New Relic and has an entity associated to it. APM agent SERVES Browser agent This relationship is created when an APM agent injects the browser agent into a page. Workload entity CONTAINS Any entity When a workload is created or updated, relationships for each of the entities that belong to the workload are created. Because some workloads are “dynamic” (defined by tags), relationships are re-created every 5 minutes. This way entities can join or leave the workload. Source: Infrastructure Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? Infrastructure host HOSTS Application This relationship is created when an application is running in one or more hosts, and the infra agent is running in those hosts. Infrastructure host HOSTS Container This relationship is created when containers are running in one or more hosts, and the host is instrumented with the infra agent. Source: Synthetics monitor Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? Synthetics Monitor CALLS Browser agent This relationship is created when a synthetics monitor checks a page instrumented with the browser agent. Synthetics Monitor CALLS APM application Agent events that contain the attribute nr.syntheticsMonitorId have been described as synthetics monitors (the source) interacting with an APM application (the target). If the header exists and the APM application Id exists, a relationship is created between the monitor and the app. Source: Kubernetes Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? Cluster CONTAINS Pod This relationship is created when a pod is created in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Cluster CONTAINS Deployment This relationship is created when a deployment is created in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Cluster CONTAINS DaemonSet This relationship is created when a DaemonSet is created in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Cluster CONTAINS StatefulSet This relationship is created when a StatefulSet is created in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Cluster CONTAINS Host This relationship is created when a host that's part of a cluster is instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Deployment CONTAINS Pod This relationship is created when a deployment creates a pod in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. DaemonSet CONTAINS Pod This relationship is created when a DaemonSet is created a pod in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. StatefulSet CONTAINS Pod This relationship is created when a StatefulSet creates a pod in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Pod CONTAINS Container This relationship is created when a pod creates a container in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Host HOSTS Pod This relationship is created when a pod is running in a host that's part of a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Container HOSTS Application This relationship is created when an application is running in docker, and the hosts where docker is running are instrumented by the the infra agent. External services Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? External service CALLS External service When the relationship is created, the external service reports a span with its name on the service.name attribute and the name of the service that initiates the call in the parent.service.name attribute. Application IS External service A relationship between an application and an external service is created so that users can navigate between them using the related entities component. Browser application instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS External service A browser application reports an Ajax/HostTransaction metric when calling an external service (URL). Example metric: Ajax/HostTransaction/api.segment.io:443/CallbackTime' Cluster CONTAINS External service When the relationship is created, the external service reports a span with the attribute k8s.cluster.name, the name of the cluster. The cluster must be instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration and the cluster name set for the integration must match the one reported in the span. Pod HOSTS External service When the relationship is created, the external service reports a span with the following attributes: service.name: The name of the service. k8s.cluster.name: The name of the cluster. k8s.pod.name: The name of the pod that’s running the service. k8s.namespace.name: The namespace where the pod was created. The cluster must be instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration and the cluster name set for the integration must match the one reported in the span.",

      "body": "The Insights Dashboard API is deprecated, but you can use NerdGraph (our GraphQL API) to create and configure dashboards. If you're not migrating from the old Insights API, you can skip this doc and go to the new Dashboards API. Why a new dashboards API? Our Insights product, which was a way to query data and create charts and dashboards, has been deprecated and its set of features moved over to be a core part of the New Relic One platform. To learn more about this transition and new features, see the Insights to New Relic One migration guide. The Insights Dashboard API will be deprecated in July of 2021. Until then, if you're using the Insights Dashboard API, you should attempt to switch over to using NerdGraph. (The Insights query API will not be deprecated but NerdGraph is preferred.) Keep reading to learn how to get started with NerdGraph and learn about equivalent operations. Get started with NerdGraph NerdGraph is the preferred API for making NRQL queries of your New Relic data. Every user who uses NerdGraph needs their own user key. When using NerdGraph, it helps to understand that our dashboards are entities that report data from other entities, such as monitored apps, hosts and services. If you're new to NerdGraph and GraphQL, you may want to first read our Introduction to NerdGraph and some of Create dashboards with NerdGraph. The NerdGraph API explorer is located at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Operations mapping table The table below maps every Insights API operation to the new dashboards API.

By using the NerdGraph API explorer, you can discover GraphQL types and fields, along with a brief explanation. We want to facilitate your migration from the Insights API to the new New Relic One dashboards API. Find below some examples that illustrate how the old REST endpoints map to the new GraphQL queries or mutations. List (GET) -> entitySearch query Dashboards in New Relic One embrace the concept of entity. They are now another entity in New Relic’s entity ecosystem. Try it out using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. List all dashboard entities you have access to { actor { entitySearch(queryBuilder: {type: DASHBOARD}) { results { entities { ... on DashboardEntityOutline { guid name accountId } } } } } } Copy List all dashboards by name { actor { entitySearch(queryBuilder: {name: \"My dashboard\"}) { results { entities { ... on DashboardEntityOutline { guid name accountId } } } } } } Copy List all dashboards by creator’s email { actor { entitySearch(queryBuilder: {type: DASHBOARD, tags: {key: \"createdBy\", value: \"email@domain.com\"}}) { results { entities { ... on DashboardEntityOutline { guid name accountId } } } } } } Copy List all dashboards by creator’s user id { actor { entitySearch(query: \"type ='DASHBOARD' and ownerId = '2357322'\") { results { entities { ... on DashboardEntityOutline { guid name accountId } } } } } } Copy Show (GET) -> entity query In order to get information on a dashboard, all you need is to provide its unique entity identifier or entity guid. Then you can access all the dashboard properties that you are interested in by adding them in the GraphQL query. Try it out using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Get dashboard info given its entity guid { actor { entity(guid: \"MY_DASHBOARD_GUID\") { ... on DashboardEntity { guid accountId name createdAt updatedAt permissions description owner { email userId } pages { guid name createdAt updatedAt description owner { email userId } widgets { id visualization { id } title layout { row column height width } rawConfiguration linkedEntities { guid } } } } } } } Copy Create (POST) -> dashboardCreate mutation Operations that mutate the state of the system are mutations in GraphQL APIs. You can create a dashboard by providing the required input for the dashboardCreate mutation. Although GraphQL APIs aim to be self-explanatory, Nerdgraph docs can help you with some information about the fields, like the doc about how to build dashboard widgets. Try it out using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Create dashboard with two pages and two widgets per page mutation { dashboardCreate(accountId: 1, dashboard: { name: \"My awesome dashboard\", permissions: PUBLIC_READ_WRITE, pages: [{ name: \"My first page\", widgets: [{ visualization: { id: \"viz.markdown\" }, title: \"My markdown widget\", layout: { row: 1, column: 1, width: 4, height: 3 }, rawConfiguration: { text: \"#My markdown\" } }, { visualization: { id: \"viz.line\" }, title: \"My line widget\", layout: { row: 1, column: 5, width: 4, height: 3 }, rawConfiguration: { nrqlQueries: [{ accountId: 1, query: \"SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET appName TIMESERIES\" }] } }] }, { name: \"My second page\", widgets: [{ visualization: { id: \"viz.billboard\" }, title: \"My billboard widget with thresholds\", layout: { row: 1, column: 1, width: 4, height: 3 }, rawConfiguration: { nrqlQueries: [{ accountId: 1, query: \"SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction\" }], thresholds: [{ alertSeverity: WARNING, value: 650 }, { alertSeverity: CRITICAL, value: 1500 }] } }, { visualization: { id: \"viz.table\" }, title: \"My table widget\", layout: { row: 1, column: 5, width: 4, height: 3 }, rawConfiguration: { nrqlQueries: [{ query: \"SELECT * FROM Transaction\", accountId: 1 }] } }] }] }) { errors { description type } entityResult { guid accountId name createdAt updatedAt permissions description owner { email userId } pages { guid name createdAt updatedAt description owner { email userId } widgets { id visualization { id } title layout { row column height width } rawConfiguration linkedEntities { guid } } } } } } Copy Update (PUT) -> dashboardUpdate mutation The dashboardUpdate mutation allows you to update an existing dashboard by providing the existing dashboard guid and the new configuration. Similarly to creating a dashboard, the mutation tries to be self-explanatory, but you can look up the doc about how to build dashboard widgets. Try it out using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Update previously created dashboard to 1 page and 1 widget per page mutation { dashboardUpdate(guid: \"MY_DASHBOARD_GUID\" dashboard: { name: \"My awesome dashboard\", permissions: PUBLIC_READ_WRITE, pages: [{ name: \"My first page\", widgets: [{ visualization: { id: \"viz.line\" }, title: \"My line widget\", layout: { row: 1, column: 1, width: 4, height: 3 }, rawConfiguration: { nrqlQueries: [{ accountId: 1, query: \"SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET appName TIMESERIES\" }] } }] }, { name: \"My second page\", widgets: [{ visualization: { id: \"viz.table\" }, title: \"My table widget\", layout: { row: 1, column: 1, width: 4, height: 3 }, rawConfiguration: { nrqlQueries: [{ query: \"SELECT * FROM Transaction\", accountId: 1 }] } }] }] }) { errors { description type } entityResult { guid accountId name createdAt updatedAt permissions description owner { email userId } pages { guid name createdAt updatedAt description owner { email userId } widgets { id visualization { id } title layout { row column height width } rawConfiguration linkedEntities { guid } } } } } } Copy Delete (DELETE) -> dashboardDelete mutation The dashboardDelete mutation allows you to delete an existing dashboard by providing its entity guid. Try it out using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Delete previously created dashboard mutation { dashboardDelete(guid:\"MY_DASHBOARD_GUID\") { status errors { type description } } } Copy",

      "body": "A condition describes a monitored data source and the behavior of that data source that will be considered a violation. This document will explain the types of conditions available, how to create a condition, and how to view existing conditions. Related documentation: Basic concepts and workflow Min/max limits (like maximum number of conditions per policy) REST API to list or edit alert settings NRQL Condition NerdGraph API to manage your NRQL conditions via NerdGraph. Create a condition To create a condition: Create a policy and you will automatically be prompted to add a condition. OR From an existing policy page, select Create/add a condition. Follow the prompts in the UI, which include: Selecting a product/data-source Selecting a condition type Defining thresholds Optional: After you finish creating a condition, copy it and add it to other policies. Important Conditions that provide fields for you to input numerical values accept decimal points up to the second decimal place (hundredths). For example, 0.01 is the smallest possible value. Types of conditions Here are descriptions of the different types of conditions: NRQL query conditions Use the UI or NerdGraph API to create NRQL conditions for basic NRQL queries that return a number. APM metric alert conditions See APM metric alert conditions for tips about creating APM conditions using NRQL. Baseline conditions Baseline alerting allows you to create conditions that dynamically adjust to changing data and trends, such as weekly or seasonal patterns. This feature is available for APM and browser monitoring apps, as well as NRQL queries. Outlier detection conditions Outlier detection attempts to find groupings in your data and then looks for values that are outliers from those groupings. Outlier detection is available only for NRQL alerts. Synthetic monitoring multi-location conditions With multi-location Synthetic monitoring conditions, you can set up a monitor to notify you when a specific number of locations are failing at the same time. Key transaction metrics conditions For APM, you can set up conditions for key transactions. Java instance conditions You can set thresholds that open a violation when they are breached by any of your Java app's instance metrics. By scoping thresholds to specific instances, you can more quickly identify where potential problems are originating. This is useful, for example, to detect anomalies that are occurring only in a subset of your app's instances. These sorts of anomalies are easy to miss for apps that aggregate metrics across a large number of instances. JVM health metric conditions (Java apps) For Java apps monitored by APM, you can set thresholds that open a violation when the heap size or number of threads for a single JVM is out of the expected operating range. We calculate alerting threshold violations individually for each of the app's selected instances. When creating your condition, select JVM health metric as the type of condition for your Java app's alert policy, then select any of the available thresholds: Deadlocked threads Heap memory usage CPU utilization time Garbage collection CPU time Violations will automatically close when the inverse of the threshold is met, but by using the UI you can also change the time when a violation force-closes for a JVM health metric. Default is 24 hours. Web transaction percentile conditions We include the option to define a percentile as the threshold for your condition when your web app's response time is above, below, or equal to this value. This is useful, for example, when Operations personnel want to alert on a percentile for an app server's overall web transaction response time rather than the average web response time. Tip If you want to set an arbitrary threshold in a condition for a non-web app transaction, use the NRQL queries feature. To define the percentile threshold: Select Web transactions percentiles as the type of condition for your APM app's condition, then select a single app. (To alert on more than one app, create an individual Web transactions percentiles condition for each.) To define the thresholds that open the violation, type the Percentile nth response time value, then select its frequency (above, below, or equal to this value). We store the transaction time in milliseconds, although the user interface shows the Critical and Warning values as seconds. If you want to define milliseconds, be sure to include the decimal point in your value. Dynamic targeting with labels for apps By applying labels to applications, you can automatically link these entities to your condition. This makes it easy to manage all the applications within a dynamic environment. We recommend using the agent configuration file to best maintain entity labels. A single label identifies all entities associated with that label (maximum 10,000 entities). Multiple labels only identify entities which share all the selected labels. Using dynamic targeting with your condition also requires that you set a violation close timer. To add, edit, or remove up to ten labels for a condition: Select APM > Application metric as the product type. When identifying entities, select the Labels tab. Search for a label by name, or select a label from the list of categories. You can also create conditions directly within the context of what you are monitoring with Infrastructure. Infrastructure conditions You can create conditions for your resources directly in Infrastructure. For example, if you want to be notified when we have stopped receiving data from an Infrastructure agent, use the host not reporting condition type. This allows you to dynamically alert on filtered groups of hosts and configure the time window from 5 to 60 minutes. Apdex and response time conditions You can open violations and send notifications for response times. However, Apdex scores are almost always more meaningful and provide a better reflection of application performance. For example, average response times can be skewed by outliers, while the Apdex score gives a more accurate assessment of acceptable response time rates that your users experience. Change a condition name If you want to change the default condition name, make it short and descriptive. Provide useful information for notification messages that have limited characters, such as email subject lines, online chat, etc. Use camel case or dotted decimal notation. Describe the essence of what is being violated. To change an existing condition's name: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, then (select a policy). Click a condition name to edit it, and then type a meaningful name for the condition. You can't edit the product and condition type associated with a condition. Instead, you must delete the condition and create a new one with a different product and condition type. Maintain policies and conditions After you save the condition, the currently selected policy lists all alert conditions that apply to it. From here you can: Repeat the steps to add more conditions to the policy. Continue the policy setup process by adding one or more notification channels to it. Change the condition's name, the entities it's scoped to, or the critical (red) and warning (yellow) thresholds. Copy the condition and add it other policies in the selected account. Rename the policy. Disable any conditions in the policy, or delete the policy or any of its conditions. You may also manage your policies via the policies NerdGraph API.

      "body": "With alerts you can easily tell whether an entity (the target for the notification) has one or more conditions associated with it: If yes, its health status indicator on the selected index (APM, browser, etc.) will be color-coded to the current state. To view a summary of current alert violations, mouse over its health status indicator. If no, its health status indicator on the selected index will appear grey. Important To learn more about how conditions and policies work together, see Introduction to important concepts. Exceptions The health status indicator doesn't apply for: Infrastructure entities Dashboards Entities targeted by labels Color-coded health status The index automatically appears when you select the product from the New Relic menu bar. For example, to view the index of APM apps, go to one.newrelic.com, then click APM. The Applications index lists all APM product entities and their current health status. Color Health status Green The entity is operational. We are collecting data that you can view in the appropriate UI. No alert violations are currently reported for it. Yellow The entity is degraded. A warning threshold has been violated. Red A critical threshold has been violated: Notifications have been sent based on the selected incident rollup preference. The incident appears in the Incidents index. Gray The entity's status is unknown. We're not receiving alerts data for the entity. This could mean alerts are muted, not set up, or the reporting system is down. Health status transitions The following table describes the different health status transitions an entity can endure: From... To... Transition explanation Gray Green The entity is evaluated for at least one condition, and the results show there are no violations present. Green / Red Gray Possible explanations: The last condition associated to the entity has been deleted and therefore there's no status to report. The last condition associated to the entity has been disabled and therefore there's no status to report. The entity has stopped reporting data. There's a New Relic platform issue. Check the New Relic status page for updates. Green Yellow / Red There's at least one open violation at the time the entity is undergoing the evaluation. Yellow / Red Green The last open violation associated to the entity has been closed. Example: App without conditions Here's an example of an app listed on the APM index that is not associated with any conditions. Its color-coded health status is light grey, which indicates no alert conditions are set up for that entity. Go to one.newrelic.com, then click Explorer: This example shows an app that currently isn't associated with any alerts conditions. Its grey status icon means it doesn't have any conditions. Follow standard procedures to add it to an existing condition or to create a new condition for it. Example: App with conditions Here's an example of an app listed on the APM index that is associated with one or more conditions. Its color-coded health status is green, because we are collecting data for it, and currently there are no Warning (yellow) or Critical (red) violations. Go to one.newrelic.com, then click Explorer: This example shows an app that has one or more conditions. Its color-coded health status (green) shows the app hasn't reached any threshold violations. Tip To view the index listing currently open incidents across all products, not just this entity, select View all violations.",
